Topic: You are invited in to a small circle of creative contributors channel, but we are thinking to make up a category that can be represented by community as: creative, marketing, user testers etc. Yet my choice is for everybody to get acquainted and when proposals will come to us we can confirm the groups with the team. At this point we have writers-room for creatives, project-trade-competition for traders, we will make #marketing-project and user-tester-project, if we see a clear action/idea proposed, till which point will are all supportive to it!

```
The days of centralization are coming to an end. A new age of peer to peer trading is coming.

Bitcoin inspired thousands of people by showing how a worldwide monetary system could operate without a central entity. Its discovery launched a renaissance and a return back to the original vision of Internet and to the values of chyberpunks.

Where are we heading? The metaverse.

A metaverse is coming and it ought to be open, trustless, and sovereign from the whims of politics and from those who seek to surprises others from their benefit.

Join Komodo on our journey towards the empowerment of all.

"The days of centralization are coming to an end. A new age of peer to peer trading is coming." Personally I don't think so. To myself it is more like, the days of centralization are coming to a greater convergence and your freedom is not a part of it. A new age peer technology could level the playing field if the communis got involved, communis is the root concept of community, according to David Graeber, in: Debt, the first 5000 years.

This is nice, but it says what Bitcoin inspired.  What specifically is Komodo going to do different and/or on top of Bitcoin?


[24-Jun-21 08:34 AM] Nev#5914
Bill Binney used to be a Director of the National Security Agency and he said, "I just don't think anything on the web is secure" so we made Komodo.

woah, so much chat! Hard to keep up üòÑ

I'll just drop the script here that Artakush read on the hangout today:

```
For an industry that strives for decentralization, we are relying too much on centralized systems. It has been acknowledged that blockchain technology is extremely secure. Yet, we have to read about massive hacks and thefts daily. We must do better.

Let us put more emphasis on the low-level protocols that unite the ecosystems and their communities and that provide the foundational building blocks for higher-level applications.

We need a DEX network that is not limited to a single ecosystem.  We need to bridge everything all the way from diverse blockchain protocols - to their passionate crypto communities - to the individual level of traders and hodlers.

We are here to establish a rock-solid ground to build on - that lets the bright minds of our industry build the future we always imagined - an open and trustless system secured from the whims of politics or from the disruption of exchange hacks and delistings.

Join Komodo on our journey towards the empowerment of everyone. From hodlers to traders and from developers to entrepreneurs.

[24-Jun-21 01:46 PM] Nev#5914
All parts could be moving, the stuff on the wires could be moving like slightly in the breeze, the logo and lights on the center piece could also be glowing and pulsating slightly and the clouds in the sky could be moving also as well as the reflections on the horizontal ground plane, but... This image is not good enough quality meaning it is not big enough and would pixelate blown up to 1920 x1080, so if you wanted me to try and do this I need a bigger image, thanks.


[24-Jun-21 02:02 PM] Nev#5914
Yip I just looked at it on my PC and it would really need to be bigger the detail becomes fuzzy quite quickly when magnified, it could be done but it would end up untidy. You could even ghost image it over the top and make it seem like your eyes are going funny, are my eyes doing tricks or is it the picture effect.


[24-Jun-21 02:27 PM] Nev#5914
The big too big to fail are failing again and who you gonna call, nobody because there is nobody they own it all but there are much better solutions. 

Yip, that Bitcoin stuff, crypto currencies, they are not just currencies. 

"I just don't think anything on the web is secure" said ex NSA director, analyst and whistleblower, Bill Binney. 

so we built Komodo Platform.

We double up security by using other block chains to doubly record entries, making it so hackers or NSA would need to screw two block chains at the right time.

The big too big to fail are failing again and who you gonna call, nobody because there is nobody they own it all but there are much better solutions.  (So we start off with the first image moving and crackling sound like the monitor/TV is dying ( words the big etc.) (much better solutions) and everything in the image corrects.) 

Yip, that Bitcoin stuff, crypto currencies, they are not just currencies. 
Bitcoin standing outside the theater proud as punch with his chest out and then all the crypto currencies in the world fall out of the sky and smother him. Then the Komodo logo tip toes out of the picture and we get to Bill, I think I got a video of Bill saying that.
"I just don't think anything on the web is secure" said ex NSA director, analyst and whistleblower, Bill Binney. 
And then the video I made success is a journey not a destination begin your block chain journey.
so we built Komodo Platform.

That sounds great,  basic 0.1 great and final address 0.1 was greater,  on basic mp3 I was hit first with what seemed like a pop from the start but was basic that's why.  On re-listen to final address 0.1 pops are on there as well but must be less noticeable first time? I have no idea if you know but the letter P causes what they call pops you can eliminate them with a pop screen. Basically it is a piece of light weight fabric stretched taught about 8 to 12 inches away from the mic. They are not very expensive and really do kill the pops. Besides those pops that sounds really good, professional. Thanks I really enjoyed listening to that, it works, I took notice.

@EurekaJohn I played around with you voice-over and took most of the artifacts out, I simply cut them out but sorry you will need to wait a little till I come up with a complete video to use it as I have no way of sharing unless I send it directly and I don't want to do that. Thanks


[28-Jun-21 06:39 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
Thanks Nev!  I am part of the Bankless DAO in their AV Guild and we are experimenting with various digital asset management (DAM) programs.  One that I find is very useful is resourcespace.com


[28-Jun-21 06:41 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
I uploaded some Komodo stuff to it and made you a user.  https://eurekajohn.free.resourcespace.com I will DM you your username and password.  You can go in and poke around and let me know what you think.  Maybe if you like it, we can possibly suggest it to the Komodo team...

@daybreak and @butterygold would you like to go check out the resourcespace.com and see if that looks like a suitable DAM platform?  If so, I can add you as users and we can upload stuff there to collaborate.

Hi, I have posted 3, might be 4 videos to Pootube as well as other sites, each one has a link to Komodo Platform main page, it is my understanding that search engines use links to rank websites and they are counted. It was believed that video links carried more weight, I don't know now because I haven't bothered with that type of stuff for about 5 years.  So if Komodo team like stuff they will use it, if not they won't and everybody else will like what they do or don't like but all links into other content will benefit it as far as I know. So I don't just make videos I build links as well.

[30-Jun-21 08:49 AM] Nev#5914
Yip, I had a more in depth look at this tool and, you need an RTX card as well as Win 10 to be using it, I have neither so there goes my week playing around with it. It looks like I will be making videos as usual. From videos I looked at it seems to be really good at creating realistic looking landscape quickly. Would be good for gaming and animation art works but it looks like I will have to be happy with Gimp clone tool, ha, ha.

Well the head seems to sync with the voice, it seems to be Bob on to me, ha, ha. Audo said he wanted to bring a human element into the marketing. I was thinking more of a character, it was why I played with daybreak's little dog, I have no tools for doing voice. I can do it manually but it's much messing around. I expect that tool your using will say whatever you record into it now because it is set up to do that. I expect that is the purpose.


[01-Jul-21 12:56 AM] Nev#5914
Atomic Bob could be anything though I think and I know you have your drawing of an older Bob type character and that seems to do the job but I was wondering about something else maybe or is that a lot of work to change the character? Atomic Bob's a good idea because he already exists as Bob and Alice so the question is do you want or need Alice as well?

It could be a bit like the Jack and Jill type story's, the Adventures of Bob and Alice.  Alice and Bob went to the market today they met with BTC and Eth both a bit too big headed for Bob so he sauntered off while Alice tried to find out anything about those new NFT's, she was wondering if there was any point in her adopting the idea but they didn't know anything. Eth said go and talk Arty he might know something he;s always messing around with NFT's.

I just drew Atomic Bob yesterday.  It could be anyone. Bob and Alice is a great idea.  I can redraw Bob, or anyone else.  If a good character graphic artist wants to draw the empty face and make various versions of eyes and mouth, I can rig it up any way possible.


[01-Jul-21 03:19 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
I can also do the whole body.  With various arms/leg movements, but that‚Äôs more time consuming.


[01-Jul-21 03:20 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
I manually keyframe the audio, so that is the most time consuming part


[01-Jul-21 03:21 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
The purpose of making Atomic Bob was to inspire ideas and show what I am able to rig up pretty easily, not to be any sort of final version.

As you can see also, there are all sorts of things I can do with the AE scripting language to create abstract background animations.

I like Bob.  It‚Äôs a great idea @EurekaJohn


[01-Jul-21 07:06 AM] Nev#5914
Is your way any simpler than mine I wonder? It probably is because I do it by recording myself saying stuff on video, then extract as frames, then copy the frames I want to what ever I am trying to make talk then recompile and keep messing around until I get it to work. I have had some success. I expect if you know of an easier or simpler way of doing it you would be but just in case do you know of anything that could make it more simple?


[01-Jul-21 07:12 AM] Nev#5914
I can create anything as a character but simple is always best me thinks, like Family Guy or South Park, just like cardboard cut outs except on PC screen, when voice is being done then it could go to the face of the character for that then back to an action or scene. I think that's how it is done.


[01-Jul-21 07:13 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
I record a separate audio track.  I create an empty face and make several versions of mouths and eyes.  I compile those layers into separate eyes and mouth compositions and number them.  I assign each layer in the composition a keyframe number and I scrub the audio and assign the specific time on the audio with the keyframed layer I want to show.


[01-Jul-21 07:13 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
Yes!  I do it exactly how southpark did it.


[01-Jul-21 07:17 AM] Nev#5914
So your working with a Key frame type tool, like Macromedia Flash used to be until Adobe got their hand on it?


[01-Jul-21 07:18 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
Yes.  After Effects is very similar to Flash.  But with may more effects and functionality


[01-Jul-21 07:19 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
After Effects expressions language is also very similar to actionscript.


[01-Jul-21 07:22 AM] Nev#5914
Yeah south Park was fun but total crap really loved it. Justice League was mad as well usual characters but the mouths looked like they where stuck onto the character like a plastic sticker.


[01-Jul-21 07:25 AM] Nev#5914
I might consider After Effects but don't you have to rent it now or something $20 a month? I don't know but will look into it, I have used it a long time ago so it would probably like a completely different program now.


[01-Jul-21 07:34 AM] Nev#5914
A quick look tells me it's like more than $20 a month, robbery as far as I am concerned, just another corporate scam, I will look into finding something, see where it leads me. $20 a month will be an extreme for me unless I am making like 50 times more out of it, might be worth it then, ha, ha.

[01-Jul-21 07:39 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
Yeah.  I understand.  I have CS5 from a work account I used to use back in the day.  So that's why I can use it


[01-Jul-21 07:40 AM] Nev#5914
Ho I can get a copy anytime if I wanted one but they are no good as far as I know, everything I would do would be owned by Adobe if I didn't buy it.


[01-Jul-21 10:28 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
How easy is it to use Davinci in comparison to After Effects? Is there a steep learning curve or can a user of AE transfer a lot of the skillz?


[01-Jul-21 11:02 AM] Nev#5914
Yeah it stated on its own page that it is a steep learning curve but daybreak I think has used both if I remember correctly so would know better than me as I have only played around with  Hitfilm Express and Davinci claims to be better but I think they also stated again that it is a steeper learning curve in comparison. My instinct tells me that the basic idea will be like most editors as they all seem to be. The one I liked the best was Lumiere or something like that I can't spell very well. The same goes for sound editing, it was Cool Edit Pro, all grabbed by Adobe I think and then poof gone.

Hi, sorry, having a morning out, at last.  It‚Äôs just so nice to see people again after the lock down.  My experience with Davinci so far has been that once I got over it being called something new, once I got into it it‚Äôs very, very much like Final Cut Pro, just with better organized modules. Audio, video, color etc..  So when I went for something automatically, I found the effect in the same place.  Nice!!

OK.  I created additional layers in Photoshop as I prepare to import them into After Effects for stop motion keyframing.  I also separated the pupils from the resy of the eyeballs so I can shift them from left to right and back when talking.  Here is a screenshot.... https://gifyu.com/image/AabN

Great, yeah Photoshop work files can be imported or exported out of gimp, some stuff might get lost going from more recent editions of Photoshop. What your familiar with is always a good way to go. The biggest difference in use between them both is names of tools. Probably a lot less effects in gimp but I don't use the latest gimp I'm about 6 years(edit, actually when I looked it's 3 years old) and haven't used Photoshop for perhaps ten years so everything would probably be very different.

Keyframing stop-motion in After Effects

For faces:
1) Create each version of movement (eg: mouths, eyes) on separate layers in illustrator/Photoshop.

2) Import into After Effects

3) Create new composition and Import > Files to (shift + left click to select all layers) drop layers onto timeline

4) Highlight layers and press Alt + ] to make all layers one frame long

5) With layers still highlighted go to top menu and click animation > keyframe assistant > sequence layers > OK (do not check overlap)

6) Go to Composition at top.  Composition > Trim Comp to Work Area.  Or hold shift and drag comp sizing bar to end of last layer

7) Save composition and create new comp and plce sequenced comp where you want it in the new comp. 
If the new comp is the face and the sequenced comp is the eyes, 
place the eyes comp where you want it on the face comp.

8)Highlight eyes comp inside new comp and right-click > Time > Enable Time Remapping (Ctrl + alt + T)

9) Right-click on keyframe and click toggle hold keyframe

10) In time code 0:00:00:00, adjust the last to digits to correspond with the frame mapped in your sequenced layer.  

11) add audio in layer below

12) to Scrub audio, hold Ctrl + dragging the cursor.  
Adjust the last two digits on time code to program the desired keyframe.

Yip, I could play all day long animating new character in a software package but I haven't got a software package yet as I don't want the corporate stuff.

Sorry, thanks for the effort but as soon as I see corporate name, (After Effects), my brain shuts down I lose all enthusiasm, it's quite bad really because it could be stunting. I also know it's time to build that computer for using Blender. Great effort because I can tell your a busy guy with time constraints. All the best.

[06-Jul-21 11:24 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
Yeah.  It can be done stop motion style with the ticking back and forth, or I can make use the vector settings to stretch the pieces out and in like an accordion.  If done right, they can both look good.

Will that be using vector images? If so I will be interested to see how you use it, I really liked flash for vector drawing I made some cool stuff at the time. Please keep me up dated if you can, thanks.

No probs.  We all busy.  I just bring the kids in the office with me and we all "work" (color) together.  2 birds, one stone.  When I have to go into the actual office at work, I have my laptop open on the side multitasking, so I am pretty much always online.  Lol.  Here is the Laser Cowboy I drew.  Not sure what script or concept he should talk about. Maybe about ZkSnarks or something like that...  https://drive.google.com/file/d/15Ej27vvCPMw4gEwF2zZ2eDwjJ4N80Ow2/view?usp=sharing

Hi, are your there? I was hoping to ask you about the marks in that piece of work you created with bearded guy. When I look closely the marks are like shards do you know what creates that, is it a brush or an effect or not important enough to care about? It caught may attention and I am curious.


[08-Jul-21 06:48 AM] Nev#5914
I was also wondering, did you use yourself as the model? Just thought it looked like you but didn't see a great deal of your face to be sure, I could go back and look harder but the best idea is to ask I think.


[08-Jul-21 05:12 PM] Nev#5914
Thanks for sharing the Laser Cowboy, was wondering if you would use blending effects, Vector Art is great for line drawings and that was what I thought you would produce because that's, what it's used for I did some cartoon stuff, tried to sculpt the lines to make them look like a pen a lot of work doing that but it is quite effective. I also like the get it down regardless, just do it attitude, busy guy kids climbing all over him, enjoy. Thanks again.


[08-Jul-21 05:45 PM] EurekaJohn#2094
Thanks Nev.  I‚Äôm a super novice with vector cartoon art.  I don‚Äôt know what you mean by blending effects. Can you help a brother out and explain that?

[09-Jul-21 04:41 AM] Slyris#2880
Regarding the reason of swap fails you can always send me a screenshot of those swaps details and i will check with @cipi for the reason and my guess is probably a fees problem, we are aware that many users try to swap ETH and get some fails, we are still investigating the reason and i will go back to you as soon we have correctly caught and solve the problem, meanwhile i suggest you to use the BEP-20 alternative, you will also save lot of money on fees.

It seems most all life congregates around water, all civilizations going back at least ten thousands years have been established around water, it is essential, if you buy into the Darwinian idea then everything actually comes from water, the miasmic soup as they call it.


[09-Jul-21 06:24 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
Yeah.  True.  In terms of blockchain you may even be able to add that water is the the oracle that steers and allows the flow of decentralized information from chaos (bits and pieces of data) to be channeled to the blockchain/order (our version of truth or reality) via smart contracts (our brains).  Without water as the oracle/portal, in the womb, then life is not possible.  Animate that!  :labs1: Lol

Hi Nev, For the image I created a 3D base in Blender. Next, on top of the render, I digitally paint the character to completion in PS. The glitches are a result of; custom brushes in PS, a program called Polygonize, and digitization effects in Davince in resolve (by means of nodes and dynamic masks). All images I create I finish with post processing in Davinci Resolve because Photoshop is regrettably still in the stoneage when it comes to; very careful color manipulation, grading and (especially) gradient work..

Hope that helps.

Hi, thank you for the detailed answer and time put into explaining, "The glitches are a result of; custom brushes in PS, a program called Polygonize" You consider them glitches which is what I thought they where and I also thought they where the result of brushes but I have no clue about the other phrases as I don't use these tools but soon will thank you again for your time. 

"Adding images to thread" I used to be able to just add images to postings but I think Discord changed that at some point. Now I have to load them up to other sites like (postimages.org) then link them to the post.

Hi, I tried to explain blending in vector art but I don't use that stuff anymore so can't remember the phrases used for tools and descriptions of their effects but i did try. So the alternative was to share a video that is more appropriate because it is using Illustrator and Photoshop both tools you use but i don't ha, ha.

I downloaded the simple view version from.  The inteface looks easy enouh.  But when I go to swap ETH or BTC in the "from" field when I hit the menu arrow where it says KMD to change it to ETH or BTC, it does not give me any other options.  It is blank.

Only funded balance can swaps


[11-Jul-21 01:27 PM] EurekaJohn#2094
Ok.   SO I need to transfer into the wallet for the option to show up into the swap options.  I suppose I am used to Uniswap where it shows me all of the swap options regardless of whether I have any of the token in my browser wallet or not.


[11-Jul-21 01:57 PM] Slyris#2880
I can add that but you will not be able to swap empty balance


[11-Jul-21 01:57 PM] Slyris#2880
The thing is that you can see possible swap only based on your current balance


[11-Jul-21 01:58 PM] Slyris#2880
The second selector show you what is possible for your available amount (this is how it works behind)


[11-Jul-21 02:34 PM] EurekaJohn#2094
That is understood.  But one thing I think people are used to from other swapping platforms is seeing what is available and making a mental note of what they can do.  I know I do that on simpleswap.io.  I have been there to swap Theta for example, and I saw Zilliqa on there as an option.  The next time I wanted to swap for Zilliqa, I remembered it was available on Simpleswap.io.  I know simpleswap is centralized and not the same, I was just using it as an example for the menu options.

Hey anyone, I am wondering about link juice from any images I link into Discord. I am not an expert but I am sure images I post elsewhere will pass some juice to Komodo Discord. I don't think search engines can scrape discord easily like they can a website but I still think linking in and out of channel goes to forming a good natural linking structure. Images, videos and articles all from authoritative social media sites will help to tell search engines that there is a rich source of content going into the channel so it must have some value. It is useful to post images directly to discord but I will continue to use both on a regular bases unless somebody tells me it is a waste of time, ha, ha, thanks to anyone in advance that might know something to contribute to this link juice thinking about linking.üòÄ


[12-Jul-21 06:21 AM] gcharang#6833
maybe search engines can scrape public channels(doubtful). they definitely can't access/scrape content in this and other channels on the komodo discord as they are all behing access permissions. only people with "member" role can see most of the channels and this particular channel is accesible to only a handful of people outside the team


[12-Jul-21 06:39 AM] Nev#5914
Thank you for that information clarification I didn't think that search engines could scrape the content from Discord. They call it indexing but they rewrite the information to their own database so to me that is scraping other peoples content. That's why I am not keen on search engine because they are database searches not searches of the internet, if it's not in their data base it's not available according to them but it is really they just choose not to index it.

@gcharang  @Nev  thank you Nev for bringing this up.  I am wondering how we can maximize exposure?  I have a Twitter account but, don‚Äôt know how to tag üè∑Ô∏è for best Komodo effect.  I don‚Äôt have a website but do have pages on Facebook. I could create another for kmd platform but, again I don‚Äôt know how to use tags to best effect.  Nev could use SEO with his posts to a website.  If you and/or decker or anyone, could put together a cheat sheet for us that would be great!!  There‚Äôs starting to be some good stuff on here that will help get conversations rolling.  Of course if Komodo wants to use any of this first, we‚Äôd be honored.  I just instinctively feel it‚Äôll be better, the more voices are heard. How do we do that for you?     @Artakush  @Audo  hi guys this was what I was asking.  It‚Äôs fine to say ‚Äòput it on Twitter‚Äô but it would be even better if we had a cheat sheet with all the #hashtags or @NAmes so we could get the right eyes üëÄ on it.  Thanks!

[12-Jul-21 08:32 AM] Nev#5914
I recently read a message on pootube saying that you can tag your videos but it doesn't mean anything they will only use the information in the content for indexing, I expect that is to stop users keyword stuffing in tags. As for others I don't know but unless tags are actually using words in your content then stuffing words into them will probably not gain anything. I am not trying to say or trying to imply that you plan to stuff tags with key words I am just giving my thoughts. If pootube are not counting tags then it is possible that others are not either so I am not sure tags have any value anymore but only use words that you are actually using in any information being provided that is always the best policy. Stick links anywhere you can except on questionable sites and don't use anchor text, just post naked bare links, like this: You can get more info here: https://forum.komodoplatform.com/t/komodo-creative-content-open-discussion/352 or more info: link or look here: link, use normal standard calls to action, not calls like, "Komodo provides great info" it can devalue those links if they look at all like they are being manufactured for search engine optimization. Also when commenting on Komodo videos, which you should always do regardless because this helps videos a lot, you should try to stuff a few keywords into it if possible because comments are classed as independent validation especially when having valuable keyword in context.

Not too keen on Renascence stuff it's a lot of lies and exaggerations based on the Greek and Roman empires who where extremely violent slavers but it's best not to talk about that as it doesn't fit the narrative which is my point.


[14-Jul-21 06:20 AM] Nev#5914
Which leads me to this ‚ÄúThe theory of perfect competition was essentially invented to idealize capitalism, to show it as firms, as these passive, supremely responsible entities that respond to consumer behavior but if you know anything about the history of firms and the history of capitalism you know that's not true they are always engaged in a war‚Äù, Anwar Shaikh, Professor of Economics at the New School.


[14-Jul-21 06:25 AM] Nev#5914
So perhaps we could cause a ruckus, they always get big attention, tell the truth about the so called Renascence, about how it was all predicated on extreme violence, much like the systems we have today, I wonder why? Perhaps it was something to do with the renascence? You would think that these great thinkers would have a lot to say about freedom and freewill but they don't because it's always been about slavery.

Hi,
A tweet could read:
AtomicDEX ‚Äì Atomic Swap; Decentralized Exchange. Barter and Trade. Peer2peer

I‚Äôve put this together with all new film equipment and Davinci Resolve editing software.  It‚Äôs mostly been an exercise in editing with a watercolor overlay, color correction, audio input, and transition experiments.  I could go on tweaking it forever but, that hasn‚Äôt been the point.  I‚Äôm learning all these systems and Komodo at the same time.  I think the idea of overlaying nature video to look like a moving painting (within the theme of Komodo platform) is a bonafide one.  I‚Äôm going to keep experimenting until I get the ‚Äúlook‚Äù right but, everyone starts somewhere.  Oh, and if we were to continue with the wind, I‚Äôll take a trip to central Washington and film the BIG ONES at my in-laws.  This is all.

The answer my friend is blowing" till the end but you will never get to know what it's got to say, sadly it blew away, lol. I like the grasses, I paused it a couple of times to see how they where imitated with a water color effect. Hope it was OK to down load the video? I could so I did and it helped to look at it better. The video was buffering which is why I wanted to look because it showed me by accident, happy accidents I do like them. Anyway I like the wind most of the time and it has significant connotations towards change "the wind of change is blowing through me" Hawkwind "blowing in the wind" Bob Dylan "After a silence the wind complains like a creature longing to burst it's chains"W. B. Rands "If the winds of fortune are temporarily blowing against you, remember that you can harness them and make them carry you toward your definite purpose, through the use of your imagination."

The whispering grasses brought this to mind, try whispering this: "If the winds of fortune are temporarily blowing against you, remember that you can harness them and make them carry you toward your definite purpose, through the use of your imagination." into a microphone and record it then turn the volume up if needed a little and mix it with the sound of the wind. The imagery spells out a message, the words would spell out a message but not the direct message that could be left as a spike for the curiosity. I am going to try it myself but I won't be publishing it. I just want to experience it, especially since a friend of mine says whispering is used a lot in vocal recordings. I think it would be better with a female voice but there ya go I am not giving orders just thinking out load or whispering, ha, ha. Thanks again.

@Nev great good feed back.  Wind imagery is so special and not the easiest to record.  I am here now, wind, doesn‚Äôt work. Speaking from experience üòâ  However I do enjoy the 300amps of pure sine wave electricity it provides for the computer!

The same quote would work with this video as well I will keep on with that idea I think. Thanks.

Did you create the grass with real life video footage or was that simulated?  Either way, good footage! The watercolor overlay is nice and subtle so it doesn't look obvious, but as my question posed, it leaves it open to question.  I like the idea of the wind being harnessed.  For the transition, I would create an opacity fade transition between the grass and the windmill to fit with the ethereal dreamlike feel.  The circles are a little too abrupt and concrete.  @Nev's Hill quote is a good one.   As he said, you can blend your voice, or whisper it in with the wind a bit more to make it feel almost as if the wind were the personified character talking.  I am not very audio adept, so I can't even begin to try to suggest a good way to record wind.  Overall, I love that you put it out there and are running with the idea!  That's what this room seems to be about and I love it!

Thank you for your encouragement!  Yes the grass is real and then morphed into looking like a moving painting.  I think it has a lot of potential.  I think doing this with the river flowing will look even cooler, some day.  I almost didn‚Äôt post at all because hubby laughed at my dinky windmill reminding me of the full sized ones in High Prairie. Yes, that‚Äôs the name of a town.  But like I said, I had to start somewhere and the roof was a lot closer.  I agree about the circles but at least I could make them the right color.  My hope is to learn to put these together quickly enough to start posting regularly to Twitter or wherever.  Thanks for understanding it‚Äôs all experimental at this point and being positive in your suggestions.  I really like both what you and Nev have suggested and will continue to work out these new systems I got.  Cheers ü•Ç

Yip happy accident number 2, I found this below, I knew the line but never really knew the full poem and I found it, what a lovely poem.

Autumn Song

The ash-berry clusters are darkly red;
The leaves of the limes are almost shed;
The passion-flower hangs out her yellow fruit;
The sycamore puts on her brownest suit.

After a silence, the wind complains,
Like a creature longing to burst its chains.
The swallows are gone, I saw them gather;
I heard them murmuring of the weather.

The clouds move fast, the south is blowing;
The sun is slanting; the year is going;
I love to walk where the leaves lie dead,
And hear them rustle beneath my tread.

                                    William Brighty Rands (1823-1882)
Change again "The wind of change is blowing through me and it's all moving" Hawkwind, all over again.

I did try it myself but to be honest I changed some of the words first time, the same words as you identified and a lot of the words the second time I tried it last night. I find it OK to read but I am not sure when I read it out load I think it too long and doesn't  flow well when read out loud. Thanks for the input it is useful and informing.

It was quite a process of elimination.  I created various shaped and colored flames on different layers in Illustrator.  Then imported them into After Effects.  I positioned the flames in AE and applied the 3D toggle for the z dimension and keyframed the scale and z posiitons.  After screwing around with the pen tool and the timeline I found that to be way too cumbersome, not random, and time consuming.  So I used the wiggle(x,x); script expression on each property to automate the random movement.  It is a bit too fast right now, I need to slow it down some, but I ran out of time and got tired and just wanted to post something for the time being.  I also toggled blending mode between the layers to have them blend together and not be so one on top of the other.

I could be wrong, but I can't imagine it would not be too hard to chop up the large versions of the windmill photos and animate the blades to move the way you want them to.  Or time the movement of the blades on cue according to a storyline.  Pretty easy animation rig from first glance at it!

Hey, I finally got to looking at the Plato cave idea, sorry but you will get no complaints from me, I like it, I garbed it, can I use it? Not saying I am going to but just in case. What are you going to do now? I got 8 seconds of video animation. So far I got, opening doors, Komodo, is this the beginning. Sorry but I can't begin to explain the images and transitions but I can say I am buzzing. üòé

You can totally use it.  I already have the fire animated from the last intro I made, so I will re-use that.  I am going to have a perspective view going up the stairs and out the door.

This is great!  Do you have a copy of the lizard you can den so I can make a cartoon version of it?


[28-Jul-21 08:46 AM] Nev#5914
Yes the lizard is in layers, but is fixed in that pose, I don't have other poses it was originally made to go around the earth. I did play with Escher lizards as well and have them as clockwork parts but I can't find the images at the moment. Below is one that inspired the one I am talking about. Imagine a serpent in a circle with the cogs being the spikes on the serpents back rotating inside the bigger cog that was supposed to represent the earth. Anyway if you want me to work with you to create and develop images for animations then I am willing to take it serious and put some effort in.

Ah ok.  I knew I recognized that lizard but I could not put my thumb on it.  I have been all over the place this week with work and my show getting some attention.  But I want to do the animation stuff I love also.  I don't want to waste your time, but I can see how I could make the gears turn in After Effects.  The little inner gear would be tough to do, but they would all need to be separate little nested animations.

Great show by the way, shameless plug.

I will have to look up what nested images are as I am not quite sure.


[28-Jul-21 09:04 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
It's videos within videos.  In After Effects, you create an animation composition and drop it into another composition.  Like my new intro video.  I created a fire animation composition and dropped that into the larger animation.  I can use that fire animation anywhere.  Like in my cave drawing that I am trying to continue with here.

I will go back to the cog idea myself as I think it will be simpler with video stop frame animation.


[28-Jul-21 09:50 AM] EurekaJohn#2094
Technically, yes, it is more simple.  From a time standpoint, it is laborious!  But I do love doing stop-motion! I used to get together with friends and we would make a whole day out of doing frame-by-frame photos to make stop-motion clips.  I was some super nerdy fun.

Yip, it is correct according to my animation, the center cog moves clockwise. The outer cog with internal teeth moves counter clockwise in this one. It was a lot less work than I thought to actually animate the five central moving cogs. I did it with only four repeated still images in a loop. I will be more pleased if I can find a use for it, ha, ha.

Atomic Bob meets Alice Trading.

Welcome to your block chain journey, meet our dynamic hero Atomic Bob, please take a bow bob.

Our dynamic hero Atomic Bob finally decides to get on board the Komodo Platform.

As soon as Bob transferred to Komodo Platform things changed and now he can see the true extent of his real reach as a programmed transaction dynamic. He can travel to any block-chain directly, peer 2 peer, as his namesake implies, it's Atomic.

Bob is very pleased and well on his way through the Komodo Metaverse, Bob gets a first hand guided tour from Alice Trading with the first stop being the Komodo wallet, another namesake, called Atomic DEX.

The AtomicDEX is not just a wallet it performs atomic swaps between wallets, peer 2 peer, this means wallet to wallet where you can trade with others without ever leaving your own wallet.

Yes, this means it's like sending coins to another wallet, there are more actions that you need to take to do this but there are grandma's doing it, so it's just a few extra steps.

If you don't want to do atomic swaps then it's just a wallet, except it's a multi coin wallet and all your coins could be stored in the one place.  

Secured on two block chains using Delayed Proof of Work, transaction details are written to another block-chain making it two times more difficult to falsify. 

Records would need to be changed at two different times with two different chains. 

The Best Can Be Difficult To See

According To The Computer Genie All This Is What Money Looks Like.

Atomic Bob meets Alice Trading on the Komodo Platform, ha, ha. Any ideas, suggestions or help would be much appreciated, thank you. 

We now have three potential characters, Atomic Bob, Alice Trading and The Computer Genie who could be an oracle?

Thanks, no it wasn't an enormous piece of work making  the video, most of the work was making the images, the actual compiling of the video was easy, in fact the main part of the video which is the movement behind all the A's was made with only 4 still images.  I think there are only 9 or 10 still images in the whole thing.


[02-Aug-21 08:14 AM] daybreak#8641
Well, if it‚Äôs ‚Äúeasy‚Äù a slithering dragon would be kinda cool.  What was the voice over?


[02-Aug-21 12:33 PM] Nev#5914
The voice over was me just messing trying to create sound effects on the voice, trying to create a mechanical sounding voice, also wanting it to be almost unintelligible. On the dragon subject making mechanical movements is only two movements form one tooth to the half way mark then back to the tooth, really it seems like it could be done with 2 images but I think it took 4 to do that one. A dragon would need multiple images and movements. Talking needs about 8 different mouth shapes, facial movements like eyes, eye brows, nose and jaw as well as all being synced up to the actual voice so it looks realistic and convincing. Lip sync really needs to be done with a software like flash, it can be done with stop motion but it seems to be more work.

You did it!  The cogs look great.  I agree with @daybreak about the A's.  Where would you be incorporating a dragon?  I see this cogs animation as more of a standalone animation with possibly a text box going along with a voice talking about a concept, almost a quick TLDR snippet between scenes/ or quick intermission screen.

Alice Trading seemed obvious at the time but was never set in stone, easy come, easy go, for some reason my mind thinks Alice needs another name but that can go as well. Alice is Bob's trading partner in the description of how atomic swaps work, I think it's Bob & Alice. So just Alice would be fine I think. The ordinary Joe & Jane six pack are another pair.

I have an issue because I am a dumb animal and so I need something real to talk about or create a story about. So my issue is how do I perceive Atomic Bob? Atomic Bob as far as I am concerned is a programmed transaction dynamic so in reality is mealy a collection of electron particles that have been programmed to do things. The way I make Bob seemingly real is by making him into a hologram. The Bob I made up as a mobile phone type of thing can stay the same but instead of being the mobile phone he is actually a hologram that is projected by the mobile phone.  This way Bob can be the same Bob on any or multiple phones all at the same time and that's an interesting concept because it has unlimited potential. See below for what I mean. https://i.postimg.cc/8C06nD3V/Atomic-Bob-New.png

That's funny because there is no echo, at least none that is added, if there is echo it must be natural from the room probably because I need some kind of baffle for the mic but I just re-listened to the last 3 videos and I can't hear any echo at all, maybe just a little in some places but nothing major. Thanks for the feedback but I am not hearing any echo.

Hey Artakush, I have spent the last few hours trying to identify what you are talking about because I do not think you are making things up. First of all according to what you said in the marketing meeting, it was about the not so deep fake video with Joe, Bob and Vitalik. The problem with that sound recording is I was trying to make my one voice sound like 3 different voices so there was quite a bit of editing. I liked the dark effect you mentioned so left it there, I can clean it up a little if you want but not much because it is so heavily edited anyway.

[09-Aug-21 09:12 AM] Nev#5914
I have as well identified a problem with an echo effect but I am not able to identify it, I think it might be a latency issue with my sound card  but for that I will need to get into a dialogue with a friend of mine because I am not very good with that technical syncing in latency.


[09-Aug-21 09:14 AM] Artakush#4285
I like your work Nev, I like deep fake too. I also think that we can agree that the quality or aesthetics can be clearer. But it does put effort to deliver a message like that. Let me know if you need any help with the latency/soundcard thing as I am a producer tooüëå 

Keep up the great work!

Yeah no problem but I would prefer others to be able to access the conversation, discussion because they might find it helpful for their own efforts. So it seems I do have a problem but it's not actually a problem but more of a preference, ha, ha. You decide here or in DM?


[09-Aug-21 09:32 AM] Nev#5914
I record with a pillow behind the mic to soak up reverberation from the room, I found the best recording of voice to be made using a mic I have on my head phones so it will be a condenser mic.


[09-Aug-21 09:33 AM] Nev#5914
I have tried a number of microphones, cheap and expensive but the mic on the headphones seems to be the best.


[09-Aug-21 09:47 AM] Nev#5914
Probably because it is made for that purpose but they have effects built into them to stop picking up unwanted sound from the environment, limiter type effects , like smart phones and built in mics on video cameras not as smart as they might suggest. I got to go now because I have my duties be back later.

[10-Aug-21 07:05 AM] Nev#5914
Yip, I figured it out, the echo is because of recording in a room with too much background noise from other equipment. This means that there is excess noise reduction being applied. It seems that when the noise reduction is heavily applied it cut's out all noise between sounds but keeps noise that is mixed in with the sound or vocal. It seems to be accentuating the vocal sound mixed in with the noise trying to make it more apparent. The problem is what that sound actually consists of is reverberation/echo from the room making it more apparent and sound like echo on the voice or vocal.


[10-Aug-21 07:10 AM] Nev#5914
The solution is easy except that I am lazy and also like to do things on the spur of the moment so don't consider out comes just quick results. I recorded the same thing in a room with no background noise and a baffle behind the mic to soak up excess sound going into the room and bingo it was perfect with very little noise reduction needed and zero echo.

Yip, waiting for Batman, Spiderman or a dragon to save you is not a good idea, especially if your waiting for politicians to do the right things. It is ominous, Metaverse = Panopticon, if you want to know what a Panopticon is, it's a prison with glass walls and nowhere to hide. Try this for scary, GPT3 machines programmed to lie. As well as turning human beings into pets for AI to play with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqbB07n_uQ4

GPT-3 is pretty terrifying. But I am not at all surprised. That line between humanized robot and computerized human blurs more every day. We went over this manuscript called the ‚Äúcyborg manifesto ‚Äú for one of my human centered design classes at the university of Washington. It was terrifying, but interesting considering that it was written in the 80s and is so quickly becoming reality. Here is the PDF.

Just an update on what I am doing. I will have a rough layout of the AtomicDEX ecosystem by Monday. Then we can talk about if the information is displayed in the appropriate way. once we have the Lofi 2D version of the map then we can start to make it visually appealing and also discuss how to make it interactive.  MiniGunner showed me an interactive solar system map that was built in Unity. I know that one of the main concerns will be having this map interactive on the website. in the past, everything I have made in unity ended up as an application that needed to be downloaded.

That's cool, for myself I have been turning logos into spheres like planets not specifically for what you are doing but because I like them. The point is you can use them if you want to and now I have the logo's you have complied together and made more accessible  I will make a lot more.  Here's an example below: https://i.postimg.cc/vHBkZqS8/De-Fi-and-Fiat-Kid.png I know nothing about Unity, will need to look into it. Thanks.üòÄ

[25-Aug-21 10:10 AM] Kelcie#1924
Yeah I need to get a better headset, noise canceling. It seems like almost every time I try to meditate I end up hearing police sirens. I feel like I am living in a world that is too loud and overwhelming. 

I know that for the SmartFi Video I am working on I wanted to include some sort of soothing noise as I narrate. I wonder, and I‚Äôm sure the answer is out there, what Hz if the best for memory retention.  My theory is that playing this background music or noise with the narration might improve the users absorption of the information.


[25-Aug-21 10:36 AM] Nev#5914
For sure, try watching any video with no sound and it's not good, even very good video animation is crap without sound.  Sound is really a vibration and everything vibrates at some frequency so yes finding the right pitch, sound and composition would be worth the effort surely. I will keep this in mind and go looking over the next few days to see if i can find anything. I do have a video lecture somewhere about the prefect pitch, it might say something about that. I know the video starts out talking about a steel bridge where a section collapsed because of vibration in the metal caused by the wind.

Interesting video but nothing like what you are looking for sorry, I will look further though as I am interested in the idea of a frequency improving memory as my memory is bad, really bad, ha, ha, it comes in handy sometimes though. I have to settle for, "if I don't remember it wasn't worth remembering" attitude.

[26-Aug-21 06:32 AM] Kelcie#1924
Right now and info on OFC is not located on the ecosystem page. Also, while I was collecting the partner logos I noticed that a few of our partners had very pixelated logos, even on their main page. I can compile a list of the partner logos I am talking about but would it be more helpful for me to just contact them and ask if they have a vector file? I am able to recreate these logos in a vector format if they are interested. It would be beneficial for everyone involved.


[26-Aug-21 08:14 AM] Nev#5914
Yip, I was making spheres last night with them and I had issues with one because of pixelating, so i can confirm but I only did five and there are about 40 so there will be more. I did consider rebuilding them but fonts are always an issue not knowing what they used.

There are over 250 logos in there and I know you know that but that is a lot of work just collecting all of them besides doing something with them all. Thank you for doing that, like I said a lot of work. The universe spirals look great. Did you know that two of the oldest known symbols made by 8000 year old ancestors where the Yin Yang, more than a thousand years older than the Chinese Yin Yang and the Swastika both based on spirals. Great stuff, thanks.

I am glad the file can be helpful, I know that it can be a pain searching the internet. My goal is to have a high quality image for each asset listed on atomicDEX. Ideally it would be nice to have a vector file of each logo and update it whenever the logo or icon is redesigned.  Also, as coins and tokens are added to atomic dex, we can keep expanding the graphic as well as the folder.

I listened to the discussion you had about the size of the Ecosystem picture being too big to use, I disagree, I looked into Unity as I said I would and I think it could be done in Unity, I know it could be done with Flash because many moons ago I was making stuff a bit like that with Flash. Yes I know flash has been discontinued and Yes I know you don't have great experience with Unity, me neither but I did think that instead of wasting time on art competitions, "I am not keen of art competitions" the team could use a competition format to encourage Unity users into the fold. In fact I think that the team should be doing their best to bring Unity users into Komodo because I think Unity will be a key to building interaction into the web. Perhaps I don't know enough about Unity yet, ha, ha.

When AtomicDEX was BarterDEX and was first launched they had competitions on doing Atomic swaps with prizes. I thought at the time that that could be made into a game format and could be used to bring new people into the fold. It would also be more applicable to Football, Soccer tournaments.


[10-Sep-21 09:29 AM] Nev#5914

" "I am not keen of art competitions" "prizes" they are all winnersüëç üòé üòÄ  in my own experience I have produced much work from taking part in competitions. That same work has been repurposed many times over and will very likely be used again. that is my treasure chest along with other stuff. I didn't consider any of that when I made that statement above and even the prizes part doesn't work because I love my treasure chest.  I have changed my mind, I like Art competitions, ha, ha .üëå

I've been thinking about atomicdex promotion. We can make some explanatory infographics about atomicdex features. Still or animated gifs-videos. That will be useful for social media promotion and web article visualization. Especially need to explain with graphics why people should use atomicdex.

welcome @sems , we have discussed infographics in the past.  I agree it is important, and i think this might be something the marketing team is working on right now.  The writers room is great for community art.  Feel free to make what you feel as long as it is your own content.  Let me know if you need any partner logos, style guides. We are all here to help each other.

I am sure we will all find new experiences, already had a few, I have just been making memes and ideas, pictures for fun, the past two weeks haven't been very productive but I have still been making stuff anyway, not so much Komodo stuff, just pictures for the sake of it. I think I might have some kind of addiction to making pictures, I make something every day almost so I am not complaining. I think it's dropped a bit because of what has been going on the past two weeks but to be honest I am clueless as to what that actually is. All I hear is we are busy, ha, ha, and I am not interested if it doesn't affect me. All the best.

@Artakush I do still want to make this interactive someday. I am polishing my unity skill for an upcoming game, i really liked the 3d space explorer that we talked about before.  I am just trying to figure out alternative to Unity for this particular project because I want to make an interactive infographic that can be viewed by anyone, not a unity application that will need to be downloaded. also this will grow as more digital assets are added to AtomicDEX.


[20-Oct-21 10:17 AM] Artakush#4285
Completely understand what you mean. I will check if I can find some help. I am thinking that for know a sort ofeither formal, or story telling version like @daybreak makes could be interesting achievement before we can focus on one fleshed out interactive version


[20-Oct-21 10:18 AM] Artakush#4285
Lets say 1) by @daybreak in the way of Narrative.. and another one, more kind of formal. highlighting projects, zoom in zoom out kind of way, when you zoom in, you see perks of the platform and main points they want to highlight, when you zoom out, you kind of travel searching observing the planets/stars choosing to "read more" about them


[20-Oct-21 10:21 AM] Kelcie#1924
that is a good direction to take. I thought about maybe putting it in after effects and seeing what I can do with it there, but i am going to wait for my new computer first. This one would most definitely explode.


[20-Oct-21 10:24 AM] daybreak#8641
I‚Äôm thinking it could be 3D and I can ‚Äúfly‚Äù in to specific community for the story telling part.  This could be used over and over again for each project.  Davinci Resolve has extraordinary special effects.

It can always grow as in any other story telling. We just make up a story where these project communitoes migrate to Komodo 3cosystem


[22-Oct-21 07:25 AM] daybreak#8641
@Artakush you‚Äôve mentioned before the idea of various videos being able to play with different endings. Thank you for this example, now I understand so much better.  Like the example in Twitter (10 ways to die) it would take an enormity of chapters to complete such a task.  Perhaps KomodoTales will be that repository.  It sure is a good idea!  Ooo and if you do it right, you win an NFT.  I‚Äôve got a little Tokel.

@sems this is where the conversation started about using the galaxy of KomodoPlatform communities with @Artakush and @Kelcie.  If you follow the conversation along I suggest the opposite (flying in).  Do you think we can accomplish this with Davinci Resolve?  I do but I‚Äôm not sure how yet.  Think flying through space (zooming in rotationally?). Interested in your thoughts as the type/size of photo will make a difference with Kelcie.


[22-Oct-21 02:53 PM] daybreak#8641
@sems


[22-Oct-21 08:33 PM] sems#7713
In davinci resolve possible to make zoom in and out of the image. But it's not very possible to make a look like somebody taking out off an image . Need to use 3D elements for that. Like creating 3D version of Kelcie's Komodo Galaxy.


[22-Oct-21 08:36 PM] sems#7713
Or in davinci resolve or Blender. We can create a 2d layered environment. Maybe create only a few 3d element to give 3d space feeling. By this way we can find a way to make that look.


[22-Oct-21 08:36 PM] sems#7713
Need to try and see best way.


[23-Oct-21 02:40 PM] daybreak#8641
@sems I‚Äôm thinking the 3D spinning of the galaxy would be fairly easy along with zooming in. The question then becomes what does the audience see after a certain point we‚Äôd need the stars ‚ú® to start resolving themselves into individual destinations.  I wonder if we won‚Äôt need a series of images to pull of that effect. Each flight being somewhat different from the last unless returning to a previous destination.  Kinda like Google Earth Pro meets Star Trek.

[24-Oct-21 10:01 AM] sems#7713
We can use particle effects for creating multiple stars. But creating all of them will make us deal with a huge file size. Working with low poly or non realistic style models and light shaders would help to avoid struggle with huge file size. And also no need to create all of stars as 3d. We can use background image and it will not be noticable for viewers.

{Reactions}
üå† 

[24-Oct-21 10:08 AM] sems#7713
And if we need to create terrains for stars/planets when we fly in ( which would be very nice), unity or unreal engine would be helpful. We can create specific terrains/worlds which express those stories atmosphere for every planet. And when you telling story, we can show places/images related to story.

Yes. I like the idea. As I mentioned before, we can do it with 3d animations. Actually it would be done with 2d either. But 3d will give us more flexibility and time saving opportunity. But as a result, we can do it anyway.

I have new visuals from the Komodo collection by Ramon.  I‚Äôm excited to use them.  I‚Äôm just looking to fly into the galaxy of AtomicDEX to kmd and thc this episode. I‚Äôm not trying to create a world for each coin. I don‚Äôt know what each community in visions are.  That would need to be coordinated with them and is beyond the scope of KomodoTales.


[09-Nov-21 06:00 AM] daybreak#8641
However, imo, that would be a great launching pad for your animation series.  How‚Äôs that going btw? Anything we can do to help you see it come to fruition?

Well, I am cryptosammy. I am working on a project called Lore of the Tokels, which I am currently working fulltime on. Its on Tokel Platform and after making a demo game, I am now close to releasing a mvp (minimal viable product). With some community members, we have set up a foundation and I have been asking a lot of dumb questions. I am new in developing on blockchain and I started here to setup paxful with Atomic DEX and accidently became a gamedev. I know a little marketing theory, but never set up a business. I am however curious and try to look at everything from different angles. I am here to learn and feel very honored to watch how community contributors do magical things and I am sorry if I ask obvious and stupid questions, but I'll try to mostly read.

As is mostly always the case I looked at images before reading txt. The first one I guessed might be electrical circuitry and the second looked like it was under water, a sea theme, third was obviously a pirate, all resembled skulls., that seems to be all you can do with pixel art images, the second one also reminded me of an old fashioned telephone. Most people in this market I would guess don't even know what and old fashioned telephone actually looks like.  An idea for you. Old fashioned telephones, dead phones, ha, ha. Thanks I enjoyed wondering about them.

From attempting my first komodo ac chain launch I'm noticing some areas that could do well to have more content built around. The first is a better understanding of the asset chain parameters (basic and CC).

At this point we have #writers-room for creatives, #project-trade-competition for traders, we will make #marketing-project and user-tester-project, if we see a clear action/idea proposed, till which point will are all supportive to it!

[11-Nov-21 12:15 PM] Regnar#6164
So I do have an idea that I think is pretty cool. Laying out purpose first: To educate not just Komodo ecosystem, but other crypto communities on blockchain fundamentals; to also bring more people to Komodo for informative resources; to expand Komodo's name as a blockchain industry leader and expert. But also to provide more content for people and get them some NFTs.

We could have a curriculum of Komodo blockchain fundamental series to read in a specific order to really get things to click. There could be required reading and then some optional deep dives that expand on a topic.
For example reading about SHA256 and 512 probably go after the hashing algorithm introduction (required), and can probably be option deep dives.

Something like a basic blockchain overview and article of the courses laid out. Then maybe the problem blockchain tries to solve with some optional background history like the inflation article. Then the primers on the components that make up blockchains, asymmetric encryption, hashing, Byzantine generals, double spending, digital signatures, consensus etc.

Then there could be more specific wallets section, trading section, defi, mining algorithms, etc. After it gets expanded out a bit more we could add practice questions to the bottom of each article. And then afterwards you do a quiz on the entire curriculum and get a certificate as an NFT with Tokel.

I had an idea a while back to create a faucet fruit machine, gambling machine, where instead of fruit it has coin logos. You run the machine and it land on logos of a certain coin that then gives you information about it, you have to keep it open for a short period of time to get your reward which is really a faucet but also encourages the user to read the information thus learn at the same time. Also encourage users to use atomicDex to send their coins to, a multi wallet plus decentralized exchange. Many different coins could also be in the faucet but I don't know how or even if it could be done, which is why I want to get some type of grip on Unity.

So I have tried a few different procgen setups I've liked. This one is in JS, but also has some python for building your own
<https://robohash.org/>


[17-Nov-21 02:17 PM] Regnar#6164
This one comes down to drawing art as PNGs with different components saved as separate layers. Those layers are then color coded and stacked so they can be selected at random from a directory to apply back in layer format. This is a bit heavier as you need to save all the components as pngs and depending on how many you have, there could be hundreds in each folder. It's also a bit tricky to modify different colors randomly, they only really prebuild those colors


[17-Nov-21 02:19 PM] Regnar#6164
For a more grid like pattern like those Komodians, you could also do a python based one that feeds colors based on a big grid


[17-Nov-21 02:21 PM] Regnar#6164
So for example, I would draw an image here <https://cryptopunksnotdead.github.io/pixelart.js/editor/> and convert the image to 0-6 numbers. Then I could directly input that base image into a python script.


[17-Nov-21 02:22 PM] Regnar#6164
I then have some functions that grabs random premade inputs for eyes, mouth, etc. and plugs them into that grid, then selects colors at random and applies them to each number.


[17-Nov-21 02:24 PM] Regnar#6164
So using a basic punk template, I made some custom eyes and can import them at random, then generate the rest of the punk at random like this.

So you could draw the templates, and then pick spots you want to randomize (eyes, mouth, nose, ears, accessories, hats, necklaces, etc) and draw those separate components but in a way that would lay out on the template


[17-Nov-21 02:26 PM] Regnar#6164

I also added some buffer around the eyes in this case so I can swap it out with different sized eyes.

```python
Accessories = {
    "Eyes":{
        "Annoyed": [['4','4','4','4', '4','4','4'],
                    ['4','0','1','4', '4','0','1'],
                    ['4','0','0','4', '4','0','0'],
                    ['4','4','4','4', '4','4','4']],
        "Pensive": [['4','4','4','4', '4','4','4'],
                    ['4','0','0','4', '4','0','0'],
                    ['4','1','0','4', '4','1','0'],
                    ['4','4','4','4', '4','4','4']],
...
```


[17-Nov-21 02:30 PM] Regnar#6164
Which represents the maps for types of eyes I swap in. If it picks the Annoyed eyes, it will plug those values into the base map where the eyes are located. The colors still match up though, since I'm applying colors at the end by numbers. Basically just mapping a number to a color (e.g. 4 = 255,255,255 or something)


[17-Nov-21 05:09 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm generally more comfortable in Python, but there's also this library which looks pretty clean and is in Typescript and generates the images as SVG which is good to work with on a browser, lightweight and can definitely fit more detail than I am currently using (though technically there's no real limit to how big I can make those maps) but as an NFT you'd want to export as a PNG anyway, and want to create a PNG before "giving" it to someone so they don't modify the SVG before it's minted.

I've been looking at procedural generation art for a couple weeks now and have a few scripts that work in varying degrees. the 8bit style is a bit easier for me to work with since I don't really have anything to draw pngs with, and I'm not super familiar with working with custom svgs, but for 8 bit style, the grid pattern works well. For higher detail, non 8bit style, svg is probably better and then convert to png afterwards.

@Regnar 

The options are interesting. But there are a few issues with the worflow.

For example I don't handpaint pixel by pixel (except for finishing touches), I use a converter. Handpainting attributes while thinking of code layout, would be rather cumbersome for me to pull off.

In the end I end up with a psd in which i can combine multiple attributes. Which enables me to make a set in about a day time. Example:

I don't really have the time to do art and dabble with scripting simultaneously. An on-line generator would be amazing for the community.


[18-Nov-21 03:57 AM] ramonster42#7323
ironically this might be more time intensive as my workflow features direct conversions from lineart. I do have all attributes in different layers, so it might be possible to 'fake' an online generator without too much scripting, based on my PNG's with transparency.


[18-Nov-21 03:59 AM] ramonster42#7323

Photoshop doesn't work well for pixelation conversion as it processes the aliasing too much.


[18-Nov-21 05:00 AM] ramonster42#7323
Currently komodians are 29X29 px (or blocks) (unlike cryptopunks 24)

for the generator that means 1015px to 35 (px) blocks.

my approach would be a microservice, ExpressJS - json API. Make sliced images from the PSD and have a set of sizes that would define the outcome render. For Lore I use in 3D modular characters and switch everything off and select the parts I need to be active. It sounds complex, but it are basically two arrays.

this is for the community right?


[18-Nov-21 05:21 AM] cryptosammy#3587
if you can find someone who can design the UX quickly, I can do the tech stuff quite fast. And when that works, you can find someone experienced who can make it secure in a second. I think that this would be easy for the super coders we have in community

This is not something that needs to be done short-term, but is a good 'nice to have' for the community and potential NFT release. I'm pretty sure Komodo would compensate for the programming as a freelance task if someone got the chops to make it happen.

[18-Nov-21 02:49 PM] Regnar#6164
You would probably want to build the clean image first then and then use that pixel conversion tool (which is pretty cool and I bookmarked it)


[18-Nov-21 02:50 PM] Regnar#6164
> I do have all attributes in different layers, so it might be possible to 'fake' an online generator without too much scripting, based on my PNG's with transparency.
This is what I did initially, it isn't super fast (for Python to do all the layers) compared to the pixel first method, but it is still very doable and this script is actually pretty on point for what you were suggesting. <https://github.com/e1ven/Robohash/tree/master/robohash/sets/set4> This is the github showing you the location of `set4` which is just a directory of folders. The inner folders are labeled by their component (body, fur, eyes, mouth, accessories) and has a number `000#00body` which basically tells the script which directory to go to first and grab a png. So those numbers layer the png you are building (e.g. first layer is the body png, then fur, then eyes, then mouth, then accessories)

{Reactions}
üëç 

[18-Nov-21 02:57 PM] Regnar#6164
There's an element of randomness to it when it selects a component from the directory, but the order stays the same.


[18-Nov-21 02:59 PM] Regnar#6164
So I think you could draw your art so that components always fit on the `body` and that way it doesn't matter which one you grab, it will still stack properly.


[18-Nov-21 02:59 PM] Regnar#6164
I moved away from this one because it required me to build a bunch of PNGs in Paint and they came out pretty awful since I was making them with a mouse.


[18-Nov-21 03:03 PM] Regnar#6164
but reasonably you could make your components that way. Additionally I messed around with mapping colors of an image and swapping those colors for others to create random themed images. The fewer the colors, the easier it is. But if you have like 10 main colors, you would mostly want to build a map for those colors for when you draw your templates. So for example, you would set the skin color to one specific color (preferably one you don't actually want to use) for ALL your templates, then you do the eye colors, etc. Then I would read the image and convert all occurances of the "skin" color to some other color, and so on. Which makes a random colored image, but still maintains consistency in the format.


[18-Nov-21 03:05 PM] Regnar#6164

Oh one of the cool things about this code sample I found that I can tweak to work here, is it uses a hash to generate randomness. Which means I could feed it a users crypto address and it would generate them a random NFT. And anytime I use their address to generate an NFT, it would create the same one. Not super important, but definitely a cool feature


[19-Nov-21 07:14 PM] Regnar#6164
So using the already built cat templates/components and the SuperNET KMD address as a randomness seed, it makes this

So the robohash code is just a python class that browses some directories grabbing a single image from each one and stacking it on one another using PIL. I just threw it on a webserver and everytime I load the page it makes a new image and serves it to the browser. This could just be done via command line and make hundreds of these and save them all into a folder

it all comes down to drawing the components and stacking them properly. Some draw them in SVG, some as PNG, some as actual pixels

yep


[20-Nov-21 07:09 AM] Regnar#6164
I've messed with most of them just for fun. PNG is pretty straightforward and makes sense considering a lot of the tools being used to make them. It's also nice since if they are NFTs they will need to be uploaded anyway, and if you want them as avatars PNG is probably what you'll convert to anyway. so building them there are different ways, but the end result is getting it into a png

probably not the best code I've ever written but w.e.

    color_map = {
        '0':self.background,
        '1':self.outline,
        '2':self.eyes,

        '4':self.skin,
        '5':self.skinShine,
        '6':self.skinShine2,
    }
    for row in list_of_strings:
        for index, item in enumerate(row):
            row[index] = color_map[item]
    self.clean_grid = list_of_strings
```

this concept of generating random images is very old. In my first job in a games development company around 2006 they used to create random game charactors generators, with customisations, in Adobe Flash.
Then social media and other palces avatars came to highlight.
Didn't had thought CryptoKitties will take that to this level and make millions/billions of this small concept and give push to NFTs üòÖ

yea it's pretty cool imo


[20-Nov-21 07:28 AM] Regnar#6164
I've also experimented with more random generated images, not necessarily avatars via layer stacking


[20-Nov-21 07:29 AM] Regnar#6164
so I'll plot random points on a grid and start connecting lines for those points by a consistent rule, and repeat until it's finished. Makes some pretty cool patterns that are all different

We need to transfer the data into a database so that it's easy to keep up to date and share with others. Would you be interested in doing this for a bounty?

I created a public database here: https://komodoplatform.notion.site/49bf3866e43a46419fd70663bcb9b435?v=7d5b9bd1a05d4d40a3a04e24dbbc2bd8

I can add you to manage the database so you will have write access.

Update:  the document has been revised with a great deal of input from you all.  What will be it‚Äôs final iteration? A group of us are still reaching out and finding our communities.  Must be built with Komodo Platform tech to make the primary list.  However, great links have snuck on there too.  Carry on.

My brain is full, may I please be excused?  In other words I‚Äôve compiled the information about Komodo‚Äôs ecosystem with the help of four other Komodians and sent you a link.  Have a great day!
