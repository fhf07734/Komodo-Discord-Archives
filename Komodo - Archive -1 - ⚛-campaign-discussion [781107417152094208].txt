An idea to get more stress testors in (and it might be too late to logistically do this) would be to reach out to coin projects with decent sized communities and *temporarily* add their projects for a competition. Those coins with the highest swap counts vs KMD in a 24-48 hour period win a free permanent listing on AtomicDEX (Desktop and Mobile). Could have tiered prizes like 1st is both Desktop and Mobile, 2nd is free Mobile, 3rd is a donation to their community fund. etc. 

Then you do some individual prizes based on highest trader profits, highest individual swap counts, maybe a prize for the trader most in the hole üòÖ

This makes the incentive a free listing for a coin project, and then gets other teams and other community influencers to leverage their community to compete. As opposed to individual rewards which incentivize not sharing the competition information, ie. avoid expanding their competition and reducing an individual chances to win

Clarification about the donations for the bounty pool: you can donate and still request to withdraw your donation later if you are not happy about how it is proposed to be used or if there are no good proposals.

This is like a marketplace. Anyone can submit ideas and if someone likes them then they can get funded. That someone can also be the Komodo team.

This channel is for discussion about those proposals.

Is the stress test open to everyone? Or just people not geo-blocked?


[25-Nov-20 07:17 AM] lightspeed393#5403
If you use a VPN and can trade who would know?


[25-Nov-20 07:20 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Understood about the VPN. Im just trying to figure out if this campaign is open to anyone or not.


[25-Nov-20 07:21 AM] lightspeed393#5403
All that's required to register is a KMD address. If your address can trade, I don't see why anyone wouldn't be included.


[25-Nov-20 07:21 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Is the stress test done on the newest version of Adex?


[25-Nov-20 07:24 AM] lightspeed393#5403
Well I'm sure they'd want people to use the newest version for the sake of finding bugs and not finding old bugs that have already been fixed, but I don't see why that really matters


[25-Nov-20 07:26 AM] lightspeed393#5403
This whole geoblock thing is blown out of proportion. If you come to be a tester and its blocked in your region, use the version from marmara, or cli, or take 5 seconds to start a vpn. The registration form only asked for the KMD address you'll be trading on, doesn't ask you to verify your identity and check for country.

If the only change is removal of non-kyc, then why not package this specifically for a few different communities? Ie:  create a GitHub that says litecoin/atomicDEX-Desktop/releases/tag/0.3.1-alpha

Or DGB/ or insert-your-coin/

It will give the impression that there is a DEX specifically for their community


[25-Nov-20 07:42 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Might convince more to test from that specific community.


[25-Nov-20 07:45 AM] lightspeed393#5403
Any community could fork and run their own *version* but to what benefit? Just submit the PR for your coin back to the main repo and you're included. Running your own fork means that communities team has to maintain it and constantly pull new changes from the upstream repo to stay up to date.


[25-Nov-20 07:47 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I could fork it, remove the one line that that compiles with geoblock, and make a release, but it would be the same as Marama's version. There's no benefit imo of other communities doing this as well. It's still all the same backend (atomicdex-api) using the same netid.


[25-Nov-20 07:50 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I get what you're saying about that community might get the impression they have their own dex, but just seems like more work and unecessary division to me.


[25-Nov-20 07:51 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Is not Marmarachain benefiting from a marketing perspective? Their name is being advertised. From an outside perspective, there is the Komodochain AtomicDex and the Marmarachain AtomicDex both get tested during the stress test. Prepare to answer questions about this multiple times. Big win for Marmarachain BTW.


[25-Nov-20 07:53 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
It's almost similar to how lots of advertising energy went into agama, only to give it away to Verus and also help put Verus name out there for notice. Big win for Verus


[25-Nov-20 07:56 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I personally don't really think its a win for Marmara. It's not like it's been renamed, or rebranded to fit their marketing needs. It's literally the same app with the same backend network. Still benefits komodo as the liquity and orders are being placed on the main atomicdex network.


[25-Nov-20 07:56 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
If I was you, I'd strongly consider forking AtomicDex and advertise Spacecoin AtomicDex.


[25-Nov-20 07:57 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
It's all about perspective, something that seems lost on developers


[25-Nov-20 07:57 AM] Meyse#0952
I dont think Verus Desktop has anything to do with Agama


[25-Nov-20 07:58 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I get that. I'm just saying once someone downloads the *spacecoin* atomicdex version, they wouldn't even know which one they are using. Same thing. Just different link you download from.

[25-Nov-20 08:06 AM] lightspeed393#5403
@‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª I completely get your points on marketing. I just think there's more to gain by spending time adding more coins to AtomicDEX and then approaching their communites and telling them it's available to trade, rather than spending time trying to get them to fork and run their own version. Both ways benefit the underlying network/orderbooks though, so to each their own.

Idea for Atomic DEX: let's say for examples sake my ID is xxxxx1234 ; I thought it'd be good if people can send you coins (whether KMD, LTC etc) just using your ID whilst they use the Atomic DEX. Currently the sender needs to know your wallet address. I appreciate in most cases people won't want to possibly tell people their ID for security but amongst friends , family etc I feel it'd be useful. Thoughts?


[25-Nov-20 12:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
maybe atomicdex can support verus ID?

Right now we're conducting outreach to communities in an effort to discover any crypto communities willing or interested in doing one of the following:

- Secure a placement for themselves in one of the the community spots for during the AtomicDEX stress test.
- Collaborate for a shared media placement opportunity with their community at anytime during the stress test and campaign leading up to it.


The goal is to get as many people take part in the stress test as possible and to do some co-marketing stuff with the other communities.

**If you would like to helpout you can reach out to your favourite community and let them know about the opportunity!**

Use these links for reference:
 - The stress test announcement https://komodoplatform.com/sign-up-for-the-december-2020-atomicdex-stress-test-event/
 - The early registration form https://mailchi.mp/komodoplatform/early-bird-registration

Although we're running our own outreach directly from marketing, the Komodo community here can get so much more done than than the 3 dedicated marketing team people we currently have with everything on our plates.

All you have to do is bring back a connection which leads to securing a community placement for one of the spots or create a media collaboration opportunity with another influencer, project, or audience.

who can get in touch with these communities?


[26-Nov-20 02:38 AM] Lennart#9331
I can get in touch with DigiByte or provide contact information. I would suggest to ask Rudy Bouwman from Digi foundation but what exactly to propose? Incentive for their community?


[26-Nov-20 02:41 AM] jl777c#5810
for DGB people it would seem a good incentive would be free DGB


[26-Nov-20 02:41 AM] jl777c#5810
this can be done by offering below market pricing for DGB on atomicDEX


[26-Nov-20 02:42 AM] jl777c#5810
but should be limited to addresses with relatively small amounts to prevent a whale from just grabbing. all the free DGB


[26-Nov-20 02:42 AM] jl777c#5810
for other communities, substitute "DGB" with their coin


[26-Nov-20 02:53 AM] Lennart#9331
that certainly sounds like a good idea to get lots of people in. limited to addresses means they would have to preregister like the stress test early bird registration?


[26-Nov-20 02:54 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure about the details. just the concept. it was asked what incentive to offer DGB peoples. answer: free DGB

KMD is one block per minute. If KMD produces one (KBTC), (KETH), (KUSD). The atomic swap can be resolved within 3 to 5 minutes, someone will play.


[27-Nov-20 02:43 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Develop a dual-chain model, deposit a BTC/ETH, lock it and generate a KBTC/KETH. Withdraw the coin and destroy it.


[27-Nov-20 02:45 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
No one played atomic swaps, mainly because the swap time was too long and the miners' fees were too high.

Just thinking out aloud here.  What would be the benefits of Digibyte running there own version of AtomicDEX and building on it for their community? (DigibyteDEX)  I'm sure there would be plenty.  I actually lost a lot of DGB on poloniex.  
The Digibyte creator and poloniex owner Justin Sun were having an argument and to save face Sun delisted Digibyte.   I was in hospital at the time, so did not know of the delisting, resulting in a massive loss of funds.  If Digibyte built on AtomicDEX they could add any 
feature/promo they wanted and the Community would have there own DEX.  More to the point the Digibyte Community would have control over there own exchange.

Maybe a good protocol for customer acquisition would be have a user publicly post a screenshot of their AtomicDex order for a defined amount, then we use the AtomicDex as the mechanism to pay them out. Ie: Digibyte community is informed of the campaign on social media, users create a bid order via AtomicDex, then  post an image of the bid, then we fill the order and pay them out with the kmd that was raised. Would need to have predetermined an amount of value for each customer acquisition.


[27-Nov-20 09:23 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Is the goal to pay people for views of the campaign in an effort to spread awareness, or are we looking to pay for people that DL and use the app?


[27-Nov-20 09:26 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Ie: community bounty funds pay out in one or more of these situations,
1. Spreading awareness via social media
2. User actively DL the Dex and install/ create address
3. User posts a Bid


[27-Nov-20 09:33 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
I keep thinking about what would motivate a non-kmd community. Does offering a stranger a few bucks to load and install software truly motivate people?

Another approach that I mentioned a few days ago might be a better way to motivate other communities. Instead of just saying, hey I want to pay you for your time for this project that we made, frame it it differently by making it something for them. If they feel it is something for them and their community, naturally they would want to support it as it helps their position, just like we want to support adex cause it helps our position. So in this scenario, we offer a bounty for forking the AtomicDex to specifically target individual coin communities. It is still the same mm2 network id and probably the same name as well. But we get someone from their community to take ownership of it. Exactly like what Marmarachain is doing. Motivate by giving them a Dex, which is also our Dex.

@‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª I wonder if they would be incentivized even simply knowing that there is a dex with their favourite coin that would benefit from from liquidity that they provide. Even just that in itself might encourage them to support the dex providing liquidity because they want their coin to have liquidity on a true atomic swap dex

It's already built, they don't know about it ? I see swaps for all those pairs occasionally. I assumed some members were already using it. maybe we put up some cheap pairs of their respective currency, but tell them around when they are going on the order books sometime in the future and they'll be incentivized to get atomic dex going on their devices.

setting a date and time for the event lets us make sure the support resources are available to get as many new people running as necessary.

What should stress testers aim to achieve mainly? Just buy and sell as much as possible? As frequently as possible? Will this stress test be using the dexp2p (forgot the exact name) for network communication?


[29-Nov-20 08:06 AM] lightspeed393#5403
dexp2p is a feature within komodod, afaik that won't be apart of atomicDEX stress testing.


[29-Nov-20 08:11 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I'm curious about the aim of trades as well though @Audo. Like what do users have to do to be sucessful and attempt to win prizes? You told me it only requires RICK/MORTY, but is it based on number of trades, or size of trades? As users come here from other communities (hopefully) we should be prepared to tell them what exactly they'll need to do to be successful. Of course we're mostly looking for bugs/limitations of the network, but I'm assuming most will be focused on how they can be rewarded.


[29-Nov-20 08:18 AM] tolken#2655
@lightspeed393 I thought dexp2p was more or less a direct response to the inefficiencies discovered in the last stress test.


[29-Nov-20 08:25 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I'm not sure I could be wrong, but I don't think it's used. AtomicDEX devs have been implementing libp2p gossipsub protocol for orderbooks afaik.


[29-Nov-20 08:33 AM] gcharang#6833
dexp2p was supposed to be used by mm2, but it wasn't an exact fit afaik


[29-Nov-20 08:34 AM] lightspeed393#5403
probably something to do with most atomicdex users aren't running komodod so the orderbook wouldn't be very decentralized.


[29-Nov-20 08:38 AM] tolken#2655
@gcharang thanks, would love to hear more details on how this evolved and what type of efficiency/throughput the team projects is possible with the revised network code.


[29-Nov-20 09:38 AM] gcharang#6833
maybe it can be a blog post. @Delton  might be able to piece together the history and expectations by interviewing the devs. it can be part of the stress test post mortem report

The stress test will happen mainly between Rick & Morty pair. We just need a large amount of users to trade simultaniously. We can also trade different volumes with the Rick & Morty trades. 

Technically speaking a rick & morty swap is the same as KMD & MLC swap.

Would there be any benefit to create a third test coin for trading? Where are all of these rick and morty coins coming from? How will they be distributed? I can see a scenario where having a third coin provides more opportunities to trade simultaneously.

we have locked to the two test coins. Adding a third one doesn't add anything from technical standpoint.

[30-Nov-20 12:38 PM] ejuliano#8606
it's ok if there are advantages, i'm not meaning it in that way
regardless,  marketing should definitely make it known loud and clear, that rick & morty are the test coins needed, and that the faucets are open... i wonder how many registered testers and potential testers are not aware of this?


[30-Nov-20 12:48 PM] lightspeed393#5403
AtomicDEX-Desktop added the ability to claim RICK and MORTY from the faucet right from the app after the halloween testing. I'm guessing there will be a new release for this before the stress test starts.

It's the manner in which the free coins will be distributed and earned which will create a useful and fair distribution opportunity.  Atm for being prepared, participants need to register and have their AtomicDEX KMD address on the list which they will be trading from. 
https://mailchi.mp/komodoplatform/early-bird-registration

For Marketing side, for this stress test, we're going to be trying out a few delivery systems for engagement and then looking at the data and taking into account community feedback on the days following.  We'll use this system to improve on event engagement techniques - and then modify future swap events as needed when we find better practices.

@Jcharming @Audo we need to do some korean focused promo too


[03-Dec-20 03:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
seems like that is a big trading block, have we done some out reach to that community?


[03-Dec-20 05:18 PM] Mylo#8306
@goldenman  are you still around? AtomicDEX stress test is next week if you can drum up some Korean interest üí´


[03-Dec-20 07:45 PM] Jcharming#2693
Thanks for the heads up, we haven't made a translation of the reg form specific for Korean, that mostly has to do with us having a lot on our plates and not having a direct outlet for Korea translate material.  
If you have an audience you can share this with let it be known and I"ll see what I can do about getting the landing page translated.
