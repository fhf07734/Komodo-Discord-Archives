I still have no clue on what to expect and how the swap really works. No wallets on bittrex, no trading on cryptobridge. I must say I am getting nervous about the lack of information. Is there room for a technical article that explains the swap for masternode holders?

Hi here :).
Barterlly is now open on BETA mode, and will provide tools for users and CoinOwners to perform OTC trades in a safe way.
Any KMD assetchain dPowed will be listed, and supported, for free.
Other coins not already listed can submit a listing application at : https://barterlly.typeform.com/to/iqpS1H
During the BETA, Barterlly won't charge any fee other than the transaction ones. after the release we will charge 1% on top of every transaction.
Our goal is to provide premium tools for coins listed on the platform. (Discord swapbot, twitter integration, public orders, wallet integration, API, custom templating, and many more).
Feel free to join us on our Discord.
https://discord.gg/RHc95zw
The app link is located at : https://app.barterlly.io
We are open to suggestions, and partnerships.

See you soon !

Barterlly's team

I have 9700 THC coins. Everything is delisting. What should I do?


[03-Jun-19 09:21 PM] jacman#4756
I tried importprivkey with Komodo-CLI using my THC private key but I get ‚Äúinvalid private key encoding‚Äù. Did I miss a step to encode my private key differently before importing it? How would I do that?


[03-Jun-19 09:41 PM] jacman#4756
Maybe I should be using Agama. I‚Äôll try that.


[04-Jun-19 06:15 PM] jacman#4756
Agama worked well. I read the swap will be automatic so private keys will continue to work on the new upgraded chain.

The HempCoin $THC is closer to the new Komodo THC chain.

All THC coins needs removed from ANY exchange including Coinomi to a QT wallet. Coins in a QT wallet will be in the Snapshot for the new technology chain.

[02-Jul-19 10:36 AM] Exile13#4458
OK!! üòÉ To start this migration is would be BEST if all your THC was in ONE address, the migration will include dumping your private keys from a THC address in the "debug console" in your Hempcoin.org QT wallet.


[02-Jul-19 03:36 PM] TexMiners#3303
Sounds easy enough.  @Exile13 , make sure you communicate about potential scammers trying to help people.  Dumping private keys is a risky operation, and it's easy to get scammed.  I work on another coin project, and we had a community member get scammed out of a ton of coin, because they allowed someone to "help" them, over TeamView.


[02-Jul-19 03:37 PM] TexMiners#3303
The scammer got the coins, then dumped them, causing the price to take a massive dive.


[02-Jul-19 03:52 PM] Exile13#4458
best option is to do it yourself, there may be a visual guide created


[02-Jul-19 07:41 PM] TexMiners#3303
@Exile13 , yes but you'll have people asking for help, then scammers will PM them, offering help.

migration date announced in 24 hrs


[11-Jul-19 02:12 PM] Exile13#4458
`The delay of the snapshot has been waiting on P2PB2B to fix THEIR wallet mistake issue. We are moving forward with the snapshot (within a few days) and will announce the date and time within 24 hours. 

Crypto Bridge recently let us know they will host this migration. If you want to send coins to them they will issue the new coins. 

All other coins from Coinomi and other wallets must be in a QT or Crypto-Bridge exchange. 

We are announcing that we have Bitker lined up as a new exchange as well as others as soon as they set up the new Komodo updated chain. 

Once the migration happens we have many new platforms to announce.`

Build Komodo from source https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/installation.html

Start THC daemon 
./komodod -ac_name=THC -ac_supply=251253103 -ac_reward=360000000,300000000,240000000,180000000,150000000,90000000,0 -ac_staked=100 -ac_eras=7 -ac_end=500001,1000001,1500001,2000001,2500001,4500001,0 -ac_perc=233333333 -ac_cc=2 -ac_ccenable=229,236,240 -ac_script=2ea22c8020987fad30df055db6fd922c3a57e55d76601229ed3da3b31340112e773df3d0d28103120c008203000401ccb8 -ac_founders=150 -ac_cbmaturity=1 -ac_sapling=1 -addnode=195.201.20.230 -addnode=195.201.137.5 -earlytxid=7e4a76259e99c9379551389e9f757fc5f46c33ae922a8644dc2b187af2a6adc1

If you're importing more than 1 THC WIF you should do  
./komodo-cli -ac_name=THC importprivkey <THC WIF> "" false 0 212
for all them but..

The very last one
./komodo-cli -ac_name=THC importprivkey <THC WIF> "" true 0 212
for the last one. True/false is telling the daemon whether or not to rescan, so if you use true for all of them it may take a very long time.

my THC funds in my QT masternode wallet are good right?

no need for me to move them for the swap?

@Rockwolfe the qt wallet is no longer active for tx, only for creating your private keys

I need help to set up the wallet please. 
Got my priv key from old wallet, then for the KMD Ocean wallet, I try to run "START_THC.bat" but when the Komodo-qt window pops up, it disappears after a second or two. The last thing it says in the window is "Loading sapling parameters", then the window disappears.
Thought it was my antivirus or firewall blocking it but disabling those did not help
