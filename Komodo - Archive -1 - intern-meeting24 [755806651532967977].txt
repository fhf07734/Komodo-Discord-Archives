Hi Skywalker, regarding the exchange listing.
I am working with Komodo Platform and reached out to the team. It sounds like we need jump into a discovery call to go over some more specifics. Are you available this Tuesday or Wednesday?

@Jack. 

suggested edit:  
Hi Skywalker, regarding the exchange listing.
I reached out to the Komodo team and they expressed interest. The next step is to jump into a discovery call with you and go over specifics of what we're after. 
Which of these available meeting times works for you this week?  [MonthDay] [Timestart -Timestop] [Timezone prefer UTC]


[17-Sep-20 09:32 AM] Jack.#4200
Hey there wow that sounds cool but can you Give me some details pls. Where would we get listed? How big is the fee? Who do we talk to? And what would you need from me
And I'm not a official particl team member but I could arrange to be available


[17-Sep-20 09:38 AM] Jcharming#2693
- atomicDEX 
- either tech collab, co-marketing, or a modest fee (can be explained in a call with team) 
- We'll have a discovery call with the Komodo Team Marketing Director & Business Team 
-  We'll need to have the discovery call.


[17-Sep-20 09:45 AM] Jack.#4200
Would it be possible to you put me into contact with the official Particl team? We could have one official member on the discovery call including yourself. 

In the past we have listed project for free if they have core marketing but usually, we charge a modest fee.


[17-Sep-20 09:54 AM] Jack.#4200
Feeling more confident about this now. Thanks for the help guys 🤘

@Churro we found an atomic swap explanation with Gcharang. I forgot we had made this.

I can walk you guys through it today if it's unclear

it might seem confusing at first, but basically there are two suitcases (one from maker and one from taker) and then a public large chest.

2. Maker generates 'swap secret' for the public chest. Once the chest is closed it cannot be opened without having the 'swap secret'. He then puts KMD to a chest and locks it (and only the other party can now open the briefcase).
3. Taker takes his BTC and puts it to the other suitcase that is then locked and only the maker can open it. Then the suitcase goes to the large chest and now the entire chest is closed.
4. Maker can open the large chest with 'swap secret' and can now take his suitcase and open it.
5. Taker comes to the chest that has already been opened and takes the remaining suitcase

The whole point to understand (and what this tires to illustorate) is the curcial step #4 where the maker has to use the 'swap secret' to get what he wants, and by doing that he allows the Taker to come in (in step 5) and get his side of the trade.
