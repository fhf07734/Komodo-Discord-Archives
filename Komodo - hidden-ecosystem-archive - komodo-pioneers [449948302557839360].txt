[dscrdpioneers] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> have a look at html5 games on github.  plenty there.  html5 games are easy to work with - html5 game engines: https://github.com/collections/javascript-game-engines  phaser is good.

you use any of those game engines in a google search and " tutorial" or " sample" and there'll be plenty of stuff that has been started that can be modded no probs.

then if you want to go a bit more hardcore, there's unity3d.com and unreal engine.

[dscrdpioneers] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> so pick your genre, top down shooter, 1st person, 3rd person, platformer, infinite runner etc.  there's also a marketplace on unity3d for out-of-the-box simple games.  depending what the goal is - have a look at the unity assetstore https://assetstore.unity.com/categories/templates

IT Giant Fujitsu Is Launching a 'Ready-to-Go' Blockchain Service -...
Fujitsu has launched a new blockchain consultancy service it claims will deliver a minimum viable product in just five days.

[14-Jul-18 07:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdpioneers] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> ```prices for the service start at ‚Ç¨9,900 and will include everything from basic introductory lessons on blockchain technology to assessments of the proposed use case and the building of a prototype by day five.

From there, clients can choose to fork out more cash to have the product further developed or walk away with the work as it stands.```

You should restart every 4 hours or so


[25-Jul-18 12:03 PM] Solicitor Rick#8992
Thanks for the swift response! So from the look of it, it should run exactly as advertised on Raspbian. With the exception that I should probably set a cronjob or something to restart it every 4 hours. That sounds like a fun afternoon to me. Let's dig up a proper micro-SD card and give this a whirl.

[01-Aug-18 09:47 PM] CHMEX#0686
With Spread - difference between bid and ask. 
Additionaly you jist trade with a higher margin on your bob and instantly copy/ liquidate on a cex the delta is your profit.

Did you do a workshop before on getting komodo running on a RaspberryPi?


[29-Mar-19 12:48 AM] barv#0867
Yep. Actually BarterDEX but kind of the same procedure. If you run a full node, be sure to attach a harddrive though. bacause of the many read/writes

BarterDEX LP Workshop v2 - User Guide
This guide learns you how to install & use BarterDEX. Next to that, it shows you how to be a liquidity provider, using your laptop or Raspberry Pi. Previous Meetup event: https://www.meetup.com/blockbar/events/bwwqkpyxfbnc/

Thanks very much dear @CrisF and of course @barv for info

Cool. It's always fun to play around with the Rpi's üòÉ


[30-Mar-19 04:32 AM] CrisF#3405
They are setting things up to run on Rpis at the moment.  Would you mind if they contacted you if they have any questions @barv ?


[30-Mar-19 04:37 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
As far as I know BarterDEX does not require setting up Komodo. We want to set up Komodo with Marmara Stakebox project. @radix42 was very helpful. She gave the right hardware to setup. Before buying the hardware suggested by @radix42,  our team decided to give a last chance to docker.

Hi, i tried to follow the slides from @barv and @bartwr  but the process got stuck at getting the userpass. I got this error:i@spielerpi:~/SuperNET/iguana/dexscripts $ ./client &

Anyone a suggestion?

What happens if you leave it on? Does it continue? In that case: just wait a bit longer until the userpass shows up

[dscrdpioneers] <pioneer barv> Planned one üòÉ


[18-Jul-19 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdpioneers] <pioneer barv> Actually two. But number two is about proof of gameplay & chips. does that count?


[18-Jul-19 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdpioneers] <Audo> not sure, I think it would be second priority versus other meetups that are specifically about rebrand. Better to make the rebrand meetup first at least :)

Let me know when and I might book flights to come
