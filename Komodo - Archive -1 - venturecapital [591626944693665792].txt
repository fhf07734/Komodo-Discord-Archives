As some people know, on top of working as an Entrepreneur, I am now General Partner at Starchain.capital. I am convince that a successful ecosystem need outside money to grow. I will spend some time everyday here to help entrepreneurs that are looking to build projects on Komodo platform. We will also work on adding here other VC friends. Komodo has a great community and a great tech, let's push it. @Bitcoin Benny and I share the same vision. Cheers

@Fab√ò so what exactly is this channel for? Is it to find projects within the ecosystem which could use funding and leverage your position at starchain.capital and other vc to help them out?


[23-Jun-19 03:56 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Yep I thing the goals are #1 to provide support to whom has an idea and technical skills but never build a business from the ground up (growth plan, legal, marketing, financials, management) #2 provide feed back to whom needs financial support to build an mvp or to help scaling

Need to put my head around it but seems to be big


[30-Jun-19 07:31 AM] Fab√ò#8941
Raising money from LPs and deploying capital is very costly automation could lead to finance more projects and solve scalability issues. This is big


[30-Jun-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it allows to onboard new users in seconds, with a fully validated blockchain


[30-Jun-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
so speed of an API wallet like electrum, but the cryptographic proofs that is almost as good as a full node


[30-Jun-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
2GB+ of data needed reduced to 20kb


[30-Jun-19 07:36 AM] Fab√ò#8941
This is brillant congrats


[30-Jun-19 07:36 AM] Fab√ò#8941
How could we take it from here (building a mvp)?


[30-Jun-19 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to add nSPV support to an SPV wallet, and also make some small changes to the daemon to support it


[30-Jun-19 07:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Fab√ò try BreadWallet on your iOS or Android Wallet. There is a core library of that BreadWallet in C language open source, available on Github. It is very possible to upgrade that library to have nSPV supported. But that needs some C dev who's capable to understand that and nSPV requirements, and upgrade that code to make it nSPV supported.
Once it's supported all sorts of Mobile to Desktop nSPV supported applications can be built. The same exact lib can be then also be used for AtomicDEX in its backend.


[30-Jun-19 07:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
But, for that you have to make a team assembled who can do this task.


[30-Jun-19 07:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Read my few chat lines in #üé∞‚îÉask-jl777


[30-Jun-19 07:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it will clear you some things on it


[30-Jun-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not that much work given a dev who can update breadwallet


[30-Jun-19 07:40 AM] Fab√ò#8941
Used for AtomicDEX this is BIG @grewalsatinder


[30-Jun-19 07:40 AM] Fab√ò#8941
Well we need to showcase this


[30-Jun-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is an existing SPV wallet for zcash, that would speed things up


[30-Jun-19 07:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
True üôÇ


[30-Jun-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it does solve the problem of supporting millions of users


[30-Jun-19 07:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Fab√ò using that bread wallet lib is basically eliminate the need of setting up Electrum Servers, which also costs money and time to maintain, and also not as equals to the decentralisation as the actual peer to peer network of the blockchain itself. So, that's in my opinion is multiple times superior solution to build.


[30-Jun-19 07:41 AM] Fab√ò#8941
A platform need to allow Millions of users if not hundred of millions it is the only way to scale and to create a valuable ecosystem


[30-Jun-19 07:41 AM] Fab√ò#8941
To me that start with financing and basis financial tools üõ†


[30-Jun-19 07:42 AM] Fab√ò#8941
As we need to take care of the people that build this ecosystem


[30-Jun-19 07:42 AM] Fab√ò#8941
I am not a dev but I am committed to bring people in and partnerships


[30-Jun-19 07:42 AM] Fab√ò#8941
For that we gonna need docs and mvp


[30-Jun-19 07:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can help with project/product management regarding that breadwallet lib if you need help.
I can definitely help define the tasks and guide the devs who wants to pick this task.


[30-Jun-19 07:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I don't have to good grasp of C/C++, I just know what needs to be done where to go to get what a dev need to get things started with.


[30-Jun-19 07:44 AM] Fab√ò#8941
@jl777c good with that ?


[30-Jun-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
nSPV wallet wont be a direct revenue generator


[30-Jun-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
support for it would allow any ecosystem coin to ramp up to million(s) of users, just using its p2p network


[30-Jun-19 07:48 AM] Fab√ò#8941
Right this model I agreed won‚Äôt create direct revenue but will bring users and projects which impact the value of our ecosystem and bring inflation (versus other assets) which is a form of relative money creation (increase in purchase power)


[30-Jun-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
i think a proof of concept would start with an existing SPV wallet, add support for zcash protocol if it doesnt already have it, and then add the nSPV speedups


[30-Jun-19 07:50 AM] Fab√ò#8941
Amen


[30-Jun-19 07:50 AM] Fab√ò#8941
üôè


[30-Jun-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
the server side, we can just do on demand as it is just making some p2p message handler for existing rpc calls


[30-Jun-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it should be a month or two worth of work for an experienced dev.


[30-Jun-19 07:51 AM] Fab√ò#8941
Make sense

[30-Jun-19 07:53 AM] Fab√ò#8941
Copy that thanks JL


[30-Jun-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so we need an SPV wallet dev to customize breadwallet or equivalent


[30-Jun-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i can make sure the server side is done internally


[30-Jun-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
and somebody to manage the miniproject


[30-Jun-19 07:55 AM] Fab√ò#8941

@Fab√ò    Yes it has been awhile,  been just grinding away.  I believe I have found a way to create a asset backed stablecoin that doesn‚Äôt require much legally.  I believe it can help a lot of the areas we need to improve in,  I wrote a little bit about it in the jl777 channel.  I‚Äôll copypaste it over here.


[05-Jul-19 09:14 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
‚ÄúI have in mind using these tokens to represent warehouse receipts used to claim stored goods, specifically standardized commodities but it can and will be expanded to other goods as well.  If these tokens can be atomic swapped with coins like I described above ,  this can effectively solve liquidity issue with Atomicdex, as well as other benefits , in the form many additional chains added to the ecosystem to accommodate other interests ( a different chain with its own tokens for each country or city or warehouse location for instance ) .  Beyond stablecoins(warehouse receipts ),  many chains ( fees to Komodo ),  liquidity ( more things for KMD to trade against )  it provides the ecosystem with a form of ‚Äúgood‚Äù money ( Gresham law reference )  which can siphon from even other coins and their liquidity.‚Äù

I would like to discuss this with you and @ca333 @noashh#2802  @Bitcoin Benny  @jl777c and others.  I believe this could be a unicorn project.  However it is well beyond the scope of just one person,  there are some things technologically that need done ( and need done regardless of this project ) ,  on the business/legal end and physical end as well,  let alone if the parties involved wish to do a fundraising offering.   From my deep delve into the UCC and federal and state regulations over the last few days ,  it does not appear there are any legal quagmires like other types of stablecoins .  Being not a currency itself but rather a document of title and is not a security  as it is not an investment contract ( passes Howey) ,  it‚Äôs not algorithmically based as it is backed by collateral .  I am seeking out legal counsel on this .

we'd be willing to work with @polycryptoblog along these lines and incorporate into the LUMBER brand, but there isn't much point in discussing if the budget is pegged too low as well as a good understanding of regulatory/legal risk and the costs of maintaining a legal team.

Another venture I'd be willing to be a part of is "Project Marine Iguana"; i.e  establish a self-sustaining cryptomining farm using windpower on the island of Malta. The mined crypto could be distributed to coin hodlers and/or fiat reserves could be built up by reselling the electricity locally while building longterm strategic relationships in the region.

@polycryptoblog this is an interesting blurb


[06-Jul-19 06:29 AM] Fab√ò#8941
Would like to discuss this in more depth

@Lumbi Perhaps not exactly what you are talking about, but for large scale miners in the US this seems like the place to do it. I think they can handle up to 78,000 rigs.

@yorklab there are some similarities. it is amazing how efficient some of these generators have become. how cool would it be to have a virtual 'shareholders' meeting every 30 days to decide what alts to mine and putting it to a vote; or how much excess electricity was sold off for fiat dividends, etc. üòÉ

@Lumbi  Your coin nobody needs it ( IMHO ). Nobody mine it. Explorer has been down for several days. There are no buy orders on the exchange. There are some real achievements you can publish ?


[07-Jul-19 03:01 AM] SadykovT#2123
@Deleted User  I'll fix it. But I will still think so until I see some results.


[08-Jul-19 12:37 AM] Lumbi#8378
@SadykovT a new pool should be coming online around the 15th of july. https://lmbr.mcmpool.eu/ is operational. network activity can be tracked here https://explorer2.lumberscout.io/. Digital Price isn't the most active exchange, but there has been some activity https://digitalprice.io/order?url=lumber-btc . All in all perhaps not much compared to BTC, but where was BTC in 2009? üòâ   @Deleted User  we are in the process of re-writing the app to use cryptoconditions. The original app used centralized servers that were too costly to maintain for the time being.

Hej ! I been thinking about an idea, and as VC would be users, I post it here for feedback

Especially in early phases of projects, there is sometime a bit of a chicken and egg problem when it comes to funding. That is where ‚ÄúConditional Automatic Funding‚Äù (CAF) could kick in. Investors put some money on the table and verifiable objectives are set. The project automatically gets the money if it delivers, otherwise investors automatically get their money back.

Investors derisk their investment while scooping project earlier. The project boosts its credibility, feel secure and focus on what‚Äôs matter: delivering. It could be used for ‚Äúclassic‚Äù startup funding (e.g. with SAFE) or for crypto projects.

Seems to me (a non tech guy) a MVP based on Komodo, would be relatively ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to develop, possibly with a centralized oracle at first (like EY or PWC).

This would also get early stage projects and investors to connect with the Komodo ecosystem: that could make a lot of sense on a marketing perspective.

Funny, this is one of the reasons I am here. @skitout. 

I have an Automated Donation Engine, (ADE) that does what you were speaking about, and has a governance model.


[18-Oct-19 08:03 AM] skitout#8659
@Sully Interesting ! Where can we find more info about Automated Donation Engine ?


[19-Oct-19 03:11 AM] Sully#3164
Will be published this week. Finalizing website. Also publishing WP for the decentralized application that will be utilizing it.


[19-Oct-19 06:54 AM] skitout#8659
cool ! let me know when it will be out üôÇ


[07-Nov-19 06:35 PM] Sully#3164
@skitout. If you feel like checking it out, the ADE whitepaper is published to a placeholder website. There is also a WP for the project we are developing the ADE for, (CoolADE). Please go to fractaldynamics.io to see them.


[09-Nov-19 09:52 AM] skitout#8659
@Sully thx ! will check it !
