We are speaking to couple of interested private investors, for this reason we are extending tokensale to 2 weeks. Sale closes on 4th July. Discount will remain the same. Referral tokens will be distributed on 5th July. Bounty Tokens and other contest tokens will be distributed by @bountyhive and Stox as planned

[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> Welcome everyone  üñê


[23-Jun-18 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emmanuel> Yes, it works. üòÉ


[24-Jun-18 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <webworker01> Hello


[24-Jun-18 01:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <webworker01> Was wondering what amount of OOT is needed for free subscription? and does just holding keep the subscription?


[24-Jun-18 05:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> @webworker01  $60


[24-Jun-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> Yes, When our platform is UP and if your wallet have $60 during that time, we can consider free subscription


[24-Jun-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> Invite will be sent to you


[24-Jun-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> We already have registered users in our member's area


[24-Jun-18 05:58 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
is it really a "free subscription" if it requires $60? ü§î


[24-Jun-18 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> Free subscription is for people who participated in tokensale


[24-Jun-18 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> Members wont be paying us üòÉ


[24-Jun-18 06:12 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

#justSayin


[24-Jun-18 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> Members are holding $60 OOT in their wallet, once they get invite, register for one year subscription, they can sell


[24-Jun-18 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> So, Utrum is not charging OOT


[24-Jun-18 06:16 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I get the concept; I just don't get the bastardization of the word "free" is all


[24-Jun-18 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> It is not costing anything to members, so we call it free subscription


[24-Jun-18 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> May be you can come up with a better word genie üòÉ


[24-Jun-18 06:17 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
If I only have $30 and I have to buy another $30 to get the "free" thing, then the "free" thing costs $30


[24-Jun-18 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> Yes, but at the end you have your $60 with you


[24-Jun-18 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> You are not paying anything


[24-Jun-18 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> Its more like eligibility


[24-Jun-18 06:18 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Bonus subscription for all who hold more than $x"
would be more correct


[24-Jun-18 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> Well, the minimum was $60 in our tokensale, so went with that


[24-Jun-18 06:20 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
And that's not even me getting into the fact that the pseudo $ value relies on 3 separate markets to determine üòõ


[24-Jun-18 06:21 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
If I have $61 worth now and BTC plummets to $3k (giving me only $30.5), do I lose my "free" sub?


[24-Jun-18 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> Its related to OOT üòÉ


[24-Jun-18 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> We are pretty liberal with market fluctuations


[24-Jun-18 06:22 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
there's an OOT/USD market?


[24-Jun-18 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <OOT OOT> As far as I know everyone who participated in tokensale are elgiible as minimum purchase was $60


[24-Jun-18 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <webworker01> Does this require some type of registration? i just bought some OOT on barterdex without $60 minimum yesterday


[24-Jun-18 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <webworker01> so basically minimum is 500 oot to get membership, but can I simply just have 500 or need i sign up somewhere also?

[dscrdutrum] <benohanlon> FYI @everyone I am suggesting something for Komodo that you may want to have a say on because it could benefit. It's an idea for a 'brief and micro-bounties' community that would create a decentralized resource for our content, comms and marketing and bring it into line with Komodo's ecosystem. I've recorded a video of myself explaining it (not official KMD video just me talking!).

If you're interested please come and share your thoughts here and leave comments https://forum.komodoplatform.com/t/about-the-komodo-influencer-network-category/117. 

If this gains enough traction and you like the idea I can take this to Steve and JL777 and suggest we try it out. Please make your voice heard! 

P.S. if you just want the video it's here https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=O1LdWU1WEQo.

[13-Jul-18 04:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> It shouldn't be hard to implement in Agama as well. But we cannot make promises about when that will happen.

@goldenman


[26-Jul-18 04:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> @goldenman James is developing a long term solution, it's actually already coded, you can check the discussion yesterday at #crypto-conditions on the Komodo Discord. 
Meanwhile we're researching and developing intermediate solutions for the same problem, that don't require hard fork (inevitable in the middle/long term).


[26-Jul-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> The alpha wallet is already working, it just needs the new features added, you can check our Github.


[26-Jul-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> It requires a re-design too.


[26-Jul-18 04:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> Our web designer is working on it.

[dscrdutrum] <Da_Crypto_> Hi everyone, #Utrum is a decentralized reward platform which will provide cryptocurrency stakeholders an ecosystem where they can share information in earnest. The Utrum team understands that as new blockchain technologies are being developed, it is increasingly difficult for investors to intelligently and informatively find the best cryptocurrency investments in the industry.

[28-Nov-18 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab> I agree with Hold.


[28-Nov-18 09:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Jimm B.> What do you think about Freeze or Time lock?


[28-Nov-18 09:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Jimm B.> People will love utrums freeze featureüòú


[28-Nov-18 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Freeze and time lock are negative words üòÉ


[28-Nov-18 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> As mentioned by you @Jimm B. We are going with HOLD instead of HODL


[28-Nov-18 10:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> HOLD represents positivity and confidence üòÉ

[29-Nov-18 03:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <NatuMyers> I was told you're looking for volunteers (I help investors perform due diligence on projects)

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Hi @NatuMyers welcome


[29-Nov-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Hi @obattal try at coinexchange


[29-Nov-18 09:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> There are no restrictions at RightBTC

This should help Utrum. With fewer promoters for people to follow they will need some place to go to get their information.

SEC's Next Move: Social Media Influencers Who Promoted Crypto ICOs
The SEC is actively cracking down on crypto initial coin offering (ICO) projects and a top official said earlier this year that dozens of cases are pending.
https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/ZXlbOYQ1F5htnw1fkHdlDvD7ysIjfaEq-Fhl0SK_NoY/https/www.ccn.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Securities-and-Exchange-Commission.jpg


[03-Dec-18 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> True, Utrum must become a synonym of "asking the experts".


[03-Dec-18 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> And those experts come from the community.


[03-Dec-18 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> SEC is going after celebs , not analysts though


[03-Dec-18 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> SEC wants them to declare their earnings when they promoted


[03-Dec-18 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab> I think that's where they are starting because they are an easy target. They may be working their way down.


[03-Dec-18 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Anyway the celeb promotions are scammy üòÉ


[03-Dec-18 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> whoever pays more, they endorse them


[03-Dec-18 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab> Another interesting bit on that same article:
```Coinbase has been cautious in ensuring that a digital asset is not recognized as a security by the SEC because in a hypothetical case that an asset listed by an exchange is declared a security by the U.S. government, the exchange could be prosecuted for illicitly distributing unregistered securities.```
If Coinbase is listing ZEC that could bode well for KMD. Just as Bitcoin influences alts, Komodo can influence its asset chains.


[03-Dec-18 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Sure it does


[03-Dec-18 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> SEC is not clear with any laws. It's all bits and pieces and no one has clarity


[03-Dec-18 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Utrum being a Cayman Foundation, SEC laws are applicable for US projects specifically. We are safe there


[03-Dec-18 06:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Coinbase might not list KMD though as there is no registered entity behind it

Federal Court Rules Case in Favor of Crypto ICO Against SEC
Last week, the U.S. federal court ruled a case between the SEC and a crypto initial coin offering (ICO) project called Blockvest in favor of the project.

[03-Dec-18 06:34 AM] Sri#6686
Yes, that happens when you have an organization behind that project that is willing to take it to courts üòÉ


[03-Dec-18 06:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cryptoon> They are working on a foundation I think though


[03-Dec-18 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> That would be great news if they do it. Because of the SEC and DOJ, every crypto needs some kind of legal setup


[03-Dec-18 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> Yeah, it's based in Vietnam, last i heard.


[03-Dec-18 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Interesting choice of Jurisdiction, Malta would be great


[03-Dec-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab> Sounds like the foundation home based in Vietnam is related to RedFOX labs and Ben Fairbank.


[03-Dec-18 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Very much possible


[04-Dec-18 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Dec-18 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> We're putting a lot of love on this project, it will give fruits, believe me.


[04-Dec-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> Games are not part of the target market, i guess. But, who knows, that's up to the Utrum foundation to decide.


[04-Dec-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <obattal> Yeah


[04-Dec-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Dec-18 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> @obattal we would need first a relation between gaming and crypto reviews. Maybe gamefying parts of the platform? Hehe, i don't know. Everything is possible.

[dscrdutrum] <obattal> @Emman - DevOps  That's True üòÑ hope So

[04-Dec-18 02:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> By the way, gamefying parts of the platform was discussed last year, it's still a possibility.


[04-Dec-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <obattal> Hope so much Brother


[04-Dec-18 02:35 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> not sure about that, probably no 32 bit


[06-Dec-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> The 2 examples I'd look at and look at their successes are, O3 Mobile Wallet and Trust..  And I'd look at the APH wallet, bc in my opinion, it's the best looking wallet in crypto--even if the project has tanked....


[06-Dec-18 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> O3 started out just as a Neo wallet...
Then it was able to integrate a working Dex for Switcheo, in a matter of one or two weeks...
Now it is a wonderful app....
Should be a crypto project, in my opinion


[06-Dec-18 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> Trust---started off as an Ethereum wallet, for tokens, too.. Ran smoothly... Then CZ bought it... It looked just as good when it wasn't Binance's Wallet


[06-Dec-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> @Cruz Most wallets are using shapeshift, changelly


[06-Dec-18 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Project Lead> Did you check Exodus, I guess that's the best in my opinion


[06-Dec-18 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> I just meant, in my opinion for overall use, O3 & Trust have been the most successful---with the time they have had & what they've done with it. They seem like good models, or examples... And Aphelion, it just looks good, imo...


[06-Dec-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - DevOps> interesting


[06-Dec-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> This is the Dex integrated into O3

[06-Dec-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Cruz> That is damn impressive. 
It started out as a wallet, just for holding NEO...
Then it became the Switcheo DEX.. And they've upgraded it twice now.. They integrated it in a matter of weeks, if i remember right

I like the White/Blue

[dscrdutrum] <Cryptoon> alpha website done, ready for publication, not a working product?


[15-Apr-19 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Crumb> @10 do you realise that to have a product, you first need to make that product? sounds crazy, right?
on a more serious note. many projects begin with just a whitepaper and after ICO start actually making things. this might not be an ideal (classic model for new companies requires to have a product and/or customers first, before receiving funding), but nevertheless it is part of our new reality that there is a lag between making an investment and seeing (some) results


[15-Apr-19 01:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <10> @crumb It sounds crazy to invest tons of money in something that isn't created, see it delayed & the price drop what, 98%.. and almost a year later, no project


[15-Apr-19 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Crumb> i took part in ICO, i knew it is extremely risky


[15-Apr-19 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Crumb> investing *tons* of money into these kinds of projects is not a wise decision. risk management is important.


[15-Apr-19 04:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @10 Are you new to crowd funding and ICO investment. Seems like it. I would like to know, does utrum only lost its value or other projects too,because of bear.


[15-Apr-19 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @crumb in traditional modal, projects raise money from vc and then build product. Then launch. In crowd funding model, vc are replaced by common people.


[15-Apr-19 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Risk is always the same for both vc and common investors


[15-Apr-19 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> It's high risk, high reward


[15-Apr-19 04:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> But it's unfortunate that bear killed the value and momentum of many projects


[15-Apr-19 04:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> I agree, there is delay as we have to layoff staff to save money and keep project alive

[dscrdutrum] <Duck Tape> Hey guys. Whose idea was it to have 200 confirmations on Digital Price for OOT? The reason is obviously not security, utrum being a komodo chain.

[dscrdutrum] <Emman - Blockchain Dev> about this issue.


[16-Apr-19 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Duck Tape> I thought it was somehow one of you whose idea it was. To discourage arbitrage.  I will ask at DP.


[16-Apr-19 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Duck Tape> Still waiting for a small deposit of OOT. Something went wrong. Four days and still not fixed. I hate all centralized exchanges.

[dscrdutrum] <Emman - Blockchain Dev> oh, @Duck Tape they are working on the daemon, it's on maintenance right now.

[dscrdutrum] <Emman - Blockchain Dev> Meanwhile, there's always Coinexchange.io


[16-Apr-19 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Duck Tape> Price are too low at coinexchange.  I also wanted to trade it against KMD.


[16-Apr-19 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Duck Tape> Will the Alpha version of your platform soon be released?


[16-Apr-19 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - Blockchain Dev> it's almost ready, devs working on details


[16-Apr-19 09:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Emman - Blockchain Dev> if you're really into testing, you can participate in testing it #üî¨-testing


[16-Apr-19 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> They have doubts as we dont have working product, so they are playing wait and see


[19-Apr-19 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Now, when we release alpha, they will be confident to list us

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Lot of things will change when we release Alpha


[19-Apr-19 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We could find new VC, we could get listed on major exchanges, normal investors will feel confident to invest

Hi here :).

Our goal is to provide premium tools for coins listed on the platform. (Discord swapbot, twitter integration, public orders, wallet integration, API, custom templating, and many more).

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Locked funds are safe. When they get unlocked after time period, they will be sent to wallet address which is been used by you during the lock process. If you have used agama wallet to generate OOT address, then move your funds to new wallet address. Use Utrum Desktop or Web Wallet for generating new address.

How is Utrum Reputation Score (URS) Calculated?
URS is a dynamic score that is assigned to Utrum members based on their performance. URS will keep changing with the verdict received on posts for contributors and voters.

[dscrdutrum] <Smedley> The prediction feature looks interesting. How will it work?


[06-Jul-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @Smedley A trading analyst can make a prediction. He need to set price for the question " What will be the price of coin after 15 days". He needs to mention reason and can provide charts to support his prediction.


[06-Jul-19 02:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Members can vote on this prediction, if they agree or disagree with the prediction


[06-Jul-19 02:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> If analyst make a prediction for a coin ( example kmd), he will not be able to predict again until 15 days. He can predict other coins though.


[06-Jul-19 02:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We assign success rate to the analyst based on the prediction result. This is the metric you should look for to understand the capability of analyst along his Reputation Score


[06-Jul-19 02:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Reputation score is the result of verdict, how many members agrees with this post, be it a review, prediction, insight or report

Still finding gems in @utrumdotio beta, here you can sort coins by category (privacy, platform, gambling, dapps, etc), age, asset type, platform, country and product status. Here's the King, #Bitcoin in 10-11 years category, long live the King!

Hello guys. Did rightbtc delist Utrum? I can only access my OOT via the wallet of the old site. The new site doesn't have any OOT trading pairs

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Seems they dint update our wallet yet


[18-Jul-19 06:21 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
Ok thanks for the headsup. You can still withdraw Utrum from the old site though, so it's no big deal. Any remaining orders I had on the Utrum pair have been cancelled and the BTC is in the wallet of the new site, so it's fine.

Testing @utrumdotio again, here's a SWOT analysis of @PirateChain. I'm definitely a lover of ARRR but in making reviews it's important to be objective & understand where weaknesses are. Luckily many of these are already on Pirate's radar & progress is being made daily.

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Cryptocurrency is one of the highest risk markets in which to invest‚Ä¶and arguably the most accessible to anyone. With the increasing difficulty for investors to adequately distinguish between the good and the bad in crypto investing, many well-meaning investors have lost everything in their attempts at supporting the growth of this technology.

Utrum believes that by developing an Artificial Intelligence backed, a community-driven platform which rewards users for their help in reviewing, rating, analyzing and predicting crypto projects, assets, and teams, these problems can be solved. Through the use of blockchain, Utrum is creating an ecosystem of supportive and educational guidance for investors of all caliber, as well as a marketplace for projects and providers to showcase to a targeted investment-rich community. Utrum will also implement community-voted moderators whose job it is to help regulate and manage the ecosystem according to community governance.


[05-Aug-19 12:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Utrum  is poised and passionate about developing a powerful community platform for crypto projects, developers, analysts, newbies, and investors to gain access to quality information and reviews.

[dscrdutrum] <Emman - Devops> Dwy raised some interesting points but:
1) most people who should know about them already knew, so... the value of this is relative, and
2) he wrote that in the heat of the moment, and therefore not very clear.

[06-Sep-19 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Can you consider doing 3d/7d predictions?


[06-Sep-19 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I don't see 7d prediction on most alts, as realistic.


[06-Sep-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> To include a altcoin chart on 7D prediction, would prove futile. You're better off including a btc chart

[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> $177 prediction 
$170.40 currently
less than 5% deviation 

uh oh


[07-Sep-19 12:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @Privatoshi for now, it's 7 days for all coins. We will revisit this after few months


[07-Sep-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Let's say this prediction above ends up being a successful one. And he has 44% Rating. How is that a good thing?


[07-Sep-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> @Sri


[07-Sep-19 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Users rating others predictions, 7 days in advanced, seems highly difficth he to me. Most guys can't find basic support & basic ruesistance, on a chart.


[07-Sep-19 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> There are only 2 ways to do it.  What community thinks of it and what is the reality


[07-Sep-19 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So we are addressing both here using URS and Success Rate


[07-Sep-19 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> It is true not many can't read charts, but once we have a stronger community, this issue will be resolved


[07-Sep-19 01:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> URS is based on community verdict and Success rate is the result of prediction

[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Nice


[07-Sep-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> See the leaderboard


[07-Sep-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> U want those two numbers to be close


[07-Sep-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> essentially


[07-Sep-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> if it happens


[07-Sep-19 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> In the long run, it should be


[07-Sep-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Anyway user who made prediction should not lose heart, because his success rate speaks for himself


[07-Sep-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I played Cindicator and had a really good strike rate


[07-Sep-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> It will be the metric people look for


[07-Sep-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> But to ask for alts for 7 days out... with BTC @ 75% dominance


[07-Sep-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> It's difficult for anyone


[07-Sep-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> For now, it looks like that. We cant keep changing the whole process based on dominance üôÇ


[07-Sep-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> But I like the challenge


[07-Sep-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Based on low rate of success...yeah


[07-Sep-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yes, its possible to set predictions for 7 days, 15 days, 30 days so on


[07-Sep-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We also can change success rate deviation to 10% if everyone agrees


[07-Sep-19 01:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Is that 5% up or down?


[07-Sep-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> both up or down is considered as success


[07-Sep-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I'm gonna get a hit


[07-Sep-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> It was over a $10 prediction increase inyhno


[07-Sep-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I think


[07-Sep-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> It's moving up too


[07-Sep-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You should get 100% success


[07-Sep-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Sep-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Sep-19 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> My goal is to get very close


[07-Sep-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> 1-2%


[07-Sep-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You will, keep trying üôÇ


[07-Sep-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> 2 days left


[07-Sep-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> There are 2000 coins and you can make predict all of them


[07-Sep-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Fingers crossed, lets see if you hit 100%


[07-Sep-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> But coming up with charts on those


[07-Sep-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Bc not all alts go off of TA


[07-Sep-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> True


[07-Sep-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Some get FA pumps


[07-Sep-19 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You can always try


[07-Sep-19 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I can label the move up


[07-Sep-19 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> on a chart


[07-Sep-19 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> as FA


[07-Sep-19 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You can mention that in description and reason


[07-Sep-19 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> even though it might not make much TA sense


[07-Sep-19 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> some people mentioned FA in description and reason


[07-Sep-19 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> If it does do it, then why not


[07-Sep-19 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I stay away from broad terms


[07-Sep-19 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Specific reason  within this time frame


[07-Sep-19 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Can we wager UTRUM against another user?


[07-Sep-19 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> For a prediction


[07-Sep-19 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Desired by both parties


[07-Sep-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We thought 1 week is a reasonable time


[07-Sep-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Or maybe, maybe you can premine another coin, and we can buy it with Utrum. And use that coin, if using Utrum for that reason is not desireablen


[07-Sep-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Waging prediction is a good idea, we will think about it


[07-Sep-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763

[07-Sep-19 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I'm about to make history

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Few hours left GMT 00:00

[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I need Bitcoin to drop


[07-Sep-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Perfect


[07-Sep-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> It might be at 177 at 00:00

[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> @Sri


[08-Sep-19 03:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Can we place predictions, in BTC, not USD.

I've never used USD, in trading crypto.
BTC price is the real price.
USD price changes, every second


[08-Sep-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> ETH-BTC could be 0.017 today, but BTC $10K


[08-Sep-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yes its on task list, other user also asked


[08-Sep-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Ahhhhh thank you


[08-Sep-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Thank you so much


[08-Sep-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I'm sure u have plenty to do, already..


[08-Sep-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Well, I'm curious.


[08-Sep-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> indeed


[08-Sep-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> How is everything holding up?


[08-Sep-19 03:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Errors or little things


[08-Sep-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So far good, No major bugs, I would call it a big achievement


[08-Sep-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> The site looks great


[08-Sep-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I would as well


[08-Sep-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> No doubt


[08-Sep-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Except few css bugs, nothing major


[08-Sep-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Monumental for one man to do


[08-Sep-19 03:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We are a team üôÇ I m only the architect


[08-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Usually with new stuff, you have down time & adjustments


[08-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Things don't always go right


[08-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We planned it really well


[08-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Which is fine


[08-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> It looks like it


[08-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Jeez


[08-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Very nice rollout indeed


[08-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Utrum runs on 16 servers including blockchain, hold, rewards, explorers so on


[08-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> 16


[08-Sep-19 03:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> yeah can you believe it


[08-Sep-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Like VPS?


[08-Sep-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> 16


[08-Sep-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> dedicated servers 8 gb ones


[08-Sep-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> some are 4 gb ram


[08-Sep-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Thats good bc it keeps everything flowing nice


[08-Sep-19 03:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Everything is segmented


[08-Sep-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> True, that is why we never had a problem with hold rewards, content rewards and portal


[08-Sep-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Thanks to @Emman - Devops he did a good job


[08-Sep-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Too much, from one place, is not good


[08-Sep-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Planning


[08-Sep-19 03:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Is that expensive?


[08-Sep-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> For a new portal it is


[08-Sep-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> But we thought, we should run it in a professional way from day 1


[08-Sep-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> that is why none of our services went down


[08-Sep-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> That is true.


[08-Sep-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We just need some traction now


[08-Sep-19 03:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Better to maintain the status quo with everything


[08-Sep-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Not like these other suckers


[08-Sep-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Trade off usability for profits


[08-Sep-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Once we get some recognition, nothing will stop our growth


[08-Sep-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I know what you need


[08-Sep-19 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> A contest


[08-Sep-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Problem is this, we ran so many bounties and contests and it pulled our price so down, we dint recover yet


[08-Sep-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Top 4 closest predictions to price...
Big Pot.
And then advertise to bring your friends & you'll get referral rewards


[08-Sep-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Ask the community if they can donate funds


[08-Sep-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> I m scared of bounties now


[08-Sep-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> This is a contest on a working platfotm


[08-Sep-19 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> They will dump and dump and dump


[08-Sep-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> That requires users to interact


[08-Sep-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I said 4 winners


[08-Sep-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Just a contest


[08-Sep-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I'll buy some and donate


[08-Sep-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Every post is rewarded, what more you want üôÇ


[08-Sep-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> More yards


[08-Sep-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> users


[08-Sep-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> ok lets plan it


[08-Sep-19 03:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I can buy maybe 1000 Utrum and donate


[08-Sep-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Maybe more...


[08-Sep-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> Maybe others here will see value in it


[08-Sep-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Problem is not OOT, problem is very few buyers as we are not popular yet


[08-Sep-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> If someone dumps, that's fine.
I'll rebuy them and we will run the contest again.
and get more usres


[08-Sep-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> users


[08-Sep-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> The goal is more users


[08-Sep-19 03:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Ok plan it and let me know


[08-Sep-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I'm just trying to think of marketing


[08-Sep-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> I know they should want to be on Utrum with nothing


[08-Sep-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> I added you to ideas channel, you can post there


[08-Sep-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi> But I'm just trying to be creative


[08-Sep-19 03:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> others will give their opinion and we can act

Would a Dark Mode, Lite Mode, Blue Mode theme, be something we could look at, down the road?

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> yes


[10-Sep-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> themes like twitter is possible


[10-Sep-19 06:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Like some people don't have the best eyesight and need a dark theme

[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> @gigamesh What do u think of the portal?


[10-Sep-19 02:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Sri said he will address the dark theme etc, a little after some more important stuff first

[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> @Sri - Lead have u heard of them?


[10-Sep-19 03:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> no


[10-Sep-19 03:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> what projects compete with utrum?


[10-Sep-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> and why is it called utrum?


[10-Sep-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Cant just name one because every module we have is a different project


[10-Sep-19 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Its a combination of over 8 projects

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Our cryptos page is cmc, reviews is revain, prediction is cindicator, steemit - feed and content rewards, binance research - reports,  news - medium coin blogs, so on


[10-Sep-19 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> What does Utrum mean?

Utrum is the Latin term which means "whether", as in "or", and we chose this for a portal where members are voting and choosing between two opposing viewpoints..." whether this or that."
What is the significance of OOT?

Utrum is pronounced "Oothrum" in Latin, so we took the first three letters from this pronunciation, "OOT", for our Token symbol. However, for our project, Utrum is pronounced "You Trum" and OOT is pronounce exactly as it's spelled, "OOT"


[10-Sep-19 03:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I think we are better than all 8 combined.

Hey guys

[12-Sep-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Luke - DE Ambassador> hey guys. I am writing an article about utrum. can somebody explain in words whats the difference between a report and an insight?


[12-Sep-19 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Insight can be an article - research, opinion, code reviews or SWOT analysis


[12-Sep-19 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Report is more detailed analysis


[12-Sep-19 06:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Luke - DE Ambassador> ok


[12-Sep-19 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Reports can be like binance research, more detailed, covers every aspect of project


[13-Sep-19 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> Hi @Sri - Lead - i put up by last review on utrum and got a message saying it has to be moderated and checked if its original. It has been published elsewhere so will flag ur system. To be clear it is my review, but how will such conflicts be resolved in future.. on a case by case basis?


[13-Sep-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Mixic - RU Ambassador> I think it's just the usual protection against spam. It's okay.


[13-Sep-19 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @gigamesh yes, it's case by case. Moderators will look into it


[13-Sep-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ok thanks


[13-Sep-19 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> copy/pasting from the wordpress site was pretty easy. couple things were wonky and needed fixing but thats usually the case in these sorts of situations


[13-Sep-19 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> e.g. youtube vids never copy across well


[13-Sep-19 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> why cant I edit after submission @Sri - Lead ?


[13-Sep-19 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> It goes to blockchain


[13-Sep-19 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We can do it like steemit but for now, you cant edit


[13-Sep-19 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> can u show me the txid for my Loki review?


[13-Sep-19 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> or how can i find it?


[13-Sep-19 06:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yes, it appears after voting

[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> voting closed? why closed?


[13-Sep-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Voting is open only for 3 days


[13-Sep-19 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> for every post


[13-Sep-19 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> why?


[13-Sep-19 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Because the whole system is based on member voting and we cant keep it forever


[13-Sep-19 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Based on member voting, rewards and reputation are assigned


[13-Sep-19 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> this "voting" is not the  same as the moderator check, right?


[13-Sep-19 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> if yes why not 30 days?


[13-Sep-19 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> yes, its member voting


[13-Sep-19 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 30 days is too long for people to receive rewards and urs


[13-Sep-19 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> moderation is different, it only happens for 3 things


[13-Sep-19 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> copied content, flagged posts and spam


[13-Sep-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> so i publish... get rewards first 3 days... then what?


[13-Sep-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> nothing


[13-Sep-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> still rewarded or not?


[13-Sep-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ouch


[13-Sep-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Your post can be viewed forever but you wont receive rewards or reputation for that


[13-Sep-19 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> if it goes "viral" after 3 days i get nothing?


[13-Sep-19 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yeah nothing


[13-Sep-19 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> u dont think thats harsh?


[13-Sep-19 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> But you get more followers


[13-Sep-19 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> It means more votes for your next post


[13-Sep-19 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> There has to be some deadline and we chose 3 days


[13-Sep-19 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ok i didnt read ToS, do u plan on sharing ad revenue?


[13-Sep-19 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yes


[13-Sep-19 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> so i will b rewarded after 3 days? in future?


[13-Sep-19 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> for ad revenue?


[13-Sep-19 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We need to revisit that


[13-Sep-19 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> For now we thought 3 days is a good window because most people read it and vote it by then


[13-Sep-19 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> how did u arrive at  3 days and r u prepared to change this number thru community vote?


[13-Sep-19 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yes ofcourse


[13-Sep-19 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> If community thinks 3 days is very less, we can change it


[13-Sep-19 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> @Privatoshi - Ambassador im interested in ur input here


[13-Sep-19 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> But I bet everyone likes 3 days


[13-Sep-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> 3 is IMHO waaay too little


[13-Sep-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Reason, being rewards


[13-Sep-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> but maybe im missing something?


[13-Sep-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Imagine we have 1000 posts on portal per day


[13-Sep-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> then every one cant vote every post


[13-Sep-19 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> People are impatient giga


[13-Sep-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Initially I thought of 15 days


[13-Sep-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> if u tell them wait and get more money... they will wait


[13-Sep-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> in my experience


[13-Sep-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Once we grow, we go for community vote and decide then


[13-Sep-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ok, sounds good üëç


[13-Sep-19 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 3 days, 7 days, 15 days, 30 days


[13-Sep-19 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Let people choose


[13-Sep-19 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> i say x10


[13-Sep-19 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> ahahaha


[13-Sep-19 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You can vote when we do it


[13-Sep-19 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> it takes me more than 3 days to write the damn thing üòâ


[13-Sep-19 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> I understand, but trust me 3 days is more than enough


[13-Sep-19 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> when we have lot of posts per day


[13-Sep-19 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So, the logic here is get more followers


[13-Sep-19 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> > I understand, but trust me 3 days is more than enough


[13-Sep-19 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> if like twitter then yes


[13-Sep-19 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So your post gets into their feed, they vote


[13-Sep-19 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> but this is like medium as well?


[13-Sep-19 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yes its like medium


[13-Sep-19 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We have 4 different types of content so we need some uniformity so that we dont confuse members


[13-Sep-19 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> well then.. id like to hear other opinions on this... what say y'all?


[13-Sep-19 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> is 3 days enough?


[13-Sep-19 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> @Sri - Lead üòâ


[13-Sep-19 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @everyone


[13-Sep-19 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Ok I hit the panic button lol


[13-Sep-19 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Lets see


[13-Sep-19 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> cool, everybody pitch in


[13-Sep-19 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Are you comfortable with 3 day voting or do you wish to have 7 days, 15 days or 30 days?


[13-Sep-19 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <FtrSaroth> 7 days


[13-Sep-19 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Crypto Baggins> I feel like 7 is good


[13-Sep-19 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Jimm B.> 7üëç


[13-Sep-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ill settle for 7


[13-Sep-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> üòâ


[13-Sep-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We just got 3 votes


[13-Sep-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> in 30 secs


[13-Sep-19 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> we wait


[13-Sep-19 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> were u thinking of twitter when u picked 72 hours?


[13-Sep-19 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> did you calculated content reward supply?


[13-Sep-19 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @gigamesh It was 15 days at the start, but we changed it to 3 days


[13-Sep-19 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> why?


[13-Sep-19 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> I thought when there are lots of posts, no one will read the old ones


[13-Sep-19 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 3 days also let user login atleast once into the system üôÇ


[13-Sep-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> 3 is ideal to me, community is still tiny, we can't predict how many time consume the reward supply when we are very huge community


[13-Sep-19 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> @gigamesh what's up guys


[13-Sep-19 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @Zafer - TR Ambassador Its a good angle, we also need to think not to overpay


[13-Sep-19 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> This might cause more inflation


[13-Sep-19 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> 7 days, take the rewards down 30%


[13-Sep-19 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> even over generous right now


[13-Sep-19 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> across the board


[13-Sep-19 07:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I like that too


[13-Sep-19 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> reward  early users


[13-Sep-19 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Zafer - TR Ambassador> yeah I said like bitcoin's early mining days


[13-Sep-19 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763

[13-Sep-19 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Do you know anything about it?


[13-Sep-19 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Or should we start from scratch


[13-Sep-19 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> there's a Predictions section (last question b4 i read all the docs).... most of those predictions are for events more than 3 days in the future. how r ppl rewarded for being right?


[13-Sep-19 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> 7 days


[13-Sep-19 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> You get a 5% variance from the projected price and actual price


[13-Sep-19 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> U hit that, you are successful


[13-Sep-19 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @gigamesh We are paying rewards based on member vote, same like rest


[13-Sep-19 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Later, we consider only success rate

[13-Sep-19 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab - Ambassador> I think it's too early to make changes. If you keep making changes people will get confused. As @Sri said, let's give it more time then vote on a permanent change.


[13-Sep-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab - Ambassador> @gigamesh yes, just trying to do my part to contribute.


[13-Sep-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> absolutely. i was only curious about why 3 days was regarded optimal


[13-Sep-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763

How is Utrum Reputation Score (URS) calculated?
URS is a dynamic score that is assigned to Utrum members based on their performance. URS will keep changing with the verdict received on posts for contributors and voters.

[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> @Privatoshi - Ambassador actually yes I do, more than I thought I would @Sri - Lead the only 2 methods I am aware of which can prevent a Sybil attack (assuming that is the correct term in this context) is 1. Fee-for-service, or 2. a proof-of-work, or some other non-trivial  proof ..... are the counter-measures u mentioned above enough to stop a determined attacker?


[13-Sep-19 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> For this system, for the portal, these safeguards are very strong.

[13-Sep-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> @gigamesh You might bypass our antispam and create accounts


[13-Sep-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> But you need to enter your 2fa code for every post and vote you make


[13-Sep-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Hahaha


[13-Sep-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> so thats 1000 times you need to enter


[13-Sep-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Too many clicks


[13-Sep-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> unprofitable


[13-Sep-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> üòÇ


[13-Sep-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We setup a slider for that reason üôÇ


[13-Sep-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Voting is a slider, bots cant do it


[13-Sep-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> üçø üçø


[13-Sep-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We spent enough time to think about all possible scenarios @gigamesh


[13-Sep-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So if a bot has to be successful, it needs to do 3 things right


[13-Sep-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 1. Bypass our antispam


[13-Sep-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 2. Auth code for post and vote


[13-Sep-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 3. Slider for voting


[13-Sep-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Its slide and click


[13-Sep-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> ‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è‚òùÔ∏è


[13-Sep-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> If we ever see a bot succeeded with all these 3, we come up with a 4


[13-Sep-19 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Let there be no doubt about that


[13-Sep-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Fee to signup is not effective method according to me, see  Steemit  for example


[13-Sep-19 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Most products will only have 1, at most 2 safeguards, Utrum has 3. 
KuCoin has 3.


[13-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> EOS requires a fee, to create a wallet


[13-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Same lead developer


[13-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Steemit got more bots than normal users


[13-Sep-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I think that dissuades even some potential good contributor's from joining


[13-Sep-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Basic methods usually work best. 
No different here.


[13-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 2fa and slider are new things for Utrum.  No social network uses it


[13-Sep-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763

[13-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> For Beta, I think we already have a lot of things


[13-Sep-19 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We just need users and content now


[13-Sep-19 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> I agree.
Need feedback from a variety of users


[13-Sep-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> What happens when the 100M rewards have been fully spent? (sry if WP covers this, reading now)


[13-Sep-19 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> i.e. will there be more than 216M one day?


[13-Sep-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ``Contributors are rewarded OOT tokens whenever a user rates content within a period of 30 days. This allows articles or other content provided by a contributor enough time to be discovered and given adequate assessment by the community. This also promotes an active, healthy community ecosystem by motivating both contributor and curator.
``


[13-Sep-19 01:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ok so used to be 30


[13-Sep-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> can I see my **MVA**?


[13-Sep-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> was there a trustee election recently, how dod it go?


[13-Sep-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Gigamesh with good questions


[13-Sep-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> MVA calculations look complex


[13-Sep-19 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> the paper mentions MVA and coefficients and the rating system. Just wondering if I can see my own MVA rating or coefficient or whatever


[13-Sep-19 10:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> also i read in the wp about the 12 trustees and how another 6 would be voted every 6 months or something. Has that happened, how did it go?


[14-Sep-19 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Elections will be held in Jan 2020, once we have enough members


[14-Sep-19 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Mva not implemented yet


[14-Sep-19 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> We need more content


[14-Sep-19 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Right now, it's 5 posts a day


[14-Sep-19 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Ad revenue and other revenue sources will be rotated so it will never end


[14-Sep-19 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> I think we won't spend more than 64 million from the 108 million reserve


[14-Sep-19 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> @gigamesh thx for coming here


[15-Sep-19 01:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> sure, np. i like the incentive scheme and will use the platform + stash away some OOT


[15-Sep-19 01:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> scheme lol.... design, layout, platform


[15-Sep-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> model.... that's the one


[15-Sep-19 01:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> incentive model


[15-Sep-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> i guess scheme sounds sinister lol


[15-Sep-19 01:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> altho is still correct in the context of incentives


[15-Sep-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> Maybe if we are talking specifically using the oxford dictionary.


[15-Sep-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> But we know words take on new meanings, and then those definitions change.


[15-Sep-19 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> schematic and scheme are two different words


[15-Sep-19 02:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> A schematic is a way something is set up
A scheme is a plan, usually sinister.

[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> Hi guys! Hope all is well with all of you. Well it's the start of another week and lots to look forward to. I've been pretty quiet about the Utrum review/interview I'm putting together but that's going to change in the coming days. I'd like to see adoption and new users coming in. I think its important to emphasize that simply participating can earn rewards. It's fun, engaging and rewarding. I'm posting this message also because I'd like to here from YOU, the users. **If any of you would like to post comments on your experiences and thoughts about the Utrum platform there's a good chance I might quote you in the review**. It would add to the review very well and show the community interaction. You can post comments here, or DM me, or catch me on twitter. I'd love to hear from you,  thank you!

[dscrdutrum] <YorkLab - Ambassador> You can go through some of my tweets to get some quotes, but I‚Äôll give you this also. I'm sure you'll find better, so I'm OK if don't find anything useful from me. üòÄ 

Although I‚Äôve been involved with Utrum from the beginning, I had no idea how useful it would be until the portal launched. The two areas I never gave any thought to before is News and Events. You get news for any coin of your choosing; or if you can simply choose to follow all cryptocurrency news in general and never miss a thing. I find myself going there every day now. The same goes for the Events section; it amazes to see all that is happening virtually every day in the crypto world. Lastly, voting can be addictive! You can vote on anybody‚Äôs post, and it‚Äôs so simple; just one click and you‚Äôre done. Then on top of that you get paid for voting! Making money with just a few mouse clicks is a no brainer to me.

[dscrdutrum] <Privatoshi - Ambassador> @Sri 
 @gigamesh & I talked and I think we were both in agreement, that a two option,  dark UI & light UI would address everyone's needs. So I made something for you, as an example.
As always, these are only suggestions, not complaints. And the examples are an attempt at trying to be constructive, instead of just coming here and saying we want this or that ... ‚ù§

[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> well there were warnings üôÇ

[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> cool, ppls still learning the system


[26-Sep-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Its good they make mistake for the first time, they wont forget the second time


[26-Sep-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Its a new concept, so it takes time for people to understand

[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Cant edit, Voting


[26-Sep-19 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> I wonder if you could hold the article for 30 mins on your server before committing to blockchain and allow 30 mins of editing. somertimes things look diff when u upload. i cant recall is there a Preview button?


[26-Sep-19 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> a preview button would help. one of my reviews i copy pasted from a different website looked good in the editing window but after uploading some of the images ended up being huge.


[26-Sep-19 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Aron‚ÄúXuanLeeeeee‚ÄúGoldberg> I had already written privately with sri, for the next time I know


[26-Sep-19 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Aron‚ÄúXuanLeeeeee‚ÄúGoldberg> we learn together every day and grow up together


[26-Sep-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yes, Preview will be a good option, will add to task list


[26-Sep-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> @Sri - Lead as u were telling me in DM dPoW notarizes the articles/reviews/predictions we write to the Bitcoin blockchain. Is it human readable on the BTC chain (i.e. ASCII text?)


[26-Sep-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> (thought id share this question with the crowd)


[26-Sep-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> No


[26-Sep-19 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Content is in the block, blocks are notarized to KMD and then to BTC


[26-Sep-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> so on the utrum explorer my review is humam readable (http/ascii) https://explorer.utrum.io/opreturn/api/v1/blockchain/579744-044382


[26-Sep-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Its possible to view it on Utrum explorer


[26-Sep-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> when that tx is notarized to KMD does it still have that data?


[26-Sep-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> It does


[26-Sep-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> and so when it goes to BTC does it still have that http/ascii data?


[26-Sep-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Technically it is. I should speak to emman to get more details


[26-Sep-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> that would b great if u could confirm


[26-Sep-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> will do


[26-Sep-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> thx! would b cool if it does still look like that


[26-Sep-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> on the BTC chain


[26-Sep-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yeah but thing is this, we can track only from OOT - KMD


[26-Sep-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> we cant track from KMD - BTC


[26-Sep-19 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> OOT cant but KMD presumably can yes?


[26-Sep-19 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> KMD does notarize every chain they have to BTC


[26-Sep-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So cant track OOT there


[26-Sep-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> is there such a thing as a dPoW explorer?


[26-Sep-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> But can be synced


[26-Sep-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> would b useful


[26-Sep-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So I assume you cant see the ascii on kmd or btc


[26-Sep-19 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Only possible on OOT explorer

Komodo Platform (dPoW) Notarization Statistics - Season 3
Statistics for the Komodo Platform's dPOW notarization of KMD and supported blockchains.


[26-Sep-19 03:24 AM] gcharang#6833
the data flowing from OOT -> KMD and KMD -> BTC
are just blockhashes signed by Notary nodes
so on the BTC chain, there will be a "Proof" of existence of a certain post in the OOT blockchain at a certain time
it guarantees that the posts haven't been tampered after the notarization time (unless the BTC blockchain has also been tampered)


[26-Sep-19 03:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Thanks for the clarification charan


[26-Sep-19 03:28 AM] gcharang#6833
no problem!


[26-Sep-19 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> so BTC proves the authenticity but does not serve as a backup in the event of catastrophic blockchain attack


[26-Sep-19 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> i suppose keeping local backups of the OOT chain data is enough


[26-Sep-19 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> esp since BTC can validate it so to speak


[26-Sep-19 03:36 AM] gcharang#6833
all the nodes running the OOT blockchain will have a copy
even if a 51% attack is done, only the txns/b;ocks that are yet to be notarized are vulnerable
once a txn/block is notarized, unless someone hacks all the nodes and deletes the blockchain, there is no problem


[26-Sep-19 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> thanks

[26-Sep-19 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> @Sri - Lead about predictions.  I notice there r no time frames. would time frames be useful?


[26-Sep-19 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> 7 days is time frame


[26-Sep-19 09:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> You mean like 7 days, 15 days, 30 days?


[26-Sep-19 09:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> yeah


[26-Sep-19 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ok so predictions are for 7 days?


[26-Sep-19 09:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> so like if BTC is 9000 and i predict 7500. after 2 days it hits 7500, but then goes back to 10 k on day 7. was i right or wrong?


[26-Sep-19 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> i assume i am right but maybe being able to pick a time frame is useful?


[26-Sep-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> The time frame is 7 days


[26-Sep-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> So you are wrong


[26-Sep-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ooohhh


[26-Sep-19 09:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> System only checks the price for 7 days


[26-Sep-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> ooohh that means we def need time periods imo


[26-Sep-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> my BTC 7300 is happening


[26-Sep-19 09:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> dunno where itll be in a week


[26-Sep-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Yeah not just you, the rule is same for everyone


[26-Sep-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Everyone is predicting for 7 days


[26-Sep-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> sure


[26-Sep-19 09:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> fair enough


[26-Sep-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Problem with providing time frame - voting is for 5 days now, rewards are paid based on 5 day voting


[26-Sep-19 09:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> After few months, we plan to change prediction rewards based on success rate, then we can provide time frame option - 7 days, 15 days, 30 days


[26-Sep-19 09:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Now we are paying everyone irrelevant of success rate just to encourage them


[26-Sep-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> Voting becomes important as we grow, if many people agree with prediction, then most likely people will buy or sell based on it


[26-Sep-19 09:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <Sri - Lead> That is the power of community predictions


[26-Sep-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdutrum] <gigamesh> thanks for explaining
