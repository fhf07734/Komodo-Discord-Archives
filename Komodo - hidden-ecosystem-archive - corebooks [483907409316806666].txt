i'll be an active member from now on, and get in touch soon to make the first blockchains a success, also i would like to send some mockups of business ideas that could help to monetize komodo and attract more developers and capital, as the way i see it, if we bet in komodo we need to help in any way we can to be the best option for dapps

i have been hacked before, so blockchain, decentralization and security it's a big deal for me, i will be happy to bring anything to the table if it could help other startups avoid that situation

Hi, i'm the CEO of an innovation agency in M√©xico, we build and invest in high tech startups around the world, and offer software and hardware development services, i've been working in fintech for some years now, and with new blockchain startups in the rise we found komodo as the best option for dapps and smart contracts

are you building your blockchain by yourselves?


[31-Aug-18 08:20 AM] PTYX#6840
or do you need blockchain as a service?

We have some internal projects, and we are helping some of our customers to build their dapps for both private and government sectors
