Is it possible to create an dico similar to the EOS ico?


[20-Oct-18 02:19 PM] Alice#9607
Over a certain timeframe coins can be contributed to a pot. When the time is over a fixed amount of coins get distributed to all contributors to the pot proportionally.

via dico, the coins are transfered when the swap is done

@jl777c Are there code samples how to implement this?

there is a dico repo somewhere, but i dont remember exactly where

Maybe you can time lock them and use a CC to identify belonging to a certain address so even though the receiver doesn't get them right away, they know those coins are scheduled to be delivered to them.


[21-Oct-18 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
would require to make such a CC and enable arbitrary destination addresses


[21-Oct-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
not impossible

The dico-app is here https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e

I'd like to configure the dicoapp for a new token. @ca333, I see you configured DSEC in https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/commit/45dbb79127d86e65dd98a935194e52a9e7b5b358#diff-7b7bc9b49494840e8a390b095d1fcb78.  What is the pubkey that you configured here?

Hi @bartwr 
Still need @ca333 to confirm but I think that is the key you needed to be able to receive the coin.
You can get your public key by calling this api (https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/barterDEX-API.html#passphrase)
P/S: Please use `develop` branch for latest code and feel free open new issue if you want to support

On `develop` the command `yarn install` does not work, because some dependencies are not for node 9.11.2 (the version mentioned in the README.md). If I set node 10 instead & then `yarn install`, the installation of dependencies works. Though starting the app gives JavaScript console errors. Because I cannot run the app in `develop`, but can run the `master`, I now test the master branch, fyi


[11-Nov-18 11:41 PM] namhoang28#4328
I've updated all dependencies to the newest version in last week. Now you need node > 10 to run dICO app. I suggest using node v10.13.0 since I use it in my laptop.
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dicoapp-e/blob/develop/package.json#L278
And there are also some people have problem with marketmaker app in dICO repo. Please try to replace it with latest version here before you run it:
https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/releases/tag/v1.0.942
The application should run normally after that
Let me know if you still get any problem
I will update document in this week. It needs a clear instruction¬†guide

[12-Nov-18 12:28 AM] bartwr#6773
Apart from running the `develop` branch of the dicoapp-e repo, I have an other question. I want to offer a coin in exchange for BTC or KMD. The coin at the top is the coin that can be bought. Right now the balance of the offered coin is 0. What do I have to do to have a balance here?

I think the answer is something like this:

- Make sure that the electrum server `electrum1.cipig.net` can find liquidity for coin 'X'. As soon as there's liquidity, the amount of tokens for 'X' goes from 0 to a higher amount. From that moment it's possible to buy available tokens via BTC/KMD using the dICO-app.

Is my assumption above correct?


[12-Nov-18 06:45 PM] ca333#0333
@namhoang28 @bartwr - that pubkey is the bob-pubkey! You need to set up a bob from which the price gets fetched explicitly - doing it based on market-offering can lead to unpleasant situations (underbidding you with "empty" orders, etc.)

[29-Nov-18 01:21 PM] bartwr#6773
fyi I have the dico-app 'master' branch running well. Tested it with KMD/[coin] & BTC/[coin] swaps. Works great.

I've seen the new `develop` branch as well - this one looks better than the `master` & has lots of improvements. Can't make it run locally yet, will test later on.

Anyhow. Just saying that the dico-app does what it should do. Nice.

Hi, guys! 
could I issue tokens without max count limit? 
and manage tokens creation based on payed commitments to clients?


[17-Dec-18 05:17 AM] jl777c#5810
there is not really a max, it is more a function of initial supply + lifetime mining rewards


[17-Dec-18 05:23 AM] gcharang#6833
I don't know your exact purpose, but there is on-chain token creation available on any asset-chain built using komodo. It's numbers are virtually limitless as `1 base-token = 10^8 on-chain tokens` https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/contracts/tokens/introduction.html


[17-Dec-18 06:38 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@gcharang
I meant a assetchain with dynamic coins supply.
But is talking about some another entity named "on-chain tokens"?


[17-Dec-18 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
@Nick Bk (YAF.fy) the coins must be created by some mechanism... or you want anybody to be able to create more coins at anytime?


[17-Dec-18 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
or some special user?


[17-Dec-18 06:56 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@jl777c
I would like issue coins as far as new orders arrives. It will be presale campaign of the real world product


[17-Dec-18 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, but what blockchain method validates that a new order arrived?


[17-Dec-18 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
some data entry person enters a web form to issue 1 million coins?


[17-Dec-18 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
do you see the problem?


[17-Dec-18 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
you can preissue a large amount of coins and then burn the excess afterwards


[17-Dec-18 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
but unless there is a secure method to create new coins, this new method to create coins wont be secure


[17-Dec-18 07:03 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
bitcoin transaction to crowdsale address


[17-Dec-18 07:06 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
That seems to me as something that would create a huge inflationary value issue without a cap somewhere


[17-Dec-18 07:06 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
so it will be ico, with fixed token price, but tokens count will be incremental


[17-Dec-18 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
why not wait until ICO is over to create the chain?


[17-Dec-18 07:08 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@jl777c
I want fair dICO


[17-Dec-18 07:08 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
and do not store balances anywhere besides blockchain


[17-Dec-18 07:09 AM] jl777c#5810
then preissue max, burn unsold


[17-Dec-18 07:10 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
I want timeless tokens issue, but controlled by clients payments


[17-Dec-18 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
this is not a built in function, you would need to do a merkle proof against a trusted source of BTC merkle roots and implement a way to create coins based on this


[17-Dec-18 07:15 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
ps: it should be like crowdsale on omnilayer


[17-Dec-18 07:20 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@jl777c
it should be done like proof of burn (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_burn) but tomy address, I think it is done already by someone


[17-Dec-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
who?


[17-Dec-18 07:23 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
omnicoin(mastercoin) has that functional


[17-Dec-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not done by me, seems gateways CC is the closest


[17-Dec-18 07:24 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
but its dex is bitcoin based, so it very slow


[17-Dec-18 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
and omni is build on top of bitcoin and has bitcoind accessible, doing it cross chain is an entirely different thing


[17-Dec-18 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
and much more difficult


[17-Dec-18 07:25 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
I understand it
could we reuse some of its code in komodo?


[17-Dec-18 07:27 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
it has some kind proof, that btc transaction is done, and then coins issued (maybe I mistaked, because issue additional omnilayer coins is simple op-return trick)


[17-Dec-18 07:28 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
but they declared two kinds of ico, and second one creates coins on behalf of transaction to some address


[17-Dec-18 07:29 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
it should be simpler that atomic swap used in barterdex exchange


[17-Dec-18 07:31 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Not sure how a system that's essentially atomic swap *plus* mining *plus* other stuff could be "simpler" than atomic swap alone


[17-Dec-18 07:31 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
what about this kind of solution:
coins created like coinbase mined in block, and appears on input addresses of transactions in that block.. something like that


[17-Dec-18 07:32 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
so its a kind of PoS mechanism


[17-Dec-18 07:32 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402

{Reactions}
üòÅ 

[17-Dec-18 07:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
for it to be PoS, there has to be an S
since S is created on-demand in your proposal, it's not really akin that


[17-Dec-18 07:35 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
no matter how to call it, but mechanism is very similar, and I think could be reused


[17-Dec-18 07:35 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
basically, as I see it, you'd have to combine mm and komodod into 1 creature


[17-Dec-18 07:38 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
count of coins mined in PoS will depend on count of transactions in block, but not on count of utxo in whole chain.. (but I am not fully familiar with PoS algorithm)


[17-Dec-18 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
you want to accept bitcoin


[17-Dec-18 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
which means either all nodes need to run a bitcoin node (impractical) or you use cross chain proofs


[17-Dec-18 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
additionally the cross chain proofs need to be used to issue new coins


[17-Dec-18 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
gateways CC does most of this, but it uses the locked coins that are only released when valid proofs are submitted


[17-Dec-18 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is blockchain enforced as to freely movable coins, as the locked coins are locked until a valid cross chain proof is submitted


[17-Dec-18 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
but this requires a source of bitcoin merkleroots


[17-Dec-18 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the cross chain burn protocol could be modified to do a one way coin create, but still a source of bitcoin merkle roots are needed and this change needs to be made at the core level


[17-Dec-18 07:42 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
mechanics aside, for a second, and going back to my inflation thought...
If your total sale = 5BTC in value, what stops BuyerX from dumping 5BTC and instantly doubling the supply and cutting everyone else's value instantly in half?


[17-Dec-18 07:45 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@jl777c
how is "locked coins" prepaired transaction stored? is it stored on mempool? we could also store "virtually locked coins" of second one chain and issue it in next block..


[17-Dec-18 07:46 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
I am became a guarantee of that chain capitalisation, not much different with fixed supply


[17-Dec-18 07:47 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
your BTC is double, that has no impact on investors and your CoinX will have it's own market/value that wouldn't be tied to BTC 1:1

[17-Dec-18 07:50 AM] Alright#0419
What is the problem with premining a very large amount of coins, selling what you're able to sell then burning the rest?


[17-Dec-18 07:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`but btc is pulled out from market`
in the 5+5 situation that I'm asking about, 10 BTC is meaningless in the BTC market, whereas doubling CoinX supply is meaningful
even at 10x, 100 BTC is fairly meaningless to the BTC market


[17-Dec-18 07:51 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402

[17-Dec-18 07:51 AM] Alright#0419

@ComputerGenie
yes I will create a new money, and it will backed by trust in future product fabrication, if I do it , the price of tokens up, if not, its goes down.


[17-Dec-18 07:53 AM] Alright#0419
simply creating more than you would ever possibly be able to sell and keeping them locked up tight seems the easiest solution


[17-Dec-18 07:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`backed by trust in future` a promise is not value, so you're still not addressing the fact that every investor prior to that comparative "whale" would have their value halved


[17-Dec-18 07:54 AM] Alright#0419
Genie has a very good point

sounds like fiat with extra steps


[17-Dec-18 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
I already wrote the solution


[17-Dec-18 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
but I have no interest to spend time to implement as simply issuing more and burned at the end of ICO is the simple solution


[17-Dec-18 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
in either case, people need to trust the issuer for the coins/dilution


[17-Dec-18 07:56 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@ComputerGenie
Trust is only makes value for any money, and cryptocurrency not exception.
In my case I am trying to nominate product price 1-to-1 with coin, in case of standard ICO product has variable price in coins


[17-Dec-18 07:56 AM] Alright#0419
He wants an ICO that never ends from what I understand @jl777c


[17-Dec-18 07:57 AM] Alright#0419
which again, @Nick Bk (YAF.fy) doesn't make sense unless existing coin holders are receiving the BTC directly


[17-Dec-18 07:58 AM] Alright#0419
Nick, if you actually want to do it, I can explain how to create an assetchain that allows you to create coins at will. Warning you though, it's not simple *at all*


[17-Dec-18 08:00 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
In standard ICO you nominate a COMPANY with X coins (max supply), I want to nominate a PRODUCTS with unlimited supply, only restricted by count of clients orders


[17-Dec-18 08:01 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@Alright
It will be cool


[17-Dec-18 08:02 AM] Alright#0419
You can do it via momom and the burn contract. You need to notarize a new fungible chain then transfer coins from it


[17-Dec-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
then what I wrote about the one way cross chain import is what is needed to be done


[17-Dec-18 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC -> newchain


[17-Dec-18 08:03 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@jl777c
I dont need a scam time limited ICO and then burn and forget coins... I want continuesly grow it


[17-Dec-18 08:03 AM] Alright#0419
you realize that each additional investor dilutes the previous investors' coins?

[17-Dec-18 08:06 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`you realize that each additional investor dilutes the previous investors' coins?` <- exactly what I was trying to say


[17-Dec-18 08:07 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@Alright
if value of produced (also in future)  items not reduces, then whole capitalisation grows 1-to-1 with coins supply
and you could exchange items and reflect it on chain


[17-Dec-18 08:09 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`if value of produced (also in future) items not reduces`
So you're saying you will have the capacity to instantly produce orders on demand at a rate of 1:1? What if your production rate is 10 widgets per day and I order 10k?


[17-Dec-18 08:10 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@ComputerGenie
eventually production rate should achieve demand
if not, the price will drop


[17-Dec-18 08:10 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
it is futures contract

if your investors can trust you enough to be able to print coins at will, they should be able to trust you enough with a large amount of coins that should never really come into circulation

@Alright
ok, will make some research and decide


[17-Dec-18 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
premine more coins than you could ever possibly sell, lock them up in a few multisig addresses


[17-Dec-18 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
That's all you really need to do. The momom thing I mentioned wasn't intended to be used as a way to print coins at will, it's just a consequence of how it works that it's possible


[17-Dec-18 09:37 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
@Alright
Am I right?
I should make new assetchain by deploying couple of notary nodes, and then issue assets on that chain, like in NXT but with some magic coin conditions contract?


[17-Dec-18 09:38 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
Where is that contract executed, or it is like plugin for client node?


[17-Dec-18 09:40 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
Is any client, who would like to trade on barterdex should has that plugin installed, or it is propagated somehow..?


[17-Dec-18 09:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
YOu just need some noary nodes of your own yes ... then crate a NEW assetchain in the same cluster with the amount of coins you want... then migrate them to the otehr chain.. and kill the chain you created.


[17-Dec-18 09:47 AM] Deleted User#0000

basically you create a new blockchain every time you ant more coins

then send them from that blockchain to the main one.


[17-Dec-18 10:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
there is probably easier ways ... like you can write a custom consensus rule that a particular key can just crate imprt coins without a valid MoMoM hash.

I don't understand how coins could be migrated to another chain if we have a fixed amount of supply..
So there is some constant variable, but not fully constant as is ))
Looks like a PoS scam..


[17-Dec-18 10:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
lol ... its not a constant supply ... you said you wanted to create unlimited coins whenever you like this is how you can do it


[17-Dec-18 10:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
For out project there are 25 notary nodes who all contreol the keys that make the process possible... so they al need tpo decide together to invent coins ...


[17-Dec-18 10:50 AM] Nick Bk (YAF.fy)#1402
but when I created asset chain, should I set max supply constant?

@Nick Bk (YAF.fy)  this post might explain migrations for you - http://rant.cryptocartography.io/tokens-without-borders-migration/

It is basically a way to allow chains within the same cluster to be fungible. It only works if you have the migrations CC contract enabled on your asset chains, and the source/destination chain has the same ccid (i.e. are on the same cluster of chains).

5% comes from UTXO existing.  Just the existence of having a UTXO with >10 KMD entitles it to 5% per year after approx 1 hour.    The UTXO when spent then claims this reward, it's part of the blockchain rules (consensus) which every node can see and verify.

[16-May-19 01:54 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I'm just asking because there are 2 very interesting projects that could launch later this year (maybe) and they need wide distribution of coins, they seem perfect targets to propose to use dICO.  Unfortunately neither of them is Bitcoin-based, so I think they will need to wait for mm2.0 and a custom integration.


[16-May-19 02:03 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
Do you know if there been any data analysis about coin distribution with the 5 dICO that have been done? One of the dICO selling points was a wider distribution because whales can't buy most tokens at once. I think having data to back this claim would be very useful


[17-May-19 11:51 AM] bartwr#6773
@KomodoWorld All transaction data should be available in the blockchain of the 'dICO coin'. Check the blockchain explorer of this specific coin during the time of the dICO to get data that you can analyse.


[17-May-19 11:53 AM] bartwr#6773
Would be nice if there was a graphical tool of course, but I don't think it exists right now.


[17-May-19 12:00 PM] bartwr#6773
Also. Any team that launches a coin could help rewriting the dICO app, so that it's using the new mm2. It shouldn't be too difficult. (The mm2 is still in alpha right now. Later this year it is fully usable I believe).

Here's the Github repo: https://github.com/particle4dev/dicoapp-e I could help if there're questions for customizing or rewriting to mm2

Somebody was asking a out mm2 whale resistance compared to mm1.

Where it was a technical "thing" in mm1 it can also be restrictive in mm2 with a flag set of "max per swap per pubkey".

Slightly different mechanism to perform resistance.  Can be gamed if a whale wanted to participate with 1000 instances perhaps.

@KomodoWorld I think you asked a cpl weeks ago


[22-Jun-19 01:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it is highly resistant to the non-technical whale

but if a whale has technical skills too, well,  they can dominate any online sales process,but such techie-whales are very very rare

I know this isn't really a dICO, but there's a swiss company hoping to run an ICO adhering to KYC regulation, and have a few thousand dollars to put into a good ICO dashboard. I want to support komodo/the community so if it's possible to do (not really decentralized), would anyone be willing to give a quote? 
Here are the requirements;
Presale of NFT indicating a set SuperNode, which will receive a % of bought back tokens quarterly.
Main sale of regular currency.
Competitive supernodes: quarterly top 10 holders are locked in for next quarter, receiving same benefits as set Supernodes.

Their main application is built on HyperLedger, and the main use of the token will be purchase of their services. 

If this is possible, please send any quote you have üòÑ Thanks in advance, and I hope I can inject a bit of support to the Komodo community if possible. (Don't undersell yourself, and give as realistic a quote as possible).
