[discord] <SHossain> Hello!


[11-Jun-18 02:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Jcharming> @jl777c Thank you for the invite and link, checking out the resources here to answer some of my questions about the development of a poker platform https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1KT6WCRRhA13xDlKehNiBK93GQR1gQa2R


[11-Jun-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Jcharming> If there are other resources I'd be happy to have them I'm likely going to be doing a piece on Komodo and it's aspirations to release a decentralized poker platform this quarter.  ty


[11-Jun-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jl777> wait wait! nobody said this quarter!!


[11-Jun-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jl777> it is still in development without any completion dates given at all by the dev team


[11-Jun-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Jcharming> Clarification, I'll likely be doing a piece on Komodo's aspirations to release a poker platform down the road in its future.  I will publish it this quarter, and had not intended to give any information as to a release date unless I were to discover it from the team working on it.


[11-Jun-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763

[11-Jun-18 02:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> aha ok, mis parsed what you wrote yes this is the proof of concept for solving a very difficult decentralization problem


[11-Jun-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> all the needed pieces are almost here, so we can start putting it together and finding out what needs to be fixed, then once the cli version is working stable, we can have the GUI built on top. so any end user solution is  a ways out


[11-Jun-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Jcharming> I assume you are the lead dev for the Komodo platform project?


[11-Jun-18 02:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> but even with a cli version, it proves that such probelems can be solved, even with realtime response requirements

[11-Jun-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Jcharming> I see, good to meet you.  I've been following the kmd project for the last 2 quarters and it has been showing up with a higher frequency than usual in my news aggregate sweeps.


[11-Jun-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Jcharming> ty for the link


[11-Jun-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> we have been at this for longer than most and finally all the pieces are coming together, even age-old dPoW is now a timely thing to have


[11-Jun-18 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Jcharming> Very cool, would you be willing to be reached out to here if I wanted to get more in depth information on the KMD project?  
For some background of why I'm asking, I'm a contributor on a few servers, a couple of which are sizable.  I run a daily newsletter publish and I've received a lot of questions about KMD tech when I was posting news information about kmdplatform these last 2 quarters (especially as I was covering the dICO releases).  My subjective take away is that there is substantial interest in the project, however the technical density doesn't translate well.  I'd love to formulate a more digestible understanding for myself, after which I'd be willing to share it out in my other publishes.


[11-Jun-18 02:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> sure, here or KMD discord, I am online a lot and accessible


[11-Jun-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> CHIPS is more a usecase of the advanced KMD tech


[11-Jun-18 02:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Jcharming> Do you have a link to the KMD discord that I can have access to as well? Then I can keep questions pertinent to both projects in the appropriate channels so others can benefit from anything discorded as well.  Or just to simply not clog things up, unnecessarily.

[11-Jun-18 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> I asked for a jl777 channel created in the technology section


[11-Jun-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Jcharming> Thank you.


[11-Jun-18 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> we are just starting the migration from slack


[11-Jun-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Jcharming> That's excellent thank you again.  I'll reach out to you in the coming months. Again, thank you for taking the time to answer some questions.


[11-Jun-18 02:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> feel free to post questions, whenever. best to ask just a few at a time, instead of a wall of text. usually the answers to the questions end up changing the followups you want to ask anyway


[11-Jun-18 02:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Jcharming> Thank you I will, and we are in complete agreement about the last part of that statement. lol


[11-Jun-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> I have used the simplest available solutions for the various KMD aspects, but it all ends up being a relatively complex system, even if it is built from "simple" things like SPV and checkpoints


[11-Jun-18 03:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Jcharming> And that makes complete sense to me, many of the projects that I review have shared similar sentiments, and they aren't developing a multi-chain platforms, or end-to-end blockchain services, or decentralized exchanges.  I can only imagine that the size of the system in a project like this only deepens the complexity.  Which also makes sense, as that result is what I have experienced.  It's reflected in both my own understanding coming into this project and starting research on it, and that of many other people that who have asked me questions about it after reading recent news exerts.   

I'd imagine the lack of 'digestibility' is what has even kept me away for a while, as KMD isn't a new name in the space.  It's just well known as 'complicated'. lol


[11-Jun-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> We are here to make the complicated simple 😄

[11-Jun-18 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <barthegabi> Why channel discord and not slack?


[11-Jun-18 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> KMD is moving away from slack


[12-Jun-18 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763

[12-Jun-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <ph03nix> good riddance

[12-Jun-18 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Mark81> Oh man! Moving away from slack causes me more grief than this bear market.


[12-Jun-18 01:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Robert Naus> So all the channels will move from slack to discord? Is that an improvement?


[12-Jun-18 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> it is an improvement for retrieving older messages


[12-Jun-18 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe slack can live on via the bot relays

[12-Jun-18 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Robert Naus> Well obviously since local governments totally fucked up online poker. Most countries u can only play on domestic version of the platform/app so the players pool is limited. Times of Pokerstars being available to anyone are long gone. Not sure how this gonna work though, u need dedicated servers so how u gonna decentralized that?


[12-Jun-18 02:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> anyone can be a dealer


[12-Jun-18 03:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Robert Naus> Look the dealer is RNG machine that needs to be fully independent sort of..u can’t just have it run it by anyone lol


[12-Jun-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> actually CHIPS design allows this


[12-Jun-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> there is a math paper that describes


[12-Jun-18 03:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> dealer has no advantage over the players, his role is to provide a connection point for the table


[12-Jun-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> notary nodes will run a blinds service, essentially just a set of random numbers, but they wont even know what hand it is for


[12-Jun-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> MofN players are needed to decode a specific card


[12-Jun-18 03:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> so as long as there are VPS providers in a non-hostile jurisdiction, dealer nodes (tables) can be created for games to be played


[12-Jun-18 03:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> each dealer will set the table configuration and players can decide to play or not

[discord] <jorian> PANGEA whitepaper
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/455737840668770315/456036359870611457/Unsolicited_PANGEA_WP.pdf


[12-Jun-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Robert Naus> Interesting, we should get Doug Polk onboard he has large following on YouTube regarding poker and crypto. Whoever is working on this could contact him,maybe he could help spread the word?


[12-Jun-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> He’s been quiet for a while now because of the world series of poker


[12-Jun-18 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> focus went from crypto to poker it seems


[12-Jun-18 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> we had a working system a couple years ago but we needed LN type of tech for the realtime betting and that is fine for using MofN multisig, but still has the problem of all the losing nodes rage quitting and the winner not able to collect. so we needed to wait for CC (enhanced cryptoconditions ) to be ready to be able to blockchain enforce payouts


[12-Jun-18 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> yesterday I saw the first CC cross chain contract tx, but still there are some  consensus issues, so likely a few more months before we have all the ingredients needed


[12-Jun-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <iMyloMylo> 😄 rage quit


[12-Jun-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> who is using matterbridge?  and bridging it to chips?
gonna be harder to @ mention someone, need to send a carrier pigeon


[12-Jun-18 03:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Robert Naus> @Matterbridge-Chips yeah maybe after that it’s still early anyways


[12-Jun-18 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <ph03nix> a truly decentralized game of poker is huge, it sets the stage for many other games of skill
if you play poker online you are dealing with centralized poker (they wouldn't cheat you, would they?)


[12-Jun-18 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> truly decentralized poker is one of the hardest problems to solve


[12-Jun-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> and yes, once we solve that, then basically any decentralization problem will be easier to solve than poker


[12-Jun-18 09:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <DirkR> loool ..hahaha - Cheers guys!  🏄


[13-Jun-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Robert Naus> @ph03nix poker site makes money by collecting rake from pots or entry fee to tournaments. So, the more volume the more money they make. Cheating is negative EV. People cheating, using bots and collusion is a different thing, nothing to do with the site.


[13-Jun-18 02:27 AM] jl777c#5810
yes and the dealer nodes that are good at setting up collusion free games will end up with more repeat players


[13-Jun-18 02:27 AM] jl777c#5810
dealer node can set their rake on a per table basis


[13-Jun-18 02:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> but aren't bots something that pokerstars and others are fighting heavily? since for the recreational player, it affects the game a lot, i.e., the recs lose because of them and then leave to never come back


[13-Jun-18 02:34 AM] jl777c#5810
true, but notbeing centralized site the bots would specifically need to join a dealer's table node


[13-Jun-18 02:35 AM] jl777c#5810
so how will the bot maker find out about a specific dealer's table? and is there enough action to warrant the effort of deplooying a bot?


[13-Jun-18 02:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i think if we see bots, it will only be after a critical mass of succes sis achieved


[13-Jun-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> true


[13-Jun-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> is it going to be possible to index all open poker tables?


[13-Jun-18 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> joinable, that is


[13-Jun-18 02:42 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be like barterDEX netids, just less organized


[13-Jun-18 02:42 AM] jl777c#5810
post ip/port for table and people can join


[13-Jun-18 02:42 AM] jl777c#5810
of course we will add a way to post to a "lobby" for available tables, but no requirement that the lobby needs to be used


[13-Jun-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> cool


[13-Jun-18 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> yes, the possibility would be nice


[13-Jun-18 02:43 AM] jl777c#5810
more like friday nite poker at bobs


[13-Jun-18 03:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Robert Naus> It’s cool idea but been playing for all my adult life both live and online, I can tell you that poker players are extremely cautious and they won’t just play on some random node unless they fully trust it’s safe and secure from cheating. I don’t know, how do you convince them or how transparent is the process and can u observe the random deal etc. I am@not expert on technology but I am expert on poker I played as pro many years and dealt in both in casino and private games.


[13-Jun-18 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> good question, the answer to that needs to be spread very clear


[13-Jun-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> I think  the question is will the other players trust your table that you run? All the code is open source but if a table is full of colluding players, no amount of tech will solve that. The dealers that can create tables without colluders will have an advantage


[13-Jun-18 03:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> all the nodes get all the encrypted data and after a hand it can be decrypted to verify it is valid


[13-Jun-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> M players would have to collude to break the MofN encryption, with M set to be N/2+1


[13-Jun-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> but from what I know in poker, just having two players colluding can influence the outcome significantly by their betting/folding without needing to break the encryption


[13-Jun-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> so more than half. if you run a 6-player table, that means 4 need to collude to break encryption; the other 2 will notice that quite fast and will leave the table


[13-Jun-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> yes, i did that too with friends. you can't stop that


[13-Jun-18 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> yes such tables wont be popular at all. the most popular dealers will have a mix of human players and not bots but also not 100% pros either


[13-Jun-18 03:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> this is more a social problem and I dont see any magic tech that prevents  2 players from skyping privately their hole cards


[13-Jun-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> no. maybe a reputation system that only allows reputable players


[13-Jun-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> we can make the tech that enables blockchain enforced poker rules and cryptographically verifiable decks


[13-Jun-18 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> leaves the question: how do you measure reputation


[13-Jun-18 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> i think it needs to start with people playing with people they know, from that a reputation system can be created over time


[13-Jun-18 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> coinpoker has a justice system. haven't looked at it closely


[13-Jun-18 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> true


[13-Jun-18 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> but outside of MofN collusion, the CHIPS wont enable any cheating that cant already be done


[13-Jun-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> I assume there will be service providers eventually to provide a reputation, or maybe something like VRSC can be used


[13-Jun-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> CHIPS will create the tech that allows anybody to setup a fair poker table


[13-Jun-18 03:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> just like barterDEX allows anybody to be a bob


[13-Jun-18 03:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> given a DB of hand history of all the players, it should be possible to get a pretty good indication of which pubkeys are honest and which ones are not


[13-Jun-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> hmm yes, but you can always change pubkeys


[13-Jun-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> but I think the best bot detector is the poker pro


[13-Jun-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> true


[13-Jun-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> a fresh pubkey becomes a newbie


[13-Jun-18 03:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> dont trust newbies

[discord] <jl777c> the primary value a dealer might provide a table is bot detection and that could justify a higher rake


[13-Jun-18 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> but really all this is getting way ahead of things. Once there is a large enough pool of players, reputation system, hand histories, it seems that this is a solvable matter. We still need to get the blockchain enforced payout to work. Making it so only the blockchain is holding table funds makes it trustless for the most important part


[13-Jun-18 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> dealers wont have the real funds, just CHIPS satoshis being LN back and forth, so maybe a dishonest dealer can run off with 0.1 CHIPS, we ignore such silly dealers


[13-Jun-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Robert Naus> I see , so basically you start as a private friendly game and build your reputation and eventually people will trust you and play, it’s a long process that will take years, but it may work at the end.


[13-Jun-18 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> gaining trust in the online poker community is going to be a marathon anyways


[13-Jun-18 03:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Robert Naus> Eventually you get like 100x if not 1000x of nodes running games and u can have very large players pool, especially if you able to somehow show all the nodes running and players playing so there is a large selection of games


[13-Jun-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Robert Naus> The fact that anyone can play from anywhere in the world is the major selling point, as this has been nearly impossible lately and will be totally shot down soon


[13-Jun-18 03:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> yes. anyone can be a dealer, that's very cool


[13-Jun-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> dealers that choose to publish their tables will be able to be seen by all the network


[13-Jun-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> so we get public tables and private tables


[13-Jun-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> totally decentralized


[13-Jun-18 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> seems a good solution


[13-Jun-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> and of course this will be a years long process


[13-Jun-18 03:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> maybe some dealers invest money to jump start things


[13-Jun-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> or maybe some smaller online poker company.


[13-Jun-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> regardless of the details of how things propagate, CHIPS is the coin


[13-Jun-18 03:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> also poker is just one usecase, most other games can also be supported and that is where i expect a fair amount of third party solutions


[13-Jun-18 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> exactly why i created #pangea-poker , because i think you said this before: any game that uses a deterministically determined result, can be used as an application in the BET platform, right?


[13-Jun-18 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> yes


[13-Jun-18 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> roullete, slot machines, etc. entire casino could be decentralized


[13-Jun-18 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> maybe CHIPS are casino chips, not just poker chips


[13-Jun-18 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <helios> why not starting project with simply game (roulette) and for the future biuld an entire casino


[13-Jun-18 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> because solving decentralized poker is much more difficult and the idea is to make sure we can solve any decentralization problem. solving poker is a good indication we did. solving roullete, not so much


[13-Jun-18 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> also I have no desire to build a casino, but rather build the tools that allow others to build their casinos


[13-Jun-18 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <helios> good idea


[13-Jun-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> Expect a dICO soon for the first truly decentralized casino


[13-Jun-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> as a technology provider, our role is to provide the tech (with reference implementations)


[13-Jun-18 04:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> but let others make the money creating end user solutions


[13-Jun-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <helios> do you have an idea for the mainnet release? When the mining is stopping (only 9k coin for mining) an event?


[13-Jun-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> testing hasn't even started


[13-Jun-18 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> i think it's fair to say it's not gonna happen in 2018


[13-Jun-18 05:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> mining will take a long time to fuly stop. halvings go on until 1 satoshi


[13-Jun-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <helios> we hope testnet on 2018

[14-Jun-18 08:16 AM] Mark81#4505
Just read posts of colluding players. I thought simpless solution for that would be that player would not be allowed to choose on what table he sits. So it would be randomly selected and if player leaves table by trying to get into another table there would be precaution note  in next table for other players of  player that suffles between tables.


[14-Jun-18 08:17 AM] Mark81#4505
@jl777c


[14-Jun-18 08:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> if the playerpool is small you are still very likely to end up on a table with someone you know, especially when multitabling


[14-Jun-18 09:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <allbits> I think the main point is that in this decentralized technology it is up to dealers to innovate ways to make their tables more safe. And it is up to players to decide which solutions they prefer. There may emerge solutions that nobody has thought before. That is what is so powerful about offering a platform like this - it allows endless experimentation and innovation.


[14-Jun-18 10:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> certainly randomly assigning playrs to tables is one way, but it wont really work until there are a lot of players. also if bots somehow invade, then 90% of players can be bots. I think ultimately it will take human expert judgment to identify bots. if we get bots that play in a way that cant be differentiated from human play, then, well it passes the turing test so it deserves a seat at the table

Game Theory question about segmented staking
Game Theory question about segmented staking


[15-Jun-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> it has nothing to do with CHIPS, but it would be a game where the goal is to maximize the efficiency of your coins via clever allocation across the segments


[15-Jun-18 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> if we can get more than a few people interested, we can start a new PoS chain


[15-Jun-18 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> for the game


[15-Jun-18 02:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> do i see similarities to notary mining here?


[15-Jun-18 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> not really as there are no limits on staking, other than min utxo age


[15-Jun-18 02:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> 64 is the same number as number of notaries though, there is that


[15-Jun-18 02:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> each of the 64 segments are a separate battle for staking, but after 128 seconds all segments are eligible


[15-Jun-18 02:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> so the optimal allocation is to find all the segments with significantly less than average coins so it gets disproportionate staking


[15-Jun-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> however, everybody likes free money so any segid that is significantly easy should get more coins added. that is the game


[15-Jun-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> multiplayer and runs in parallel


[15-Jun-18 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> we would need a tool that displays the total coins by segid


[15-Jun-18 02:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> what's the reason for trying this? a better PoS?


[15-Jun-18 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
I think it makes it so majority stake isnt enough for 51%


[15-Jun-18 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe 67% stake is needed, not sure the exact threshold


[15-Jun-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> i'll definitely help out


[15-Jun-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> maybe we need to create a channel and get people who want to help in there


[15-Jun-18 02:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> and spread it in komodo discord?


[15-Jun-18 03:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> since it is a game, I thought of CHIPS. we can promote free coins and a game/competition


[15-Jun-18 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <crumb> can i be of any help if i'm not a coder?


[15-Jun-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> if you can send funds to addresses you can play the allocation game


[15-Jun-18 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> basically the funds in each segid is your position and the game is to get a disproportionate return


[15-Jun-18 03:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> form example, let us say the 90% stake holder is lazy and just has it all in one address


[15-Jun-18 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> and the 10% holder is more active and spreads his 10% across all the 64 segids. since 63/64 of the time the 10% stake holder is unopposed, he will win a disproportionate number of blocks, possible 3x or more than what he should get


[15-Jun-18 03:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <crumb> good to know, that i'd be able to help a bit! 
are we going to do it with chips or will there be a custom token for this specific purpose? and if new, how will it be initially distributed? faucet?


[15-Jun-18 03:49 AM] actionslacks#4072
airdrop?


[15-Jun-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Alright> Maybe put this on hold until VRSC ac_eras is implemented into Komodo. First era is POW for distribution, rest is solely POS


[15-Jun-18 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Alright> or well you could create it using VRSC's daemon right now maybe?


[15-Jun-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> I was thinking of creating CHIPS64 a 100% PoS assetchain and then when we have enough participants to distribute it


[15-Jun-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> I will just need to add staking for all addresses in the wallet feature first, but i think getting enough participants will take longer


[15-Jun-18 05:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the goal of CHIPS64 is to find the best staking strategies, so it is best for people to start with the same amount


[15-Jun-18 06:33 AM] Gateway#3763

[discord] <Hegelian> How did CHIPS launch? Looks like almost all of it has been mined already. Was it an airdrop to BTC holders?


[20-Jun-18 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <passcombo> no airdrop - simply mining


[20-Jun-18 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <passcombo> many people joined mining quickly - that's why most are already done


[20-Jun-18 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763

[discord] <passcombo> well can you prove that you are sure not 1 prson have example 5 mln BTC ? 😛


[20-Jun-18 03:55 AM] jl777c#5810
highly unlikely, it has been mined for about a year. SuperNET also mined and only managed to get about 2 million during the early days


[20-Jun-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <passcombo> and why it's worrying if true?


[20-Jun-18 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <passcombo> even if that was teh case it could be either positive or negative - depoending on timing. For example if very few people got Chips then the price could go up easy. But it's not going up that easy by itself, so my guess it's quite distributed. OR at least market manipualtors does not own too many.

[20-Jun-18 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Hegelian> Wow, top 100 addresses have all the CHIPS


[20-Jun-18 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Hegelian> 97% of the CHIPS


[20-Jun-18 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <Hegelian> So does mining continue now or is it just dpow?


[20-Jun-18 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> mining is for fractional CHIPS,maybe soon CPU mining is possible again

[discord] <jl777c> CHIPS LN network


[21-Jun-18 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> we can create this starting very soon. I want to get some CHIPS LN nodes live and funded so we can offer using CHIPS as micropayments


[21-Jun-18 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> it would also mean to port all the existing LN gui and tools over onto the CHIPS network


[21-Jun-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> bounties will be made available for creation of such. current codebase should mostly work with LN after the recent updates


[21-Jun-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> i think we need LN GUI, LN explorer equivalent, network visualizer, etc.


[21-Jun-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> anybody wants to take the lead on this?


[21-Jun-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> if we also ran low margin CHIPS/KMD and other pairs on barterDEX, that would allow conversion to and from CHIPS


[21-Jun-18 05:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> @jl777c I'll try to bite on LN stuff, since I might need to get my hands dirty with LN stuff this way or another in coming days.
If you already know some LN GUI and LN which might have caught your attention and you liked, please let me know.
I'll be just doing google search on all that, since I never took interest in segwit and LN stuff.

[21-Jun-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> will also be asking for help from other communities and see if I get some refernces to good open source projects for these.
I'm sure they will also be very happy helping since most of them are maximalist on bitcoin and segwit stuff... lol 😄


[21-Jun-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> basically I want CHIPS to have all the best LN solutions all live working, funded, etc. combined with active marketmakers it can allow people to get LN experience without risking BTC coins, plus BTC txfees are still needed to do the channel creation and that can take a while. with CHIPS it happens quite quickly


[21-Jun-18 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> So I envision the chips website to have a very easy way to get up and running with a CHIPS LN wallet in addition to Agama, a way to get a channel established and payment sent and received


[21-Jun-18 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> the LN will be used for the betting,so we need to get smart and experienced with all the LN aspects


[21-Jun-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> agree


[21-Jun-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> for CHIPS website me and @jorian decided that for the start we'll just make simple HTML static website and host it soon.
I'm just waiting for the website content data and then I'll create the website using that.


[21-Jun-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> we can for sure include the how to of LN stuff in there.


[21-Jun-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> and all this can happen starting now so it is all in place when the games code is into testing. now we got momom working, we are down to the poker state machine completion and LN integrations with the final custom CC poker eval function and it will all be a fully working system. I realized that our LN experience is lacking, especially about the latest tools


[21-Jun-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> it could be that a small amount of customization is needed to make it use CHIPS


[21-Jun-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> agree

[21-Jun-18 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <xRobeSx> I see a lot of the software connects with LND, but CHIPS will be using  c-lightning, right @jl777c ?


[21-Jun-18 06:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <xRobeSx> some of the repos say its for  LND with support for  c-lightning coming soon


[21-Jun-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> I guess CHIPS can also use LND 🤔


[21-Jun-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> LND works with `bitcoind`


[21-Jun-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> if that's how it is then LND must work with CHIPS too


[21-Jun-18 06:41 AM] xRobeSx#5136
yea i guess you're right @grewalsatinder . I'm not sure its been tested at all though


[21-Jun-18 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> > `lnd` has several pluggable back-end chain services including `btcd` (a full-node), `bitcoind`, and `neutrino` (a new experimental light client).


[21-Jun-18 06:41 AM] xRobeSx#5136
i'm not sure the changes james made to c-lightnign, but they might need to be changed to LND as well

[discord] <jl777c> what i mean is LTC must have LN wallets, etc. customized for LTC. you can see how they changed from BTC to LTC


[21-Jun-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> just do the same but instead of "LTC" use "CHIPS"


[21-Jun-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> run my lightningd from my lightning repo, no need to mess with the daemon, there is already a CHIPS customized version, in my repo


[21-Jun-18 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> so in the above chart, the litcoind is chipsd, the lnd/c-lightning is my variant of lightning


[21-Jun-18 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> the wallet and other apps are what we need converted to use CHIPS lightning, it could be automatically working as i think the rpc port is the same


[21-Jun-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <grewalsatinder> clear 👍


[21-Jun-18 08:06 AM] radix42#3743
@grewalsatinder I was just thinking at last nights Boulder Blockchain Meetup that yeah we need LN for kmd/asset chains!


[21-Jun-18 08:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> we already have it for CHIPS, so a set of low margin market makers for the other coins to CHIPS will be a way

an email I just got, looks like you guys are in another race. lol


[22-Jun-18 01:34 PM] Alright#0419
Is CoinPoker still "semi-decentralized"? Fairly sure it's just an online poker site that uses their coin as betting chips


[22-Jun-18 01:34 PM] Alright#0419
ie, a central exchange


[22-Jun-18 01:35 PM] Alright#0419
Their marketing material at launch had CHIPS as their ticker 😂 must be pretty salty about that


[22-Jun-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <helios> It is possible  release chips on a big exchange ?


[22-Jun-18 02:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Why? No utility

[slack] <pondsea> Currently


[22-Jun-18 02:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <crumb> there is no reason to hype up the token price. in the future when it's used in games, then it would make more sense


[22-Jun-18 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <crumb> by then Barter/HyperDEX will be *big exchanges* too 🙂


[22-Jun-18 02:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Let’s hope so :)


[22-Jun-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <crumb> practical use for CHIPS in games is ways out still, so patience is needed. crypto space is still pretty much in a protocol building stage. too early to expect user-friendly apps for everyday users


[22-Jun-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Hopefully later this year


[22-Jun-18 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <crumb> my hopes are always on the conservative side. less disappointments as delays are (almost) always inevitable


[25-Jun-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> i know Agama doesn't have support for CHIPS's segwit addresses. I tried importing a privkey once, and it didn't result in a b address, while in the CLI it did.

[25-Jun-18 01:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> and i think it's better to have some website and other tools up before listing


[25-Jun-18 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> we just made a big advancement in the encryption security. In the past M players colluding could have cheated. We set M to N/2+1, so if the majority are colluding they could have compromised the deck. While this is decent, for really big stakes likely not good enough. So, we improved it

Now the MofN will be set to (N+2) and (N + N/2 + 2) where N is the number of players, N/2+1 notary nodes providing random blinding values and the dealer. So some combination of players dealer and notary nodes that is N+2 need to collude. If all N players are colluding, it seems to make no sense at all. in a 9 player game, 11 colluders would be needed.

notice if we can assume the notary nodes wont collude it is fully secure even if all the players and dealer collude


[25-Jun-18 01:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> impressive! those notary nodes are darn handy, aren't they 😄


[25-Jun-18 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763

[25-Jun-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> i think you need to load submodules


[25-Jun-18 05:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> @sg777 would know how


[25-Jun-18 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jorian> @ see above. you might want to join CHIPS discord too: https://discord.gg/UyVvdV4


[25-Jun-18 05:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> `git pull --recurse-submodules` did something, trying again


[25-Jun-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> i got it to work by manually cloning libbacktrace repo in lightning/external/, i guess that submodule is missing somewhere


[25-Jun-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> ok, so now that i have a LN node up, i guess i need to open a channel to someone?


[25-Jun-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> ```
~/lightning$ cli/lightning-cli listchannels
{ "channels" :
    [  ] }
```


[25-Jun-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> ```
~/lightning$ cli/lightning-cli listnodes
{ "nodes" :
    [  ] }
```
i guess i need to wait for others


[25-Jun-18 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> who is mining CHIPS? we need to be using the latest version in dev branch


[25-Jun-18 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> ok blocks are going again, had a 20 minute gap of course caused by my testing it


[25-Jun-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jl777c> if you have a second node you can  create channels. also you can fund it


[25-Jun-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> yes, i'm syncing a second node now


[25-Jun-18 07:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> should listnodes show all nodes?


[25-Jun-18 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> on one node there's a lot of `call cli.(estimatesmartfee)` output


[25-Jun-18 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> trying to fundchannel gives an error 
```
26b49c7a33d08424ddfd9fab0f7187410ea chan #1: Opening channel: sent ERROR feerate_per_kw 2500 above maximum 1265
```


[25-Jun-18 07:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> oh i remember i think. need to set fallbackfee?


[25-Jun-18 07:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> no, still not able to fund channel. connecting is possible though, but funding returns the above error (on the node where i'm connecting to)


[25-Jun-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> ```
~/lightning$ cli/lightning-cli dev-setfees 2500 2500 2500
{ "immediate" : 2500, "normal" : 2500, "slow" : 2500 }
```
to make it 2500


[25-Jun-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[discord] <jorian> but once i fundchannel, it crashes the client

[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> got the final few things debugged and we are almost ready for POS64 test. I added a new rpc call getbalance64 that will show the mature and immature balances for utxo in the wallet. this will allow you to see where your coins are.
I will make a way with marketmaker to generate 64 addresses (and their privkeys) so you can create an address per segid easily

there is also alright's method to generate addresses

So the first step is to use one method or the other to generate addresses and register it by posting it in a JSON tha tis parseable. That will allow the creation of a global map for the segids using -addressindex.

In order to make it more interesting I will put up a 1000 KMD price to whoever stakes the most during the one week stakefest. After that we will evaluate the next step. hopefully we get some tools during the first phase and for the second phase I will be looking for the best algo to maximize results, likely a 2000 KMD prize. Likely we will need some automation that generates coin transfers based on the algo and we can have some submissions for the algo competition

[03-Jul-18 03:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> staking contest, 1000 KMD first prize for staking the most coins on a POSTEST64 chain!

komodod is able to launch independent chains with PoS/PoW generation of blocks. the ratio can be 0% to 100% PoS. The PoS uses a unique 64-way segmented staking where each utxo's address is in one of 64 different segment ids (segid) and each segid creates a staking battle within each segment. Each block the "0 segid" rotates and becomes eligible to stake first. Every 2 seconds, the next segid becomes eligible, so after 128 seconds all utxo are eligible, but the lower segids are having the advantage.

The goal of the contest is to find the best algos for allocating your stake across the different segids. A naive allocation of 1/64th to all the segments would be better than having all funds in one address, but the game theory requires to know where the stakes of the other people influence how you allocate your funds.

In order to participate, join the CHIPS discord as we will conduct the testing there since this is like a game. To generate 64 addresses, the latest marketmaker has a gen64addrs api:

source userpass
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"gen64addrs\",\"passphrase\":\"default\"}"

of course use a better passphrase than "default", it will return an array of address/wif and also just the addresses. post your 64 address array in the CHIPS discord to register for the contest. the gen64addrs api will also print out the required importprivkey cli calls to import all the addresses into a wallet.

there is a getbalance64 call in the komodod that will print your wallet's segid balances. we will start the contest this week, likely on Thursday, so there is a few days to get setup. use the dev branch for both komodod and marketmaker

[dscrd-chips] <Decker> Which branch of komodod should we use for POSTEST64? How to launch? `-ac_name=POSTEST64` and what the other params?


[03-Jul-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> `use the dev branch for both komodod and marketmaker`


[03-Jul-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> as for the params, not released yet


[03-Jul-18 02:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> Understood. Thx for tip.


[03-Jul-18 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> Seems "game" with allocating funds between addresses (segids) is similar to VRSC PoS algo. In VRSC every utxo is participating in staking (btw, very interesting idea, i like it). To get goal hash should be lower than PoS target. Where hash = F(hash_function(utxo_txhash, other_params) / utxo_size) ... On each block we get various utxos hashes, bcz other_params included. So, each block every utxo can be possible lucky to stake a block if it's hash <= pos_target.


[03-Jul-18 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> Small visualisation of VRSC staking algo to better understanding.

[03-Jul-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> @Decker is each line there a separate UTXO you are staking?


[03-Jul-18 02:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> Yep.


[03-Jul-18 02:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> So I'm guessing there is some advantage to splitting larger UTXOs?


[03-Jul-18 03:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> I'm still not able to find a goal with splitting ... seems hash function have a good random distribution.


[03-Jul-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> But at all seems you are right ... larger utxos have more chances to mine a block. Problem is in that nobody have too much VRSC to split for example in 100 utxos per 1000 VRSC each ) Because all currently mined coins are timelocked.


[03-Jul-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> Genius idea.


[03-Jul-18 03:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Decker> Even if VRSC will costs nothing on market - i will still like it, for interesting ideas.


[03-Jul-18 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> Yup, for some google cloud credits, I can't complain 😂


[03-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> It's a really interesting coin. Didn't quite understand the purpose of the emission schedule until recently.


[03-Jul-18 03:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> my first reaction was "what were they smoking when they thought of this?" now it's "damn, that's genius"


[03-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dwy> early miners with whale level of utxos that are unlocked may just rune the staking ^^

[04-Jul-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> @Soldat CHIPS is the only komodo ecosystem coin that has LN, so let's say you had LN BTC and did a BTC/CHIPS LN atomic swap, you can then trade that CHIPS for anything on barterdex.


[04-Jul-18 09:08 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> we are working on demonstrating CC capabilities and the idea is some sort of player vs player card game. Something simple but fun to play would be good. The game can encode whatever ruleset and looking for some time tested game. One minimal example would be where two players each get the same denomination cards. then each turn they play a card, the higher ranked card wins the other card. each card would have money attached to it


[15-Jul-18 05:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> the CHIPS tech would be used for the game play. CC for the enforcement of the ruleset


[15-Jul-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> we might do a CHIPS hardfork to activate CC mode once we can get more confidence in the CC

[15-Jul-18 05:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> Exciting 😀


[15-Jul-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> "Two players and a pack of 52 cards are needed. The first player offers the second player a game of 52 pick-up (or 52 card pickup). If the second player accepts, the first player scatters the 52 cards over the floor and says "52 - pick up!". The second player's job is then to reassemble the pack of cards by picking them all up."

[15-Jul-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i think the game you described actually can be a good game


[15-Jul-18 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> very simple, yet strategic and maybe you can fire some statistical analysis at it too


[15-Jul-18 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> 2 players, each player gets a set of 52 cards. then each turn, both players play a card and the one with the highest card wins. the combination of cards determine the monetary win of that hand (?), and the value of cards are predetermined at the start


[15-Jul-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <joe2x4> Hi guys. Might I suggest "Go Fish" from the list. 

Go Fish is best for 3-6 players, but it is possible for 2 to play. A standard 52 card deck is used. The dealer deals 5 cards to each player (7 each for 2 players). The remaining cards are placed face down to form a stock.

The player to dealer's left starts. A turn consists of asking a specific player for a specific rank. For example, if it is my turn I might say: 'Mary, please give me your jacks'. The player who asks must already hold at least one card of the requested rank, so I must hold at least one jack to say this. If the player who was asked (Mary) has cards of the named rank (jacks in this case), she must give all her cards of this rank to the player who asked for them. That player then gets another turn and may again ask any player for any rank already held by the asker.

If the person asked does not have any cards of the named rank, they say 'Go fish!'. The asker must then draw the top card of the undealt stock. If the drawn card is the rank asked for, the asker shows it and gets another turn. If the drawn card is not the rank asked for, the asker keeps it, but the turn now passes to the next player to the left.

As soon as a player collects a book of 4 cards of the same rank, this must be shown and discarded face down. The game continues until either someone has no cards left in their hand or the stock runs out. The winner is the player who then has the most books.

[15-Jul-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> plz, we need to start with the simplest possible game


[15-Jul-18 11:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> Your game is simple


[15-Jul-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> the idea is to make a demo of how to use CC


[15-Jul-18 11:41 AM] cascrypto#8206
cartblowing, hi or lower


[15-Jul-18 11:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> tossing in a game with complex rules will just make it harder to see the CC parts


[15-Jul-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> so the game I think is where you have two players agree to use X amount of funds to create N cards. maybe they need to be strict denominations or maybe note. And the cards "battle" with the more valuable card winning. I think that is simple as can be


[15-Jul-18 01:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> you can make it as versatile as you want, it adds to the odds of each of the 'battles'. it is actually cool, because if you manage to 'steal' a couple of high cards from your opponent, you can win big.


[15-Jul-18 01:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> use X amount of funds to create N _decks_ of cards maybe?


[15-Jul-18 02:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> I will let others expand on the baseline gameplay


[15-Jul-18 02:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> I think @jorian ‘s idea is probably the simplest. Both players just turn one card and the highest card wins. If it’s a tie, you turn the next card.? All other games seem as if they’d have too many if x happens... do a b c d e f etc


[15-Jul-18 07:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
why not roll 2 or 3 dice, highest number wins


[15-Jul-18 07:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
This can be played by 2 - 10 people


[15-Jul-18 07:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
or more


[15-Jul-18 07:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[dscrd-chips] <Alright> ok and you can't stop people from doing it


[23-Jul-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> therefore you'll never be able to GPU mine it


[23-Jul-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> you'd be surprised what I can GPU mine 😈


[23-Jul-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> your whole farm GPU farm on SHA256 is like 5 s9s


[23-Jul-18 02:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> less than 5 s9s likely


[23-Jul-18 02:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> well, that's 4 more than you said I need


[23-Jul-18 02:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> yea your whole 70ksol farm is less than a single s9 if my napkin math is correct


[23-Jul-18 02:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> it's not the size of your hash, it's how you use it 😃


[23-Jul-18 02:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> not to mention the fact that equihash sols != sha256 hashes


[23-Jul-18 02:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> 26x 1080Ti is less than 1 S7 😛


[23-Jul-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> closer to 1/4 of 1 S3 🤣


[23-Jul-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> @Dealer


[24-Jul-18 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> is the chips network OK? i did a transaction about half an hour ago and still 0 confirmations


[24-Jul-18 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <gcharang> @Alright 👆

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> https://explorer.chips.cash


[24-Jul-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> been a while indeed


[24-Jul-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> someone dumped the price of CHIPS, doesn't help either


[24-Jul-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> i had buy orders waiting, so worked quite nicely for me 😃


[24-Jul-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> oh thats nice


[24-Jul-18 04:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> just buying occasionally. a lot of stuff is on sale, better to use the chance


[24-Jul-18 04:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> doesn't mean that we can't get even lower tho :abusedsmily:


[24-Jul-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Yes it seems I should have sold a lot more CHIPS at the end of last year and been greedy 😦 lol


[24-Jul-18 05:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> you had to pay for mining equipment if i remember correctly, right


[24-Jul-18 05:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> _just used his BTC equipment because CHIPS had more value to mine than BTC_


[24-Jul-18 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I ran a private pool, rented my equihash rig (which was tiny) then rented ASICS to mine chips.... Someone was DDOSing the chips pools at the time, so i cleaned up .  Got lucky I guess.


[24-Jul-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> If anyone has an ASIC they're willing to mine CHIPS, with please pm me. I have a pool ready to go


[24-Jul-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> I've been renting ASICs out of pocket for the last week to keep the network running 😐


[24-Jul-18 07:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> cause:effect


[24-Jul-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> Please explain


[24-Jul-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> the network would be entirely stuck if not


[24-Jul-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> as soon as your GPU finds a block, the diff would lower and the profit switcher will come back and fuck the diff


[24-Jul-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> then leave again and stall the chain


[24-Jul-18 07:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> and thus causing the effect of it being non/less-profitable to mine causing the effect of dropping the diff next round causing the effect of raising the diff next round


[24-Jul-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> it's circular and the fact that current markets spec for shit adds to it


[24-Jul-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> What do you suggest we do?


[24-Jul-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> Let the chain stall for >50% of the time?


[24-Jul-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> I'd suggest you buy CHIPS and increase the price so people can afford to mine it


[24-Jul-18 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> a pseudo of 11 cents was good when the block reward was 25; when reward <1, not so much


[24-Jul-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> can't buy CHIPS if the network is stalled


[24-Jul-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> shitexchange.io broken again?


[24-Jul-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> How can I withdraw them?


[24-Jul-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> How are you even arguing this point


[24-Jul-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> keep them in the CEX bank util you sell them 😃


[24-Jul-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> Why would anyone buy a coin that's network continually stalls


[24-Jul-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> We're fixing it now, but christ it *definitely* is a problem


[24-Jul-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> `Why would anyone buy a coin that's network continually stalls` I dunno, why *do* people buy BTC and BCH? 🤔


[24-Jul-18 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> how are you fixing it, @Alright ?


[24-Jul-18 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> he's mining it with a rental


[24-Jul-18 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> SHossain pointed his ASICs at my pool, Robes offered to also 🙌


[24-Jul-18 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> network unstuck


[24-Jul-18 07:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> good, now I don't have to go across town and turn power on to the sha room 😃


[24-Jul-18 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> Don't understand why you turn profitable miners off


[24-Jul-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> because at $6200 BTC and outside temps of 100+F it's not "profitable" to run all of that for $200-300 a week


[24-Jul-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> even at $8200, it's not much better


[24-Jul-18 08:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> sha overhead is like a bajillion x that of GPUs, so I shut the whole room down to increase margins for a month or so


[24-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> want to sell me an s9?


[24-Jul-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> for the 1.2 BTC that I paid for it 😃


[24-Jul-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> I guess I could give you the "friend discount" and let it go for 1.1 BTC 😛


[24-Jul-18 08:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> I'd even make sure it was one of the ones that has 3 fully working boards

[dscrd-chips] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> docker-chipsd https://github.com/imylomylo/docker-chipsd-lightning

will add lightning to it in coming day(s), first attempt just failed with a `error: pathspec 'external/libbacktrace' did not match any file(s) known to git.` error.

going to zzzz....this hooked up with docker will be fun - hopefully get a bunch of the kmd discord able to participate in whatever you wanna do with users/testers.

I think it would be nice to be able to dump the private keys of the addresses that lightningd generates. This would greatly aide backup key management.

what if my missus is starving and breathing down my neck?  (she's not) but just saying.  these devs!! /shakes-head


[27-Jul-18 03:27 AM] Gateway#3763

Hi


[27-Jul-18 07:43 PM] sg777#2257
we like to write the set of API's that let us play the poker from the command line as per our design mentioned in the paper which we written...


[27-Jul-18 07:43 PM] sg777#2257
to start with, I written some stand alone basic set of API's here:

[27-Jul-18 07:45 PM] sg777#2257
I request you to have a look into them, and provide the suggestions and feedbacks and what all API's that would be necessary to add to develop the complete set of functionalities to play Poker...


[27-Jul-18 08:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Hermes> interesting


[27-Jul-18 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> test


[27-Jul-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> yes, please test this. the plan is to migrate the BVV functionality inside the CHIPS daemon, so it is just an automatic part of the infrastructure


[27-Jul-18 11:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> then with some rpc calls added to CHIPS, it can spawn a dealer node or a client node


[27-Jul-18 11:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> for now this functionality is isolated so we can test and debug in isolation


[28-Jul-18 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> @jorian plz offer bounties for getting the api tested


[28-Jul-18 12:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> @here Help needed! Who wants to be the CHIPS bounty manager? I will be going away on holidays and it seems the fun happens just when I leave. So, I need someone to manage bounties for: 
- testing the just mentioned BET api
- setting up a node in the Lightning Network (see #chips-lightning)

There are also bounties for getting a Lightning Wallet to work with CHIPS, to manage payment channels through a GUI.

DM if interested

[slack-kmd] <Average Eric> be super careful moving coins around on this network guys. the hashrate is so low that a few ASICS could 51% attack it

[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> I thought @SHossain and @xRobeSx  had that covered with @Alright ❓

[29-Jul-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack-kmd] <Average Eric> i would be careful trusting only a few people with the entirety of the hashrate


[29-Jul-18 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack-kmd] <Average Eric> not to mention someone could easily come out of nowhere with a majority hashrate very easily


[29-Jul-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack-kmd] <Average Eric> im not sure what solution there could be for this problem, the block rewards arent going to get any bigger so there isnt much incentive to come back and mine 😞


[29-Jul-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> ` i would be careful trusting only a few people with the entirety of the hashrate`
as opposed to most coins which is only a few pools (people) 🙄


[29-Jul-18 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack-kmd] <Average Eric> and those coins get attacked all the time 😕


[29-Jul-18 07:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> _thinks back to the last time PeerCoin was attacked 🤔_


[29-Jul-18 07:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> there's only 4-5 people that have any amount of profit motivation to attack CHIPS, so there's that


[29-Jul-18 07:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Cryptoon> Isnt chips also secured by dpow?


[29-Jul-18 07:47 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> not sure I even want to sell at 10x that 😕


[30-Jul-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> @ComputerGenie my miners are 24/7 on and pointing to @Alright's pool. seems there is a miner who uses a lot of hash during the easy diff period, mines most of the blocks and leaves me with high diff to deal with.


[30-Jul-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> I will setup a profile for a backup CHIPS pool in case Alright's one goes down. the other pool is ready. i'll do that today


[30-Jul-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> So, in short, @Alright was wrong in his theory about 1 S9 being enough?

[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> i have 2x T9+


[30-Jul-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> i was thinking that you may still be mining CHIPS 😛


[30-Jul-18 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> well, it's "cool" and rainy today, I might fire the sha room up and see if it can be levelized


[30-Jul-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> we had many days where the temps were over 95F and the room still isn't fully setup to handle high ambient temps


[30-Jul-18 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> high temps+not enough air circulation + profitability dips = ComputerGenie shutting shit down 😛


[30-Jul-18 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> i had them operating in 93C when i started them recently. 🔥 
then, had to change their place. (the garden shed doesn't have nice ventilation system)


[30-Jul-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> yeah, well, combine that with the fact that ~50% of my hashrate is S7s 😛


[30-Jul-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> for personal use, I've only got ~80TH


[30-Jul-18 06:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> damn, it's been 32 days since I've had my CHIPS daemon running on server 😦


[30-Jul-18 06:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> on the plus side, the $1200 reduction in the electric bill is going to be nice 😎


[30-Jul-18 06:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> 0.34179684 CHIPS so far woot woot, I'm rich 😃


[30-Jul-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> seems that antminers don't like being turned off; I've got a shit ton of asic chips that went bad


[30-Jul-18 06:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> 1 S9 would be enough


[30-Jul-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> `1 S9 would be enough`
2x T9+ > 1 S9
🙄


[30-Jul-18 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> his T9s are keeping the network unstuck


[30-Jul-18 06:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> 🙄


[30-Jul-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> if profit miner has more than 100TH, the difference between 21 and 35 TH as a network total is about the difference of a mouse pissing in the pacific ocean


[30-Jul-18 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> difference is network being stuck for minutes as opposed to hours when the profit switcher leaves


[30-Jul-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> now all you need to do is figure out how you're going to pay for the $800 per month that it costs in electric over the CHIPS earnings for me to do this


[30-Jul-18 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763

[30-Jul-18 07:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Yeah, you will need at least 12 cores to sync them... then you can drop to 2 or 4.


[31-Jul-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> well, I made a weak vm and ran `./assetchains` 😂


[31-Jul-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> hahah.... I tried to sync 1024 chains 500 - 1000 blocks long on a 12 thread intel server with 256GB of ram.... litteraly cant be done all at once.


[31-Jul-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> ended up rsyncing all the blocks from other servers.

[dscrd-chips] <Alright> I'll consolidate them for a fee


[31-Jul-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright>


[31-Jul-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> LOL


[31-Jul-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> just send privkey here


[31-Jul-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> consolidating them to 0 isn't what I have in mind 😛


[31-Jul-18 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> setup your payment processor


[31-Jul-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> make it pay to a separate address every so often


[31-Jul-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> I'm a solo miner, I don't have one of those


[31-Jul-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> 😛


[31-Jul-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> >give solution


[31-Jul-18 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> >oh I deleted that from my software


[31-Jul-18 07:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> I had a script that bunches 660 UTXOs, but I can't seem to find it; I guess I'll have to remake it 😣


[31-Jul-18 07:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> because I had the consolidation script, I never had any need for "payments" from myself to myself for myself


[31-Jul-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> did you remove payment processor from knomp?


[31-Jul-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> that's pretty useful for asset chains


[31-Jul-18 07:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> you can set it up to send .05 coin payments instead of dick loads of .0001s


[31-Jul-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> no, the public release will have payments because it's expected for non-solo pools


[31-Jul-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> lol.... I just mine to a pubkey thats not imported anywhere...


[31-Jul-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> for AC that is..


[31-Jul-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> guess I need to sort out some way of recovering them too...

to run this in different terminals one needs to do  run ./bet dcv ./bet bvv ./bet player and ./bet player in four diff terminals
to run with curl , I'm adding that documentation...
to write CC contract for these what are all the necessary parameters that you would require in the winning result, let me know, I'll add those..
The winner of the game is player :0, it got the card:4
{
method: "result"
playerid: winner_player_id

[dscrd-chips] <kpprabhu> Can someone share me guide on wallets and how to move chips from coinexchange


[06-Aug-18 05:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> @kpprabhu When you "have coins" on an exchange, it's just like having money in a bank: you are at their mercy if/when you ever get what is owed to you


[06-Aug-18 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> you don't actually own any coins on any centralized exchange, you have a balance on a ledger sheet and a promise

[07-Aug-18 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> @SHossain how's that wiring? 😅


[07-Aug-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> couldn't focus on that yet


[07-Aug-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> Don't mess with Genie. we had a nice plan :abusedsmily:


[07-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> We need a plan about CHIPS, can we not switch its algo away from ASIC to stop that much hash being spammed at it?


[07-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> A CPU algo seems to be a good idea, although I have no idea how much work it would be to change that.


[07-Aug-18 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I know this is not something james would have time to do either. I am not asking him to do it.


[08-Aug-18 12:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> maybe it can be changed to verushash


[08-Aug-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> How much work is that to do?


[08-Aug-18 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> not sure. havent dealt with mining algo code in the bitcoin codebase


[08-Aug-18 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> but it cant be that hard as that is the most common change forks make


[08-Aug-18 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> Verushash sounds like a good plan


[08-Aug-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Do you want me to see if I can get a Dev for this? I might know someone.


[08-Aug-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I have another suggestion. To change to dgw v3 difficulty algo. It will decrease difficulty even when no blocks are being mined, but also ramp up much much faster if somebody decides to "profit switch " it.


[08-Aug-18 08:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I will look over next few days if there are any SHA256 coins using this, and see if we can copy paste it in.

[dscrd-chips] <helios> where is the oradmap?


[08-Aug-18 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> It depends on how hard it is, I am def down for verushas even though i cant mine it with my main server. I do have a 2700X on the way next week.


[08-Aug-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> IMO as bounty manager, this is the most important thing to get sorted for CHIPS, if the chain is stalled it makes testing anything apart from BET pretty hard.


[08-Aug-18 10:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <kpprabhu> Guys..is it safe to move chips now. Blocks are not that frequent. Can my transaction get stuck ?


[08-Aug-18 10:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> yes we should offer a bounty to change CHIPS to verushash


[08-Aug-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> @Dealer


[08-Aug-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763

[08-Aug-18 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> kicked!


[08-Aug-18 03:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> sorry, i can't assign role here. Ask @jorian or jl777


[08-Aug-18 03:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> it doesnt seem to let me


[08-Aug-18 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> OK so we want to change to VerusHash, I guess with that difficulty algo can stay much the same, we don't need to change yo dgw v3 which stops profit switchers stalling the chain?


[08-Aug-18 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> _thinks "we" is not the correct term in this case_


[08-Aug-18 06:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Do we need to vote on it? Lol I think your 30k chips is pretty in significant.


[08-Aug-18 06:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I have much the same amount though.

Posted in #komodoFeb 14th


[08-Aug-18 07:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> ` Lol I think your 30k chips is pretty in significant [sic].`
not sure what my current trade holdings has to do with willingness of no one else to mine the damn coin, but sure....


[08-Aug-18 07:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> There's no shame in admitting that you've gotten all the use out of mining that you're inclined to be involved in. 😉


[08-Aug-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I meant for Vote weight


[08-Aug-18 07:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> The chain clearly no longer needs to be mined for profits, it needs to be mined so that we can use it!


[08-Aug-18 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I have a shit tonne of chips, as it is they are worth  almost nothing. If the chain dies they are worth 0.


[08-Aug-18 07:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> poor decision not to sell more when they were worth $15,000 lol


[08-Aug-18 07:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> So, because you didn't dump yours I should switch to a new mining format?


[08-Aug-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I dont know what you mean.... The chain needs to work... With it so easily attacked with ASIC's because hte blockreward is so low, we need to do something about it... Mining is not all about getting free money.


[08-Aug-18 08:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> It creates blocks, so the chain can be used 😕


[08-Aug-18 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> `Mining is not all about getting free money.`
Then get to mining 🙂


[08-Aug-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> And who is this person that you imagine is going to "attack" the chain for 97 cents worth of coinage?


[08-Aug-18 08:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> or $1.95 if dPoW is set at 200


[08-Aug-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> @ComputerGenie you don't think people "attack" chains just for the lulz?


[08-Aug-18 08:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright>


[08-Aug-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> it doesn't open the chain up to any attack vectors


[08-Aug-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> although, someone could selfish mine while the chain is stalled because notarizations are not happening


[08-Aug-18 08:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> `you don't think people "attack" chains just for the lulz?`
I'm entirely certain that some people do


[08-Aug-18 08:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> I agree

[08-Aug-18 09:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie> yes, going to completely suck for me to not get any of the coins I'm not currently mining 🙄


[08-Aug-18 09:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> not actually selfish mining 😛


[13-Aug-18 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> @blackjok3r I saw your post in POS64 but switched to here so we can keep that about the Staked chain...

Do we have confirmation that people are actually going to mine CHIPS if the algo is switched to Verushash?

I know your server can't, and some of mine can't, and I'm not sure how many people are interested in the low BR. 

I know we have to do something to keep the chain moving, I"m just curious if there are confirmed people who will mine with it


[13-Aug-18 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Shossain and james both wanted it done


[13-Aug-18 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> notaries can mine the chain, for ever and it will never break no matter price or block reward


[13-Aug-18 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Genie got really really angry about it


[13-Aug-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> roger that, as long as someone will mine it.


[13-Aug-18 06:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> I think what he got angry about was that he planned on fees down the line when CHIPS is up and running, now it's switching to something that will create added equipment expense for him to do so.


[13-Aug-18 06:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> Miners don't seem to like buying equipment for just 1-2 coins. 🤷🏿


[13-Aug-18 06:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> I think his point was more, "there's nothing wrong with SHA256, just no one wants to mine it.." because its unprofitable. Which is why I was just checking above that people will actually mine VerusHash


[13-Aug-18 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> Small block rewards aren't very intriguing for people no matter what the algo


[13-Aug-18 06:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> Going by what all I read, he didn't seem to have much ability to mine VerusHash with what he has


[13-Aug-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> the point with VerusHash is that its CPU so notaries can mine it... no amtter wheather its profitable or not, because its basically free


[13-Aug-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> I cant even mine it on my notary... 😦 so am doing all the work for others to gain the CHIPS in minign rewards.


[13-Aug-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> not that I have go too far... all I get is million of compile errors atm


[13-Aug-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> yea I was going to say you can't mine it ha. And personally I'm not going to put a bunch of NN cores on mining. I'd prefer to mine on a specific machine


[13-Aug-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> That seemed to be his other point, that you're taking something open to all and limiting the amount of people that *can* mine it


[13-Aug-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> but good work joker, it will be cool to see


[13-Aug-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> I do see genie's point.  And when the day comes that CHIPS/bet is being used a lot, BTC miners could have been interested in the fees.


[13-Aug-18 07:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> the point is, that if the chain is getting profit switched it stalls..


[13-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> I understand that and still agree with him in a way


[13-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> we don't value it enough to mine it now..

[dscrd-chips] <joe2x4> Hey guys, I'm just trying to add a few suggestions.

Is adding merge mining an option. I know various older coins have played with that type of thing. Though I believe that even on those, hash rate has historicaly declined with out new coin reward. Too bad Komodo miners couldn't merge mine chips.

The profit switcher seems more of an attack. If the attack is really only feasible till chips takes off, what would be the cost to add hash till chips is seeing more demand? 
Maybe POS Chips? What do other coins do to protect against this issue?


[13-Aug-18 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> profit switching isn't an "attack", it's just a fact of profitable mining multiple coins for miners


[13-Aug-18 12:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Profit switching is only a problem for low hash rate coins. Chips has dPoW so doesnt need a massive hash rate. And its dicciculty algo isnt great either. Must be straight BTC clone, but adjusted faster I think. I have been advised not to try anduse dgw v3 diff adjustment now either, it has attack vectors too.


[15-Aug-18 05:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> the project is alive?


[15-Aug-18 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> yes this project is alive


[17-Aug-18 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miningpools (miningpools.cloud)> chips will be changed to verushash? if yes 21 mln of chips mined how will be calculated?


[17-Aug-18 06:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> It might be... Havent been able to get it to work so far


[17-Aug-18 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> coin emmsiion will remain the same, may change difficulty calc and port to VerusHash so it can be CPU mined... may aldo change to 20s blocks instead of 10s.


[20-Aug-18 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <superslack> where can I find an explorer for chips

[dscrd-chips] <thedawson13> Thanks. Store in agama?

[dscrd-chips] <crumb> agama works nicely, yes


[26-Aug-18 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Smith> what's going on guys


[26-Aug-18 02:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Smith> any betting games yet?


[27-Aug-18 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> @sg777 is debugging the LN payment and then the first (simplest) game will be ready. once we get the simplest game working, making more complex games is a matter to update the game logic. that is an independent process without any particularly difficulty, we are solving the decentralization problems first


[27-Aug-18 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> we have a plan of incremental improvements/enhancements that will evolve the current codebase to the full solution, but since we are not marketing yet, you will need to track progress via github


[27-Aug-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Smith> thanks for the update


[27-Aug-18 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Smith> making a decentralized gamble out of this would be really nice


[27-Aug-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> yes, it will be very random


[27-Aug-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> and LN will be able to be used for realtime betting


[27-Aug-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Smith> when its ready I want to try adopting a game to the Chinese crypto community


[27-Aug-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Smith> Chinese are the biggest gambler in the world

Did the chips airdrop get distributed? I dont see any in my agama wallet.


[27-Aug-18 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> Chips has never been an airdrop. It’s been all PoW mining since the start


[28-Aug-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> @sg777 lets discuss the dev details here from now on. as we get closer to usable tech, it is time to be more open about things


[28-Aug-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> sure, I taken off last couple of days...I'll post the update on `pay` command here...


[28-Aug-18 01:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> chips chain is stalled.. was there a solution for this already?


[28-Aug-18 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> just read a bit above. staking a la VRSC?


[28-Aug-18 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> and did computergenie leave again? 😅


[28-Aug-18 02:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> anyways, i can't help test LN when chips chain is stalled


[28-Aug-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Yes, I tried to port VerusHash to chips, not stake just the hash function, so that it was a lot harder to hash attach it and stall the chain.


[28-Aug-18 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> But I couldnt get it to work.


[28-Aug-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> nice that you tried


[28-Aug-18 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> this badly needs a fix


[28-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> https://explorer.chips.cash/ is down


[28-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> has been for a while


[28-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> chain still stalled? I can rent some hash


[28-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> @grewalsatinder needs to redirect it to another explorer


[28-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> kind of hurts to keep doing that though


[28-Aug-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> maybe @jl777c can reimburse? or would that be symptom treatment


[28-Aug-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> someone either has CHIPS in the switching algorithm and doesn't realize what they are doing


[28-Aug-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> Give me address 
Will update


[28-Aug-18 07:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> or is deliberately attacking us

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> @grewalsatinder http://chips.komodochainz.info/


[28-Aug-18 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> Okay will use it's IP


[28-Aug-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> if it is someone doing it unknowingly, maybe we just hardfork to get rid of them and hope they don't come back?


[28-Aug-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> that'd be a temporary solution


[28-Aug-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> literally just change the client version


[28-Aug-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> @un Haiduc feel like unstalling the chain? 🙏


[28-Aug-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> who is un Haiduc? is he the reincarnation of computergenie?


[28-Aug-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> Because of equihash miners coming in tomorrow, I have 0 sha miners that aren't in boxes awaiting shipment to our larger location; so, there's nothing I can do, currently.


[28-Aug-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> if your stratum is still up @Alright i'll point my little usb asic's back


[28-Aug-18 07:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> idk how they got off


[28-Aug-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> they don't really help much :/


[28-Aug-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> how much hash rate is it?


[28-Aug-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> I'll put the pool back up


[28-Aug-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> like 3ghs. it's fine if not, just offering


[28-Aug-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> might as well


[28-Aug-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> couple minutes


[28-Aug-18 07:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <xRobeSx> running to the bank, be back in a few


[28-Aug-18 07:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> just message me when you're back


[28-Aug-18 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> still stuck ;_;


[28-Aug-18 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> I can un stall it for a day or so, but what then? :/


[28-Aug-18 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> it's like $30/day to make it have reasonable block times


[29-Aug-18 03:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> shossain has some miners, hopefully they can come back online. better would be to change to verushash


[29-Aug-18 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> @blackjok3r said the VRSC guy wants to help out for 5000KMD


[29-Aug-18 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> he mentioned it to me that he would do it, as he taught the 5000 CHIPS bounty was 5000 KMD.


[29-Aug-18 03:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> but for 5000 CHIPS, he said he would help me with it, but I still wasn't able to do it.


[29-Aug-18 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> i've setup a pool in case somebody wants to point hashrate over: http://136.243.227.136:8080/getting_started  - however i can't help with actual hashrate sadly.


[29-Aug-18 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> currently optimizing for NH, but it's generally working nice


[29-Aug-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> i'd say for now it's properly un-stuck.


[29-Aug-18 05:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> will have to do some slight adjustments to the difficulty adaption i guess, but i'm OK 'for now'


[29-Aug-18 06:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> i've added a 2nd port for lower diffs. if somebody has some asics and would like to help me out by connecting to see if the difficulties i've chosen make sense, i'd love that a lot


[29-Aug-18 06:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> btw pool address is     `"address": "RFhz3JK2Z54EEp5U8km3CrK19LVZ1KyE58",` and i've got a 2% fee set


[29-Aug-18 06:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> I can put 1000 KMD for 5000 KMD bounty to apply VRSC


[29-Aug-18 06:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> then still need 4000 KMD from community


[29-Aug-18 06:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> $70k at peak to switch to an algo that many of us *can't* mine?
Have you people lost your minds?


[29-Aug-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> it's not like you need a mars rover to mine verushash


[29-Aug-18 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> or any other very specialized hardware, that is


[29-Aug-18 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> no, but to do it with any usefulness you do need a CPU that takes a very specific instruction set (which many of us do not have)


[29-Aug-18 06:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> do you have a better solution?


[29-Aug-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> ummm


[29-Aug-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> mine the chain we have?


[29-Aug-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> are you mining?


[29-Aug-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> 🤣


[29-Aug-18 07:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> I was


[29-Aug-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> why would I bother if the algo is going to change?


[29-Aug-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> yea that doesn't mean crap if the chain is slow _NOW_


[29-Aug-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> ehh brb


[29-Aug-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> i need popcorn


[29-Aug-18 07:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> lol, no need for popcorn


[29-Aug-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> the chain being slow now is entirely meaningless


[29-Aug-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> then why do you make a fuzz 😄


[29-Aug-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> oh yes there is need for popcorn


[29-Aug-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> we're trying to fix this stalling of CHIPS and some had the idea that verushash could fix it


[29-Aug-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> CHIPS is stalling for 3 simple reasons:
it's summer
greedy miners left
why should anyone run a sustained setup when the plan is to change it by the time tx fees become a sustainable income?


[29-Aug-18 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> CHIPS is not really done and i don't see a lot of usage all of a sudden


[29-Aug-18 07:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> so tx fees will take a while


[29-Aug-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i think CHIPS is stalling because reward is too low


[29-Aug-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> not that it's summer, that's just timing


[29-Aug-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> and I was willing to mine it for that while until the plan became one which would cost me in excess of $10k to get the same results when tx fees are sustainable


[29-Aug-18 07:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> miners mine to make profit. if they lose money on mining, yeah, can't blame them


[29-Aug-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> `not that it's summer, that's just timing`
No, that's 100% of the reason my hash shut down for a month


[29-Aug-18 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> it's winter on the other side of the planet


[29-Aug-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> there was exactly 0 extended conversation about stalls and algo changes until summer (specifically 9 straight days of 100+F) hit this side of the planet.


[29-Aug-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> decreasing prices and lower rewards are more important, imo. anyways, whatever the reason is/was, we need it fixed. if people don't want to mine it because it is not worth it, we need to make it worth it to mine chips.


[29-Aug-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i remember blocks on demand was being talked about


[29-Aug-18 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> could also be a solution


[29-Aug-18 07:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> whatever may be the case, my pool is up and running and to what i've been told there has been measures taken to make sure it'll be mined "for a while" - whatever that may mean


[29-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> so, i'm still in need of somebody with some sha256 asics to help me test my low diff port on the pool


[29-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> `we need to make it worth it to mine chips`
It was "worth it" to me until all of the talk about changing to verushash.
Now I'm at a point where there's no logic to buying more S9s, but instead buying more CPUs, bords, etc
In short, it's stalled because folks decided to change shit


[29-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> @un Haiduc can you help with that


[29-Aug-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> @0x03 help with what, exactly?


[29-Aug-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> read above your last 'mini wall of text'


[29-Aug-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> right above, actually


[29-Aug-18 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> at the point that 3 sentences is a 'mini wall of text', I'm not sure that any rational conversation can be had 🤦🏿 
That aside, all of my sha ASICs are currently in boxes awaiting move to our larger location since I no longer have a personal use for them


[29-Aug-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> 😄


[29-Aug-18 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> have a nice day sir


[29-Aug-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> well if we can get a consistent hashrate, there is no need to change algo


[29-Aug-18 08:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> we werent getting a consistent hashrate, so solutions were requested


[29-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> I was told that it would require some unknown amount of SHA hashrate to keep the blocks consistent


[29-Aug-18 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> do we know how many miners are needed ?

[dscrd-chips] <0x03> from what it looks like right now, theres one 'smaller' miner hopping on and off, and he seems to have just enough hashrate to provide a consistent (low) blocktime. if we only knew how much he had.


[29-Aug-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> nicehash is only so-and-so much useful because it's rather tailored to PH/s and requires a completetely insane mindiff


[29-Aug-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> but it'll keep the network going nevertheless


[29-Aug-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <CHMEX> I have about 80 dollars 0.01x btc there at nicehash if needed let me know what to do


[29-Aug-18 08:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> `do we know how many miners are needed ?`
If you include the 1 miner that still has CHIPS in their profit switcher, then you're looking @ ~200-300TH
If they aren't a factor, then you're looking at ~ 20-50TH


[29-Aug-18 08:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <cipi> the minimum amount of hashrate you can buy on NH is 0.05 PH/s and the additional problem is that it requires a mindiff of 1 Mio at the pool, else it disconnects you... i made such an order on NH... minimum amount is 0.005 BTC and it last for around 3 days


[29-Aug-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> we could really just use a bunch of small usb asics on the pool, actually


[29-Aug-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> well, there are factors/issues with NH being NH that aren't a real factor in this


[29-Aug-18 08:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> i _think_ right now this would make the biggest difference


[29-Aug-18 08:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> i.e. https://www.amazon.de/Bitcoin-USB-Stick-bitshopper-GekkoScience-2Pac/dp/B0718WLSHV


[29-Aug-18 08:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> @ $92 USD, I can't see how they'd be of any value


[29-Aug-18 08:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <cipi> value doesn't matter, the problem to be solved is getting blocks on CHIPS, not making money


[29-Aug-18 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> value **does** matter when it would take 30 of them ($2700 USD) to = 1 TH


[29-Aug-18 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <cipi> ok, i see what you mean... not sure if we need 1 TH


[29-Aug-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> probably not


[29-Aug-18 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> as a (probably not too meaningful) comparison, i'm running 12 'similar' scrypt asics which are usually enough to properly support small scrypt altcoins. and you can definitely say i'm doing if from an enthusiats point of view. but something like this pointed against chips would probably just be enough, judging by the current situation


[29-Aug-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> 'Moonlander 2' is what the scrypt ones are called


[29-Aug-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> also `[5:16 PM] cipi: value doesn't matter, the problem to be solved is getting blocks on CHIPS, not making money`


[29-Aug-18 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> yeah, they are great for certain chains
I was just meaning that for the same cost of 1TH of those one could buy 1 S9, produce 14.5TH, and have $2300USD left over towards the next 16-18 months of electric


[29-Aug-18 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <cipi> sure, that will work 😃


[29-Aug-18 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> I've said it 100 times over the last couple months, the only real issue with the CHIPS chain is that no one *wants* to mine it
And I've said nearly as many times, I can't see how changing the algo isn't going to change that


[29-Aug-18 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> let me remark that 'saying' things alone wont bring any blocks still 😄


[29-Aug-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> let me remark, once again, that blocks come from miners and when you tell the miners they need to purchase new equipment to mine it, they shut down their "old" stuff and begin to prepare for the "new" 🙂


[29-Aug-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> miners are so confusing 😃


[29-Aug-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> lol


[29-Aug-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> oh come on. of the 4 (or was it 5) people participating in the last hour of discussion, 3 did something against the stuck chain or at least wanted to. while theres still one who had a lot to say despite refusing to help (for personal reasons that are not overly important to me, tbh)


[29-Aug-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> so i kind of wonder why the fuck you still keep on talking mate... it's hilarious


[29-Aug-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> chain was stuck?


[29-Aug-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> people moved, chain is moving again.


[29-Aug-18 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> dammit


[29-Aug-18 08:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> OK
1) I've personally done more for keeping the CHIPS chain moving in the last year than anyone in this convo besides jl
2) I'm not "refusing to help", I'm refusing to hash at a high expense when the plan is to switch to an algo with less operational overhead (albeit added equipment overhead)
3) I know for a fact it can currently be GPU mined (albeit slowly and at a diff higher than ZEC)
4) I keep talking because I'm feken me and that's how I feken do me (you go on and do you)


[29-Aug-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> So with 50TH, it sounds like the chain will be mostly consistent?


[29-Aug-18 08:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> if so, I guess the question is what the cost of a miner that can do that is


[29-Aug-18 08:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> if the 1 miner with CHIPS in his profitswitcher isn't a factor, then yes 50 should be plenty


[29-Aug-18 08:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> as for cost, ~$2k for someone to start from nothing


[29-Aug-18 08:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> maybe something like: https://www.asicminervalue.com/miners/asicminer/8-nano-compact

[29-Aug-18 08:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> @ $4500 USD, I'd still have to go with 4 Antminers


[29-Aug-18 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> who is mining CHIPS now?


[29-Aug-18 08:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> the blocks are steady


[29-Aug-18 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> how many time for mine the 5k chips?


[29-Aug-18 08:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> @0x03 's pool had like 16TH on it when I looked last


[29-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> @helios with current rewards, it's take a loooooooooooong while to mine 5k CHIPS


[29-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <cipi> yes, http://136.243.227.136:8080/ is his pool ... and  i have a NH-order pointing to that pool


[29-Aug-18 08:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> it is possible to calculated date?


[29-Aug-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> @jl777c a combination of my pool and exactly one other dude (the smaller miner i mentioned)


[29-Aug-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> `it is possible to calculated date?`
23.7 days if you hit every block (if I added correctly)


[29-Aug-18 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> thats whats happening now, and i'm hitting about every 5-6 blocks


[29-Aug-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> (the proof would be to turn off my pool again and wait until he jumps back off, which he did a couple of times before. but i'm pretty sure i'm right)


[29-Aug-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> if only NH didnt enforce a hilarious min diff of 1meg. actually every share thats happening on the pool is a valid block then, theres just not a lot of stuff >=1meg


[29-Aug-18 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> when the chips are fully mined --> moon


[29-Aug-18 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <un Haiduc> with the diff running at 1-6million, it's almost insane how many more blocks a rental would get if not for NH's proxy algo


[29-Aug-18 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> he probably just left again, which means we're hitting 100% of the blocks, anytime a share >1meg happens.


[29-Aug-18 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> @blackjok3r i think we may have had a misunderstanding. i was asking about the 5000 bounty that I had heard was KMD, and as I understood it was needed and didn't expect it to be a lot of work, thought I might just do it and get the bounty. As we talked, I started to feel I might be taking an opportunity that others already wanted. I probably didn't have the time anyways, so I offered to help instead. I can help a lot more than I have, for no bounty, if it can help. let me know what issues you have, and if you'd like to get it done still, maybe we can just solve them 😃

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> shameless copy:


[29-Aug-18 12:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> 9:37 AM] blackjok3r:
I believe all you'd need is to replace the blockhash with the VerusHash block hash. To do that, you'd want to use haraka* and verus_hash.* from the crypto directory, and to move SerializeVerusHash and VerusHashWriter from hash.h in the src directory to your hash.h. You should also copy the hash function pointer and selection from CBlockHeader to support portability and performance and make it easier to port. Then, at runtime, just make sure to call CVerusHash::Init() and select your hash function to set the function pointer. Of course, with a height dependent change, you may want the main hash function for CBlockHeader to just select between what you use now and VerusHash. I think that would cover everything.
(edited)
[9:38 AM] blackjok3r: All I left out, was the actual height activation and CVerusHash::Init()  call.
[9:38 AM] blackjok3r: but it will not compile


[29-Aug-18 01:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> I did a PR on that repo to fix two issues with the build:
1. I separated portable and fast VerusHash source builds with different flags and made the compilation independent of the machine being compiled on. That solved the first build issues.
2. I saw that there are issues in the code that need fixing, which show up as more build issues. I assume @blackjok3r can continue with these once the issue in #1 is gone. I did fix the first one of this type of build issue, which was just a definition of VERSION in CBlockHeader. It looks like the others are similarly fixed by matching call function parameters, etc.
Let me know if you need more help.


[29-Aug-18 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> I just went ahead and added fixes for the rest of the build issues into the PR. haven't tested it, but aside from the things breaking the build, the changes all looked reasonable.


[29-Aug-18 04:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> Thanks a lot man.


[29-Aug-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Aug-18 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> I just got back from something and saw I missed a link problem. reorging the make file and fixing now


[29-Aug-18 08:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> @grewalsatinder might want to wait a few minutes


[29-Aug-18 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <miketout> using those params now

[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> did you add the actual call to use the algo or height activate it? 
I was just trying to get the right functions into the code at first as I wansnt too sure about how to do that.


[29-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> cool, please tag me, and I'll also issue build command 🙂


[29-Aug-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> no. i assumed you were going to do that. last thing I had to do was rearrange the makefile because the headers were getting pulled in to many unnecessary places


[29-Aug-18 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> i think it's good, but i want to wait until the end 😃


[29-Aug-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> yeah, but then I saw you message that you making changes, so stopped after ./configure command 😁


[29-Aug-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> coz past experience says if I try to compile on same compiled code sometimes it doesn't give the result as we expect from fresh clone


[29-Aug-18 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763

[29-Aug-18 09:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> because it's a link issue, i need to change makefile and build clean each time


[29-Aug-18 09:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> ok, it's all fixed. they were the tests. make files reorged to be part of the PR, and it builds completely fine now

[29-Aug-18 10:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> so do I wait for another git update and then try or just try with clean clone? 🤔


[29-Aug-18 10:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> unfortunately, i'd recommend either fixing the Makefile.am there, or waiting. i have to do a fully clean build to check. building now

[29-Aug-18 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> problems with it in or out because of tests. just a dep/build issue, but takes so long to check. looking deeper

[30-Aug-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> it will, but it needs a height activation once it has been tested to actually work


[30-Aug-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blackjok3r> The first step was this, getting it to compile with verushash functions. Now someone needs to set chipsd to use verushash function and connect 2 nodes, they should go on a hard fork as soon as they connect to each other. I would advise doing it in a VM, I can try to get onto this, if nobody else can, but I am busy on scaletest stuff now, and dont want to leave that until its all finished.


[30-Aug-18 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miningpools (miningpools.cloud)> the idea to move chips to verushash it's a great solution for me. Max number of chips remain the same ( 21 mln ) ?


[30-Aug-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> @blackjok3r you should get back to scaling


[30-Aug-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i'll try to build it and maybe @grewalsatinder and me can get it to work together


[30-Aug-18 01:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> i did a `autogen.sh` successfully on OS X and now in configure phase

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> `./chipsd -algo=verushash`?


[30-Aug-18 07:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> if it's `ac_algo` then it's wrong since chips isn't an assetchain

[dscrd-chips] <miketout> @dukeleto Linux compiles fine. Other OS's should have been the same as before, but that is an OSX header issue.


[30-Aug-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> likely from something else than these changes, as nothing related to core headers should have changed at all


[30-Aug-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> OS X is like the uncle you never invited to the party


[30-Aug-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> was it working on OSX before?


[30-Aug-18 09:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> good question. I am pretty sure c-lightning works on OS X, but not sure if CHIPS preserved that


[30-Aug-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> i have compiled c-lightning on OS X recently


[30-Aug-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miketout> my guess is that there would be no differences in supported OS's from the VerusHash change


[30-Aug-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> i probably am the first person to try compiling CHIPS on os x


[30-Aug-18 09:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> i am crazy like that


[30-Aug-18 10:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <0x03> i think i've beat you to it. i had a CLI version of chips on osx, that much for sure.

[28-Sep-18 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> we need the same kind of hype for CHIPS as now with PIRATE 😄


[28-Sep-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> actually chips would be perfect to be full zksnarks like pirate

[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> private chips


[28-Sep-18 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> but maybe not allways? before a gmae you need to sometimes show you have sth to play with?...


[28-Sep-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> but on the other hand you could make a deposit to special account to prove yourself... situation will be more interesting when CC comes to pirate... then maybe no use on other then non private chains


[28-Sep-18 03:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> PS I dont not exactly believe pirates value will grow and last untill it will get true CEX liquidity and some wider usage


[28-Sep-18 03:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> and CEXes are not sure as govs will preffer to close full private chain - money loundry as first usage will come for sure


[28-Sep-18 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> so some way of decentralized market will be needed anyway


[28-Sep-18 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <joe2x4> Chips uses CC and I believe pirate can't do that.


[28-Sep-18 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com> but will in the future


[28-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763

[05-Dec-18 10:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <blubbi> Time to set sail Pirates. 
We've built the new discord and we want to get all of us migrated over there. We have radio, and tip bots and will get a bridge to the one remaining Pirate channel in KMD discord once everyone sets sail.
TODAY THE INVITE BOUNTY STARTS!!!!
So get your ref link and lets annoy everyone on social media platforms from Instagram to Twitter, FB to Gab, Reddit to Steemit! 

https://discord.gg/4TuRWV

https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/512188534111862786/519568247297671178/Arrr_Discord_Bounty.jpg?width=300&height=300

How to enter:
1. At the top of the channel menu, click Pirate at the top, then +invite people.
2. At the bottom of the pop up window, there is an “edit link” button. Please set your invite link to “NEVER EXPIRE”. 
3. Save this link… and spam it everywhere you want to share it to get people to join the Discord.
4. Between Dec 25th and Dec 31st we will end the contest and tally the invites. — For your first 10 invites, you will receive 20 ARRR each, up to 200 ARRR. After that you will get 10 ARRR per invite, up to no limit. Leaves and Fake invites will be removed from your total payouts.

[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> that page looks like it covers everything if you look at all of the posts and I think the graphic makes a good visual aid
`the round betting always stops at the player who raised the last?`
the "round" *starts* with the player that raised last and ends with the player to their immediate right (if no one else re-raises)


[27-Dec-18 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay, isn't it that the round always start with the player left to the dealer...

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> in this once the flop  or turn or river cards are drawn, the betting is starting from the player left to the dealer..


[27-Dec-18 12:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> correct
I guess what I was saying would apply as a "sub-round"


[27-Dec-18 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay got it, so if a player A raises and all other players just perform the call, even in that case also player A won't be allowed to raise again right?


[27-Dec-18 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> correct, if all are calls then you cannot re-raise yourself


[27-Dec-18 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay, one more doubt is, isn't the case we need to fix small_blind before start of the game?


[27-Dec-18 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> or we can allow dynamic bet on small_blind?


[27-Dec-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `if a player A raises and all other players just perform the call` then the betting will end with the active player to their immediate right


[27-Dec-18 01:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> agreed, it means for that round the betting is over, depending up on the state of the game, next community cards will be drawn...right?


[27-Dec-18 01:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `we need to fix small_blind before start of the game?
or we can allow dynamic bet on small_blind?`
the "standard" is set big and small; there are "house rules" that apply in some places, but generally blinds are fixed amount


[27-Dec-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> 1&2 5&10 3&6 etc


[27-Dec-18 01:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> got it thanks, so the maximum rounds of betting rounds is 4?


[27-Dec-18 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> 1) after hole cards are drawn 2) after flop cards 3) after turn card 4) after river card


[27-Dec-18 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> Small is "generally" 1/2 of big
if you count a "round" as it relates to the card action then, yes, you have 4
preflop
post-flop
post-turn
post-river


[27-Dec-18 01:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay, yes, we will fix small/big blinds to something like 1/2 satoshis for time being on LN..


[27-Dec-18 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> thanks a lot for clarifying the doubts.


[27-Dec-18 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> np, poker is every reason I got interested in CHIPS at the beginning 😉

[28-Dec-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> a question for the community is what games we want to see CHIPS supporting. we are working toward a table driven game definition, so once a specific type of game is implemented, then similar variants would be supported with the creation of a new set of data that describes the game rules.


[28-Dec-18 02:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> i estimate 100+ different games can be supported, but we want to support the games that people want to play


[28-Dec-18 02:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> anyone interested to test the poker game which uses pangea protocol, please take the code from the `poker` branch and test..

How to join Chips discord? 
UPD found link above


[28-Dec-18 03:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> hi I have one small doubt, if no other player raises on big-blind, does the player with big-blind can `re-raise` again?


[28-Dec-18 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> some apps not allowing and some are allowing...


[28-Dec-18 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> if the `big-blind` player isn't allowed to `re-raise` then in that case will the round stops at `small-blind` player?


[28-Dec-18 03:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢  please help


[28-Dec-18 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `does the player with big-blind can re-raise again?`
The BB pays their bet "blind" and for that cost they "buy" the privilege to act last
__if no other player raises__ then after the SB acts, the BBs options are `check`(which means they forgo the option to raise), `raise`, or `fold`(rarely will any BB fold, but it is a valid option)

Roulette
Roulette is a casino game named after the French word meaning little wheel. In the game, players may choose to place bets on either a single number, various groupings of numbers, the colors red or black, whether the number is odd or even, or if the numbers are high (19–36) ...

[28-Dec-18 05:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> roulette is almost possible with diceCC right?


[28-Dec-18 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Only limitation now is disabled 1:2 odds


[28-Dec-18 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Yassin IndéNodes> with nice GUI 😜


[28-Dec-18 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Oh actually roulette needs exact number, so DiceCC 2.0 needed


[28-Dec-18 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Which will give a random number in given range instead of just won or lose


[28-Dec-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Will possible to make BJ on such CC easy as well

[28-Dec-18 06:10 AM] Gateway#3763

[28-Dec-18 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> @jorian the idea is to make games definable with just data, no code. so you define how many cards, max players, min players, number of rounds, type of betting, etc. and "cards" meaning a random number, so can be for dice, roullete, slots, etc.


[28-Dec-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> once we get several games, we can make a generalized data table defined version for the first three games. then more can be added. as to who will make these data tables it would be possible for anybody that understands a game well enough could do it


[28-Dec-18 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> of course the GUI for all the games is an entirely separate thing


[28-Dec-18 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> but I figure if we implement cli for 100+ games, the GUI devs, they will come


[28-Dec-18 11:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> Have a general question about how tables will work. Is there any mechanism for detecting sock puppets? Ie one person playing multiple hands at the same table?


[28-Dec-18 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Fraud question is very good question for decentralised poker without KYC.
But it's not a protocol stuff I think


[29-Dec-18 01:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> good question @Alright  ... again we see an app that should be profile-based, user trusted profiles should be created to enhance user experience? same is for Verus/voting and DAO apps


[29-Dec-18 01:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> decentralized profile working on mobile, where we could "confirm/build trust" to each other using our mobile devices could be a kind of break-through


[29-Dec-18 01:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> but there would be also the fraud prevention issue to solve


[29-Dec-18 01:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> actually same question is for centralized poker too (maybe even more) - how can you know if you are not playing again frauds online?


[29-Dec-18 01:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> at least playin 1:1 should be fair? 😃


[29-Dec-18 01:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> "centralised" poker rooms have very huge security/fraud departments and clients are super malware (have direct access even to all hardware)


[29-Dec-18 01:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> + KYC procedures


[29-Dec-18 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> Im thinking if this is address based stats - having good game-based tax like 10% - users could first build reputation playing 1:1 (which for frauds does not make much sense when 10% tax appalied) and then knowing how many 1:1 someone played and how much total winner tax he paid you would know if this is safe for you to participate with him on 1:N play


[29-Dec-18 01:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> but maybe this is mroe work then gain ?


[29-Dec-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Hmm I can build some reputation (not sure how to measure it) from X PCs


[29-Dec-18 01:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> All the efforts depends of the prize (stakes)


[29-Dec-18 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> In my opinion such poker is good for tech demonstration, some satoshies play fun - because people like it, it's community oriented and very understandable. But it's an utopia to make a commercial product of decentralised online-poker


[29-Dec-18 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> having 10% game winner tax + expecting 1:1 plays for trust build and tax paid as measure could work initially


[29-Dec-18 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Take rake only from winner?


[29-Dec-18 01:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> but maybe some good game theory mathematician could calcualte a proper tax % and proper parameters to avoid frauds


[29-Dec-18 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> It may be good to make a home games I think


[29-Dec-18 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> what Im saying - if you are fraud and want to build trust palying 1:1 - it makes no sense as you loose 10% after each game done, right?


[29-Dec-18 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> so doing this makes little sense


[29-Dec-18 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> When you know personally other game participants


[29-Dec-18 01:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> as long as you also use total paid tax as measure (to avoid couldint small amount games like << 1$)


[29-Dec-18 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> the more tax someone paid the better trust in this case... still it's a matter of how big is fraud... if someone willing to fraud people for millions he would be eager to prove himself burning hundreds of thousands... so still some public profiles - not game related are needed


[29-Dec-18 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> I believe the question is addressed in the whitepaper, but I haven't looked at it in a few months. Was hoping someone would be able to generalize it


[29-Dec-18 01:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> does anyone have a link to whitepaper?

[29-Dec-18 01:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> I think Verus should work out decentralized profiles (as this is closest to democracy voting and there profile trust is needed), but to make it they need substantial investor


[29-Dec-18 01:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> but this would be a huge project and many test , ideas lots of development needed, imagine sth between decentralized facebook+google

[29-Dec-18 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Alright> after skimming over that, I believe that is talking about deck shuffling in particular


[29-Dec-18 01:49 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> als othere could be possibility of "fully random games" that each player join a random game - so less probably you get many "bots" on one game


[29-Dec-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> and to exclude co-oparetion between players you could 1. change their names randomly 2.  allow only group chat or no chat at all - still if people sitting same room they could cheat others if joined same game ... but we could the distinguish "jumpers"? people joining and switching off the game? but we could prevent this with minimum fee amount to join the game to avoid switching


[29-Dec-18 01:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> so nobody knows who is who


[29-Dec-18 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> I dont mean this should be only option - just additional option - if people prefer use this one late only - time will tell


[29-Dec-18 02:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> game layer is on top of blockchain I guess, so many possibilities should be there?


[29-Dec-18 02:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> You can shuffle the names but you can't shuffle positions each times in not "Rush" poker, but for "Rush" poker (in which in each hand generating new table with random taken players from pool) you need a quite huge players pool


[29-Dec-18 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Anyway we're trying to invent wheel at the moment


[29-Dec-18 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> so I would suggest here a table joining fee + winner tax ?  or sth like that - fee separate fees which serve as fraud prevention different tactics?


[29-Dec-18 02:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> It's not possible to prevent online poker fraud on buy-ins  / rake level - if you have a way to do it I think poker rooms will be happy to pay you millions which they spent on security departments which works like a FBI (in industry leaders companies)


[30-Dec-18 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> the only safe way is to play against pubkeys that you know who it belongs to. tight knit online communities can have poker nite


[30-Dec-18 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> for large scale, the rush poker method will work as long as there arent 75% of "players" that are actually bots

[dscrd-chips] <AlexMasi> Hi guys, is this project still alive? What can I do with 150 chips that I have from a year or so? Thank you

[dscrd-chips] <AlexMasi> I see the bitpoker site offline. Can anybody give me some up to date info on what has been going on please?

[dscrd-chips] <crumb> if you want to see GUI-s then you're still early. it's strictly CLI for now

[dscrd-chips] <AlexMasi> Thank you will look

[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> @sg777 Following this guide https://github.com/sg777/bet/tree/poker on fresh Ubuntu 18.04 machine.
On step  ``` ./configure --with-boost=/usr/local/``` from `# Installing CHIPS`
At first I get: ```checking for Berkeley DB C++ headers... default
configure: error: Found Berkeley DB other than 4.8, required for portable wallets (--with-incompatible-bdb to ignore or --disable-wallet to disable wallet functionality)
```
Then if I run ``` ./configure --with-boost=/usr/local/ --with-incompatible-bdb```
```checking for boostlib >= 1.47.0... yes
checking whether the Boost::System library is available... yes
configure: error: Could not find a version of the boost_system library!

[03-Jan-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> in one node are you doing?


[03-Jan-19 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Yep


[03-Jan-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> cd bet/privatebet


[03-Jan-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> then run `./bet player 159.69.23.30`


[03-Jan-19 01:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> to start the playing node...since on that IP I just started to run the DCV..


[03-Jan-19 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> how actually it works is there are two nodes DCV(Dealer) and BVV(Blinder) and the playing nodes connect to DCV where the table formation happens...then players, DCV and BVV involve in the process of deck shuffling..then card distribution with round betting happens


[03-Jan-19 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> does your LN has any funds, initially the playing nodes sets up the channels of 0.05 CHIPS with DCV


[03-Jan-19 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> I dont have any CHIPS


[03-Jan-19 01:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> run this `./lightning-cli newaddr`

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @jorian , like the way we have kmd bot to give tips, is it possible to have one such chips-bot for tips, so that whoever active gets some chips which they can use to test or play..


[03-Jan-19 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Jan-19 05:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <KomodoWorld> about the gui, is there any dev interested to work on it? I remember a pangea prototype years ago, with a video. Is that code still available and useful as a starting point?


[03-Jan-19 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes, that very initial pangea prototype, now one can actually play texas holdem poker using the pangea protocol..


[03-Jan-19 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <KomodoWorld> and so it's possible to adapt that gui to the current underlying tech? Only need someone that can do the job


[03-Jan-19 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <KomodoWorld> that makes a full release more likely within 2019


[03-Jan-19 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <KomodoWorld> I was just thinking how to help, I can add a bounty for the gui


[03-Jan-19 05:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes, that's the plan, I can make backend however that suits to the GUI....

[dscrd-chips] <KomodoWorld> I can't remember if there some revenue for gui devs from pangea/bet assets, like for barterdex gui

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> don't know, but I remember jl asked jorian to look for GUI devs...

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> is your chips synced?

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> normally, when you start lightning for the first time, it only scans the last 50 blocks or so

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> weird. maybe something changed recently


[03-Jan-19 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> but this is not really useful


[03-Jan-19 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Hmm maybe it's because CHIPS was not in sync when I started it, let me try to restart lighthing

[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Thanks 👍 Will try to connect to dealer now


[03-Jan-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> you don't have to


[03-Jan-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> if you play a game, it will be done automatically


[03-Jan-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> at least, it should. that's what we should test now 😄


[03-Jan-19 07:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> ```then run ./bet player 159.69.23.30
to start the playing node...since on that IP I just started to run the DCV..
how actually it works is there are two nodes DCV(Dealer) and BVV(Blinder) and the playing nodes connect to DCV where the table formation happens...then players, DCV and BVV involve in the process of deck shuffling..then card distribution with round betting happens
does your LN has any funds, initially the playing nodes sets up the channels of 0.05 CHIPS with DCV```


[03-Jan-19 07:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Should I do this part? 😃

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> thing is: we need 4 nodes to play a game

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> maybe that can improved later

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> but yes, the more prepared nodes the better


[03-Jan-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> We can just schedule test on some time


[03-Jan-19 08:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> So people who want to play will prepare the nodes before this time

[03-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Should player see result of showdown or only dealer can see it atm?


[03-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes, the reason I asked the minimum amount bet as `1000000` is when the nodes unable to calculate the fee the default fee set to 1000 and 34000 is greater than >0.5 percentage of the max fee allowed..for that the payout transaction is getting declined..

[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Oh, I see


[03-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> can we play one more game with small_blind>=1000000


[03-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> and you can put rest of the bets whichever you want..


[03-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Do you take the fee if flop seen only?


[03-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> In general fee taking only if flop seen


[03-Jan-19 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Sure


[03-Jan-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Have I reconnect now?


[03-Jan-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> ctrl+c


[03-Jan-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> and run again


[03-Jan-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> is it asking you for small_blind?


[03-Jan-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Yup, my choice is 1000000


[03-Jan-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Actually it's quite confusing to choose a blinds size  😃


[03-Jan-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> can you stop and start the node again...I just started DCV....


[03-Jan-19 08:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes for small_blind and big_blind we need to fix some amounts....I didn't know which amounts should be idle..


[03-Jan-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Lightning node?


[03-Jan-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> that's why I left those amount open...


[03-Jan-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> `sudo ninja install`
worked


[03-Jan-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> nope..


[03-Jan-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> bet


[03-Jan-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> so it is okay to hardcode small_blind and big_blind right?


[03-Jan-19 08:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> guys may be good idea to take some screenshots of your games - first decentralized poker games ever maybe ?


[03-Jan-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Usually there is a tables with different blinds


[03-Jan-19 08:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Lets say 0.01/0.02 0.1/0.2 0.5/1 and etc.

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋  I'll also post the video by tomorrow morning


[03-Jan-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> great if you save them we could use them later to publish it on reddit or somewhere - some marketing and history making 😃


[03-Jan-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @TonyL  so for time being can I fix blinds as follows `Lets say 0.01/0.02 0.1/0.2 0.5/1 CHIPS and etc.`


[03-Jan-19 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Seems good


[03-Jan-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> ahh video will be great!


[03-Jan-19 08:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Also usually in online poker (no limit games) player cant take all bankroll to the table (100 big blinds stack is typical)


[03-Jan-19 08:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> For 0.01/0.02 maximum amount I can sit with 2 CHIPS, for 0.1/0.2 20 CHIPS


[03-Jan-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> To prevent of "endless" bankroll pressuring


[03-Jan-19 08:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> sure, I'll keep that check..

[03-Jan-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Why you have 7 cards


[03-Jan-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> If I folded on turn


[03-Jan-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Shouldn't it be 4 + 2 ?


[03-Jan-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> first two are hole cards...


[03-Jan-19 08:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> next five are community cards..


[03-Jan-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> But we didn't see 5th card


[03-Jan-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> since you folded before the river card....and the number of active players is only 1....


[03-Jan-19 08:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> the hand will get evaluated and awarded me the winner...


[03-Jan-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> actually I should display these logs also at the folded players terminal too...


[03-Jan-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> No, if everybody fold


[03-Jan-19 08:53 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Jan-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> And player who won shouldn't see cards which nobody else saw


[03-Jan-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Like a river in our last dealt


[03-Jan-19 08:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay...so the river card should never be dealt?


[03-Jan-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Correct


[03-Jan-19 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay...I'll correct that..

[03-Jan-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> same goes for the turn (card before the river), if after the flop someone bets and everyone else folds, then the turn and river are not shown


[03-Jan-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> no. i just followed the guide https://github.com/sg777/bet/blob/poker/README.md

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> watch some games on youtube to get a feeling


[03-Jan-19 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Yeah and if everybody fold preflop


[03-Jan-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> No community cards revealing at all


[03-Jan-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> And no rake taken

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> and can you please try..


[03-Jan-19 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> rake is another thing sg probably didn't account for yet

[03-Jan-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Isn't it connected to rake?


[03-Jan-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Oh it's just txfee maybe


[03-Jan-19 08:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> @sg777 same result with `poker` branch


[03-Jan-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> that's something with the LN...I posted in LN community for that how much minimum fee we can hardcode...I'll soon fix that..


[03-Jan-19 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @SHossain can you please run again...


[03-Jan-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> one more thing is did you pulled the latest changes from the lightning and chips master branches?


[03-Jan-19 09:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I didn't know about `rake`, I'll read about it...


[03-Jan-19 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> everything compiled in the last 30 minutes from latest source


[03-Jan-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> one more doubt is, for example if all the players folds expect one...in that case does the player cards should be revealed at the end of the game...or the dealer simply reward the single remaining player without revealing any of the cards?


[03-Jan-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> If everybody folds except of 1 player - he winning pot and no need to show his cards


[03-Jan-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> look, this is a list of several tournaments. almost every tournament has a different setup: how much rake, how much the blinds are, when the blinds go higher

[03-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> and those need to be programmed somehow


[03-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> sure


[03-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> @jorian better to check cash tables list


[03-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> ```
./bet player 159.69.23.30
nntype.33 connect to tcp://159.69.23.30:7798 connectsock.1
nntype.80 connect to tcp://159.69.23.30:7799 connectsock.2

Segmentation fault (core dumped)
```


[03-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> true, but it's the same idea


[03-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> there needs to be a table layer


[03-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <SHossain> this is what i see on lightning output
```
2019-01-03T17:04:12.202Z lightningd(9232): Connected json input

```


[03-Jan-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> and on top of the table layer, a tournament layer

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> one doubt if the hand gets completed...and the evaluation of it made...and the same set of players want to play again..in that does the deck need to be re shuffled or they can continue playing on the remaining shuffled deck?


[03-Jan-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Usually deck shuffling before new hand

[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> And etc


[04-Jan-19 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> is raise should always be 2x of bet...


[04-Jan-19 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> and in the initial round does first raise should also be >=big_blind

```41: Raises A: A raise must be at least the size of the largest previous bet or raise of the current betting round. If a player raises 50% or more of the previous bet but less than the minimum raise, he must make a full raise. The raise will be exactly the minimum raise allowed.

B: In no-limit and pot limit, an all-in wager of less than a full raise does not reopen the betting to a player who has already acted and is not facing at least a full raise when the action returns to him. In limit, at least 50% of a full raise is required to re-open betting for players who have already acted. See Illustration Addendum.```

[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> In this one I folded


[04-Jan-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I got poor cards `diamonds-->nine     diamonds-->four`


[04-Jan-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I thought you win that round..


[04-Jan-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Oh was hard to call on such board with ten high 😃


[04-Jan-19 05:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I don't much of poker tactics, but luck is favoring my way 😃


[04-Jan-19 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Did you fold from big blind on my call?


[04-Jan-19 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes..


[04-Jan-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> 😃  easy money


[04-Jan-19 05:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> to see if the dcv to  your playing node works or not..


[04-Jan-19 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Would be really useful on this stage to see result of dealt in the end


[04-Jan-19 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Like a player X won pot Y


[04-Jan-19 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> when I fold or you win...you getting any log that lln success


[04-Jan-19 05:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> And also to see my balance available to play

[04-Jan-19 05:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Like a available to bet balance displaying, actions of players before my turn with betsizing and result of dealt in the end and will be possible to enjoyable play even without GUI imo haha


[04-Jan-19 05:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <TonyL> Oh and my position displaying also (in heads up game it's easy to track but on bigger table this information is necessary for player decision)

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> no dedicated website to it exists to my knowledge, most of the documentation present in drives, forums nad git..

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> chips isn't necessarily poker only


[22-Jan-19 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> like in a casino, you can use chips to play blackjack or stud poker or whatever games there are

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> that initial draft gives details about the shuffling logic which we deploy in poker and in the future games..


[22-Jan-19 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> so going through that paper gives some idea about what are different entities in our system, and how they play a role in playing poker or any future games which we develop..

[22-Jan-19 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Gloryman> I kept coming back to the discord but it seemed so empty at times.


[22-Jan-19 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Gloryman> Ok, looking at other parts of the discord and on github, this was too complicated for me to understand. So I gave up.


[22-Jan-19 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Gloryman> crypto poker sounds like a great idea tho.


[22-Jan-19 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Gloryman> will there be rake on this casino/poker site or will it be rake free?

[23-Jan-19 09:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> but like is it working  to play the poker? since I couldn't able to enter the table size and actions are happening automatically..


[23-Jan-19 09:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> do you have any guidelines on how one can play on that front end...

[26-Jan-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> it wasnt quite working


[26-Jan-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> and it uses old api


[26-Jan-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> but it should be very close to working


[26-Jan-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> and the backend shouldnt be too hard to convert


[26-Jan-19 01:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay, I'll take the first one as reference to start with..


[26-Jan-19 01:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Gloryman> Hey @jl777c , when is the plan to get an actual poker community playing regularly on this software. I will write it in my diary.


[26-Jan-19 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> it is up to the CHIPS community


[26-Jan-19 01:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Gloryman> Do we have any idea about what the rake will be like on this poker software?


[26-Jan-19 01:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> the dealer should be able to set the rake for their tables


[26-Jan-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> @sg777 on start up, there’s a mock API end point doing it from server.py I think.  I’ll be in front of machine in cpl hrs


[28-Jan-19 04:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes, I'm looking into `pangeawebsocket.py` trying to figure out where the front end actions are mapped to backend logic...


[28-Jan-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> Anyone know why chips isn't listed on the address asset viewer on the dexstats site?

[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> I've nearly left them behind twice when migrating to a new wallet.


[29-Jan-19 07:52 AM] jspook16#3059
Maybe because chips isn't a kmd asset chain


[29-Jan-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> i see you are in the perfect position to ask 😄


[29-Jan-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> Regarding chips not being an asset chain, neither is btc, hush, ltc, bch? All of them listed on the address asset viewer. Chips is based on a KMD address (i.e "can" use the same privkey).


[29-Jan-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> I'm not trying to be a dick. It was a serious question, I'm certainly backing chips and I would imagine will be a major player in the ecosystem. I'm not sure who is responsible for managing dexstats but I use it frequently.

[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> It is also listed under ECOSYSTEM PROJECTS on kmd discord.


[29-Jan-19 03:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie ツ> @ch6ris That a given website can make API calls to different wallets is not indicative of them being of the same base.
CHIPS is a fork of Bitcoin
KMD is a fork of Zcash which is a fork of Bitcoin
"KMD BTC BCH DASH LTC HUSH" (and a thousand others) share the same ancestry, and therefore much of the same base API structure and many core parts/functions.
CHIPS is part of the ecosystem, but isn't part of komodod because of LN (or at least that's the shortest way to describe it)


[29-Jan-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> It should be listed on the site, that is all I am saying. As i said I don't know who is responsible for the website.

[30-Jan-19 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> @jspook16 the streamer is not integrated with chips. The streamer has been following chips for some time with interest and is waiting for his big chance to play on fully developed software on chips.

[02-Feb-19 03:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> Hey guys, I have a question. @sg777 @jl777c @jorian Why did you create chips as a separate coin? Why didn't you just make poker and casino software that allows you to bet with Komodo? I don't understand the need for the coin.


[02-Feb-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> KMD doesn't have lightning, CHIPS does


[02-Feb-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jorian> james knows more about the specific reasons


[02-Feb-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> I would never contaminate KMD codebase with segwit


[02-Feb-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> is it just that KMD would not be "fast" (blocktime/confirmation time wise) enough or are there other specific technical reasons besides that


[02-Feb-19 05:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> segwit is an abomination, why to integrate it?


[02-Feb-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie ツ> Segwit/LN "works" for what it works for and __none__ of those cases are actual "average currency user" cases (no matter what you read on reddit), so putting it in something like Komodo would be pointless (even assuming all the other issues were worked out)


[02-Feb-19 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> But why not have deposits in komodo. Players play with chips that represent komodo and when they withdrawal they withdraw komodo. I don't see what the advantage is of chips compared to previous bitcoin poker sites and gambling sites. Also, a bigger poker/gambling site would be more respected with more credibility if it was attached to a bigger coin.


[02-Feb-19 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> But I am not technical


[02-Feb-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie ツ> ` I don't see what the advantage is of chips compared to previous bitcoin poker sites and gambling sites.`
Because it's an entire gaming platform, not limited to just poker or "gambling".
The idea is to build a platform that nearly any game you can think of can be used on.


[02-Feb-19 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> Why cant bitcoin be used in any game u can think of?


[02-Feb-19 06:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie ツ> Because bitcoin doesn't have any rule sets for games or logic (aside from the currency stuff itself)


[02-Feb-19 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> That's what I mean, what's the difference between a currency being on a any game u can think of platform and chips being a currency on any game u can think of


[02-Feb-19 06:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie ツ> Can you think of a currency that has a card shuffler in the consensus of the coin itself?


[02-Feb-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> No. I mean practically what is the difference for consumer or user?


[02-Feb-19 06:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> How is it better than any program on top of a crypto currency


[02-Feb-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie ツ> CHIPS and the platform will not just be used as currency *in* the games, it will contain the consensus rules *for* the games


[02-Feb-19 06:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> Sorry buddy, I'm not technical. What does that mean? How is it better?


[02-Feb-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie ツ> Layer apps (on top of the currency) depend on you trusting the app/site to decide and enforce rules
With this idea, rules in the consensus code means that everyone shares the rules, and any time the rules are changed the majority of users must agree to those rules being changed


[02-Feb-19 06:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> Oh I see what u mean


[02-Feb-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> So the community change the software together kind of thing.


[02-Feb-19 06:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> That's really interesting


[02-Feb-19 06:42 AM] cipi#4502
` Why cant bitcoin be used in any game u can think of?`
Easy answer: Because blocktime of BTC is 10 minutes... i don't think you want to wait 10 minutes or more for a player of poker to place his bet.


[02-Feb-19 06:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Vibr> Atomic swaps between LN enabled chains could be possible though, or some time locked contract where one could use any currency externally and chips would be used internally (both balances displayed)?


[02-Feb-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> hmm. now that i read my question it is clear that it was too vague. i did not mean why segwit is not used in KMD, but what technical reasons are there to use CHIPS instead of KMD or BTC for example. @cipi  and @ComputerGenie ツ already explained it, so i was right to assume that one of the reasons for using CHIPS is confirmation times and CHIPS being not just in-game currency, but part of the games platform itself?


[02-Feb-19 01:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <GlorymanRTS> I understand better now, thanks guys


[02-Feb-19 07:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> LN has many issues, but for a hub and spoke topology it can indeed to very fast transactions, so technically it works for realtime poker. CHIPS is meant to be used via LN for all the games. LN requires segwit


[02-Feb-19 09:42 PM] jspook16#3059
Is it right in assuming that you won't have to "deposit" either? You hold your chips until you place a bet?


[03-Feb-19 02:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> you need to open LN channel


[12-Feb-19 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> does anyone have any idea of the opensource repo that does http response building in C?


[14-Feb-19 04:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> cJSON.c


[14-Feb-19 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> you can construct a JSON response and usually the actual reponse is adding a header


[14-Feb-19 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> iguana does this


[14-Feb-19 04:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> so does komodod


[19-Feb-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> As I'm getting many DM's about the status of the front end....Due to viral fever last week my platlet count had gone down and it restored to normal in last two days and for that reason I'm offline from past 7-8 days.


[28-Feb-19 04:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> done with the integration of libwebsockets into bet repo, making the REST API calls, the use of C as backednd is taking more time than expected..


[19-Mar-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> @jl777c do you support always chips ?


[19-Mar-19 11:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> CHIPS is making slow steady progress, i help sg777 who is the implementor


[19-Mar-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> Any idea for the release of the gui please ? Any marketing campaing ?


[20-Mar-19 02:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> we wait for sg777. as far as marketing goes, it will need to be grass roots basis, there isnt any ICO, or founders reward for CHIPS, so it is up to community


[20-Mar-19 05:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> chips is not a project known as the others (it can be seen from the number of users of this community) and the project will surely be very slow unless there is a reward in KMD. 
sg777 and lj777 works hard but without a serious interest on it, chips will be a nice idea


[20-Mar-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> a full time devs are required to develop GUI


[20-Mar-19 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> I think, with the hodler of chips, an possibility for launch a funding for the dev and for accelerate developpement of chips


[20-Mar-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> the top 100 have 97% of chips coin


[20-Mar-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> could be a solution too


[20-Mar-19 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> also with donation


[20-Mar-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <kremer> donations didn't work for GRIN


[20-Mar-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <kremer> a much more known project than CHIPS


[21-Mar-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> it is possible to calcul the money for the dev and restart the prohect?


[21-Mar-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> there is no need to 'restart' the project. when the underlying tech is mature enough, then we'll just need GUI devs.


[21-Mar-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> but they need the foundation to build on and thats is what @sg777 and @jl777c are doing as we speak


[21-Mar-19 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> sg777 is doing gui now


[21-Mar-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> thank you for the clarification james. still, if there is one reference GUI that showcases the possibilities then getting others to join will be much easier.
somewhat similar to early BarterDEX by Satinder and HyperDEX followed after that


[21-Mar-19 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> a gui will mean everything to this project. 🚀


[21-Mar-19 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <crumb> yes, as gaming is mostly about the UX and eye candy


[21-Mar-19 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> eye candy is very important these days.


[21-Mar-19 04:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> My 80yo neighbor doesn't understand why I am painting over the ugly green gutters on our house with something more modern.


[21-Mar-19 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> chips withdrawals are disabled on dp atm. 😦


[21-Mar-19 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ch6ris> `sg777 is doing gui now` any chance of a teaser?


[21-Mar-19 04:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> Im working on gui, here is the repo:https://github.com/sg777/pangea-poker-frontend

[21-Mar-19 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> With good front Dev things could have much faster..


[21-Mar-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I'm learning and taking help from jl, doing the things.


[21-Mar-19 07:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> the project need a font end dev?


[21-Mar-19 08:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miner707> Maybe additional support won't be a bad idea


[25-Mar-19 01:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> we launch this?


[25-Mar-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> all the help is appreciated


[25-Mar-19 03:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> CHIPS only has devs and no other resources, so marketing, etc. will need community engagement. assuming it works well, maybe actual usage to spread it


[28-Mar-19 12:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> thanks @jl777c and @sg777 for your work.  hope to see soon a gui ready, sure community will help project to grow up 👍

[02-Apr-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> The current status w.r.t to gui development is, I'm been making the changes to the front end to handle the communications across playing nodes. One way I made it done, in that process I added few labels in the front end for that I need the help from some gui dev to review my approach. Any gui dev interested please ping me, I can arrange the test setup if they want to test or like to contribute.

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> Hello


[03-Apr-19 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miner707> Thanks for the update @sg777  lets make this happen all that needed is a GUI which can get the ball rolling , poker especially online poker it a huge opportunity a Decentralized one is inevitable why not chips/pangea


[03-Apr-19 06:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <bluewind> Yep, there is huge profit in poker some people do it for a living and make alot of money from it , so I can imagine people playing on Pangea for a living and cashing out their CHIPS using DEX to buy stable coins .


[03-Apr-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <$tefano.> chips could be the first poker games on real blockchain not on token! 😎


[03-Apr-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> We hope this


[03-Apr-19 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> This project is awesome


[03-Apr-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Apr-19 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> Yes for sure. Now the goal is playing poker 😎

[dscrd-chips] <brianbalsamique> I can’t take on a GUI project right now, but I may have a friend or two... (Does anyone know if there’s a reward or bounty out on this as well?)


[03-Apr-19 11:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> yes, there are plenty of CHIPS for bounties


[03-Apr-19 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miner707> @brianbalsamique  chips will do very well with a gui dev,  only sg777 working on his own 😟


[03-Apr-19 01:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <brianbalsamique> @miner707 just sent out a text

[03-Apr-19 02:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <brianbalsamique> @miner707 any idea, sir?


[03-Apr-19 05:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miner707> @brianbalsamique  I believe it just front end Gui implementation for poker games  @sg777 he will know the specifics as for bounties ask jl777


[04-Apr-19 12:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <brianbalsamique> @miner707 @jl777c @sg777 Theres some interest amongst some of my friends. If anyone with details on what’s specifically needed right now could DM me that’d be cool 🤙


[04-Apr-19 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> @sg777 will know the details. I am sure we can raise some CHIPS bounty for a nice gui


[04-Apr-19 01:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @brianbalsamique  as mentioned, i take care of the logic, I only need help in aligning the elements in the existing gui, adding new elements and styles...


[04-Apr-19 03:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <brianbalsamique> @sg777 @jl777c Is it cool to ask about the bounty? Any rough estimate?


[04-Apr-19 03:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <brianbalsamique> @sg777 I might have time to help a bit too this week as well. Can you shoot me some links?


[04-Apr-19 03:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> hi @brianbalsamique , the back end is at https://github.com/sg777/bet and front end is available at https://github.com/sg777/pangea-poker-frontend

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> just to give you a brief update on what's happenening so far is, while testing for a 2 players I can see the message size up to 36KB, so I made changes to send/receive messages of size upto 64 KB in the code, in the front end by enabling debug mode(f12) you can see all the backend communications which are happening via front end client...earlier we have used socket read/write..but now since we are using websocket read/write almost in all API's the write logic needs to be changed....for that I'm rewriting the API's with rest_* names to suit to this...the rest_dev looks like a mess now...I'll clean it once this basic addition of all rest API's are done...from here on..I can see in this week I'll finish off writing all the rest API's...the tricky thing here is..now I'm also writing kind of state machine or parsing JSON messages on the front end , based on the method types the front end logic takes a call which messages should be fed to front end UI and which needs to be forwarded to whom at the back end....one can see the the what's been done by setting up the bet node and running thr front-end on localhost in debug mode on browser can see the communications..


[07-Apr-19 06:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @miner707  sure, but at this moment we don't have many devs..


[08-Apr-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> @sg777 so we use the `rest_dev` branch with the pangea front end?   i'm just briefing someone to have a look at it and seeing if they can get something testable and working end of month.


[08-Apr-19 09:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo(KomodoPioneers)> so looks like maybe something can be started to dev against the new changes in about a week (maybe 2 weeks) with the changes you want to make?


[08-Apr-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes @Mylo(KomodoPioneers)  we have to use `rest_dev` branch with the pangea front end...by this month end we surely be having something to test and play on front end


[08-Apr-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> if  any dev wants to play, still one can setup the `master` branch and play via terminal..


[12-Apr-19 06:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> Hi, I made poker working with the front end..though in the ui not many things are updated...please check the details here

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> at this moment on local host using gui one can play the poker....with little changes to gui and testing is done...from then making it to play over multi-node is a matter of one day work for me...


[12-Apr-19 06:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> some of you already set up the back end nodes....just checkout to rest_dev branch and try testing with gui on your local machine..and then we see what information needs to be added on the gui so that looks more user friendly and playable...

[13-Apr-19 03:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> and to support developers, need funds, I guess

Hi @Decker 
I'd like to add verushash 2.0 algo into yiimp opensource project. I need C code for this.
I noticed you have this https://github.com/DeckerSU/verushash-example but I think that it is for verushash 1.1 but dukeleto is adding verushash 2 into chips.
I noticed that you forked ccminer to add verushash 1.1 and you forked yiimp (but I did not see any new commits).
Can you help me ?

Chips seems like an interesting project. Why is the market volume so low?


[07-Jul-19 06:35 AM] phm87#7395
Most is already mined so there is no pool with autoswitch that dumps any chips. Holders hodls and do not sell on CEX. You will find few OTC sellers on chips'discord or on Bartelly.

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> now one can play the poker game remotely by just running one player node using the old GUI remotely provided there is `DCV` and `BVV` nodes are up running...the branches one need to consider for this are `poker_test` of `pangea-poker-frontend ` and `bet` repos...I'm updating the instructions to start the node in the backend and to play using the GUI shortly in the README file and share some video regarding it.......apart from that with the new GUI pixelshove is developing I guess he is close...

[dscrd-chips] <pixelshove> I'm close. I will send a full gameplay video tomorrow. Backend integration takes a little longer than I originally anticipated. If all goes well, playable version sometime next week.

Thanks for your patience!

[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> For those that were interested in a CHIPS mobile wallet. Chameleon v3 wallet has been released and has CHIPS support! Not only that, you can store your KMD and other assetchains on there. I'd highly recommend the wallet and would like to thank @PTYX and @Instel7 for adding support for us. Please check out your native app store for Chameleon Pay.


[08-Jul-19 06:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Instel7> @NutellaLicka Thanks to you and to all the chips/kmd community 👌, let us know if you're interested on adding other coins

[dscrd-chips] <pixelshove> Here is the gameplay demo of the GUI. 

The video recorded the pixels 1 to 1 so it looks a bit mushy. But be assured that it's much more crisp in real life (since pretty much every graphic is a vector).

Keep in mind that the first testable version will be considerably slower than what you see here due to latency occurring while communicating with the backend. It's something that we will need to work on for better UX.

[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @pixelshove In HU it looks like:

The button in heads-up has a few defining characteristics that make it unlike any other position in poker:

    The button also posts the small blind.
    The button acts first pre-flop and last post-flop.


[09-Jul-19 01:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> looking good !


[09-Jul-19 02:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <pixelshove> @hyperDEX yeah I know that. Seems like the backend doesn't work like that btw cc @sg777

[09-Jul-19 09:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @pixelshove didn't get that, is that the demo which you shown is not on the bet backend repo?


[09-Jul-19 09:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> Or share front end repo details with me, I can test it on the backend bet repo


[09-Jul-19 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo> Haha, i had +ve feedback from kmd rebrand  doc lead, sidd on how I did kmd.  Will be ok for chips.  I’ll put a few hrs in next week to rejig for chips.  After the season 3 notaries is calm.


[10-Jul-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 the play flow is that when button is SB, preflop it is first to act. Post flop BB is the first to act.


[10-Jul-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Is that how the backend code handles that?


[10-Jul-19 07:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <nael55> that GUI looks great 👍


[10-Jul-19 08:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> as per the backend flow, first preflop happens and then SB and BB happens then the cards are shown to the players for further  betting..I automated SB and BB as I thought those moves are mandatory..

[10-Jul-19 12:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo> funds inbetween small and big blind = all-in.....


[10-Jul-19 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> I'm not sure "how to word it" but
there are elimination situations where the remaining 2 players may or may not have one blind or the other in play (depending on house rules) on the following hand
similar to a "dead button" situation

Can you recommend any desktop (PC) wallet for CHIPS? (Litemode, spv, not full sync)


[10-Jul-19 07:36 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
You can use the verus agama in lite mode, but people have reported a few errors trying to send funds. Otherwise you have ChipsQT that requires full sync, or we have just been added to the Chameleon v3 app, if a mobile wallet suits your fancy.

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @hyperDEX the logic which I written is for texas handlem poker...I followeed  the wiki and some videos related to texas heldem poker..in that it was there that first SB is done then BB is done where(BB=2*SB), let me know if this differes to texas handlem poker logic...I'll make changes accordingly..

[10-Jul-19 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 only in heads up matches does the steps change. If you have at least 3 players, first to act preflop is button, then SB then BB. But then on flop it is SB/BB/Button.

[dscrd-chips] <LocoMB> hey let me just throw out some random thought here - how about using IOTA Tangle instead if lightning for Poker backend messaging? not fast enough? tech too immature? probably both, right? Tangle can be pretty fast when in good marching order, but not quite as fast as LN I think 🌩


[13-Jul-19 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> backend messaging is done through tcp socket, not through lightning-network (the payment does, and it's almost instant, confirmations are only needed for the deposit & withdrawal transactions). I'm still waiting for IOTA to remove the COO.

[16-Jul-19 03:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> In bet repo I made changes in `poker branch for backedn play` and in `rest_dev branch for front end play` and in `poker_test branch for distributed gui play`...please let me know for any errors..


[16-Jul-19 03:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @hyperDEX multiplayer is much faster since I use the network sockets in the backend so that there is very minimal communication via websockets...it's playable now..


[16-Jul-19 03:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> with the new GUI which you & pixelshove is making if the code made avilable to public please let me know, I can help in resolving any backend errors that occur


[16-Jul-19 03:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> in order to play the poker over distributed GUI please use `poker_branch` of bet and pangea-poker-frontend repos..

[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Yes the code will be public once completed @pixelshove can you DM the repo to sg777 please


[17-Jul-19 04:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Pixelshove said we should be done with the GUI by the weekend. @sg777 can you please provide some assistance to him to get the new backend code integrated before then? Also for BJ, do we need to wait for you to do the backend first or can we start that?

@Mylo sorry to keep harassing you but did you get a chance to do a package for the backend and GUI?

[dscrd-chips] <Yassin> if you need ask question, ask @hyperDEX @sg777 @jl777c


[17-Jul-19 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Yassin> ✌


[17-Jul-19 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ixuz> Thanks! I'm a little busy right now but I'll get back here later. 👌


[17-Jul-19 06:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> @hyperDEX can do that in a few clicks, currently all 4 nodes are using sg777 chips repo and not jl777's, probably need to switch to jl777's repo & the latest bet repo & test before cloning more nodes ?


[17-Jul-19 07:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo> 2moro I'll spend cpl hrs on it

[17-Jul-19 07:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @PHBA2061  let me know when you plan to test more than 2 players, mean while I'll make changes to read the number of players from command line..


[17-Jul-19 07:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> hyperDEX said he would want to do some tests this Friday/Saturday with 4-6 players nodes. if I use jl777 chips/master insterad of yours, will it work properly with lightning now ?


[17-Jul-19 07:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes it will work..


[17-Jul-19 07:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> for me adding support in the backend for number of players > 2 is easy but in the gui it require bit more changes...atleast we can try testing commnad line for more number of players..


[17-Jul-19 07:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> from what hyperDEX  said I assume that pixelshove is close to finish hismultiplayer GUI


[17-Jul-19 11:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <pixelshove> 2+ players requires a little more work on the front-end. 2 players is almost done.


[17-Jul-19 12:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Sorry @PHBA2061 we may need more dealer/BVV nodes. I guess we can try HU for now till @sg777 sorts out the backend for >2


[19-Jul-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @PHBA2061 can you give me the node IPs and ports?


[19-Jul-19 02:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Dealer - IP - Port etc


[19-Jul-19 02:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Might be ready to play some HU 😃

[19-Jul-19 07:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 with the GUI as is, it needs the IP of the 1st and 2nd player to start. If we have 2 different people connecting, 1 puts the 1st ip and the 2nd putting the 2nd ip, would they be able to play with each other?


[19-Jul-19 07:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @pixelshove


[19-Jul-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes in the old gui there is no option to input the player IP from the gui directly..we need to hardcode it in the pangeapoker.js, the player just need to hardcode his IP in the `pangeapoker.js`, I guess pixelshove is providing a prompt to enter the IP from gui..


[19-Jul-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Cool do you know the ports used?


[19-Jul-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777


[19-Jul-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @pixelshove can you give player2 as a option entry before you click start?


[19-Jul-19 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <pixelshove> The default ports are 9000, 9001, 9002, 9003. The new gui has a modal on startup that lets you input the IPs


[20-Jul-19 12:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Thanks @pixelshove


[20-Jul-19 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 i have tested the GUI. We really need to find out why the nodes are crashing? Also we need to fix the fold issue ASAP.

[20-Jul-19 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <pixelshove> Fold issue is on me. Solving it today.


[20-Jul-19 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Oh sorry i meant, the backend stops when a winner hand is announced. So right now only 1 hand can play then we have to stop and start again

[dscrd-chips] <miner707> I am guessing no GUI this weekend


[21-Jul-19 03:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @miner707  GUI was delivered but i am currently waiting on sg777 to figure out the node crashing issues and get multiplayer actually working but in the mean time i am debugging the GUI with @pixelshove


[21-Jul-19 03:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> sg777 had some stuff on today but hopefully he can work on these issues this week. Then we can get people to test the GUI


[21-Jul-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @PHBA2061 can you hold off on the new cluster of nodes until the backend stuff is resolved then we can do user testing


[21-Jul-19 04:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> sure, I also think that we must have 1 table working properly before creating more tables


[21-Jul-19 04:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Problem is i did not understand that the 2 player is hard coded in....We cannot even play with 2 different players at the moment even when using 2 player nodes, same dealer/bvv


[21-Jul-19 04:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> I just thought it was max 2 players. Anyways with the player nodes crashing randomly and no way to recover, as well as not being able to go to another hand when one finishes.....there is only so little we can do until that is resolved.


[21-Jul-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PTYX> Will the chips gui be reachable via webview?


[21-Jul-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Yes but you will be required to SSH into the nodes


[21-Jul-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> This is just a short term thing, once we have packaged it we will get players to run it locally


[22-Jul-19 01:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <LocoMB> I was just wondering- why doesn't Komodore64 Games put some attention to CHIPS wallet? with that massive market,, this could generate some profit and attention for them


[22-Jul-19 03:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> different tech, different project. Could be partnerships in the future, tho


[22-Jul-19 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miner707> So we waiting on sg777


[22-Jul-19 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miner707> Are there two GUIs being made?


[22-Jul-19 06:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Pixelshove is the dev i hired, i am not aware of any dev team doing it.


[22-Jul-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Yes currently waiting on sg777 to find out why the player nodes are crashing and to get multiplayer working.


[22-Jul-19 06:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> But the GUI is essentially done.


[22-Jul-19 12:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> I'd like to send 20% of my notary node mining rewards to CHIPS fund, can you confirm that it is this address ? ``RChipsMFstBYP4VR4sSY4sX17rV5TFpovc`` Maybe @jorian  knows

[22-Jul-19 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @hyperDEX sorry last two days im down with the fever, im looking into the crashing issues now..


[23-Jul-19 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> No worries @sg777 hope you are better now.


[23-Jul-19 12:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Please let me know if you want me to do more testing. I can get backtraces if you need some more.


[23-Jul-19 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> sure, I'll let you know ....in the backend which branch are you using `rest_dev`?


[23-Jul-19 02:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> yes , it is `rest_dev` branch

[23-Jul-19 01:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 yes i know but i get random player node crashes and you can only play 1  hand. We also cannot get 2 players to connect to different player nodes and connect to same dealer/BVV node


[23-Jul-19 01:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> @sg777 just because it works for you, that is alpha level. to get to beta it needs to work for others too


[23-Jul-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @hyperDEX I'll change it to play multiple hands, `We also cannot get 2 players to connect to different player nodes and connect to same dealer/BVV node` you mean the players accessing the gui from different browsers?


[23-Jul-19 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @jl777c sure, will be fixing these issues..


[23-Jul-19 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 What i would like to do is to do the following:

Player 1 - SSH into dealer/BVV/player 1 node.


[23-Jul-19 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Player 2 - SSH into player 2 node


[23-Jul-19 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Play game between the 2 players from different locations. Once this can be done, we go to 6 then 9/10.


[23-Jul-19 11:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Eventually we get dealer/BVV node out of the equation altogether (They are just running somehow and waiting for players to connect) and have player 1 and player 2 connecting to nodes.

Then finally have player nodes actually in a package that people run and start playing.


[24-Jul-19 04:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 @pixelshove How will a lobby work? How can we discover dealer and BVV nodes?


[24-Jul-19 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Or are we going to hardcode things into the KMD NN?


[24-Jul-19 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> sure, ill test with my poker_test branch, I just finished adding up the logic, where the players can play indefinetely until they have funds(in the earlier case as you mentioned after one hand we need to start all the nodes again)


[24-Jul-19 04:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Is there a option to add more funds?


[24-Jul-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> no, actually we need to add that option in gui such that...it will show the ln-address of the player on the gui and the player can fund to it at any time..


[24-Jul-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> at this moment before starting of the game, players should need to load their ln-wallets


[24-Jul-19 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Ok but like normal websites, they have a balance but what they buy in may not be their full balance


[24-Jul-19 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> So how would a user "top up" from balance


[24-Jul-19 05:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> they can fund to any address in their ln-wallet to `topup` the balance..I'll check with pixelshove to see how we can display these ln-wallet chips address onto the gui so that, the players can fund them on the moment..


[25-Jul-19 05:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 yeah but lets consider you have $500, table you are playing on is $0.1/0.2 with max buying of 100BB. You sit down with $20


[25-Jul-19 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Once i lose the $20, i should not need to deposit some more. I have 480 left in my wallet


[25-Jul-19 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> let us clearly define all these type of requirements


[25-Jul-19 07:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> sg777 is not poker player so if we dont clearly define things upfront, there will be a lot of iterations to get it right


[25-Jul-19 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> Do you have à tutoriel for launch poker party please?


[25-Jul-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> here it is  <https://discordapp.com/channels/455737840169386016/455737840668770315/588046091874861189>


[25-Jul-19 06:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @hyperDEX at this moment whatever that is funded to chips address in ln-wallet im populating that amount onto the gui....say suppose you funded 500 CHIPS to your ln-wallet in the gui it shows 500 CHIPS, are you asking like limiting say suppose X(x<500) CHIPS on particular table from the player? if so during player join we need to allow the user on gui like amount of CHIPS he is interested to spend on that particular table(since by default he is allowed to play all what he have)...


[25-Jul-19 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> @sg777 I think the idea is to have an option to choose how much you want to buy in on a table for. 
For example, when I approach a poker table, I may have $1000 in my physical wallet, but I only put down $250 on the table to play.


[25-Jul-19 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> If I lose that $250, I may consider buying in again with any amount of my $750 left


[25-Jul-19 06:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Well someone could join with 5000BB and just go in every hand, if the rest of the table has 100bb this player needs to lose lots of all ins to be broke


[25-Jul-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> In poker there is short stack (20BB max buyin) normal (100BB max buyin) deep i think is 500BB


[25-Jul-19 06:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> BB=Big blind for those wondering


[25-Jul-19 06:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> I agree. Having a max buy in limit on the table, relative to the big blind, is a great idea.
Also having the option to buy in from xBB(min buy in) to yBB(max buy in)


[25-Jul-19 06:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Maybe these limits can be a function of the dealer node. They set the Blinds and the buy in min/max


[25-Jul-19 07:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Yep, this function needs to be replicated in the long term, otherwise like i said i will sit down with 5000BB and go all in.

100BB
200BB
400BB
800BB
1600BB
3200BB
6400BB

So the 5000BB needs to lose 6 all ins in a row to the same player to go broke 😄


[25-Jul-19 08:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> so when each player join the table do we need to keep the restriction about min and max amounts that the player should put on the table?


[25-Jul-19 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> I think the dealer node should be able to choose for their table


[25-Jul-19 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Like they choose what blinds they set as well


[25-Jul-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Minimum should be set in stone (x number of big blinds)
But max should be variable if able


[25-Jul-19 09:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Maybe we can set it to something reasonable in the mean time


[25-Jul-19 09:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> The player should then have an option to "buy in" (put x amount of CHIPS) down on the table between min and max


[25-Jul-19 11:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> sure, don't know much about poker, small doubt, for example player1 joined the table with say suppose $100 and player2 with $200, and there is a scenario if both go allin, isn't it unfair to the player2 since though the odds of winning is same for each player but the bet amount are not in same proportionate


[25-Jul-19 11:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> In that case, although player 2 is all in, they're only betting with $100 of that all in. Unless player 3 calls the $200 all in.


[25-Jul-19 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Player 2 is raising the bet for other players, and calling the all in for player 1


[25-Jul-19 11:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> So if player 2 lost, they wouldnt lose their $100 because of that reason


[25-Jul-19 11:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> oh..okay assuming there are only 2 players, in that case even if player2 lost also he gets his $100 back since player1 put a maximum of only $100


[25-Jul-19 11:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Yes


[25-Jul-19 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> in the case of multiplayer(more than 2) if a player forced to do allin in the initial round of betting...so he has to wait until all other players done playing further round of betting?


[25-Jul-19 11:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> `Two players all-in for different amounts: In this scenario, you take the amount of the smaller stack from the big stack into the pot, returning the difference to the big-stack player.`


[25-Jul-19 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> With 3 players or more players
`Short stack all-in against two players: When a short stack is all-in against two larger stacks, the blinds, short stack, plus the amount of the short stack from each larger stack is placed in the main pot. All players are eligible to win this pot.

The two players on the side are now free to play and bet as usual into a side pot, which only they are eligible to win. (This means there can be two winners in the hand - a side pot and a main pot winner.)`


[25-Jul-19 11:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> `Multiple players all-in: When multiple players are all-in, you must make multiple side pots. Make a main pot as described above. After you've done that, repeat the process with the next-smallest stack.

Continue to do this until all stacks are accounted for. Make sure to keep track of who is eligible for what pots.`


[25-Jul-19 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay so is it the case that everytime a player undergoes allin, a side pot will be created?


[25-Jul-19 11:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Not every time


[25-Jul-19 11:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I mean provided if two or more left on the table


[25-Jul-19 11:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> If everyone else has enough chips to just call them, and it's the last hand, it won't


[25-Jul-19 11:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> The only time there will be a side pot, is if there are more bets over the all in amount


[25-Jul-19 11:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay so when some player went allin, if there are any other players (more than 1) left who can raise the stake in that case a side pot will be created, am i right here?


[25-Jul-19 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> It will be created yes. But if nobody calls that bet, then the bet goes back to the player who raised it, and the hand continues as an all in


[25-Jul-19 11:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> and the side pot is only the amount above the all in


[25-Jul-19 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay, so based on this, side pot or main pot always contains the equal contribution from all the players whover in the pot..


[25-Jul-19 11:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> `The golden, overarching rule to keep in mind is that each player matches each opponents' bet with as much as is left in his stack.
All players still in the pot are obligated to match whatever the smallest stack has contributed to the pot. This is the "main pot.”
The player with the next smallest stack then is required to match remaining bets from players with bigger stacks, and so on.
This is put into a “side pot” with each respective player.`


[25-Jul-19 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> If that clears it up


[25-Jul-19 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> It gets super complicated if everyone has different amounts


[25-Jul-19 11:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> <https://www.pokerlistings.com/rules-for-poker-all-in-situations-poker-side-pot-calculator>


[25-Jul-19 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Obviously with a simple  pot calculator it is not an issue


[25-Jul-19 11:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes cleared now..


[25-Jul-19 11:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> How are hand values handled at the moment?


[25-Jul-19 11:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Sorry I've been quite busy IRL and with the NN season starting, I haven't had much time to put towards CHIPS


[25-Jul-19 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> in two player im not returning the differences in stake to the losing player incase if he bets higher during the allin scenario..need to make few changes now


[25-Jul-19 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> during allin im just adding whatver bet amount are to the pot and paying it to the winning player full pot..


[25-Jul-19 11:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> will correct that now..


[25-Jul-19 11:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> oh yeah lucky we picked this up!


[25-Jul-19 11:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Maybe it would be better to try and hard code it for 3 people. Because having multiple people will account for other combinations of things


[25-Jul-19 11:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> instead of 1v1


[25-Jul-19 11:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> where you won't see multi pots and stuff


[25-Jul-19 11:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> and multiple all in calls


[25-Jul-19 11:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> raise over a call, raise over a raise, etc


[25-Jul-19 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes sure, I'll hardcode atleast to 3 and need to test the side pots..


[25-Jul-19 11:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> 😃


[25-Jul-19 11:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> now im getting what @hyperDEX  is asking above, thanks for the clarification...regarding the min and max amount do you have any suggestions?


[25-Jul-19 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> in multiple of BB


[25-Jul-19 11:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> standby


[25-Jul-19 11:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Min: 10Big Blinds Max:100Big Blinds ?


[25-Jul-19 11:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> But I think this should be a dealer node function when they setup their table


[25-Jul-19 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> So a dealer could setup a deep table and let 500BB


[25-Jul-19 11:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> but this shouldn't be the standard


[25-Jul-19 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay in the gui we should provide in some configurable way for the delaer node..


[25-Jul-19 11:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I think i should need to collect what are all the information that dealer has to mandate and provide some means to configure that information from the gui


[25-Jul-19 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Yeah, I'm not sure how the dealer nodes work just yet, But I understand they set the blind amounts, is this correct? I.E. 100Chips small blind, 200Cips big blind.


[25-Jul-19 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes 0.001 CHIPS SB and 0.002 BB at this moment..


[25-Jul-19 11:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> that also I hardcoded in the code


[25-Jul-19 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Yeah so that will want to be configurable as well. It's fine to hardcode for now


[25-Jul-19 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> In my opinion


[25-Jul-19 11:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay


[25-Jul-19 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Another thing we need to think about is how to show hands or not at the end of the game


[25-Jul-19 11:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> For example, making the GUI do it automatically if you're required to, or having an option to show if you're not required to


[26-Jul-19 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> My GUI dev is on a hourly rate now. Can we please get the functionality to play before we add more things 😛


[26-Jul-19 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 is multiplayer working now and multihands?


[26-Jul-19 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Aha, that is so fair


[26-Jul-19 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> I think we are at a good place with the GUI development. We just need to make sure the backend works for simple things like multiplayer to be able to play a few hands then increase that from 2 players up to 9/10. Once we are at that stage then i am more than happy to pay for more development.


[26-Jul-19 12:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Along the way we can adjust and fix GUI issues but i think at this point, there is no point in adding more functionality if we cannot play together with the current GUI


[26-Jul-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> True true


[26-Jul-19 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Well is it clear to sg777 what needs to be done to get that working, from your point of view?


[26-Jul-19 02:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Yes he said he is working on the ability to play more than 1 hand before resetting everything and being able to have more than 1 person be able to play to the same dealer/bvv nodes. @sg777 when do you think you will be able to get that functionality done so we can test?


[26-Jul-19 03:17 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I also made necessary changes in `poker_test` branch to support the playing of hands from different browsers..i'll discuss the changes needs to be done in the new gui with pixelshove which are very minor so soon one can play..


[26-Jul-19 04:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> This is awesome 😃 Can't wait to try it out


[26-Jul-19 04:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Pixelshove is looking into the fixes needed.


[26-Jul-19 04:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 were you able to get multiple player working? So 1 connects to dealer/bvv/player 1 then another player connects to player 2 and they play?


[26-Jul-19 04:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes it's working on my old gui, need to make minor changes for the pixelshove gui, he is looking into it..


[26-Jul-19 04:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Cool thanks, was the restriction of 2 removed or we still on 2?


[26-Jul-19 04:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> from the gui we need to support for that...


[26-Jul-19 04:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> or if takes more efforts, I'll make changes to pass table size from commandline whenever the dealer node starts from the backend..im fine with anyway


[26-Jul-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 I think the dealer node should set table size. Should not be up to the GUI to set this


[26-Jul-19 03:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> It would be the one to keep track of it too so 6 max cant have 10 players

[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> @everyone 
I will be doing a short interview with @𝕃𝕠𝕠𝕋𝕫 for Crypto Core Media, tomorrow at 0000 UTC time on the 28th of July. (in about 18hours). I'd love your feedback for any important points you think I should discuss. The idea will be to provide a general, not to technical, overview of the project at the current stage. I will plan to talk a bit about the history of the project up until now, what is currently being worked on and what the future looks like for CHIPS. Feel free to DM me with any points, or feedback afterwards. 

You can listen live at https://ccmedia.airtime.pro/ and we will post links of the recording afterwards. :CHIPS:

[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> do we have  a plan like 1. release app easy to set up and play game 2. get more exchanges (graviex?) 3. get some social/media articles exposures? + working hours (or bounties amounts) estimation to get these things done?


[28-Jul-19 12:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> always good to have some estimations


[28-Jul-19 12:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋> if we have it then community may fond some more bounties for progress, I personally do not fund anything that do not have estimations/reasonable plan/etrc 😃


[28-Jul-19 12:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Currently, there is no plan like that. Currently, the focus is on dev. In true KMD like fashion, if the tech/product isn't there, why market it 😛


[28-Jul-19 12:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> The GUI is ready to go. Waiting for the backend to be ready/fixed so we can play by connecting to remote nodes.


[28-Jul-19 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Whilst we are waiting, i would hope there is a easy way of packaging it into a nice installer (no eta on this nor is any actively working on this)


[28-Jul-19 12:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> We do not need more exchanges nor any marketing right now.


[28-Jul-19 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 can you let me know when you have fixed the issue to be able to play multiple hands?


[28-Jul-19 01:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Are these my GUI specific issues or your one works?


[29-Jul-19 02:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <pixelshove> @sg777 messaged me about his updates regarding multiple hands. I'm looking into it now, will update you soon.


[29-Jul-19 03:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Mylo> i'm seeing if i can package it up in .deb format @hyperDEX otherwise, i'll look at simpleinstaller option.


[29-Jul-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <pixelshove> I think https://electronjs.org/ would be a good solution to convert the new GUI into a standalone desktop app. That way it's gonna be much easier and cleaner to play on multiplbe tables at the same time. With Electron, it's very straightforward to convert a React app into a stanadlone one - and the best that it's cross-platform.

[29-Jul-19 06:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Chief Crypto> Hello, I was wondering if anyone else who sent their CHIPS to a VerusAgama address when the AGAMA vulnerability issues took place is now having an issue sending the CHIPS out of their VerusAGAMA wallet? I get an "invalid pub key" error when trying to send them out of the wallet.


[29-Jul-19 07:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> the issue is known back then, because Verus Agama doesn't recognize CHIPS address format


[29-Jul-19 07:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Chief Crypto> So we can send them TO versus agama, but cannot yet send them back out?


[29-Jul-19 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Chief Crypto> I was able to successfully send them to a newly created seed in Verus Agama back in June, but have not tried to move them again until today.


[29-Jul-19 07:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> to send them out you need to use another wallet, CHIPS QT for example <https://github.com/DeckerSU/chips3/releases/tag/v0.14.99_decker_2>


[29-Jul-19 07:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Chief Crypto> So I can use my seed from VerusAgama with that wallet to access my coins?


[29-Jul-19 07:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> a lot of people in this Discord have used that, but I use a CLI wallet, so I'm not 100% sure it has an option to import your seed or not

[dscrd-chips] <Chief Crypto> Thanks for the info.


[29-Jul-19 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> how about 3Gb ? CHIPS only takes about 3.1 Gb


[29-Jul-19 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Chief Crypto> Nice!


[29-Jul-19 07:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Chief Crypto> Much better


[29-Jul-19 07:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> if you stuck while syncing or if it is slow, try manually adding some nodes from this <http://chips.komodochainz.info/network>

[dscrd-chips] <Chief Crypto> I don't see any way to use QT wallet to get my CHIPS out of Verus Agama wallet, unfortunately. 

There must be some other folks who migrated their coins to Verus Agama in June and have the same problem. Not sure what to do to free the coins. I never would have sent them in to the Verus Agama if I knew they would be trapped there, but people were saying it was safe at the time.

[dscrd-chips] <phm87> @Chief Crypto  I don't know how to put a seed into a CLI daemon. Usually, I convert the seed to a WIF (privatekey) that I import into the coin daemon. To convert the seed to the CHIPS WIF, I use Decker's tool (I note down the address and the WIF):
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/notary/generate-privkeys-third-party-coins-from-passphrase.html#install-dependencies
Then when you have the private key (WIF) you can import it:
```chips-cli importprivkey XXXXX```

[29-Jul-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> (Please never share your private keys nor your seeds)


[29-Jul-19 09:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> The importprivkey will take a while, please do not stop the command/prompt. You can check what is going on from another terminal by checking CHIPS debug.log : ``tail -f .chips/debug.log``


[29-Jul-19 09:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> When it did finish, you must check that the address is properly imported : ``chips-cli validateaddress Address`` (on the address, not on the WIF), if you see mine:true it is perfect


[29-Jul-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> from the output of Decker's tool, the "Compressed WIF" is the WIF (privatekey) when the "Compressed Address" is the address


[29-Jul-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> Remark : there are other tools to convert a seed into a WIF


[29-Jul-19 09:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Chief Crypto> I am rather non-technical-abled, as I never used the command prompt for much other than starting old video games on Windows 3.1 back in the day, but I can follow a good walkthrough. I suppose I have some basics to learn in this case.


[29-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> I am in the train, I cannot make a walkthrough right now but I'll make one tonight. Using Decker tool is not complicated, please feel free to give a try. i'll send more detailled instructions later


[29-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Chief Crypto> And thanks for the info, of course.


[29-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> You're welcome.


[29-Jul-19 09:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Chief Crypto> Ill give it a shot. 😃


[29-Jul-19 09:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> Do not use an online tool to convert your seed (many hackers created such websites). After installing Decker tool, you can cut Internet from the computer to do the seed-to-WIF convertion offline and delete the seed from the computer before turning on internet


[29-Jul-19 10:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Chief Crypto> I figured it out. I was using an old version of Verus Agama. I downloaded the latest version, and now I can send my coins out. =/


[29-Jul-19 10:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Chief Crypto> Hopefully, this will help someone else who didn't think of the obvious right away.


[29-Jul-19 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <phm87> @Chief Crypto congrats ! I am happy that you solved your isdue. I don t use agama nor verus agama


[30-Jul-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> FYI seed phrases are only compatible with light wallets. Full node wallets do not use seed phrases


[30-Jul-19 05:46 AM] phm87#7395
@dukeleto that s why I suggested to use decker tool to get the corresponding privkey. Thank you for the explanation. I did not know for light wallets

[dscrd-chips] <pbca26> i've made a CHIPS fork of btc electrum wallet
disabled non-related stuff like RBF, dynamic fees and hw wallets support

instructions how to install dev version (python):
git clone https://github.com/pbca26/electrum -b dev chips-electrum
sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt5
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
python3 -m pip install .[fast]
sudo apt-get install protobuf-compiler
protoc --proto_path=electrum --python_out=electrum electrum/paymentrequest.proto

the above steps assumes you already have python3 installed

run it with verbose param:
cd chips-electrum
python3 run_electrum -v

i haven't tested all features so let me know if you find something in out of service state
regular send/receive should work fine

[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 Can we please investigate the player node crashes. I am paying for a GUI dev that cannot do what they need to 80% of the time due to these crashes.


[30-Jul-19 01:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> I am paying by the hour and this is very inefficient.


[30-Jul-19 07:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @Mylo when do you think you will get some time to do that? Maybe these player node crashes are related to the remote nature of them.. If so, then then them running locally might avoid the issue?


[30-Jul-19 08:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> maybe you should pay @sg777 too 😉

[30-Jul-19 08:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> The kind that's tired of you making big splashy posts about your $
a) if you didn't what the general populous to chime in, then it should have been in a private manner
b) Why would I "do something" when you're already paying someone to do it? So that you can cry more about how you overpaid for a GUI and got beat to market?

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @hyperDEX  I'm just playing the game using your backend nodes, and it's not crashing, if you can't pull the laetst changes and say it's crashing I can't help with it...


[30-Jul-19 09:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> whenever it's crashes please do `backtrace` and create an issue in my repo and inform me....


[30-Jul-19 09:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I'm testing on `https://github.com/norbertdragan/lightning-chips-frontend/commits/develop` repo, you can see the last commit is made on july 26th and im running the same develop branch as gui...


[30-Jul-19 10:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @sg777 @pixelshove said he sent logs of the crash to you, so the logs show that the player node is not on latest?

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> when I see today it was last compiled on july 29th on your machines..


[30-Jul-19 10:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> i'm doing clean build and updating them..


[30-Jul-19 10:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Ok thanks.


[30-Jul-19 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> So with the new hands, players can play until 1 runs out of money now?


[30-Jul-19 10:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Can 2 people connect to different player nodes but play together or is that still a work in progress?


[30-Jul-19 10:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes with new hands, one can play other run out of money..for 2 people to play on new gui some changes needs to be done, which haven't been done yet, im aware where to make changes to the gui, I push those chanegs to pixelshove repo and will test them today..


[30-Jul-19 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Thanks. For the game logic it would be

Someone starts dealer node
Someone starts BVV node

Then player 1 just needs to connect to player node 1
Player 2 to player node 2

Do player 1 or 2 need to be SSHed into either the dealer/bvv node?


[30-Jul-19 10:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> all player nodes and bvv should beconnected to dcv or dealer node..


[30-Jul-19 10:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> the dcv and other nodes are connected using publisher-subscriber model..


[30-Jul-19 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> dcv publishes the data and all other nodes subscribes to that...and each node individually push the data to dcv if they have anything to send..


[30-Jul-19 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> So how do you see the game logic? Both players need to SSH into the dealer node?


[30-Jul-19 10:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> not ssh when you start the player node in the backend...`./bet player <ip address of the dcv node>`


[30-Jul-19 10:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> for bvv its `./bet bvv <ip address of the dcv node>`


[30-Jul-19 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> when the player start the gui from it the player only connects to it's backend using wensockets...(unlike now from the same gui a connection is made to all the backend nodes)...and since in the backend these nodes got connected using the network sockets all the game logic communications happens through backend network sockets...


[30-Jul-19 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> whenever there is need of some input from the player, the corresponding detailes pushed to the gui and player can take action of his interest..


[30-Jul-19 10:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> oh cool


[30-Jul-19 10:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Well we use remote nodes right now so we have to SSH into the player nodes


[30-Jul-19 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes we can use, right now I ssh ed into your nodes and runniing dcv,bvv, player1 and player2 nodes..


[30-Jul-19 10:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> and accessing the gui which is running on my local machine..


[30-Jul-19 10:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Ok so once you have this working we need to run bet on the BVV and all player nodes to point to the DCV


[30-Jul-19 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> yes exactly..


[30-Jul-19 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> if you see the playing of commandline version of our poker game where it works like that all other nodes connect to DCV..


[30-Jul-19 10:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Cool ok, do you think it should be done before the weekend? How hard would it be to change from 2 players to more than 2?


[30-Jul-19 10:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> If you see in this screenshot once the hand gets completed a reset is called to clear the specific values of previous hand and new hand is started automatically

[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> I will give it a go later today.


[30-Jul-19 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> One other thing, you see in the GUI the blinds are 3/6, players are playing like 500k/1m or something, is that a GUI issue or something on the backend?


[30-Jul-19 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> we are pushing this string from backend "NL Hold'em<br>Blinds: 3/6" and I can change it..


[30-Jul-19 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I don't know if this has any significance, tell me right string I can replace


[30-Jul-19 10:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> What controls the blinds for the players right now?


[30-Jul-19 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I hardcoded the smallblind and bigblind values at this moment


[30-Jul-19 10:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> We need to maybe change the string to a option we pass through to DCV


[30-Jul-19 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> ./bet holdemnl 36 on the DCV or something


[30-Jul-19 10:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Can we change the string to 100/200 and match that value on the backend just to get some consistency?


[30-Jul-19 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I can change that


[30-Jul-19 10:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Thanks 😃


[30-Jul-19 10:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> wc 👍


[30-Jul-19 10:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Once you get the 2 player working, is the limit of 2 still hardcoded or can i spin up more player nodes?


[30-Jul-19 10:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> it's hardcoded since if I remove we need to enter those many IP's of the players from the gui and in the backend also we need to have those many nodes...for that I hardcoded...


[30-Jul-19 10:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> I'll add a way to pass the number of players from commandline...


[30-Jul-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> `Texas Hold’em Poker:100/200` is this string fine for game name?


[30-Jul-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Should we do it just in the param on the dcv node?


[30-Jul-19 10:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Texas Hold’em NL 100/200 should be fine.


[30-Jul-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> if we do in DCV node, it can publish that info to other nodes..


[30-Jul-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> DCV ./bet gametype blinds number of players min/max deposit


[30-Jul-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> just need to add one publisher messgae for that


[30-Jul-19 10:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Something like that


[30-Jul-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay sure I'll provide a way to configure those from the commandline..


[30-Jul-19 10:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Need to figure out how to do this in the future with a lobby


[30-Jul-19 10:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Im guessing the dcv nodes would just be running with whatever the params are so say it started with  holdem NL 1/2 blinds 6 players 20/100 buyin max


[30-Jul-19 10:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Then the lobby would show that, then players just join when they want to play


[30-Jul-19 10:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> okay


[30-Jul-19 11:45 PM] OsTa#2589
WTS 37000 chips for 1 BTC


[31-Jul-19 01:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> What other game types would there be?


[31-Jul-19 01:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> ```./bet "gametype" "table size" "blinds" "limit"``` For DCV nodes.
`"gametype"`: 'THP' = Texas Hold'em Poker

`"tablesize"`: 'x' = max number of players on the table. x/2 rounded down is minimum number.

`"blinds"`: 'x' = amount for the big blind. (in 1000's of satoshis?)
Small blind is always x/2.

`"limit"`: Max deposit amount. (in 1000's of satoshis?)
'NL' = No Limit
'x' = x * big blind
*Min amount = 3x big blind for all tables.(or other amount)*

Something like this would be great. Feel free to add/remove/adjust as required
How long would the table last for once the DCV has set it up? 1 round, x rounds, forever?


[31-Jul-19 01:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Or you could just make the command
```./bet "gametype"```
Then have response/reply commands afterwards that ask for table size, blinds and limit.

[31-Jul-19 03:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> @miner707 
I guess you should re-read what I wrote
I don't disrespect his "doing bits for the community", in fact I said that it's appreciated
What I don't respect is is his continual going on about how much money he spends on his own private projects and how that should make him special above others.

sg777 has done a **lot** of feken work and **that** should be respected far more than some bullshit about "I am paying by the hour and this is very inefficient."

The private project you mentioned is to make a open source GUI for THIS community. If i did not do it, no one would and we would be no closer to releasing a playable app.  So take your need for attention and you can shove it up your ass.


[31-Jul-19 04:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> I don't think this discussion is needed, nor is it necessary for us to hear in a public forum. I'd recommend taking it up in DM so you guys can work through this beef in a private fashion


[31-Jul-19 04:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <ComputerGenie 👴🏼📢> `If i did not do it, no one would `
It's nice to see that you still hold those narcissistic delusions of grandeur

[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Any update on VerusHash progress @dukeleto 
Anything we can do in the mean time to aid the process or prepare for testing?


[31-Jul-19 05:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> Calm guys


[31-Jul-19 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <bluewind> @NutellaLicka I agree however ,sometimes it not healthy to bury things in private an healthy community will always have open argument once in a while we are all different with our own sense of reality , maybe @hyperDEX you could  compensate  sg777 maybe on a short term contract base for gui  so he can be full time dev and on it ,  seems efficient just a thought


[31-Jul-19 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <helios> The project is difficult but it is awesome. And the road is good


[31-Jul-19 05:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> I believe HyperDEX is being very generous towards the project and wants to see it succeed. sg777 is also in the same boat and is being compensated for their time and effort. 
I'd hesitate on commenting about how other people are using their money or speculating on how they shouldnt/should have used it. If you feel the need to, I'd say put your money where your mouth is ;)

Edit: a word


[31-Jul-19 05:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <bluewind> very much agreed.


[31-Jul-19 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> I also believe Genie wants to see this project to succeed and they have put their time effort and money into helping as well. 
I didnt want that last comment to be mistaken for any sort of bias. I was speaking more generally than anything.

[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> guys, do you all get  `b` address on DigitalPrice for deposit?


[31-Jul-19 08:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> i sent some to that address and it ended up on an `R` address


[31-Jul-19 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> addresses start with a `b` are pay-to-script-hash addresses, in this case it probably is multisig address but I'm not entirely sure.
The are valid, just not as widely used as `R` addresses


[31-Jul-19 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> yeah it's weird and i am a bit worried as the deposit is not showing up on the exchange. contacted them anyway. thanks


[31-Jul-19 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> `b` addrs are multisig/P2SH, not widely used


[31-Jul-19 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @bluewind I was under the impression that @sg777 was being paid by the Komodo team, if not i can try to help there too, others are free to help as well. People do not understand that I am not being paid by the team nor directed by them to build a GUI. I saw a problem that we needed to fix to get adoption so spent my own money making sure we get that done.


[31-Jul-19 01:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> If everyone waited around for everyone else to do something, nothing will get done.


[31-Jul-19 01:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <allbits> Respect 💯


[31-Jul-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> sg777 is being paid


[31-Jul-19 01:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> @hyperDEX is doing something that few others in the ecosystem have done


[31-Jul-19 01:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> anybody that is critical of hyperdex is not thinking about the benefit of the ecosystem


[31-Jul-19 02:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <miner707> The ecosystem thrives with people like hyperdex taking initiatives that improves the ecosystem as a whole , making new product on top of the platform ,isnt that what jl envisioned when creating KMD, so it best we encourage such individuals


[31-Jul-19 02:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <bluewind> yes not sure it healthy to have a community that discourage prolific contributors not a good rep as jl777 noted


[31-Jul-19 03:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Thanks for the comments everyone, i really appreciate it.

I am not doing these things for the fame or the money, i just want to see KMD and the whole ecosystem to succeed. Over reacting yesterday was not a great look, so I apologize. Will try harder to ignore these things in the future.

[31-Jul-19 11:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @hyperDEX , I created a branch `more_players` where I enabled to play more than 2 players from the commandline will test once the mining nodes are up..once tested I'll merge them into `rest_dev` brach..

only mac and linux binaries
don't have access to win at the moment
i can look into bip44 and consequent hw wallets integration in future
doesn't seem too hard to do but definitely a time consuming endeavor

[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> ```To whom it may concern,

I am writing as a representative of the CHIPS project and would like to provide an update for the CHIPS coin you have listed.

Currently the coin is still active and is in heavy development. Our development activities can be tracked in our discord at link here and in the github repo's linked below.

Firstly, you may be reading this and asking yourself, what is CHIPS? Well, read on.
CHIPS is a trust-less, peer-to-peer, secure, on chain poker application.
Other online poker facilitators use centralised servers to host the poker application itself, requiring users to trust their companies and connect to their nodes. They also may even accept cryptocurrency as a form of payment, but unlike these applications, CHIPS uses actual blockchain technology to: 
- run a p2p blockchain that stores the cryptocurrency used for betting (also secured by Komodo dPoW),
- uses a p2p cryptographic function for deck shuffling and allocation (shamir secret keys), and
- uses lightning network technology to create a real time betting platform.

Below are links to both of the explorers, plus some exchanges we are now listed on. 
Explorers:

[02-Aug-19 01:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> ```I would also like to add that we have multiple github repos & projects we are currently contributing to in development of the CHIPS poker application.
The CHIPS blockchain itself: 
https://github.com/jl777/chips3
The CHIPS LN:
https://github.com/jl777/lightning/tree/dev
The CHIPS betting application/protocol:
https://github.com/sg777/bet

I hope this provides conclusive evidence that CHIPS is still quite active, although with low liquidity due to an intensive development phase. If you would like more information or clarification, please don't hesitate to reply to this email, or find me in the CHIPS discord.

Regards,
NutellaLicka
CHIPS ecosystem contributor```

I have sent this email to CoinGecko, CoinPaprika & CMC. Hopefully this will provide some much needed updates.

[02-Aug-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> @hyperDEX  need to switch branch, all 4 nodes are currently on `rest_dev` branch, `bet` will take DCV IP as the only parameter, however in the video sg777 show yesterday he played on `poker_test` branch


[02-Aug-19 05:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> so,  inside bet repo, `git pull`, then `git checkout poker_test` , then `make`


[02-Aug-19 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Oh ok will do thanks @PHBA2061


[02-Aug-19 05:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Switched test nodes to poker_test now


[02-Aug-19 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> I received a reply from coingecko
```Hello,

Does CHIPS currently have a website?

Our minimum requirement is that there must be a website for coins to be listed on CoinGecko.

Thanks and Best Regards,```
We best get the website at a usable standard then eh. Unfortunately I will be away from the computer most of this week so I wont be able to work on it.

[03-Aug-19 01:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> just finished listening to the podcast, you did an excellent job answering to the questions & explaining what CHIPS is about in a very easy way to understand, there are only 3 minor things I want to add: 😃 
1) if I heard correctly I think you said "Blinding Value Vector" ? It's actually "Blinding Value Vendor"
2) may be it's worth mentioning that once we successfully test CHIPS on poker, then it can be used for any other casino games, not just poker.
3) at minute 21 you said "if you're looking to be more anonymous, then we do have a CHIPS/ARRR on exchange, so you can purchase CHIPS with your ARRR" , imo the moment you trade your coins on an exchange, your anonymity are partially exposed.

[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Anyone know how we can run gdb with the parameters passed through?


[03-Aug-19 05:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> @PHBA2061  Thank you very much for the feedback! 
Yeah I mispoke there. Still trying to wrap my head around all the terminology and how it interacts with one another. 
I will definitely start to have a think about the wider CHIPS application. I think focusing on the one application now will help people understand how it is used better. Introducing other use cases after we have successfully created the poker application will be a breeze then!
And agreed, the privacy discussion can be a long one, my intention wasn't to delve into that as I wanted to speak to the CHIPS side of things. But definitely point noted.

How do I run a program with commandline arguments using GDB within...
When running a program on GDB, usually, the arguments for the program are given at the run command. Is there a way to run the program using GDB and as well as give arguments within a shell script?

[dscrd-chips] <allbits> Wen play? I'm thinking @hyperDEX can get most of his money back by fleecing me at the tables. Ima gonna be a fish


[03-Aug-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> hahah @allbits i am doing everything i can to push this forward. It is about getting GUI to work then getting backend to work as expected then GUI to work with that again. Maybe i started this GUI a bit early because a lot of the things, multihands/multiplayers was not there.


[03-Aug-19 03:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> But we are getting there. GUI for the most part is complete to be able to play


[03-Aug-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <allbits> Yes, it's interesting to observe how your GUI work tends to expose the backend shortcomings, and then helps to drive the iteration process, as it did in hyperdex. At least that's my outsiders take on it


[03-Aug-19 03:58 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> @Oszy   WINK


[08-Aug-19 11:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> Users can create accounts with DAO.Casino’s TestNet 2.0, as well as deposit test tokens with Validators, and stake them against Blockchain’s resources. Users can become Validators, as long as they possess enough of the BET token, which is the native token for the DAO.Casino platform.
According to the company, some of the most important innovations in DAO.Casino’s TestNet 2.0 are:

-Dedicated staking resource type “vote” used for Validator voting along with traditional CPU and
bandwidth;
-Dynamic number of Validator nodes based on the total stake amount (from 21 up to 100);
-Transaction sponsorship for providing a way to “sponsor” resource reservation needed for
transactions made by other accounts. This feature will allow organizations to easily onboard new
users by performing actions on the blockchain without initial token deposits.

[08-Aug-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> @helios @sg777 and @pixelshove are working on that. The GUI is basically done, now it is iterating the backend and the GUI as differences come up. Biggest one they are working on is actual multiplayer, up to this point it had been someone playing but have control over all nodes

[10-Aug-19 02:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> There is no specific date set. The team are working away trying to get all of the back/front integration sorted. Once that is done there will be a bunch of testing, cashier integration and maybe then a V1.0 release date can be thought about (along with website release). Anybody is free to use it in the current state if they so choose though.


[10-Aug-19 02:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> before public release, multisig lock/unlock of table bets would need to be implemented, the gui integration is first as that will allow gui level testing in parallel with removing this last exposure


[10-Aug-19 03:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Would @sg777 be able to work on the multisig when the gui integration is  complete, or will that require another dev?
I'll add it to the trello to do list tomorrow


[10-Aug-19 03:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> sg777 can do it


[10-Aug-19 03:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <hyperDEX> Well GUI is complete, backend and front ends being iterated as we find things that are missing to support multiplayer over 2 different players.


[10-Aug-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Privatoshi> I can help testing.

[12-Aug-19 08:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <Oszy> @dukeleto it's $200 to add 7 letters to the command they currently use?

[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> Does CHIPS support nSPV?


[13-Aug-19 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> If not how much of work it might be?


[13-Aug-19 08:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> @grewalsatinder you would need to port all things jl added to KMD to CHIPS codebase. It's feasible, not "easy" but not horrific. A lot of copy+pasting code from KMD into CHIPS and then getting it to compile correctly


[13-Aug-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> might be hard to disentangle only nSPV code from KMD to put into CHIPS


[13-Aug-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> Ok


[13-Aug-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> so you would end up modifying a lot of code for CHIPS


[13-Aug-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> CHIPS is a newer btc api, too


[13-Aug-19 08:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> so there is all that annoyance, various structs/etc changing names/etc

[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> that is my guess, James would know more

[dscrd-chips] <sg777> @PHBA2061  do you have any machines with 8GB space, since my nodes are of 16GB and I never see the bus error in my nodes..


[13-Aug-19 08:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> for the gui  use the `develop` branch of pixelshove repo`https://github.com/norbertdragan/lightning-chips-frontend/tree/develop` and for the backend use the `poker_test` branch of `bet` repo....the backend nodes should start as follows:


[13-Aug-19 08:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> `./bet dcv <dcv_ip>` for dcv `./bet bvv <dcv_ip>` for bvv  `./bet player <dcv_ip>` for player


[13-Aug-19 08:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <sg777> rather than entering the ip's manually in the gui for testing you can create `.env` files in `lightning-poker-front` root directory...and copy paster the addresses as below in the `.env` file created

[dscrd-chips] <PHBA2061> probably it failed because it can't find contiguous blocks of memory to allocate ? the total memory usage is only about 1.7 Gb, so I thought 4Gb would be sufficient.
I'll be testing on my own 4 Google VM first, they can be scaled if needed, then on Vultr's nodes later

[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> If you mean when will CHIPS host a competition. We will do this when we have launched the official application. There will be alpha and beta testing in the medium term though


[17-Aug-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> I'm excited :)


[17-Aug-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> How are you guys going to set yourself apart from other crypto casinos? Like edgeless. I guess they are not fully decentralized... But they have low fees which people like. It would be cool if you guys reduced fees and added a tip the dealer option. Poker pros normally tip the dealer, I wonder if they would tip the ecosystem 😂


[17-Aug-19 07:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> The current plan for rake is 1% which is significantly lower than every online poker facilitator. 0.5% to development, 0.25% to dealers and 0.25% to BVVs. This is subject to adjustment once we have considered all of the factors at play.
I dont mind the tip the dealer option though. That sounds like a reasonable thing to add. 
The biggest draw card for CHIPS is the decentralised, trust less nature of the dapp.


[17-Aug-19 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <allbits> Can dealer portion of rake be a parameter set by dealer?


[17-Aug-19 08:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> I'd suggest not. I think it doesnt require a variable parameter. The idea is to give people an incentive to setup a dealer node, not to create a set of tables with different rake amounts.


[17-Aug-19 08:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> Im sure the dealer nodes will get great tips. I know poker players, sometimes they only win 100 and tip $5, pretty nice! I wouldn't 😂


[17-Aug-19 08:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> If you look at the pic below, the average rake of different facilitators is around 4-5%. 
I'd suggest that even having a 2% rake would be a massive improvement for players and provide some decent dev funds

[17-Aug-19 09:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> I thought edgeless or a different crypro project had 0% rake? Or was that 0% house edge?


[17-Aug-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> Maybe less rake for using chips


[17-Aug-19 09:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> But im overcomplicating things 😂


[17-Aug-19 09:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> Im just excited, crypto conditions will be great for chips and I think people will be really interested in playing :)


[17-Aug-19 09:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> It would also be cool to see chatting enabled or maybe select an emoticon face while betting. Part of the fun of poker is trying to read the others.


[18-Aug-19 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <joe2x4> @NutellaLicka what is the average rake size vs popularity? Does a lower rake actually equal more popular?


[18-Aug-19 04:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> That is a hard one to measure. Rake size is actually hard to work out, and a lot of them have rake back incentives if you play a lot with them. The article I pulled that from did the math over 1000 hands I believe.
I know poker players care a lot about rake. Especially professional ones. Be cause they have to put more hours in, to get the take that they have paid back. The more rake per pot they pay, the less money per hour they're getting


[18-Aug-19 07:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> Also there are many other factors driving people to poker sites. Things I've noted are: Rake, deposit/withdrawal features and facilities, the actual players on the site and how they play(whether they're majority professionals or amateurs), whether the site offers different tournaments, whether it's mainly cash games, how many hands one can play at a time and how smoothly the application runs when opening multiple tables.


[18-Aug-19 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> Tournaments would be cool. $10 buy in.


[18-Aug-19 09:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> I'm sure there would be plenty of variations of buy ins and prize pools

[dscrd-chips] <jorian> bots are a real issue, pro players will not come back once some bots show up. private tables, or invite-only tables are a must imo


[19-Aug-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <rainbro7> I like that idea, private tables sound good. Or maybe set tables for certain win rate and account age. Idk how to actually protect, seems like this is an issue all people are facing. I guess it is hard to differentiate between bot and human. Other than with chat. A chat to gameplay rate maybe 😂 but then they would spam chat.. idk

[dscrd-chips] <dogracer> Hey @dukeleto if you need testers/miners still for a verus2 based CHIPS project I'm happy to help just let me know


[22-Aug-19 04:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> @dogracer I stopped working on verus+chips due to lack of motivation and not wanting to touch Verus stuff. If somebody wants to pick the code up, it's there, just waiting for somebody to love it

[22-Aug-19 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> they started years after CHIPS, what to do?


[22-Aug-19 11:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> @dukeleto do you know of anyone who would be capable and interested in this task?
@grewalsatinder just for your awareness, we need to find somebody else to complete the verushashv2 port


[22-Aug-19 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> @blackjok3r - lizard tamer 
If VerusHash V2 is brought into CHIPS code, would this be an easier transition to bring it into KMD code to be used on SmartChains?


[22-Aug-19 11:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> @NutellaLicka I know that already.


[22-Aug-19 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> probably don't need verushash v2 anymore.


[22-Aug-19 11:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <grewalsatinder> @jl777c might have some solution.


[23-Aug-19 12:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <jl777c> adaptivepow will fix this exact issue and would only require changing the getnextwork function


[23-Aug-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <dukeleto> @NutellaLicka no, I don't and it sounds like chips might not need/want verushash, which is maybe the best course of action

[05-Sep-19 04:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-chips] <NutellaLicka> CHIPS has a Multi-Sig donation address!
A multi-sig donation address is an address that requires multiple people to sign transactions prior to actually sending any funds. For instance, this is a 3 of 5 Multi-sig address. Meaning 3 out of the 5 authorised people must sign the transaction for it to be processed.
This specific address will replace all other CHIPS donation addresses and has @sg777 @jorian @PHBA2061 @Strob and myself as the authorised signers.
This will be the address NN's and other community donations will be put into.

`bRFaD5CPeb7jVENWf65CoVEADZUVYW2FoS` is the address. Feel free to transfer into it like any other address, both CHIPS or KMD!

If you have any questions, please ask!

I was able to fix the problem that leaded me to disable Chips. I'm happy to annonce that Chips mining is enabled again on UniMining.net <https://github.com/jl777/chips3/pull/36>
The NH order that I've set up should run less than 10 hours but hopefully, due to delays between NH and pool and huge NH min diff, it reduces the diff. I don't plan to use NH on Chips on long term

Verus has not yet released out of testnet. So it's not possible to create vCHIPS at the moment. Still in a holding pattern and nothing has changed. This is my observation.

there is a vCHIPS verusID
so it's likely;

https://cragslist.hopto.org/search/vCHIPS

it's a good way to get decentralized liquidity for CHIPS

Hello, thank you for your interest. Sorry, I didn't discuss 1MT/CHIPS yet here.
yes, 1MT refers to <https://1milliontoken.org/>
1MT is an ERC20 but due to high ETH fees, few tx happen. Most activities are in centralized services (tip.cc bot as example). 1MT use cases are similar to CHIPS/PANGEA (poker, games). 1MT Team size is similar to Chips'team but while Chips is orientated on tech mostly while 1MT focus on marketing.
When I wanted to do a test airdrop to all 1MT hodlers, 1MT was an ERC20 but around now, they are migrating/swapping/presellin to be on BSC instead of ETH

[05-Apr-21 04:07 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
I had a discussion with 1MT supporters, the airdrop can be fun but it can be more fun if it is incentivized. I'll place buy orders on AtomicDEX to buy airdropped tokens, tiny amounts to increase the fun ^^
I had a private discussion with 1MT boss, I'll give more details in private channels but he is supporting my ideas (free airdrop with that can benefit both communities), they explained me that one of the use cases for 1MT is partnerships or to do giveaways.

I won't give too much details right in public now because I didn't discuss yet details (in private) with other members of Chips'team. Stay tuned ! ^^

Hey guys,

I'd also like you to consider my proposal. I have made other commitments so I cannot offer much in the way of donations to CHIPS. However, I was head of development for 5 years at a company that made all of the games on videopoker.com. I've built several games myself and have a lot of experience in the industry. Specifically with 3-5-10 and all of it's derivatives (which is most video poker games).

If elected, I'm promising my time and development skills to the CHIPS project to help fix issues on the backend and push it forward. 

https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/season5/candidates/majora31

Thank you for your support 🙂

@daria I'am still not listed in the annoucement; But be sure that there will be some nice contribution and spent time for CHIPS 😉 My last PR for proposal is still not merged.


[22-Apr-21 02:45 PM] phm87#7395
@Biz and myself are also waiting for PR to be merged. I will sync one chips node for you @d4v  (while I sync mine) on an unimining server to let you play poker with us friday and weekend ;-)


[22-Apr-21 02:50 PM] Biz#0842
I’ve got a chips node synced already too. Think i’d have to compile a different version of repo though

[22-Apr-21 08:13 PM] sg777#2257
@Biz the master branch of bet repo contains the stable version of to play poker with 2 players...


[22-Apr-21 08:14 PM] sg777#2257
to experience playing poker using CHIPS, to start with is once you setup the player node, you can look for either me or daria to setup dealer and cashier nodes initially to avoid much of overhead in setting up those nodes..

[22-Apr-21 09:22 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
So do I get it right @Biz , @phm87, @ejuliano  you wanna play some test poker ? Shall we schedule for tomorrow? I will be online from 11am till late UTC +8.

I guess the idea is to try it, see if we can find more bugs than we already found 🤣  Also to test the sitout, which is still a bit of a PoC. You can read how it currently works here - https://github.com/chips-blockchain/pangea-poker/blob/dev/docs/sitout.md

I ve got a few things in progress - disconnections, game exit and automatic actions for hands.

So if you are keen, we can try to play a bit this week and then have another round in 2 weeks again when I will add some of those functionalities plus maybe sg will add some more stuff too ? 🤷‍♀️ 

We got available 3 player nodes, dealer node and two cashiers. So. I can run dealer and cashiers and you can run either your own player nodes or use the ones I have available, but I d like to be part of the test so I can see whats going on too 😊 

@sg777 can we play 2+ player games?
Also do you wanna join testing?

@MaJoRa We have desings already created by the previous developer and I create new ones based on the existing, but we got a bit of inconsistency between the game and the website and need to work on merging those styles somehow 🙂

So I was looking at creating a branded DEX as part of my proposal. I'm aware in game peopel will use the 'lightening' system for the transactions. But would it actually be helpful here to have a branded / themed DEX for people to buy CHIPS before playing?

Was a reply to this question: Any chance Verus will implement #Chips in the future? I can see how it would be INCREDIBLY useful to integrate the Verus reserve system in to the Pangea Poker game and any future games using #Chips. Just like putting pulling more money out of the ATM and going back to the table.

We need to do a bit of price discovery since CHIPS hasnt really traded in a long time. I will put up 1000 ARRR for auction. post your bid in CHIPS in the trading channel. min price of 1:1, meaning if you are willing to swap CHIPS 1:1 with ARRR and nobody outbids you, then you will get 1000 ARRR for 1000 CHIPS.

CHIPS whales, there is no supply of CHIPS now and we need to get CHIPS into the hands of as many people as possible. by giving away 10% of your coins, it will make it worth 10x more. if you dont want to donate, at the least just put them up for sale at the reasonable prices. we need to get thousands of CHIPS hodlers to get to the top 100

```if the CHIPS whales want to make it into a top 100 coin, they will need to donate/sell reasonably enough to create a vibrant community. if they hold onto all the supply, clearly it wont get anywhere close to the top 100.
jl777c — Today at 08:10
i am sure there will be a price that will convince the CHIPS OG to sell. in todays market what should the marketcap be for a coin that has integrated realtime decentralized poker? clearly it is worth a lot more than a dollar. however, until it has a strong community and active users, deployed tech, it wouldnt be worth $50 (price for billion+ marketcap). that being said, the price in todays market can go a bit crazy, but if it does we assume it will correct back down.
we are using an auction price to find the floor price and once that is known we can then do more price discovery to establish a fair price, which would be a price that gives liquidity at good profits for the multiyear hodlers, and also gives the buyers a good chance at making significant gains.
somewhere between $1 and $50, needs to give enough potential gains to the buyers while at the same time be enough to allow the long term CHIPS whales to cashout a bit to recover what they put in. maybe it is the sqrt of 50?
we can use atomicDEX for additional price discovery so put your bids and asks there and when we can see where the price settles, i will organize an IDO where we would make a significant amount of CHIPS available at a fixed price

on the issue of PANGEA and BET assetchains. it is clear that it is just another layer of complexity and it is better to simplify. CHIPS is what will have value from the betting and poker, so i will be sunsetting both PANGEA and BET assetchains. There will be a 1:1 buyback with CHIPS.

[26-Apr-21 01:01 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
with the conversion of PANGEA and BET into CHIPS, that means that there are no constraints on how the rake is distributed. it can be carefully designed to properly incentivize all the important participants, dealers, players, miners, blinds nodes, etc

[26-Apr-21 01:02 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
the one big issue that needs to be solved is distribution. NXT suffered from this and they never solved it and have stagnated. with CHIPS it has the potential to become a billion+ marketcap coin, but it also can end up stagnating into a $1 coin. the whales need to free up their coins and make it available at an attractive price to buyers.

the pangea and bet revshares can be allocated to chips hodlers also, or active chips users, a good idea to work out how best to allocate the rake to maximize benefit to CHIPS. at least there is just one coin CHIPS to deal with

How to disable bots in specific channels
Open the server settings.
Open the roles tab.
Select all roles the bot has.
Disable Administrator permission.
Give the bot other needed permissions (If you dont know which, just give it all!)
Do the same for other roles the bot has!

I have some CHIPS in an old Agama wallet, but it seems I can’t move them to the new Verus wallet : it says that the pub key is invalid... is there a dedicated wallet for CHIPS?

Running an airdrop campaign to KMD hodlers and having it coincide with the Summer Blockchain Conference + Miami conference that Komodo is putting on at the end of H1 (giving similar kind of priority and spotlight that CHIPS got during the Dec 12-13 AtomicDEX Stress Test) - could be a really ideal and easy way to distribute CHIPS + it's working poker tech.  
Both Komodo (KMD) and CHIPS win in this scenario.

Micro-transactions. In blockchain lightning network is popular for doing micro-transactions. There is a Decentralised Poker game in development for very long time using lightning network based micro-transactions, and it is getting ready for public tests very soon. @pangea_chips https://t.co/O1XpQYtsOg

@Hellracer88 @AtomicDEX In my opinion there can’t be more real exchange than a decentralised exchange, so that would be @AtomicDEX.
The community can request centralised exchanges like @TradeOgre and @safetradeex to start with, since it is community project community should take steps to help.

I wouldn't go so far now as to say that CHIPS is a sleeping giant, but with a bit of marketing and 1-2 exchanges, they could take the next step. I would be happy to support CHIPS in this.
Does Chips have a website? Something where I can find all the information about the chain and the coin. Is there a roadmap?

Sorry for the questions. I appreciate your input. Is CHIPS dependent on BET? CHIPS is supposed to be the fuel while BET will be the platform? And PANGEA is "just" a game?

There is no roadmap? No white paper? Who is working on the projects and how much resources does the ecosystem have?

And, there are already competitors, what unique selling point does CHIPS have?

Thanks for your help.

CHIPS is a cryptocurrency.
BET is a name of repository which has all the protocol rules coded in it.
https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet
PANGEA is the game devleoped using these set of protocol rules.

There can be N number of more card games or betting type games built using this same set of rules with either little or not modifications in BET.

So I was talking to my wife about CHIPS/Pangea. I got about 20 seconds in, mentioned it was trustless. She hears that, then interrupts me and says, "Will there be Keno and Bingo?"

My wife is never wrong. Ever. Just ask her. She speaks for all wives. They want Bingo/Keno. I told her that was likely a long way off, she told me to learn to code. 😑 I should just learn to code so she stops saying that.

I see Bingo cards a little different. May be @sg777 can answer it better if Bingo came can be addopted using Pangea/Bet protocol/code

I imagine Keno is basically a random number generator, so there would be less issue there?

Bingo you would need to shuffle the cards and the balls.

there is branch in bet, which is similar to that, `highest_card_wins` branch, what it does is easy player picks a random card from the shuffled deck, and once all the players picks the cards, the deck will be revealed and the player with highest card wins..but for this there is no gui implementation...in the initial days i used this to test the randomness of the deck..

Just brainstorming here:

Perhaps there could be a pre-set amount of the take that goes to developer wallets. The app sends a small percentage of the house/dealer take to the developer wallets *until a certain threshold is met*, at which point the full rewards go back to the miners/node operators? This way, the developers have real incentive to create as many games as possible? Each game could have its own developers/take percentage for that game going to the developers. Community could vote on thresholds? Developers could bid their time/services, auction style?

"war" or "battle royal" aka "highest card wins" could be a quicker game to implement?  how about roulette?  i also saw talk of blackjack the other day in a different channel, that one seems more complicated than highest card wins

I think we can reuse the existing GUI repo until the connection establishment part for any game, and once if we can define the game flow then I can add up the support in the backend, we'll look into it after poker, since by then we can reuse most part of the code.

Me too. I have been watching this project develop for 3-4 years now, and I am super looking forward to seeing this leap in online gaming. IMO, it has the potential, over time, to severely upset the centralized industry. When usability reaches a certain level, what will the point be of playing on centralized/untrustworthy systems?

I made this to help spread the word about CHIPS (KMD and Verus get a mention, too). I'll post a Bitchute link once the video is done processing over there. Share it if you like. 🙂

amazing... well done!  can you do the same thing but have him say "DogeDEX" instead of "AtomicDEX"... it will be good to spread both of those names around

Indeed I am. I tend to stay Bitcoin-cetric on Twitter, but I have broken that rule a few times for CHIPS, because I have paid attention to the what is being developed over the past...omg...4 years? It is the one no-brainer I know about that is this "early" in price discovery. I like Verus too, but it is more complicated. CHIPS is simple, and what you guys are doing with Pangea is nothing short of industry-changing. Organically. Amazing. Anybody with eyes will be able to see it. Right now, it's still super early, and flying way under the radar. That will of course change one day, and I intend to be around to enjoy it with the rest of you. :CHIPS:

@Chief_Bitcoin I mostly stick to Bitcoin related stuff. Got boring during the bear market, so I went political and got shadowbanned numerous times. I STILL get put behind the "offensive content" wall with totally benign tweets, so I must have pissed off the algos or some temp somewhere. Now I just stick to Bitcoin and random news/videos/funny stuff.

i'm thinking of making some sort of player-bot where any player who joins the table will be awarded some miminum amount of CHIPS(as good as faucet) and they can play with that amount, if they win they can take all the winning amount..

Hey everyone 👋  Welcome @Unknown, he is a friend of mine and pro poker player 😉  He wanted to check out what we are  doing here and ask some questions about our implementation of the game. I think one of the questions was on the rake. If I m not mistaken the latest plan is in https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/issues/209

@Chief Crypto  if you have any availability to turn some of your alternative colored chips logos into an emoji, that would be baddass. Or even a little elvis or casino things. Nutella said would add them to the discord.

Hello Hello 👋  

I have written a new Pangea setup guide. Can anyone have a look plz plz plz? Especially the people who had issues with installations or simply found it complicated. 

https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/blob/master/docs/HowToPangea.md

I am rebuilding Docker image currently too, so that  will probably be available tomorrow, but the installation script is available now for anyone who wants to try and report their experience.

Hello everyone. 

First let me tell that I am not quite familiar with block chain technology so there is good chance I misunderstood. If I am wrong somewhere please correct me. I read about project a bit and I like some things. The idea is good.

There is some part where you mentioned 9max games. Is it gonna be only 9max? Because 6max is most popular and I feel like 9max is dying.

At some point you said:
"each player generate the random number" - basically that is players code or name. Is that random number new each hand? Each table? Always the same? If it is always the same then people can go through hands and have statistic about him. It can be good, can be bad. Some rooms allows it, others not. It looks to me that more rooms are going now into direction of trying to protect amateur players more and giving some kind of anonymity (anonymous tables, changing nicks regulary...).

There is this part:
NON-REPUDIATION & CORRECTNESS OF THE GAME
.....As the game finishes every player reveals cards such that any player can verify cards from any other player, and, DCV verifies the revealed cards and evaluates the game. Since all entities possess the authenticator vectors, any player can verify and ensure  fair gameplay.

Now I do not know if this is something technical about chain (maybe sort of showing cards to verify there is no 5 aces...) or this is also literally showing cards to everyone at table at the end of each hand (after it is finished). That is a lot of free info to people around you, if im playing it will give some informations about me but also I would collect a lot about others. So maybe it will again give some advantage to better players and create bigger gap.

I see it seems rake is gonna be 1%. That is great news for anyone who plays! I love this idea about some kind of rakeback:
Adding a TX fee % would be a great way of incentivising players to mine with their CPU. This could be marketed as a "Rake Back" initiative. Players would simply click a button in the GUI, "Start Rake Back Incentive", which would use a portion of their CPU (minimal) to mine the blockchain. This would only strengthen the aPoW model, as more the more players & hands that are played, the more mining rewards, and secure the network would be. The reason this is important is to maintain an incentive to continue stable block production.

So let me say few more things about rake. No flop no drop - good rule, no rake if the hand finishes before the flop is played.

About cap, I think 2.5bb is great for smaller but awful for higher levels. It should depend on blinds. Here is rake structure I found on poker stars site:

https://gyazo.com/d56e91d6ea23759fccc5f7f82214ac3d

Yes, your game will have much smaller rake (1% compared to 3-4-5% or even more). But cap is much bigger in your games, for example:
1/2 stars 2.75, you 5
2/3 stars 3, you 10
2.5/5 stars 3, you 12.5
.....
You get the point. In bigger games it would be even bigger difference. I am not sure where it is gonna be more profitable to play since huge cap might be bigger problem than slighty bigger rake. Maybe on this way you will attract a lot of micro/small stakes games but not almost any medium/high? What is your goal?

This idea is pretty good:
Details are yet to be solidified, but the idea is to airdrop a % of the rake to CHIPS holders on a set interval basis. This will incentivise holding CHIPS, if nothing else.

At at the end there is one more concern. In poker there is a lot of money, and naturally that will attract all kind of people. Some might try to get that money by cheating. Maybe playing on the same table with 3 friends and they know each others cards? Maybe using RTA (real time assistance)? I guess good idea about decentralization is that no one from poker room can take your money, ban you... but here it is needed sometimes to ban certain player and that money from account return to players who were cheated. How would you solve this problem? Who would check those player? Can we report the cheater?

I think with the current setup, since anyone can be a dealer node, there will inevitably be a reputation system. I can even imagine tables that require using a cam so as to help avoid cheating.
Yes that sounds weird, but a good friend of mine is making alot of money online proctoring. And if you adopt this model (I can find out what backend he is using) the dealer becomes a defacto proctor. (And hot dealers will make more, including tips)

But dealer proctor model should give the dealer power to boot disruptive players and build reputation for dealer. And most likely there will be anonymous tables as well. But proctor model helps assure there is no hidden chatter and coercion between players.

@Unknown Thanks for the detailed post, here I tried answering some of the questions.

At some point you said:
"each player generate the random number" - basically that is players code or name. Is that random number new each hand? Each table? Always the same? If it is always the same then people can go through hands and have statistic about him. It can be good, can be bad. Some rooms allows it, others not. It looks to me that more rooms are going now into direction of trying to protect amateur players more and giving some kind of anonymity (anonymous tables, changing nicks regulary...).
`
Every hand player generates the new random number, lets say r, the identity of the player is r*G(Where G is the generator point on the curve25519).

[23-May-21 06:26 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
There is this part:
NON-REPUDIATION & CORRECTNESS OF THE GAME
.....As the game finishes every player reveals cards such that any player can verify cards from any other player, and, DCV verifies the revealed cards and evaluates the game. Since all entities possess the authenticator vectors, any player can verify and ensure  fair gameplay.

Now I do not know if this is something technical about chain (maybe sort of showing cards to verify there is no 5 aces...) or this is also literally showing cards to everyone at table at the end of each hand (after it is finished). That is a lot of free info to people around you, if im playing it will give some informations about me but also I would collect a lot about others. So maybe it will again give some advantage to better players and create bigger gap. I did not play on poker room where cards are shown after hand is finished, although I think one room has something like that but it is only visible tomorrow day.
`
There are broadly two scenarios here, say suppose if n players are playing and n-1 players fold, then in that case the cards won;t be revealed. But in other scenarios where the game is played without folds with atleast two players on the table then in this scenario, the player cards will be shown. Here with our approach there is no association between a real person and the identiy of that person on the table and this identiy changes every hand.`

"Every hand player generates the new random number, lets say r, the identity of the player is r*G(Where G is the generator point on the curve25519)"

Aha ok, I understand. Yeah, it will stop any tracking program. Just IMO it would be better to change those when you change table. Cause any player (pro, semi pro or amateur) would enjoy more to play if they know who is on table at least for some period so you can create some dynamic


I think you guys should figure out something about security cause if only dealer can band players from his game, it also leaves some room for dealer and some players to collude

Yes, w.r.t player identities, we thought of it , so we keeping the identities of the player remain same for the session, just like the table_id. Right now the dealer can only run a single table, when we add multi talbe support to the dealer, we can randomize the table id which appear unique to different players(we make this dealer configurable option) so that makes it difficult for the players to join the same table a bit when there is more players to play.  But w.r.t to banning of a player, i mean if the issue of colluding is really be possible, then dealer can choose to run private tables, have to see what we can do limit any possibility of that.

I read the info on how their shuffling works, `https://virtue.poker/howitworks` I see they holding lot of trust on the dealer, its like dealer passing the deck to players to shuffle nad play. For payments and all i see one needs to signup, couldn;t find any protocol how they creating a trust in the platform to handle the payments..I couldn't find any white paper on their website to see how their claim works..

It’s all in the details! The Unlawful Gambling Enforcement Act specifically prohibited casino and betting companies from restricted transactions — which are defined in part by another, older piece of legislation known as the Interstate Wire Act.

This act prevents online sites from accepting cross-border wagers on the grounds that a bank cannot legally process gaming earnings in a state without legal gaming.

This is why people are able to play online poker in specific states, but not nationwide. However, some analyses of cryptocurrency and online poker suggest that cryptocurrency would not be subjected to the Wire Act — and thus that it would allow sites to circumvent gambling legislation.

You cannot withdraw CHIPS to a KMD receive address. You must withdraw to a CHIPS receive address.

if the KMD address was an exchange like Binance or something, then most likely not. But if you can get the priv key, you can get the coins

Both KMD and CHIPS can go to the same address. The same privkey on both chains will create the same address on both chains.

price moves with every trade that isn't the same price as the last trade, just like any exchange
I think volume might make it seem a higher or lower jump in change, but still the same concept

[11-Jun-21 09:03 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
the main problem of prices for low volume/high spread coins on pages like paprika and gecko is that those sites use the volumes only to differentiate/weight the prices from different exchanges, but not for price movements on same exchange
so if there was a trade for 1000 CHIPS at a price of 1$ each and then later that day a trade of 10 CHIPS for 0.01$ each, the price shown will be 0.01$ with a volume of 1010 CHIPS

[11-Jun-21 09:08 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
but good news, there is a "cure" for that 😄
just post bid/asks in the orderbook, so the spread is smaller, so the price can't fluctuate that wildly just because of a 0.10$ trade

it wont be as full functionality as CC, as it is not turing complete, but it will allow to implement things like realtime dice. not being turing complete it avoids the problems of needing gas

tl:dr this will allow CHIPS to implement things like blockchain enforced realtime dice

So in basic terms, blockchain-enforced CHIPS craps game, slots, etc?

stateless games like slots would be much easier than games with lots of steps, like craps. probably can implement a state machine out of different transactions, but it would be an order of magnitude more work.

once it can build a library of functions, then we can start to think about more complex games. certainly state information can be encoded into the blockchain

The communication of bet API is with CHIPS and c-lightning, and with other bet nodes on the network.
CHIPS and c-lightning are already optimised for p2p
they use libevent library and enhanced p2p layer
and are fast to communicate over tor as smooth as on public clear internet
but BET API in my opinion is not as solid as it should be
so I think we will notice some speed issues on tor as well, if we did notice issues even over internet
for that reason I was pushing to adapt libp2p library as p2p layer for bet
lip2p is also enhanced specially for p2p applications
the main thing is we solve things as we go, so tor is on the edge of getting resolved
so next we can target implimenting libp2p to bet
and if we have issues of p2p because of bet's current p2p layer implimentation, which is basically nanomsg/nng, we can count on it's next upgrade of libp2p
which should solve any issues we might face with nanomsg based bet 🙂
please ask these questions in public without fear
I notice that you ask nice questions
and my answers are valuable to be read in public 🙂

there are few BIG things I'm counting on CHIPS and Pangea Poker project this year:
- Tor based decentralised multiplayer game play of Pangea Poker. We are right at the edge of that whole setup finish.
- Upgrade of Chips core code to with the latest Bitcoin-Core code, which has support of latest APIs, schnore signature based transactions and Traproot, along with Tor v3 support, which in my opinion is important for our decentralised gaming setup. The bount is already public. As soon as I have some update on some dev picking up on this bounty will led the others know here.

My plans for GUI are:

Once the multiplayer is ready or usable/playable, I want to **add a few small things to make the game more user friendly**, aka the player should have a way of exiting the game and similar things. It is all half implemented and still needs some backend support but I dont want to dive into that now since everyone is busy working on Tor and multiplayer. Plus I myself need to implement Tor connection on my side.

After that we do **community tests** etc. Collect some **feedback from poker players**, not new features but maybe adjusting some things so it is less awakward in case it is. Then I think we are ready 😊 

In parallel to this I want to improve project structure which would require some changes in the GUI architecture, the project grew over time and needs a bit of face lifting and maybe some liposuction 🤣 😉  This will not affect or delay anything, it will happen in parallel and will only be used once its ready.

Don't hesitate to approach @sg777 for this. The last update I got from him, he has tested gameplay over Tor using latest bet changes. I also need to test it and update my notes on the setup.

It is also possible that for node.js GUI part, you may or may not need to impliment Tor 🤔

:bust_in_silhouette: grewalsatinder#9653 (CHIPS, chips-chat)

because GUI is directly talking to local BET API, so the .onion address will be directly passed to the BET API and BET will be talking to other BET nodes over tor.

so the GUI-BET communication wont change? I thought it was kindda important to change that part, since that is where the players IP is exposed

this CAN be important in this case:
- If the user decideds to setup BET, CHIPS and c-lightning on for example at home computer.
- Then access the HTML GUI from a laptop's local address, and the GUI is communicating to the BET API not locally, but instead over tor.

this is true, if chips-ln-bet nodes are local, from GUI you can simply connect using local IP and which works..

If we breakdown the GUI
1. The first part dealer hosting the backend GUI, which gets launched on the player browser using the dealer backend IP, this backend is currently be in node.js, implementing tor for this means, the player has to use the tor browser to access the tor address, so basically this prt doesn't actually concerns the privacy of the playning nodes.
2. as @grewalsatinder mentioned if everything is running local, from the GUI lauched at the players local host, using local ip player can connect from the GUI to its backend node, so in this scenario tor is not required, but when if the player is running his nodes remotely and from the GUI the player wants to connect to them, then in that scenario this static ip thing is coming into the picture so there if we want bring anonymity there tor comes into the picture..

with the current setup the the static ip dependancy part is only be applicable to dealer and cashier nodes, provided if the players run their nodes locally.

You can take the master branch and play the game, which is very stable. But since we working on couple of major upstream integrations we aren;t making much announcements w.r.t game. There are instructions available in the bet repo, you can follow them, set up and play. If you stuck anywhere plz feel free to post.

that app requires you give up your keys to your funds to play so I see how CHIPS is superior but will it be similar in GUI

^ for example being able to test the gameplay with “fake” chips to see if this is something I would want to spend my “real” money on by acquiring CHIPS in adex. If there aren’t enough players and the interface is shit, I wouldn’t spend a couple hundred bucks on buying CHIPS right now. That’s my point

you give unclear questions, you get generic answers.
Nobody asks you to buy Chips. If you don't like it, just stay away from it. Nobody minds here.
Yes, it is in development right now. If you can't test the in development, don't test it. When it will be ready for those who can't test in development software come back and try yourself. 
Good luck to you too.

Unclear questions? 1. Is chips using btc or ltc tech? 2. We will have to transfer chips from adex to chips back and forth and there won’t be a link or interface in adex to play poker 3. How could someone test the game/interface with using fake (test) coins like Rick/morty on adex so they know if they want to start accumulating CHIPS

Go to betonline.com/ignition/whatever poker site you want. You can play with REAL FIAT or you can play with FAKE CHIPS…. So a new player would play with fake chips to see if they want to deposit REAL FIAT (USD, Roubles, whatever) before they play

Yes, right now you can only get CHIPS on ADEX. ADEX is also a wallet for this project. I'm not sure how many wallets right now support chips but ADEX is a main one.  This project launched in 2017 so many people have bought and held over the years without ever being able to play. The app is in active development, and is continually making progress and has jl777 blessings. One of the neat things about chips is the ability to run your own dealer node and set your own rake. Other games are also planned. As chips app is decentralized you have the option of being a dealer node or a player node. You can think of the nodes as a wallet. So if you hold chips on Adex wallet and want to play, you send to your chips app non-custodial wallet. I'm not completely sure about test net tokens but you can get free chips via faucet or reactdrop in order to test/play.

(back to point 1, chips used to be on different exchanges, and will again in the future. However due to various circumstances those exchanges being of the smaller nature no longer exist and adex filled a natural need. Once app launches expect chips to be listed in other places as well)

Ok yeah I gotchya, and yeah I remember they did a price discovery with pirate as a bounty or something a while ago. I have been doing the chipstip, but I play wayyy too much poker and I just wanted to see if the interface/real world usage is something I want to put my fiat money into now by acquiring CHIPS on adex. I understand it is still in development, but maybe someone can make a video of a few hands or something like that so non-devs/testers can see what it’s like

As far as interface, I think it is expected that suggestions and advice from experienced poker players will be utilized to continue to make a great user experience and dial in the game play. You can definitely expect some videos of game play. I'm even expecting that social media influencers will run a dealer node and drive traffic to their node. Not to mention tournaments.

I’ll have to learn more about hosting as a dealer then. So if I know a lot of poker players I could host a game, invite them to it, and collect a rake

And I’m sure there’s something to prevent someone playing as multiple people at the same table? It shouldn’t really matter if you are the dealer and playing because you can’t see their cards anyway, right?

No problem. Not to get to technical, but there are actually 3 nodes to chips. Player, dealer, cashier. The shuffling happens between these three nodes to keep everyone honest. Cashier nodes is not something the general public will run, and details are still being worked out. I'd need to reread the technical details to be more accurate, and im just reciting from memory

@RandiMcRandom you can have a look at 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nugnx4wGofk
https://blog.chips.cash/chips-pangea-poker-revolutionizing-virtual-poker/

I just had a read through all that has been mentioned here and one thing worth mentioning is that there will be no website to play CHIPS on, currently there is a development version of the GUI that is deployed to https://dev.chips.cash/. Eventually CHIPS GUI will be an app, you will download and run locally. There is 0 third party involvement in the whole process. You run the GUI and run the nodes which are mentioned above.

The interface as the whole game is work in progress and its missing features you d normally find in other poker games. What is most worked on right now is making sure the game is perfectly secure, anonymous and 100% decentralized. 

Currently, there is no one playing the game actively coz its under development so you can only simulate testing it yourself or with someone else. Right now you dont need more than 1 CHIPS to try, and even a portion of that will be enough, maybe 0.25 CHIPS, maybe even less. I dont remember the correct number. So the investment to see what this is all about is not high, plus as has been mentioned feel free to use the faucet.

CHIPS will be big one day, it is a 100% decentralized poker with full anonymity. Feel free to follow the project updates which we post every Friday. Thank you for your questions.

That video is a pretty good glimpse into what Pangea can become/are working on. Maybe once some updates are made you could jsut do a video of a couple hands to attract people and not get too into tech. The site is great and explains pretty much everything a normal poker player would need besides where they can buy chips. Will there be any type of way to purchase chips with fiat? I know it’s just adex for now and will expand to others later, but a fiat bridge would help a lot. Whatever the team can do to make everything very simple and easy to use will help the most

For example fiat gateway, very very simple download, short video or a couple of steps on how to get started, etc… just can’t have anything too complicated if you want to draw in poker players because there’s a ton of poker players out there. But heavy crypto and poker people may be a very select amount of people… never mind those that aren’t already invested in the other crypto poker sites

And if CHIPS launches and there isn’t enough people/games/action going on it would just turn users away. So the best thing is that it looks like nothing is being rushed

Obviously, my own opinion. But I also play poker with the same 20-30 guys once a week at a clubhouse and I’ve talked about this project and there were two guys interested, but only because they were just getting into crypto. Besides that the comments were they don’t trust it, why wouldn’t they use a legal site with a vpn, or a pokerrr2 app on their phone, etc… which is why I think the easier to understand and use is going to be key

Hmm, interesting thoughts. Thank you for you input. I think the plan is to have alpha release for the tech savvy/crypto friendly/poker nerd community to get the bugs out and get some feedback. The beta release will be the one targeting the players and everyone who could be interested. But yeah valid points on making it easy, we are working on that for sure.

The game GUI is in web based. Backend is mostly in C. A fully web based like webDEX could be possible someday. Before that the existing native installs need to be stable enough. Also some missing pieces to make it work without needing to have full blockchain sync might be required. nSPV + lightning network + Pangea API daemon “bet” + GUI, all compiled and load as WASM modules. We are still long way from such stack.

```heyo, was wanting to let you all know that there is a white label casino partner service available for those interested in it having one that uses Verus as the currency or any chain spun up on Verus used as the currency. It's fully on chain, profit sharing, non-custodial and has one of the best pRNGs in crypto. I attached the brochure for it for those interested.```

just a thought for when the game launches. I don't know how much is saved for CHIPS marketing, but maybe you could do some type of referral (they do them a lot online or on pokerrr2/gamlbing apps) and say that person gets 5 CHIPS per referral

maybe only keep that program open for a year or however, but could entice more people once it launches

Great idea! Affiliate marketing was huge for Pokerstars when it first started. $100 per referral or % of lifetime earnings. If could somehow incorporate into the rake or something would be a self marketing and running system.

@dimxy affiliate program is a nice idea as suggested here. Is it possible to code it in within protocol using TX RULE? I like how VerusID creation distributes initial ID and gives discount if used a referral ID while creating it. Would wish to see something similar as referral protocol in CHIPS.

@grewalsatinder we would like to make txrule scripting very flexible to allow creation of different on-chain applications. This affiliate app could be done too I believe. Maybe, It's too early for now to make production code with it at this time.

So if chips has a hard cap of 21 mil and circulating supply of 21 how do rewards for miners work and is there a chips rich list or breakdown of the rich list?

Chips has apow, which is a difficulty adjustment mechanism. It enables people to mine it with their CPU even if an asic has just stopped mining the chain. This allows the people who want to use the network (players. Dealers, holders) to keep the chain moving. Those people are incentivised to do so because they need blocks moving in order to play the game.

Looks like if you have over 250 your in the top 300. Once CHIPS has 100,000 poker players I would say that probably would qualify you as a whale but the majority of CHIPS are held by less the 20 addresses

I think its reasonable to offer a chips bot for other servers to use. Maybe we could consider limiting the faucet to the main chips discord only, and putting a link to the discord when people try in other servers

Someone PMed me sometime ago. They telling me about this discord page. I joined out of curiousity and it was just filled with random tipbots(a lot of them). No real benefit IMO in that particular scenario. Felt like a cash and grab with it literally being dedicated to many tipbots.

Things more dependent on the core of the game, bet, than anything else. If bet will take time to stable longer it will be longer. If earlier then sooner. At the moment development of bet is  highly dependent on @sg777

Funds are locked with with cashier nodes, atm im running all the cashier nodes, the only way funds will lost is if enough number of cashier nodes collude to spent payin_tx which is highly unlikely so that way funds won;t lost....if anyone edits `cashier_nodes.json`, configure and run their own cashier nodes and play in that case we won't guarantee on their funds..

Chips network is three nodes
Player
Dealer
Cashier

I believe it was decided it was best to be a % of the max tablebet for the dealer node.

 And a large quantity for the cashier node.

Anyone can setup a dealer node, cashier node was thought to be more restricted via who was running then, or at least initially. Unknown if this has changed.

```I'd suggest it be a factor of the Big Blind(BB) for the table. Say, 100x the Big blind (this is the typical maximum buy-in amount for players on poker tables, including online tables). If the table BB is 100 CHIPS, the DCV node would require to own 10k CHIPS.
If we put a USD value to CHIPS for this example, it may make more sense in peoples minds.```

This then means dealers that want to run high stakes tables, are required to hold a stake in CHIPS, meaning they have a stake in ensuring smooth gameplay.

Also:
```100xBB holding requirement would put a theoretical limit of a 210k CHIPS BB table limit, because the dealer would be required to hold 21 million CHIPS.``` But of course the players wouldn't be able to play in this instance because the dealer would be required to hold all of the CHIPS in existence. So the actual maximum would be much lower.

sorry I didn't fully understand this point, the player funds are completely be handled by the cashier nodes and at any point dealer won;t make any transaction, so literally even a node with zero CHIPS can be a dealer. My doubt is even if we enforce say dealer should hold 100BB of CHIPS, what actually we are acheiving, I see that can make only  few can be dealers and apart from that I didn't see addon security to the ecosystem.

It's not about a stake to ensure the funds aren't spent in a malicious way. It is because of this:

```It falls right into Ownership Economy fundamentals. Those who use/play/own/facilitate in the project should have an incentive and be willing to increase the overall value of the project. Other than holding or selling the rake, there are currently no other incentive structures for a DCV or BVV node. ```

The higher the stakes of the table, the more the dealer should have to hold to set that big blind limit. This way it is in their best interest to provide a good service, because they own a large stake in CHIPS.

Understood, so this also holds for closed tables(a scenario where in dealer can restrict who can join the table).

We haven't had the setup to play on testnet, since for it again needs some dedicated servers to run cashier and dealer nodes. But on mainnet even with very small amounts like 0.01 CHIP one can play so with even 1 CHIP one can play many games...im adding up the documentation to provide more info(https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet#readme)

We could exclude any tables with a big blind smaller than 0.001 CHIPS or more than 100k CHIPS or something like that

Actually to make things simple, sg777 said it will take a few days to combine all the various binaries and get it a bit more friendly for the user. Lets move this till Sunday 7am UTC.
Will try to get a full 9 player table going for then. For anyone interested, please DM me and I can add you to a group chat.

Very quick look at the white paper. Virtue poker is ETH based. So large ETH fees will ultimately be a problem. They use a side chain type of concept to keep feed lower than settle up on ETH. I'd imagine that this prevents tables below a certain $ amount from being used. Virtue also records the hash of the game state on ipfs. This might be a problem due to the reliance and impermanence of ipfs servers. They also use their own token here and there in the game, still need to pay ETH fees when using this token.

I didn't go further than this. 

I like the idea of having pro sponsors, and their white paper outlined some issues with online poker.

Chips is the first or one of the first to utilize aPow. This is meant to adjust the mining difficulty back down in a sane amount of time in case the chain is left stranded via high difficulty. But the overall idea is that the players and nodes will be incentivezed to mine the network as reward is pretty much zero

Since there is no mining reward, blocks will still need to be produced. Nodes and users will be able to use their computer for the mining. Something like when you run the app, it will utilize spare CPU processing power to do the mining.

"weird" compared to what?
most coins have a finite supply and rely on the same model 
`Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.`
👆🏽 is literally in the Bitcoin whitepaper (meaning the concept predates all we do in this space)

Hey betters, quick question. I dont know squad about about betting, but I want to ask you experts. Lets say there is a horse race of three contestants. Each adds lets say 5 CHIPS in the cookie JAR. Would the winner get like 15 CHIPS or is it normal that the host gets like 1 CHIP? Whats like an accepted thing for such a mechanic?

Originally, the Dealer (host) would get a slight percentage of the value transacted at their table. So while betters could make money by gambling, the Dealer had a consistent return. Some of it also went back into the community if I remember correctly. I think an approach from a Dealer perspective is to host the game servers....market the tables to get players to the tables and then get the Dealers cut. From a player, its the ability to gamble with your money directly with other players and no third party in between.

In the poker game scenario there are some incentives that goes validator nodes(cashier nodes we call, its 0.25% of pot if its poker) and to the dealer(which is configurable). 
Even in the case of predictable betting like the horse race, in those scenarios there still exist dealer and validator nodes, but here the role of dealer will be to create the prediction betting market like posting the queries, the role of validators will be to provide/validate the answers and to curate the bets posted by dealers. So to do this there is some commission that goes to the dealer and validator nodes.

@sg777 I am working on a game, but you can "breed" horses. Have a very simple algorithm that might be super predictable, but this is just for fun. Think cryptokitties meets medieval horses that run using root motion and adjustable animation playback speed with some random stuff based on how well you took care of your horse (furbi meets oracles)

I am in the process of porting nSPV to chips, and want to ensure that I’m not doing extra work. I am currently basing my port on KMD’s nspv implementation

You’ll find your learning curve picks up dramatically after a while. Happened for me once I started working with BTC source intimately. Coming from XMR world, there are quite a few differences

Hello @everyone 

Timeout future in the backend, some hangout scenarios are addressed with the event based approach. So mostly we done with the part of libevent integration. I feel we have very stable backend and GUI, easy scripts and setup to install.  So we should chalk out the ways to organize and play poker tournaments. 

Planned things in the coming weeks:
1. Work with gui dev to fix the GUI related issues.
2. Adding nSPV support to CHIPS.
3. Expose the API's needed to for blackjack in the backend.

atm, one can host the tables(private/public) and others can join. For poker tournament I see we need slight changes in GUI and on the dealer side to configure the things needed for the tournament and to define the format of it. We can actually plan this, may be to start with we can discuss the tournament template and from which I can make changes to suit that...I'm going through stuff to understand the format of these things...if anyone familiar in this area, can please share the reference poker tournaments formats which you would like to see here...we'll work on it...

I personally think we should focus on ironing out all issues in the current 'cash game' style of gameplay. Once all of the known issues are fixed, we could move on to changing the format. There is no point moving on if the current version hasn't been tested/used/reiterated/fixed.

im not sure how feasible are bots in this setup, but i think people can still use some assisted software's. We have implemented private tables where in which only the known entities with their pseudonyms can join the table. and since users identity is only associated with pubkey(for now its new for every game), and since all the info available on the blockchain. We can have a system where in which players can have reputation based on the players statistics, like we doing it for dealer and cashier nodes.
