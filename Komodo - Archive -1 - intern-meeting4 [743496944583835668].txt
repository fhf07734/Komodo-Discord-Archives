John Robinson Talks About His Experience In The Komodo Community
Komodo ambassador John Robinson was interviewed by Audo Kowitz in Tokyo, in late April 2020.

John has been part of the Komodo community for two years. Initially, he learned about Komodo because of the atomic swap stress test, which got him interested in the technology. He got...

@Jack.  comments about not just providing hard work, and that there is another and almost hidden quality that a community provides which is __support__ which can elevate inexperienced but also passionate users  to a place of competency  

@Jack.  makes a request for other people to reach out to besides @Audo  - for someone specific that we (interns) can reach out to for asking questions and get distilled down information that we can run with to make tuts and videos.  "Is there another (besides @Audo )"  @Jack. also has some experience with video editing and whatnot, 

@joe_land1  makes great comments on the 'sense of belonging' at jc's prodding (apologies bud) on how there is a feeling of a split in the KMD community where the tech doesn't belong in the same way that the learners, and that the lack of accessibility due to the complicatedness and split of the community feel makes it difficult to feel a belonging here.

@Jcharming you were cutting out a bit


[13-Aug-20 09:56 AM] joe_land1#1088
@Jcharming do you think you can type it out? cant rly hear u


[13-Aug-20 09:56 AM] Jcharming#2693
@Audo  poses a great question to the group 
-asking us to tell our story of how long involved, 
-how we got interested in it, 
-and if we feel like we have a sense of belonging here/ what point we felt like we started to belong
@Churro adds to the conversation commenting that it feels at a bit of a loss because there is so much to catch up on.  
@CryptoJesus brings great points forward about people that get into the community because of investment and feels like they belong because they own KMD, and as a result of this investment took time to explore the project bc they wanted to invest.  (fundamental analysis) 
The internship made it more personal and with this wants the project to succeed even more. 
@sakata  Just a big 'ole lurker, an aspect of trying to be a part of it that is a barrier.  If someone joins the server than they have an interest regardless if they do more.  
KMD has a 'feel' of there is potential, it has a vibe, but the traction kind of stops there.  

Very slow and steady, consistent theme to produce something. 
One of the feels of KMD is a steady, slow, push to move the industry.  
It isn't just a tech heavy project, it's also is paired with great minds.  
Maybe this is something to showcase more? 

Suggestion for development updates to be improved.  Comments to push for a greater marketing campaign.  
Elrond network and LSK are both great marketing programs to draw inspiration from.  
Brief tangent to talk about how KMD has such a strong base especially being built in C and comparisons to CIsco a high tech slow burn.

My network is shitting the bed, 'the joys of connection while traveling' 
Still waiting to hear from @joe_land1 @Jack. and myself for your questions @Audo  

I'll type for a bit and I can share my story in 5 minutes tomorrow.


[13-Aug-20 09:59 AM] Jcharming#2693
@joe_land1 comments on getting involved and looking for places to find traction and what to decide to get involved with, came for the DEX stayed for the techs.


[13-Aug-20 10:02 AM] Jcharming#2693
@Jack.  moreso came in following price-action and being a self-described privacy nerd, took a deeper interest in exploring what KMD was doing and with interviews seeming friendly felt they could add value and learn things so when the internship opp came up there was a space that they felt could join in and apply.


[13-Aug-20 10:10 AM] Jcharming#2693
@Audo  shares his true form is the ultimate lurker, starting from the supernet community and then when a question was asked went and gathered info and posted it to the forum in a and suddenly realized that there was value added even though they felt like it wasn't a big deal what was done.  However it was.

**Request** 
Do we have any fav community, forums, or portals related will you bring them to the group and discuss them, share what you think and like about them, and just share.


[13-Aug-20 10:16 AM] joe_land1#1088
NOT 4chan


[13-Aug-20 10:17 AM] joe_land1#1088
although i think it would generally be better to use more "professional" platforms


[13-Aug-20 10:18 AM] joe_land1#1088
like avoid things that are notorious for certain kinds of industries


[13-Aug-20 10:18 AM] joe_land1#1088
like slack?


[13-Aug-20 10:19 AM] Jcharming#2693
__Post meeting comments:__
@sakata asking if the atomicdex is an engine or if it's an application of an underlying engine of chain interoperability.  And how that could be the center of meta blockchain infrastructure.  
Marketing atomicDEX as 2 products in one and marketing them separately as an idea.


[13-Aug-20 10:25 AM] joe_land1#1088
imma hop off, got stuff to do and things to see


[13-Aug-20 10:26 AM] Jcharming#2693
@Audo comments on how there are multi layer solutions going on, and how they really need different names. 

Request to conduct polls to find more names.
