It's not really withdrawing, more making a transaction on your own wallet/address to another addresz.

Is there a way to compile komodod on a low memory machine


[19-Jun-18 03:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm trying to setup a marketmaker node


[19-Jun-18 03:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
on a 1GB RAM VPS


[19-Jun-18 03:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
but getting errors running out of memory compiling Komodo


[19-Jun-18 03:14 AM] CHMEX#0686
I managed to compile it on a 2GB RAM machine  1GB did not work


[19-Jun-18 03:17 AM] CHMEX#0686
also if you intent to run KMD as native it will currently need approx 2GB of RAM
assetchains less


[19-Jun-18 03:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
swapfile


[19-Jun-18 03:21 AM] lukechilds#2707

[19-Jun-18 03:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'll only be running KMD


[19-Jun-18 03:25 AM] CHMEX#0686
my KMD on a BOB uses 1.8GB while running


[19-Jun-18 03:25 AM] lukechilds#2707

[19-Jun-18 03:25 AM] lukechilds#2707

np


[19-Jun-18 03:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
Do you think 2GB is ok?


[19-Jun-18 03:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
or do I really need 3+?


[19-Jun-18 03:34 AM] lukechilds#2707
ah shit I'll need ETOMIC too

[19-Jun-18 03:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah this is just for KMD, ETOMIC  and an ERC20


[19-Jun-18 03:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
just for testing ERC20 in HyperDEX


[19-Jun-18 03:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think 4GB should be fine for that


[19-Jun-18 03:38 AM] CHMEX#0686
I think so yes


[19-Jun-18 03:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
is uptime ok?


[19-Jun-18 03:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
in the last 40 Days they rebooted the host once ( last night ) it's ok for that price


[19-Jun-18 03:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
just cronjob after reboot and you should be fine


[19-Jun-18 03:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, I'll set startup scripts


[19-Jun-18 03:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
that should be fine for this


[19-Jun-18 03:40 AM] lukechilds#2707

@SHossain @siu I haven't heard any issues on coinsdb from any one.


[19-Jun-18 11:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Either nobody tested it enough, or may be it's working as expected.


[19-Jun-18 11:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think it's best to make a release from `coinsdb` branch and publish it's package on release section of repo so general users can test.


[19-Jun-18 11:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
please still keep it only in house testing release...


[19-Jun-18 11:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
means no major announcements until confirmed it's working for those early testers.


[19-Jun-18 11:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
once enough users report it's working as expected, we can merge it to dev branch and to master branch.

wow


[21-Jun-18 04:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <siu> Haha... computergenie has been dumping coqui for quite a while, it was time to pay back üòÇ


[21-Jun-18 04:04 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
actually I've only sold like a total of 400 because your LPs act like they hate me üòõ


[21-Jun-18 04:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
on the + side, I bought that KMD at 27 so it was like 1/2 price COQUI ü§î


[21-Jun-18 04:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <siu> Maybe because youve been spamming it for a while?

[slack] <siu>


[21-Jun-18 04:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
not sure that trying to place a valid order counts as "spamming"...


[21-Jun-18 04:21 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and even if you count it as "spamming", there's still the fact that it lacks liquidity to the point that one has to "spam" it for 2 months in order to sell 400 ü§¶


[21-Jun-18 04:25 AM] CHMEX#0686
Intensive testing I would call it. You might have done up 20% of all atomic swaps.


[21-Jun-18 04:26 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
if 6-10 swaps a week is 20%, then we're in trouble :/

I'm not saying all markets are shit; I'm saying that if your LP isn't working, then you shouldn't say that someone is "spamming" your LP when they are placing legit orders that your LP seems to ignore

[21-Jun-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <siu> there are not much kmd in there though


[21-Jun-18 05:43 AM] Gateway#3763

@siu how many you have put on sale btw ? ü§î


[21-Jun-18 05:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if a lot, then probably make some big UTXOs too? ü§î


[21-Jun-18 05:47 AM] siu#3920
the kmd that are available in the nodes are the ones from the stress test some months ago


[21-Jun-18 05:47 AM] siu#3920
i have never reorganized the utxos


[21-Jun-18 05:47 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the problem seems to be on the KMD side (given how fast the 2 buy COQUI orders went through)


[21-Jun-18 05:47 AM] siu#3920
many of them are very small, like 0.01 or even 0.001


[21-Jun-18 05:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hmm...


[21-Jun-18 05:48 AM] siu#3920
there are plenty of COQUI though


[21-Jun-18 05:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
so I saw üòõ


[21-Jun-18 05:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
anyway, I haven't checked, but is VRSC listing on BarterDEX? üòâ


[21-Jun-18 05:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
means the orders are there ?


[21-Jun-18 05:48 AM] siu#3920
thats what i said was going to be done since ever... the funds from the stress test will be there as liquidty


[21-Jun-18 05:49 AM] siu#3920
sadly must are gone now :p

even after the price rose to 0.25 cents


[21-Jun-18 05:50 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
40 mini trades a month isn't much L coming from your P  üòú


[21-Jun-18 05:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
on the bright side, today is the highest COQUI volume in like "forever" ü§ì


[21-Jun-18 05:54 AM] siu#3920
not more than stress test day


[21-Jun-18 05:54 AM] siu#3920
but yeah... it seems like coqui is taking life of its own

Hi, is it normal to be seeing a lot of `<<<<<<<<<<< A bitcoind_RPC: XXX post_process_bitcoind_RPC.validateaddress` in terminal when running a native coin?


[22-Jun-18 07:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <cipig:matrix.org> no, i would guess it means that mm can't connect to the coin daemon


[22-Jun-18 07:37 AM] CrisF#3405
Is `importprivkey` needed?


[22-Jun-18 07:40 AM] CrisF#3405
I've imported my smartaddress into the BCH but no help from that although the balance shows in bch-cli.


[22-Jun-18 07:40 AM] CrisF#3405
Had no luck with DASH either.


[22-Jun-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <cipig:matrix.org> no, mm does importaddress, not importprivkey... and the funds must reside in the mm smartaddress (generated from the passphrase) to be accessible by mm, so importing a privkey with a totally different address does not make the funds accessible in BarterDEX


[22-Jun-18 08:41 AM] CrisF#3405
Hmm, I wonder why won't connect then.  I can see the smartaddress balance shows up in electrum but not native.  KMD is fine in both.


[22-Jun-18 08:43 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll try on a native coin installed locally (not on ssd).  Maybe that'll work.

Blockfolio Nate:
Hi, I'm a dev from Blockfolio. I was wondering if an admin here could reach out to the dev team and ask for a recommended endpoint to retrieve currency pairs, prices, and if possible trade histories.  We're currently using this endpoint https://www.atomicexplorer.com/api/mm/prices to get currency pairs and prices, but the information from there may not be accurate.  Thanks.

Not sure that accepting it as 'normal' is 'good enough', considering most of the world is using Windows... Except if bob bodes are not supposed to be run on Windows. In that case the 'limit price order - good 'til cancelled' may as well be removed from the Windows build. Would save us all some time.

@CHMEX  can you followup with the blockfolio guy


[22-Jun-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
is canbind:1 set for bob mode? if not will have problems


[22-Jun-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is and you cant actually bind, will have problems


[22-Jun-18 10:18 AM] jansako#3330
where do I set that?


[22-Jun-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
when marketmaker is started


[22-Jun-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
but if external nodes cant connect in, you canbind must be 0


[22-Jun-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
and such a node will not make a good bob

I start BarterDEX by 'npm start'

If I make a batch file to start, what exactly would be the syntax?


[22-Jun-18 10:23 AM] jansako#3330
Out of the last 9 swaps, I have 5 successful, 4 failed on 'swap never started'. Does that mean I should use 1 or 0? Seems to me that external nodes can connect 50% of the time?

I pushed a new version that should fix some percentage of stuck swaps. The issue was when bobdeposit takes a long time to confirm, bob was immediately waiting for alicepayment, but alice didnt send alicepayment until bobdeposit confirmed. If bobdeposit took longer than 30 minutes (for non-BTC) to confirm, the swap would stop after alicepayment. please update and let me know if it works properly. you should see some waiting for bobdeposit on the bob side now. it is only in jl777 branch until I get confirmation it is working

@cipi I am wondering if we have ever tested using 10+ SPV servers for a single client. 2 is the minimum, but if both get into an error state, the user is stuck getting errors. I think  a way to make SPV much more reliable is having 10+  electrums. maybe even win10 might work?


[23-Jun-18 08:00 AM] cipi#4502
i think the most i had enabled were 4, but i don't like it that much to use others then my electrum1/2-servers, since i don't know where these other servers are located and so it could happen that i get connected to one from Zimbabwe  üòÑ


[23-Jun-18 08:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> Do we know what is throughput one electrum can handle?


[23-Jun-18 08:05 AM] cipi#4502
that depends on the server, the network and the electrumx-implementation (both server and client)...


[23-Jun-18 08:08 AM] cipi#4502
btw, i never saw the load on the electrums going higher then 0.5 (with 4 cores this is 12.5%)... does not include networking stuff, but AWS is pretty good with that, so i doubt networking will ever be a problem


[23-Jun-18 08:10 AM] cipi#4502
the resource that makes most problems is RAM, since most wallets consume much too much RAM


[23-Jun-18 08:20 AM] cipi#4502
next time i will have to redeploy electrum-servers, i will configure swap space on them... 2 of the 6 have swap enabled and they are using it pretty much, 15GB are swapped out, although the server has 15GB RAM free... that indicates that most of the electrums/wallets/coins are not really used, they are just sitting there waiting for connections


[23-Jun-18 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
can we setup a 10+ SPV for a test trading pair and see if it increases the reliability


[23-Jun-18 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
can be for a small size blockcain pair


[23-Jun-18 08:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> If i get the servers i can clusterize the setup

pushed to dev branch a very significant new flag and bug fix!


[23-Jun-18 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
all orders now support a "fill":1 flag, if set the order must fill 100% the volume specified. since many people complained about this (even if they got a better price) it should reduce complaints, alice has utxos


[23-Jun-18 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
while implemeting it for bobside, I realized that somewhere along the way, bob scanning of smaller sized trades was lost! So I now have bob scanning smaller and smaller trade sizes if he cant fill the full order (only if fill:0 which will be the default for any older versions)


[23-Jun-18 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
from what I see bob not filling partial orders is the main cause for people not being able to ordermatch. the other is networking troubles, especially on windows. current fix wont change that but being able to  ordermatch partials will increase ordermatch (and user complaints that the full order didnt complete). Before alice was operatng as fill:0 and bob as fill:1

from the user point of view alice.fill.0/bob.fill.1 would likely look very similar to alice.fill.0/bob.fill.0
of course until all the bobs update, we wont see the full effect. updating my bobs


[23-Jun-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
they are all updated


[23-Jun-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the reason we didnt find this was alice doing the partial fills (Scanning for utxo that fit) made it so partial fills were normal and the assumption was bob was also doing fill:0

thre is fill and gtc now:
fill:0 gtc:0 <- how it behaved before, basically an immediate or cancel order
fill:1 gtc:0 is a fill or kill order
fill:1 gtc:1 is probably the thing to do for a default
fill:0 gtc:1 will stop as soon as any part of the order is done

also as soon as a trade starts, it basically cancels the gtc


[24-Jun-18 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810

[24-Jun-18 06:21 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, I got tired of hearing about how mm is so hard to use due to utxo. now the only utxo issue alice needs to follow is to have one big enough for the trade and one for the dexfee. hopefully that wont be too hard for people. also, it will autosplit if they ignored the instrutions and only have one utxo

@siu @cipi can any of you please compile and place this fill/gcc enabled mm to coinsdb repo ?


[24-Jun-18 06:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or I guess I can just compile and test it locally.

same as before?


[24-Jun-18 07:04 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, they had all but stopped last night (had 1 trade in like 12 hrs)


[24-Jun-18 07:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <cipig:matrix.org> fixed the systemctl-problem on one of the electrums... `systemctl kill` did the job... i don't know, but in my opinion the old sysV stuff was better then systemcl... more stable, much more simpler, straightforward and so on


[24-Jun-18 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
the nodes got pretty low on KMD, just dust for the most part


[24-Jun-18 07:06 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
for my trades, the amount of liquidity isn't usually an issue (since I use algos based on orderbook output, if bob has it, then that's what it gets placed as)


[24-Jun-18 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
they look like they are mostly success trades


[24-Jun-18 07:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

what you guys says that if I just remove this method from simple/default interface and just use the condition of `full` and `gtc` now

great! thanks again @artem.pikulin üôÇ


[24-Jun-18 07:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c oh you mean you added it as default option to all trades ?


[24-Jun-18 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe people will want partial fills, so it could just be two checkboxes default on


[24-Jun-18 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
gtc [x]
fill[x]


[24-Jun-18 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
gtc:0 fill:0 is immediate or cancel and should show up when that is the pair set


[24-Jun-18 07:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
right, okay I just add these two more boxes and don't change the autoprice option. I leave it there.


[24-Jun-18 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
gtc:0 fill:1 is fill or kill


[24-Jun-18 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
this has NOTHING to do with autoprioce

gtc:1 fill:0 is good till cancelled or partially filled


[24-Jun-18 07:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, that's clear, I just thoguht of just changing the purpose of already showing UI options there to new backend options.
will just add new UI options there.


[24-Jun-18 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
also be careful when testing anything to do with BTC. you are guaranteed to get a 30 minute delay in blocks

obviously using BarterDEX


[24-Jun-18 07:21 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
It takes time to build Linux and Mac versions after windows is done.


[24-Jun-18 07:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay üëç I'll just code the UI part until then


[24-Jun-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
I didnt implement support for ETH stuff with the latest


[24-Jun-18 07:22 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Appveyor tags a build and then Travis builds other versions.


[24-Jun-18 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so not sure if they will have any effect. maybe some parts of it will work


[24-Jun-18 07:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
just confirming, the artem's builds have the fill/gtc in it, right ?


[24-Jun-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont think bob will do autoutxo creation, but it probably doesnt matter


[24-Jun-18 07:23 AM] jl777c#5810
for ETH as 1 ETOMIC is the size for all


[24-Jun-18 07:23 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, I merged everything from jl777 dev branch, however it might not work properly for ETH/ERC20, needs to be tested.


[24-Jun-18 07:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
great! thanks for confirming. can see both osx and linux bins there too. üôÇ


[24-Jun-18 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i know the LP_autofillbob() wont do anything for etomic coins


[24-Jun-18 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
but it likely doesnt have to


[24-Jun-18 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
as they dont have utxo to begin with


[24-Jun-18 07:29 AM] cipi#4502
@grewalsatinder the build from artem is done... should i upload it to coinsdb-branch of BarterDEX-GUI?

yes plz


[24-Jun-18 07:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[24-Jun-18 07:38 AM] cipi#4502
windows binaries are missing in dev... should i upload the windows mm to dev, or do you just merge them from coinsdb?


[24-Jun-18 07:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@cipi If you can do, please update the ReadMe file for jl777/coins 
because from now on any new coin add requests has to ONLY go in that repo.


[24-Jun-18 07:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and for that anyone who'll push the add request has to have all the requirements completed and make sure the format is accurate .

@artem.pikulin do you have a windows10 system to test with? I keep hearing there are SPV problems with windows. If you can duplicate this issue, maybe we can get it fixed?


[24-Jun-18 07:43 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, I have win 10 as secondary OS, are there any steps to reproduce an issue?


[24-Jun-18 07:45 AM] siu#3920
No particular steps


[24-Jun-18 07:45 AM] siu#3920
Just try a swap in windowa the issue should be visible every so often


[24-Jun-18 07:47 AM] cipi#4502
@grewalsatinder committed the missing Windows-mm to dev... everything ok now


[24-Jun-18 07:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
cool üëç


[24-Jun-18 08:20 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
There is 1 slight issue with the auto-retry (for lack of better term) in the new code: the timer interferes with other market orders


[24-Jun-18 08:23 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
i.e., if you gtc SUPERNET/KMD and try to place CoinX/CoinY, the new order can meet against "please wait x seconds..." (even if it's been minutes since 1st order)


[24-Jun-18 08:23 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@siu what kind of issue should I expect with SPV mode on win 10? I need more details.


[24-Jun-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> you will get a "swap never started error"


[24-Jun-18 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
@ComputerGenie yes, not sure what to do about that. really i should support an arbitrary number of parallel trades for alice, but I cant fully vizualize all the code paths in that scenario so I am reluctant to do it. on the plus side, you can  have many gtc orders and it will try to cycle through. i guess there is a starvation bug though, let me fix that


[24-Jun-18 08:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> swap itself will get stuck, mostly at waiting for alice payment


[24-Jun-18 08:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> i need to add gtc=1 in client script ?

[24-Jun-18 08:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> ok


[24-Jun-18 08:33 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@jl777c It's not entirely a "bad" thing; just wanted folks to be aware as I think there should be something to let users know that this happens and is "by design" (rather than getting a flood of "this shit doesn't work anymore")


[24-Jun-18 08:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
A simple warning can go a long way in fighting confusion-based FUD


[24-Jun-18 08:35 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
op err generally being seen as bugs and all that


[24-Jun-18 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
mixing modes will be the only way to run into this, but yes it is a confusion issue


[24-Jun-18 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed a version that should be pretty resistant to starving any specific gtc order, ie. they should mostly get the same number of attempts

@artem.pikulin my guess is windows is getting some sort of error that isnt being handled because none of the unix based sockets behave that way. MSFT spent billions of dollars making windows work the same, just different to lock in people to their apps (which were the only ones that knew how to work around all the silliness as it isnt really documented)

[24-Jun-18 09:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thinking about adding a feature of autoupdating `marketmaker` ü§î


[24-Jun-18 09:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if done, that will look for releases on github repo, exactly like right now artem releases those on his git repo.


[24-Jun-18 09:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll code to check github api for a repo to check for new version of marketmaker.


[24-Jun-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that will eliminate releasing a new barterdex release just for updated marketmaker.


[24-Jun-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but then again, I need the tags which can be helpful.


[24-Jun-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like if it's stable, or nightly or experimental etc.


[24-Jun-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
based on those I can let user set the setting in app to download specific version only.

just turn them on

probably your price was too low


[24-Jun-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
or if you have fill:1 no bob had the right sized utxo, but the latest version they will autocreate them

if they can and it isnt a large percentage of their balance >25%

completed BTC KMD trade. It was quicker. far quicker üôÇ üëç


[24-Jun-18 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it is impossible to get 100% ordermatch rate. if it was possible you would have to fill all orders no matter how ridiculous


[24-Jun-18 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
that wont be happening, so there will still be errors


[24-Jun-18 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the key is finding errors that shouldnt be happening


[24-Jun-18 11:00 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I found a glitch (still looking on exactly how to replicate it since I had 2 scripts running and a manual buy order) where BTC/KMD buy of KMD turned itself into a sell KMD


[24-Jun-18 11:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
CHIPS KMD trade started quicker too! I just placed the order matching my inventory utxo and it started üòÉ


[24-Jun-18 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a pervasize change so we do need to test all the usual cases. likely doing 2 or more trade api calls at the same time would lead to unexpected results, but having it flip the order around, I am not sure how that would happen


[24-Jun-18 11:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu pushed a bug fix for `fill` `gtc` buttons for linux.
I noticed on linux it somehow starts as off state. They should by default start as on.
so if user for example turns them off, goes back to portfolio screen, clicks on exchange button, they will by default be on.
also they must be on after first time login to barterdex too.
let me know if you still find them off by default etc.


[24-Jun-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> ok


[24-Jun-18 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be a better default is gtc:1 fill:0, but not sure. depends on if it is better to get a partial fill or to sometimes/usually get a complete fill 5 to 10 min later

pushed possible fix for spontaneously reversing the order. it looks like some edge cases it is possible for alice to become bob


[24-Jun-18 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
i made it so that doesnt happen. if you had autoprice going and do an alice trade for the same pair, then temporarily it should cancel the bob order and then come back with the next autoprice iteration


[24-Jun-18 11:50 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
> some edge cases it is possible for alice to become bob
In those cases, if the order stops at bob deposit, will later swapstatus still pick up the fail and return deposit?


[24-Jun-18 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
any swap that gets started will generate the DB/SWAPS files and that has the info needed to reclaim bobdeposi

@ComputerGenie ok, I think I really fixed the spontaneaous bob issue. internally now there are separate sets of prices for alice vs bob, so if you are not doing bob things like autoprice there wont be any bob price to ordermatch


[25-Jun-18 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
before there was a single set of prices so if you did an alice order, it ended up with a bob price for the reverse for a short period of time and if an incoming alice request came in, it could have started the ordermatch process. But I think it would not have completed as there wasnt a pending alice order i that direction.

this is expected behavior


[25-Jun-18 04:13 AM] jl777c#5810
to "fix" this would require forcing bob to accept whatever price alice offers and while alice would be quite happy to have all her orders filled (regardless of price) it is possible some bobs will complain

that should fix it. after adding any new coins using the manage coin function, you need to restart the GUI for the changes to take effect

That made it worse, although deling CoinsDB did get etomic this time


[25-Jun-18 05:54 AM] cipi#4502
there is also a reset coinsdb-button somewhere  on the coins-management page...


[25-Jun-18 05:59 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
ya, I found that and it works if I add each manually, but I couldn't get it to add all (I think it just hates me)


[25-Jun-18 06:01 AM] cipi#4502
all? you mean all coins? that will not work since there are more then 255 coins and the limit is 255... that is why all this was made, to prevent having more then 255 coins in the coins-file


[25-Jun-18 06:01 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"all" meaning any default set larger than just KMD, BTC, and etomic


[25-Jun-18 06:02 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
or is that the intention (just 3 and manually add anything else)?


[25-Jun-18 06:03 AM] cipi#4502
yes, there is a default collection, i think it is BTC, KMD and ETOMIC and every other coin must be added manually to your collection... and you have to restart BarterDEX after adding coins


[25-Jun-18 06:04 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
fek me, I shoulda backed up my folder before doing a pull üò≠


[25-Jun-18 06:06 AM] cipi#4502
and when you add coins with the coins-management-page they are only added to coins.json and the icons and stuff is downloaded... you will have to also enable them as usualk after restarting BarterDEX

and you will see an opreturn withdraw when you send normal ordermatch packets (if CHIPS enabled and funded)


[25-Jun-18 09:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
any recommendations for BarterDEX GUI if I should have CHIPS autoenabled like KMD/BTC/ETOMIC in app ?


[25-Jun-18 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is in the system, probably a good idea to enable it


[25-Jun-18 09:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay will add that there in default coins list.


[25-Jun-18 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if SPV it shouldnt be automatic though


[25-Jun-18 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
it could slow things down, not sure


[25-Jun-18 09:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
clear
then I'll have it added to default coins list which shows on first startup like on fresh install and let user decide which mode they want to have it setup to autoenable it to.

@siu using the latest commit from dev ?

No, have not tested latest commit yet. Im out for lunch


[26-Jun-18 07:45 AM] siu#3920

thanks mate

@grewalsatinder what I'm saying is that whatever is  producing:
`Shepard arg: "coins_db_read_electrums"
Shepard arg: "coins_db_read_coins_json"
Shepard arg: "coins_db_read_explorers"
Shepard arg: "coins_db_read_electrums"

Shepard arg: "coins_db_read_explorers"
Shepard arg: "coins_db_read_electrums"
Shepard arg: "coins_db_read_coins_json"

repeatedly
should be throttled when not needed

@ComputerGenie I just did what I thought I could do. Can please you fix the logic of it to suite what you think it should be ?

@siu I had very old build running on my test windows 10 vm.
just ran this latest dev branch on it and it's working as expected.


[26-Jun-18 08:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
just had to do the same thing we do on linux and osx

[slack] <siu> Ok


[26-Jun-18 08:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
- on first start, reset local coins db

@cipi @siu @SHossain I reseted the default coins.json in the dev branch.


[26-Jun-18 10:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu please test latest dev branch


[26-Jun-18 10:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
fresh install


[26-Jun-18 10:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
on linux


[26-Jun-18 10:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it was the method difference between windows and linux for coins.json which was bit issue


[26-Jun-18 10:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so without breaking too much of existing code the simpler way was to just make the coins.json file default to what it is expected by coinsdb feature.


[26-Jun-18 10:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
from this commit on all coins db info is now only in jl777/coins repo.


[26-Jun-18 10:19 AM] cipi#4502
@jl777c the call "blockchain.transaction.get" now has an additional parameter, verbose (boolean) and mm doesn't pass it, which causes some error messages... could you add that parameter to the call? Here is the docu: https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx/blob/master/docs/protocol-methods.rst#blockchaintransactionget ... question is also which format does mm needs, the raw, hex transaction, or the nice json one...

[26-Jun-18 10:30 AM] cipi#4502
hmmm, that is a good question, the ones i run myself will certainly support it, but the public ones that we also use may still have some older version running... hmmm, not sure what is the best way to deal with that


[26-Jun-18 10:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@cipi  best would be to have the contact info included in the JSON of Electrum server info.


[26-Jun-18 10:33 AM] cipi#4502
the dev of electrumx-server has made a code change to get rid of the error, i will have to restart all electrums to see if it solved the problem... i have no other option, since all electrum-servers are logging to the same /var/log/syslog file


[26-Jun-18 10:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@grewalsatinder sure, i can do that... hopefully it will not brake the other applications (HyperDEX and Agama)... and i can only add that info to the servers i run, the public ones will remain without that info

did no change to barterdex code and it added the electrum servers fine


[26-Jun-18 10:40 AM] cipi#4502
ok... will add that info after dealing with the electrums servers themselves... what is this info used for?


[26-Jun-18 10:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that is in case you or anyone have to contact the electrum server owners


[26-Jun-18 10:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
just like now is the case to update the electrum servers


[26-Jun-18 10:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there should be a method to contact them


[26-Jun-18 10:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
any way possible, bitmessage, twitter, skype, email, etc etc.


[26-Jun-18 10:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
you can also make this contact  key another array or object

ok, i see the problem... when i ask the server about a non existent tx `{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "error": {"code": 2, "message": "daemon error: {'code': -1, 'message': 'JSON value is not an integer as expected'}"}, "id": 1}` is returned instead of the error string "not found"... will play a bit with it, maybe i can "fix" it myself... but it would of course be better if this workaround would not be necessary, since changes in the code can break it

`slowresponse.2`does not look very good, seems bob is not doing very well


[26-Jun-18 03:10 PM] cipi#4502
had a couple of such bobs, look especially at SUPERNET and CHIPS... the cheap bobs for this coins are doing the same... and the symptoms are the same... that's why i asked if we could penalize such bobs more and simply remove them from the orderbook


[26-Jun-18 03:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> but why do bobs get into that state?


[26-Jun-18 03:14 PM] cipi#4502
that is a good question... asked myself the same question... maybe that are simply very old installations that are still running, but where nobody really takes care of this bobs... but i don't know, i just speculate

[26-Jun-18 03:16 PM] cipi#4502
and if that is indeed the case, then removing them from orderbook is the best option, because i suppose that more people are running into the same problem

the others all synced fine. 
KMD is still synching might take an hour or so.


[27-Jun-18 12:57 AM] jl777c#5810
its in the MoMoM code, reported to libscott, likely due to the massive size OP_RETURN


[27-Jun-18 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
you are using the new -addressindex?


[27-Jun-18 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to resync with -addressindex for it to update the data

ok I will do that. having it in the .conf is not enough?

[27-Jun-18 06:13 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
FOXNews coin?


[27-Jun-18 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> imo the issue with the fresh install of barterdex is that it doesnt create a coins.json file and the code still looks for it


[27-Jun-18 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> maybe add a coins.json file with just kmd added?


[27-Jun-18 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> yep


[27-Jun-18 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> that fixes it


[27-Jun-18 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> i added COQUI (or just KMD can be added) to a coins.json file i created myself and it loaded


[27-Jun-18 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> grewalsatinder: i think the gui still needs to create a coins.json file with kmd in it only


[27-Jun-18 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> it will start


[27-Jun-18 06:18 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
at a glance, it looks to be that the problem is it's looking for `coins.json` which doesn't get written from `coins`


[27-Jun-18 06:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <siu:matrix.org> yes


[27-Jun-18 06:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu yes, I found some changes I did in linux machine weren't pushed to git. just pushed those.

Having trouble with the 'add coins to local database'. I have already added a few and all is working, now would like to add more. After clicking the button 'add coins to local database', nothing happens. I am on 1.1.0 Dev branch.


[28-Jun-18 12:38 AM] jansako#3330
Ah, right. the dev branch does not have the drop-down menu to actually add the coin. Switched to Master, the drop-down is there.

trying to find workaround.


[28-Jun-18 11:56 PM] cipi#4502
lol... windows... what a massive global waste of development manpower


[28-Jun-18 11:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was actually expecting this kinda of issue. and that is why I was asking if any of the testers found any bug or not before merging it to dev üòÑ


[29-Jun-18 12:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the issue is that on html load finishing the javascript code on html side triggers to get the list of `coins` file data which is downloaded from github, so that it can show all those coins' list in the drop down select box, but since it takes more time to reflect the result, the code asynchronously moves to the next part before it gets the results and just executes the code check for `if the returned db data is == 0`


[29-Jun-18 12:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and just executes that part, and then again triggers the next call to re execute and check if the db is having some data or not, and I see it executes it like 20 times before quiting, means getting the expected data output


[29-Jun-18 12:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thing is I have not put that part in promise code, so that will probably fix it.


[29-Jun-18 12:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
doing jus that


[29-Jun-18 12:10 AM] jansako#3330

yes, that undefined is valid.


[29-Jun-18 01:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
because the default coins.json file of old installation is not there anymore and the path of the image files and the returned data of new coins.json doesn't has the names and short names, it did not get any output, so it is undefined.


[29-Jun-18 01:04 AM] Bing#0420
ok so how do i fix it?


[29-Jun-18 01:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
as you'll be able to add the coins on your left panel, the right panel will start loading info fine.


[29-Jun-18 01:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
wait for my next update


[29-Jun-18 01:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
after my update you'll be able to see the select drop down list in left panel


[29-Jun-18 01:05 AM] Bing#0420
oh alright! didn't know


[29-Jun-18 01:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
from that list you'll be able to select and add the coins you want to have in your local db.


[29-Jun-18 01:05 AM] Bing#0420
I just thought it was weird because I have balances in those wallets


[29-Jun-18 01:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
after that your issue will be fixed of as showing undfined etc.

[29-Jun-18 01:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
because of stupid winblows


[29-Jun-18 01:06 AM] Bing#0420
I will be able to select and my wallet will show up again?


[29-Jun-18 01:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, that's correct.


[29-Jun-18 01:07 AM] Bing#0420

@Bing pushed fix for windows issue


[29-Jun-18 02:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you are using git repo to test and try barterdex, use dev branch and get latest updates with `git pull`


[29-Jun-18 02:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
then start as usual with `npm start`


[29-Jun-18 02:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
also found one more bug which would have not downloaded images and extra files on fresh install of barterdex, fixed that too in latest commit.


[29-Jun-18 02:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@cipi @siu @SHossain FYI


[29-Jun-18 03:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

testing on windows


[29-Jun-18 03:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I no confirmation if that is fixed or not


[29-Jun-18 03:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
has anyone sent eth from barterdex recently ?


[29-Jun-18 03:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
did it work for you?


[29-Jun-18 03:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[29-Jun-18 03:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
may be because of fresh install test ü§î

@grewalsatinder i tried to withdraw ETH using Send button. Didn't show anything and didn't work


[29-Jun-18 03:46 AM] SHossain#0007
using latest


[29-Jun-18 03:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@zenn3 yes, noticed the same, and talking about it in #deleted-channel


[29-Jun-18 03:47 AM] SHossain#0007
but, adding coins into local db works fine


[29-Jun-18 03:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll need to do some update to eth withdraw in GUI


[29-Jun-18 03:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
wait for it's update too

even though this is my first buy order after login, the GUI throws warning to wait for the previous pending order. recently, i'm seeing this issue. i clicked only once


[29-Jun-18 03:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm not sure if it's GUI issue or `marketmaker`


[29-Jun-18 04:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
cleared on changes required for ETH withdraw, will work on it. can expect it resolved by next week start.


[29-Jun-18 04:13 AM] SHossain#0007
should we advice users not to use the withdraw funtion for ETH/ERC20 until it is fixed?


[29-Jun-18 04:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes


[29-Jun-18 04:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
be assured that there is no issue if the withdraw fails. It actually is incomplete command issued on eth withdraw, so it never gets broadcasted.


[29-Jun-18 04:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so there is nothing to worry about this bug.

If I click a button that's the equivalent of "I'm never going to use these charts", it would seem to me that's a good way to know


[29-Jun-18 07:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
do you get any analytics of how many users are using bartedex and how many have explicitly enabled or disabled these kinda of settings ?


[29-Jun-18 07:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that would help.


[29-Jun-18 07:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not really, because most input we had on charts had to do with the lack of functionality; along the lines of "fek it, they don't work anyway so meh it'll be OK if they're gone"
Which was the reason for "hide" iirc


[29-Jun-18 07:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
true that. but I'd prefer to have them replaced than just removed.
just single red line of 404 from lib is harmless to the console log which don't show to anyone.
and I don't see it slowing down anything in the app.

I downloaded this latest version but can't add coins, they're all "undefined" in the menu and without icons. If I try to add any it says there's no electrum servers. The tar.zg package on Ubuntu


[30-Jun-18 02:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
You have to go to "manage Coins", do a reset, manually add whatever coins(s) you want, and then restart

thanks, it works now!

[30-Jun-18 03:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@agnewpickens You're correct, this wasn't in earlier releases.
BarterDEX has reached a point where it actually works with "too many" coins.
The current solution seemed the best option, I'm sure that over time it will become more intuitive and "user-friendly"


[30-Jun-18 03:33 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Can only figure out how to add one other coin right now, will take this up later.

@grewalsatinder can we add a startup dialogue to barterDEX that says "You have to go to "manage Coins", do a reset, manually add whatever coins(s) you want, and then restart"
it seems everybody has the same problem and there is no way to really know this


[01-Jul-18 11:32 PM] Acura#2748
It would be cool to change the BarterDex Settings/ Manage Coins without entering a Seed - Maybe it's workable like in Agama


[02-Jul-18 05:18 AM] PTYX#6840
we need to add the same seed login mechanism to barterdex too so users don't have to paste teh seed all the time

With current dev branch win build of mm (originally posted in #dev-marketmaker, but deleted and move here because I cannot replicate it directly using mm on nix) :

`broadcast error.({"result":null,"error":{"code":-26,"message":"16: mandatory-script-verify-flag-failed (Script evaluated without error but finished with a false/empty top stack element)"},"id":"jl777"})`
any idea why I keep getting this and swaps never start?

`myfee rawtxsend.[226] 9e7837d7bab30c8b5ce4bddece5bf78b456acc408fe254d929dc57c3b3622b9c vs 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000`
seems to be related because bobdeposits are being made despite myfee not being paid


[02-Jul-18 10:49 AM] cipi#4502
@MAISIE no, the only bob offering SANC for sale is my own... and i had to use a fixed price, because there is no external price source to do autoprice... SANC is not on CMC... the SANC-guys would have to run their own bob, i assume they have enough SANC and i assume they want to sell some


[02-Jul-18 10:51 AM] cipi#4502
but the txfees on ETH chain are anyway extremely high: https://etherscan.io/gastracker, so every swap would cost 5$ txfees or so... i don't think that someone would want to trade erc20 tokens when the txfees are so high... maybe if they want to swap tokens worth 10000$ üòÉ

so a windows specific tx signing bug for SUPERNET... any other coins have the same problem?


[02-Jul-18 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'll have to check later, at the time all I had on the rig was sn and coqui and bobs were ignoring couqi offers altogether


[02-Jul-18 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
windows and native ?


[02-Jul-18 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes to both (using qt wallet)


[02-Jul-18 01:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm doing a rescan on that wallet, atm,, there seems to be a conflicting total balance between that wallet and my normal trading nix wallet; not sure if that could be part/all of the issue or not


[02-Jul-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the problem is likely something related to wallet, if the same utxo are used on different nodes, it could get confused, but it should be failing everytime


[02-Jul-18 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
or it could be as simply annoying as:
because, winduhs üò£


[02-Jul-18 01:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
not sure what other reason a node with `connect` would have a different balance than the node it's connected too

i need some help with the latest additions gtc and the other one üòÖ


[04-Jul-18 01:53 AM] jorian#4555
so until before those changes, i could define a maxprice and a volume in my buy order. if there was no matching order, nothing would happen and i would need to decrease my volume or increase the price.


[04-Jul-18 01:54 AM] jorian#4555
now, i see this:
```2998 uuid.96905dc380817bc774115a666f8c84fc M.0 g.0 f.0      request   BTC/KMD     0.09938556 -> 399.90010000 (4031.83790060) | RT.0 0 n0
2998 uuid.96905dc380817bc774115a666f8c84fc M.0 g.0 f.0     reserved   BTC/KMD     0.05312318 -> 177.73337777 (3358.32763205) | RT.0 0 n0```


[04-Jul-18 01:56 AM] jorian#4555
and i dont understand what's happening. first, the volume i specified is lowered to 177 KMD. i get 0.05312 BTC for that, meaning that it has a price of 3358


[04-Jul-18 01:58 AM] jorian#4555
that would make it a good deal for me, if it actually connected, which it doesn't: quote validate error -2


[04-Jul-18 01:58 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
`gtc:0 fill:1 is fill or kill
gtc:1 fill:1 is a good till canceled and filled
gtc:1 fill:0 is good till cancelled or partially filled`


[04-Jul-18 01:59 AM] jorian#4555
so if i define fill:1, the behaviour would be as before the changes?


[04-Jul-18 01:59 AM] jorian#4555
and gtc:0


[04-Jul-18 02:01 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
afaik, gtc:0 fill:1 *should be* kill any remaining bits not filled


[04-Jul-18 02:02 AM] jorian#4555
(there is no documentation about this on docs.komodoplatform.com as far as i can see)


[04-Jul-18 02:02 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and 0 0 is "If I can't fill it all right now, then I don't want anything"


[04-Jul-18 02:02 AM] jorian#4555
so why does the above happen


[04-Jul-18 02:03 AM] jorian#4555
if i understand you correctly, nothing should've happened


[04-Jul-18 02:03 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it may be that you understand me, but I'm wrong


[04-Jul-18 02:04 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
as far as 00, I'm going by what was added to the GUI


[04-Jul-18 02:04 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
they put "Fill immediate or cancel order"


[04-Jul-18 02:05 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the 3 I quoted in code tags was direct from james


[04-Jul-18 02:06 AM] jorian#4555
ok, i just added fill:1 to my buy and it indeed just killed. i think g.0 f.1 is behaviour as it was before


[04-Jul-18 02:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
one thing I'm certain of, gtc 1 will go on *forever* üòõ


[04-Jul-18 02:07 AM] jorian#4555
it's like setting autoprice?


[04-Jul-18 02:07 AM] jorian#4555
or wait


[04-Jul-18 02:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
kinda, it reoffers on a timer


[04-Jul-18 02:08 AM] jorian#4555
yes, actively? bobs are passively waiting for an offer to come by, but gtc is actively sending such an offer onto the market?


[04-Jul-18 02:08 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
1 1 is kinda like bot offer should be


[04-Jul-18 02:09 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
gtc 1 fill 0 is like bot that quits on partial fill


[04-Jul-18 02:10 AM] jorian#4555
aha, got it


[04-Jul-18 02:11 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
you can issue a cancel to cli, but you have to know the uuid of the offer


[04-Jul-18 02:23 AM] jl777c#5810
gtc:0 fill:1 was how it was before


[04-Jul-18 02:23 AM] SHossain#0007
fill:0 gtc:1 will stop as soon as any part of the order is done


[04-Jul-18 02:24 AM] jl777c#5810
I am not hearing many complaints about utxo after recent changes, not sure if it is due to problems disappearing or not


[04-Jul-18 02:26 AM] jorian#4555
it still is cumbersome to buy something. busy for 30 minutes now, orders get either stuck at reserved, connect or get quote validate error -2


[04-Jul-18 02:27 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
so far, the only UTXO issue I've seen is that if you place multiple gtc 1 fill 1 offers it will sometimes confuse itself and try to use the same UTXO for more than one
at which point the newly "relocked" UTXO can't be used for the original offer that thought it locked it
But I think it's just edge cases like me that will ever have it happen


[04-Jul-18 02:29 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
`orders get either stuck at reserved, connect `
How much of that is a bad bob issue @jorian ?


[04-Jul-18 02:30 AM] jorian#4555
probably. there's too many bad bobs out there


[04-Jul-18 02:30 AM] SHossain#0007

i installed the new electrum-servers i got from @carl ... we now have 3 regions (NA, EU, Asia) with 3 electrums in each regions ... the DNS entries are updated and this is the PR for the coins repo: https://github.com/jl777/coins/pull/104 ... added the third DNS-entry (electrum3), electrum1/2 remained the same (same port) ... had to remove ARG and BLK (ARG wallet is crashing too often and BLK does not work any more, probably because the wallet is very ancient) @pbca26 @lukechilds

For the life of me I can‚Äôt seem to get any BTC/KMD alice orders to fill.  I have suitable kmd UTXOs (65s, 73 and some others) using gtc 1 and fill 1.  Alice just keeps expiring.  Can‚Äôt seem to get past request stage.  Trade amount 0.015 and price of 0.00026. That‚Äôs significantly over asking price and someone has a maxvol of 0.02, I‚Äôm not clear why I can‚Äôt seem to get a match lately. Tried an asset chain (kmd/dex) and that went though (unsurprisingly) without a hitch.

If bob is looking for 0.00026, then you want to entice him with 0.000258 not 0.00027

The other thing to remember is that because BTC is BTC, the markets might not always work and or take hours to move a swap when the mempool is congested or average fees are up

[05-Jul-18 05:55 AM] tolken#2655
Was kinda amusing, took me weeks before someone successfully traded on my kmd/bch bob, but was probably 5 min and had first kmd btc bob trade. Received 0.016948, so a bit above that threshold.

[07-Jul-18 10:04 PM] tolken#2655
Why is it when I‚Äôm doing an ltc/kmd Alice buy is it warning. ‚ÄúAddress_myutxopair couldn‚Äôt find LTC (my address) targets 0.003 0.006375 priceiter.8 voliter.7 price 52.3107 vol 0.00000‚Äù ?  I‚Äôm buying with kmd, why is it worried about what LTC UTXOs I have?


[07-Jul-18 10:34 PM] tolken#2655
:/


[08-Jul-18 12:48 AM] jl777c#5810
are you 100% sure you are on the KMD side?


[08-Jul-18 06:31 AM] tolken#2655
Im issuing a ‚Äúbuy‚Äù using ltc/kmd which should mean I‚Äôm buying ltc, selling kmd right? @jl777c


[08-Jul-18 06:33 AM] tolken#2655
I have had one Alice buy go through successfully using this basic syntax, resulting in a deposit of LTC into my account.


[08-Jul-18 07:11 AM] tolken#2655
I guess this isn‚Äôt expected behavior?


[08-Jul-18 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
that is correct behavior


[08-Jul-18 08:21 AM] tolken#2655
Why is it seemingly concerned with my ltc UTXOs when I‚Äôm selling kmd? Am I misunderstanding? Is it complaining about bobs UTXOs here, rather than mine?


[08-Jul-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
yes it could indeed be complaining about bob


[08-Jul-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
but myutxopair wouldnt be called on bob's utxos...


[08-Jul-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
very strange one


[08-Jul-18 08:48 AM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôll collect more specifics and post back.


[08-Jul-18 08:51 AM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôve been testing with gtc and fill args, immediate output is a bit different, particularly with the full being 0 or 1. I‚Äôll post results of both.

I see in my DB dir I have a rather populated GTC (more than I anticipated) file, gunna try purging that and see how that affects things.


[08-Jul-18 09:41 AM] tolken#2655
More or less the same result after purging gtc


[08-Jul-18 09:42 AM] tolken#2655
Please let me know if any other information might help diagnose.


[08-Jul-18 10:00 AM] tolken#2655
I think whatever this is may be why I‚Äôm getting such unreliable non-assetchain swaps. I see at least 3 bobs that have adequate maxvols for me to buy LTC from,  but except for one lucky time yesterday, I keep getting the error above, never progressing beyond the request.


[08-Jul-18 10:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the only "error" I see is that you don't have UTXOs to match what you're trying to swap


[08-Jul-18 10:35 AM] SHossain#0007
```
fill:0 gtc:0 <- how it behaved before, basically an immediate or cancel order
fill:1 gtc:0 is a fill or kill order
fill:1 gtc:1 is probably the thing to do for a default
fill:0 gtc:1 will stop as soon as any part of the order is done
```
and, use both fill and gtc param


[08-Jul-18 10:35 AM] SHossain#0007
not only `fill` but also `gtc`


[08-Jul-18 10:35 AM] tolken#2655
I have tried both, I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs the issue.


[08-Jul-18 10:36 AM] SHossain#0007
also, you need UTXO, bob need UTXO and good connection with native mode


[08-Jul-18 10:36 AM] tolken#2655
@ComputerGenie the issue Is that it‚Äôs complaining about my ltc UTXOs when I‚Äôm buying with kmd. Doesn‚Äôt make much sense


[08-Jul-18 10:36 AM] tolken#2655
I have plenty of UTXOs, varied sizes


[08-Jul-18 10:37 AM] tolken#2655
They are under the maxvol of the bob


[08-Jul-18 10:37 AM] SHossain#0007
those values are illusional


[08-Jul-18 10:37 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@tolken If we agree that you give me 5 grapes for my two oranges, we can't complete our deal if you only have 4.8 grapes


[08-Jul-18 10:37 AM] SHossain#0007
never to trust them, but to use as a means of reference


[08-Jul-18 10:39 AM] SHossain#0007
max vol, avg vol are not 100% accurate


[08-Jul-18 10:39 AM] tolken#2655
I can trade virtually any assetchain effortlessly it seems


[08-Jul-18 10:39 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
`address_myutxopair couldn't find` is a literal thing, it may be due to SPV lag or usage or locking to a 2nd offer, or a number of things


[08-Jul-18 10:40 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
mm is telling you that it can't find the proper UTXOs to complete your side of the swap


[08-Jul-18 10:40 AM] tolken#2655
Why is it complaining about ltc utxos?


[08-Jul-18 10:41 AM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm buying ltc, not selling ltc.


[08-Jul-18 10:41 AM] tolken#2655
As Alice


[08-Jul-18 10:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@tolken is RBs52D7pVq7txo6SCz1Tuyw2WrPmdqU3qw your KMD addy?


[08-Jul-18 10:43 AM] tolken#2655
Yep


[08-Jul-18 10:44 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
what was the timeframe difference between you buying BCH and trying to buy LTC?


[08-Jul-18 10:46 AM] tolken#2655
bch, im not clear on why those are still there, must may be some pendings bob trades from yesterday, still waiting on Alice payments. Ltc/kmd Alice buy attempts as recently as an hour or so ago.


[08-Jul-18 10:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
in the GUI, you had KMD on top or bottom?


[08-Jul-18 10:49 AM] tolken#2655
I don‚Äôt use GUI anymore really.


[08-Jul-18 10:49 AM] tolken#2655
This is all for my marketmaker, I just test Alice trades from time to time to make sure it‚Äôs alive.

@SHossain is maxvol really that inaccurate? I‚Äôd assume it‚Äôs inaccurate only in that it‚Äôs potentially out of date. Why else would it be an illusion?


[08-Jul-18 10:53 AM] SHossain#0007
those data are not most up to date


[08-Jul-18 10:54 AM] SHossain#0007
anything can happen. any of the utxo can get locked any time for other swaps. check explorer with bob address for utxos


[08-Jul-18 10:54 AM] SHossain#0007
you will find the sizes


[08-Jul-18 10:56 AM] tolken#2655
Yep, I bet they‚Äôre there too. I‚Äôll check. I highly doubt that‚Äôs the issue here


[08-Jul-18 10:57 AM] tolken#2655
@SHossain any idea how to diagnose why it‚Äôs complaining about my ltc UTXOs when I‚Äôm attempting to buy ltc?


[08-Jul-18 10:58 AM] SHossain#0007
best to use separate netid


[08-Jul-18 10:58 AM] SHossain#0007
you can test in controlled environment with only your bob


[08-Jul-18 10:59 AM] SHossain#0007
are your bobs running all coins in native mode?


[08-Jul-18 10:59 AM] SHossain#0007
how many utxo your bob's has for each coin?


[08-Jul-18 10:59 AM] tolken#2655
Separate netid? Just to do an Alice buy of LTC using my KMD from someone else‚Äôs LTC/KMD bob?


[08-Jul-18 11:00 AM] SHossain#0007
what are the utxo sizes?


[08-Jul-18 11:00 AM] tolken#2655
I have about 22 UTXOs of kmd, ranging from around 1kmd , some 65, 77... maybe some larger.


[08-Jul-18 11:01 AM] tolken#2655
Only a few ltc, but they shouldn‚Äôt be a factor here, im not selling ltc. I‚Äôm not attempting to buy anything using ltc.


[08-Jul-18 11:01 AM] tolken#2655
The errors posted above is BarterDex complaining about my ltc UTXOs. Which makes very little sense to me.

[08-Jul-18 11:05 AM] SHossain#0007
have you tried testing with PIZZA/BEER pair only?


[08-Jul-18 11:05 AM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm not attempting to do private trades. Do you think that‚Äôs possibly the problem? My Alice is trying to trade with my bob? Maybe that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening


[08-Jul-18 11:06 AM] tolken#2655
but I don‚Äôt understand why BarterDex isn‚Äôt trying to match with others if that‚Äôs the case. I have a very high bid, and I have even left it on with gtc


[08-Jul-18 11:06 AM] SHossain#0007
i'm not telling you to do private trade. if you want to know what is going on and want to troubleshoot, it is better to isolate your bob and alice from the default netid.


[08-Jul-18 11:07 AM] SHossain#0007
it is always better to test with BEER/PIZZA first. you don't loose funds but gain experience


[08-Jul-18 11:07 AM] tolken#2655
But if I isolate it, who am I going to buy from? I have already successfully traded on this configuration, bobs and Alice trades.


[08-Jul-18 11:08 AM] SHossain#0007
there could be a lot of issues. utxo, network, spv (if running)...etc


[08-Jul-18 11:08 AM] tolken#2655
I have done many trades... I have btc, kmd, bch, ltc successful bob and Alice trades.


[08-Jul-18 11:08 AM] SHossain#0007
you need to setup your bob in a VPS and buy from that


[08-Jul-18 11:08 AM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm not using spv


[08-Jul-18 11:08 AM] tolken#2655
All native


[08-Jul-18 11:11 AM] tolken#2655
I can isolate, and I‚Äôd be willing to do that if it would help you guys, but I just want to be clear, I have primed the pipes and have had this stuff working more or less. I just don‚Äôt want to go to the trouble of setting up yet another configuration without first knowing what information would be useful to look out for to aid  devs. I can isolate without using VPS.


[08-Jul-18 11:15 AM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm going to try disabling my autoprice on my ltc/kmd bob, see if there‚Äôs some conflict there


[08-Jul-18 11:18 AM] tolken#2655
Nevermind, I didn‚Äôt have an ltc/kmd bob... so I‚Äôm stumped.


[08-Jul-18 11:24 AM] tolken#2655
Interesting note, I notice that even after purging the orders from gtc dB folder; subsequent Alice orders get added to there, even though they were gtc 0. Is that the right behavior?


[08-Jul-18 11:30 AM] tolken#2655
Yeah, so trades that are gtc 0 get added to ‚Äúorders‚Äù in DB, gtc 1 doesn‚Äôt get added.

Who is trading LTC for ETOMIC?


[09-Jul-18 06:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Of is this LTC <-> ERC20 with the ETOMIC in between?


[09-Jul-18 06:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm doesnt show any txid's


[09-Jul-18 06:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So I assume it's someone just playing around


[09-Jul-18 08:50 AM] Mylo#8306
likely ERC20 with the ETOMIC placeholder there on the atomic swap info side of things.
The ETOMIC is there to match UTXOs on the bitcoin-protocol side and to be used in the smart contract for the eth side of swap.
so yes, LTC <-----> ETOMIC+ERC20/ETH

i'll. @geforce209ad  just started with us recently. this is his 2nd video. if he gets good feedback, he may get more courage to make more videos üòÉ


[10-Jul-18 02:17 PM] SquidfaceKillah#3299
Going by that video, are we able to add new coins that aren‚Äôt on the drop down menu, like a coin that isn‚Äôt listed, or have to wait for Komodo team to enable trading it?


[10-Jul-18 02:17 PM] Jazzy#0001
It's not about the video, it's about @ everyone tags üòÖ


[10-Jul-18 02:18 PM] Jazzy#0001
Unfortunately the break past every level of muting


[10-Jul-18 02:19 PM] Jazzy#0001
It's down to the team's opinion on how they're going to use them, but I think it's best practice to leave @ everyone tags for things like critical security vulnerabilities and such


[10-Jul-18 02:20 PM] Jazzy#0001
Maybe server wide relevant announcements where you want maximum exposure, but never in a side channel for some sub-project


[10-Jul-18 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
I think @ here is the one to use?


[10-Jul-18 02:21 PM] Jazzy#0001
Yeah @ here tags people who are online and in the channel, although for discord I think that's still everyone online


[10-Jul-18 02:21 PM] SHossain#0007
i can use @ here from next. just wanted everyone to be aware of this new video,


[10-Jul-18 02:23 PM] SHossain#0007
still getting used to Discord. i'm not a gamer, so, never used it before


[10-Jul-18 02:25 PM] Jazzy#0001
No problem, I'm probably being over sensitive about it while everyone is adjusting to the new platform


[10-Jul-18 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
how to message just one channel?


[10-Jul-18 02:25 PM] Jazzy#0001
It doesn't help that discord haven't provided any better context channels pings either


[10-Jul-18 02:25 PM] Jazzy#0001
Unfortunately I think we're limited to 'everyone' and 'here' still, which isn't great


[10-Jul-18 02:26 PM] Jazzy#0001
But at a minimum @ here doesn't ping offline people like @ everyone does, I think it just shows up next time you sign in

@SHossain Thanks for letting  me know about it.  I may give it a go

OK - so it stopped working. 
But using the "Reset Local Coin DB" workaround, it fixes it for now?
We can work out why it stops working.  As long as there is a workaround for now.

ok - first time i'm looking at barterdex since the coinsdb feature added.
do we know if coinsdb url is queried:
 a) just the one time at start up
 b) some other times like during mgmt
 c) it is queried a lot whilst it is running
?


[10-Jul-18 08:45 PM] siu#3920
Every time you fetch new coins the db is queried


[10-Jul-18 08:47 PM] siu#3920
But suddenly it starts looping


[10-Jul-18 08:47 PM] Mylo#8306
ok, gimme 5 mins i'll poke around some more.

That sounds wrong... it should fetch once at startup and then use a local copy to build the JSON to pass to marketmaker. üòï

flooding git with data requests cannot be a good idea.

That‚Äôs cool we can move it to another service in due course.  Prob have to be user configurable because of country wide blocks to IP ranges when they pop up.  GitHub has been subject to IP blocking, AWS as well.  And you can always expect an internet provider routing error every now and then.


[10-Jul-18 11:53 PM] CHMEX#0686
Is there at possibility to start the coin daemon with instruction to stop at one specific height. like with a  -stopatheight argument. If not are there other ideas on how to stop at a height while in a fullsync?


[10-Jul-18 11:58 PM] CHMEX#0686

`-blocknotify='pathtosomescript'`


[11-Jul-18 01:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
then in that script this:
```HEIGHT=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=$chain getblockcount) #current block height
if [ $HEIGHT -eq 3 ]
  then
    komodo-cli -ac_name=$chain stop
fi```


[11-Jul-18 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
@CHMEX main.cpp mods would be needed for that


[11-Jul-18 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
-rewind options sort of does it if you are past it


[11-Jul-18 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
but things are not guaranteed to be stable


[11-Jul-18 01:16 AM] CHMEX#0686
Thank you both. I'm using mm for a snapshot now and it becoming very slow. There is non proportional increase from snapshoting height 600'000 to height 900'000 also more hardware does not really help ( I guess by design as it only uses one proc other than for mining).
I was thinking on reading the leveldb directly like duke did once. Will see which is the fastest option.


[11-Jul-18 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
mm for snapshot is not going to work past 100,000 or so


[11-Jul-18 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can extract the list of all addresses from the -addressindex=1 mode, then it would be easy to do a snapshot,but only if the daemon is on the block you want


[11-Jul-18 01:23 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes I think to get all the addresses should be possible. Is there a way once I stopp the chain and restart not to let it continue synching?


[11-Jul-18 01:23 AM] CHMEX#0686
(other than removing the network)


[11-Jul-18 01:24 AM] jl777c#5810
yes if you put in an error for any height above -stopat=<height> that is a very useful option so I will work on it.


[11-Jul-18 01:24 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can get all the addresses, I can do the rest of the snapshot, already coded, just doesnt work without all the addresses


[11-Jul-18 01:27 AM] CHMEX#0686
that would be indeed very cool.
So the addresses will be an argument in the JSON payload and based on the provided addresses it can produce a snapshot?

[11-Jul-18 01:39 AM] ./cryptkeeper#3265
Hey guys, where can I find this info in Dash code?
  P2PKH_VERBYTE = bytes.fromhex("4c")
    P2SH_VERBYTES = [bytes.fromhex("10")]
    WIF_BYTE = bytes.fromhex("cc")


[11-Jul-18 01:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Mylo yes, if a user has been using old version of BarterDEX it has the ~/.BarterDEX/coins.json file.
old version used to copy this coins.json file on every startup to make sure the user's data directory has this coins.json.
I deleted the BarterDEX application's icons images, and it's old coins.json file, and any electrum list .js file managed in that code.
from dev point of view it makes it less confusing where actually a 3rd party dev has to contribute to add a coin. That was my intended reason to delete these old files from the source code.

Since coinsdb feature added, it is set to check by conditions if the coins.json exists or not in data directory. if not, it sets up with default coins list.
if exists it just shows those coins in manage coins screen on left panel.


[11-Jul-18 01:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
left panel drop down uses git repo's image path, the http path.
the list under there uses local file system path which uses the images from the local data directory images.

@Deleted User the coinsdb is ONLY loaded on startup, or in the case if the user pushes the button to fetch the latest database update. it is working as intended. you can take a look to the coinsdb js files to clear on the logic.

continuing on the no images logic... since the source files doesn't has the images, and in case it is using the old coins.json data from previous versions it tries to check on those images, which aren't there since those aren't requested to have in coinsdb. It also helps indicate that the ones which aren't showing the icons, either doesn't have the icons on the coinsdb git repo or they aren't actually set properly in your local coins.json/barterdex localStorage data, and needs fixing.

So, to reset these old version coins.json the simplest way is to reset it. For that I provided the quick reset button to make it lil convenient.

I did not get any help in creating any of the user action flow or code logic etc with this feature so far.
Except some code clean and other things done by @ComputerGenie (which I highly appreciate).
I could only do little much of whatever I could think of and just made it happen. To my opinion, it's good to have something as solution than nothing. and hitting the 256 maximum coins limit was my deadline, we already hit it, and I had to make something. So here is this coded feature.

I encourage the other developers in this community like you and others, to fiddle with the code and please push the improvements.
Don't count on me alone always

and regarding the coinsdb issue after going through the reset coins and still showing same issue of not showing the drop down bar, my guess is that's somehow due to github URL queries.... just a guess.
check if by VPN or proxy fixes that issue.... want to know if that's the issue as explained by @Mylo like the github and aws IP bans.


[11-Jul-18 02:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have already pushed it's fix to the github when it was reported for windows that the drop down list doesn't show. it's fix is in dev branch.
if still an issue, I need the system with exact environment where this issue is to troubleshoot. I'm sure with my internet location I will most probably won't get the issue.

@CHMEX if you have a list of addresses, a daemon that is live but stopped at a specific height, in -addressindex=1 mode you can just issue addressbalance calls

@jorian as near as I can tell, unless I've missed something, that issue is related to electron itself and how it handles accelerators. I've looked at it a couple times and still haven't found any exact solution. üò¶

@siu i don't see the dropdown issue on my end. i did reset db first, then restarted. i can see the dropdown list before and after.

as i said... i got it working before

not sure what exactly broke it


[11-Jul-18 06:59 AM] siu#3920
can you try a fresh start


[11-Jul-18 06:59 AM] siu#3920
delete .BarterDEX and start it


[11-Jul-18 06:59 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[11-Jul-18 07:04 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Albeit that I don't have the time, currently, to implement such a change, but would it be better (and more user intuitive) if we added the "Manage Coins" button to the login page? imo, that would solve the restart issue (restarting mm from "default" mode rather than full app restart) and reduce some other issues.


[11-Jul-18 07:08 AM] SHossain#0007
I deleted `.BarterDEX` data dir. deleted source. cloned fresh from repo. install and ran. it is working as intended in my end.
However, i didn't restart after fetching database and wanted to add coin and i got the error of missing dropdown menu.
Once i restarted the GUI, manage coin feature working fine.

[11-Jul-18 07:09 AM] SHossain#0007
look like the issue would appear if we don't restart after fetching the coin databse


[11-Jul-18 07:10 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
also, when no menu happens, does a "reload" from "view" menu have any fixing effect (rather than restarting the entire app)?

```this was my initial thought after reading users now must restart barterdex. it is perfectly possible to do this like you said, indeed

[11-Jul-18 01:00 PM] jansako#3330
I am working on setting up a bob node on a vps (finally :-))  Would there be a problem if I were to occasionally fire up a local BarterDEX using the same seed/address to move funds/do some UTXO maintenance? As in would that affect any  swaps in progress or the ability for a swap to start etc?


[11-Jul-18 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly if you spend utxo being used for swap, that would mess up that swap


[11-Jul-18 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
but the protocol handles that


[11-Jul-18 01:04 PM] jansako#3330
right, I just meant if there are issues like what happens when you try to run 2 marketmakers on the same LAN/public IP


[11-Jul-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
as alice should be no problems


[11-Jul-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
as bob maybe will get port binding conflicts


[11-Jul-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure


[11-Jul-18 01:31 PM] jansako#3330
Only one of them would be bob, the VPS. The other may not be making any trades at all. Thanks!

I'm close to have all KMD addresses exported not the most elegant way but I looks like to do the job.
Now I want to stop the daemon at a height and start fetching the balances. For this no new blocks shall be processed. I understand the -stopat will be a future feature is there a way I can change the p2p port so that my daemon simply does not connect to a peer?


[12-Jul-18 01:20 AM] CHMEX#0686
Once I have that I can even provide with a accurate transparent supply of KMD


[12-Jul-18 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
just do a -connect=sillyaddress


[12-Jul-18 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont connect, you wont sync

[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> for AC connect=0 does not work... it always connects to 1 other peer. you need to firewall outgoing connections fo some reason, but for KMD it works fine.

@CHMEX I will add coinsupply <height> rpc call and -stopat=<height> arg today. the coinsupply will take a while to do the first time, basically a rescan and txindex=1 is required, but you can iterate in an incrementing loop to see what the delay will be. that should allow an explorer api to get coinsupply easily. it should work for all komodod coins

more than half hour?


[12-Jul-18 08:48 AM] cipi#4502
haven't waited so long, but i will, the mm is still running, lets see


[12-Jul-18 09:44 AM] cipi#4502
@jl777c it is still there


[12-Jul-18 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
I will add a timeout to that case, but tomorrow

Hi all, I have just set up my bob node in CLI, and it seems to be working fine on a KMD/SN pair.


[12-Jul-18 10:59 AM] jansako#3330
I have also set up and synced the BOTS chain, and edited the ./enable script. trouble is when I run it, it says 'couldnt find coin locally installed "coin":"BOTS"


[12-Jul-18 10:59 AM] jansako#3330
what am I missing?


[12-Jul-18 11:23 AM] cipi#4502
the BOTS coin daemon must be running


[12-Jul-18 11:28 AM] jansako#3330
it is, I have successfully imported a WIF key, just to test if it behaves


[12-Jul-18 11:29 AM] jansako#3330
how else can I verify?


[12-Jul-18 11:33 AM] cipi#4502
it must also listen to the rpc-port 11964 and have rpcuser and password set in the config file, which has to be in the default location ~/.komodo/BOTS/BOTS.conf


[12-Jul-18 11:35 AM] cipi#4502
normally you would not have to change anything in assetchains-configs to work with BarterDEX, since the daemon creates a suitable config-file on startup


[12-Jul-18 11:35 AM] jansako#3330
yep, that is what I have


[12-Jul-18 11:36 AM] cipi#4502
the default config? and `cat ~/.komodo/BOTS/BOTS.conf` shows you this file? You can check if the daemon is listening to the right port with `netstat -ntlp | grep 11964`... there should be an entry like this ```tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:11964         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      20905/komodod```


[12-Jul-18 11:37 AM] jansako#3330
rpcuser=user1913715606
rpcpassword=passf4b5911c8eff2530ebf4336149fee67103936e4f5b455bb7eac1bfc34b2a1a38ba
rpcport=11964
server=1
txindex=1
rpcworkqueue=256
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1


[12-Jul-18 11:37 AM] jansako#3330
this is my config


[12-Jul-18 11:37 AM] cipi#4502
looks good


[12-Jul-18 11:37 AM] cipi#4502
and what does `netstat -ntlp | grep 11964` say?


[12-Jul-18 11:38 AM] jansako#3330
trying now


[12-Jul-18 11:38 AM] jansako#3330
tcp6       0      0 :::11964                :::*                    LISTEN      7386/./komodod


[12-Jul-18 11:39 AM] cipi#4502
aha... that is the problem... it listens only to the ipv6, not ipv4... could be because the port 11964 was in use when you started the daemon... i would restart the daemon and try agaian


[12-Jul-18 11:40 AM] jansako#3330
tested the same for the SN port 11341 which is working


[12-Jul-18 11:40 AM] jansako#3330
got the same


[12-Jul-18 11:40 AM] jansako#3330
tcp6       0      0 :::11341                :::*                    LISTEN      24752/./komodod


[12-Jul-18 11:41 AM] cipi#4502
weird thing...


[12-Jul-18 11:42 AM] jansako#3330
yep, I did restart the daemon once already, before trying to import a WIF just to test if it responds


[12-Jul-18 11:43 AM] cipi#4502
i assume the komodo-cli command does not care, it works, but looks like mm has problems when the daemon is only listening to ipv6... on my own bob the daemons are listening to both


[12-Jul-18 11:43 AM] cipi#4502
```tcp        0      0 127.0.0.1:11964         0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      20905/komodod       
tcp6       0      0 ::1:11964               :::*                    LISTEN      20905/komodod```


[12-Jul-18 11:44 AM] jansako#3330
like I said, the SN daemon is showing the same IPv6 response, and it works with MM, responds and I have an offer issued. No swaps yet though...


[12-Jul-18 11:45 AM] jansako#3330
I can do a full reboot if you think that would help?


[12-Jul-18 11:46 AM] cipi#4502
not sure if that would help... but i still think the daemons should listen to both ipv4/ipv6... if you do the reboot, start the coin daemons first and the mm, because mm uses a lot of ports and the probability that these ports are in use is pretty high


[12-Jul-18 11:46 AM] jansako#3330
OK, coins first, then MM.


[12-Jul-18 11:46 AM] jansako#3330
Thanks!


[12-Jul-18 11:47 AM] jansako#3330
OR maybe just kill MM and BOTS, then restart them both?


[12-Jul-18 11:47 AM] cipi#4502
yes, that would also help üòÉ


[12-Jul-18 11:48 AM] jansako#3330
q: when starting MM, do I issue the ./setpassphrase from the same terminal as the ./client, or from a new one?


[12-Jul-18 11:48 AM] cipi#4502
you could also take a look at the debug.log from the daemons, especially when they are started, they say some stuff about ports and so on


[12-Jul-18 11:48 AM] jansako#3330
sounds good, thx!


[12-Jul-18 11:49 AM] cipi#4502
it does not matter from which terminal... i use a second terminal to get rid of the output from client or reroute the output to a log-file


[12-Jul-18 11:49 AM] jansako#3330
nice, thanks!


[12-Jul-18 12:26 PM] siu#3920
i got the Bdex issues sorted out


[12-Jul-18 12:26 PM] siu#3920
ran a old version i have


[12-Jul-18 12:26 PM] siu#3920
then restarted the new version and it listed the coins again


[12-Jul-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
but what was the cause of the missing button?


[12-Jul-18 12:36 PM] siu#3920
i have no idea. Seems like there might be an issue with how the coins.json file is generated


[12-Jul-18 12:36 PM] siu#3920
once you have a  good coins.json file, the systems can pull the coins


[12-Jul-18 12:37 PM] siu#3920
in my particular case it could have been that i used a fork i have to use non-etomic mm and that messed up the coins.json file


[12-Jul-18 12:39 PM] siu#3920
btw, im seeing a bunch of new coins traded


[12-Jul-18 12:39 PM] siu#3920
AST, AE, i saw another one i dont remember the name for now


[12-Jul-18 01:02 PM] cipi#4502
i test the coins that are already in BarterDEX, but that no one tested, like AST... artem and lukechilds also play around with AE, it is also already in BarterDEX


[12-Jul-18 01:03 PM] cipi#4502
btw, next is RCN, SNGLS, CDT ... all are already in the coinsdb


[12-Jul-18 08:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
I found with scaletest stuff... if you have a lot of deamons and marketmakers... its best to set a firewall like so:
```sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default deny outgoing
sudo ufw enable
start everything
sudo ufw disable```


[12-Jul-18 08:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
this lets everything bind to the ports it wants before opening outgoing/incoming connections which can and do use up the ports that the deamons want.


[12-Jul-18 08:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
*provided you use ufw


[12-Jul-18 08:34 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[12-Jul-18 08:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes... I guess you can do it with other tools, but that was the fastest and easiest way to do it

does the cancel method work for anyone? doesnt seem to work for me


[15-Jul-18 08:47 AM] DG#6934
@siu  I have also seen that issue


[15-Jul-18 08:48 AM] DG#6934
Did a fresh installation of the new version and I can‚Äôt see the coins doing the manage coins procedure


[15-Jul-18 08:49 AM] siu#3920
@DG do you have a coins.json file?


[15-Jul-18 08:52 AM] DG#6934
Yes


[15-Jul-18 08:53 AM] DG#6934
I had a previous version installed the coin icons didn‚Äôt appeared and showed spv errors then I did the manage coins procedure after erasing the Barterdex  folder completely from appdata. After that I did  fresh installation and that didn‚Äôt help.


[15-Jul-18 09:07 AM] DG#6934
still not working , have experienced this with Windows and Mac both fresh installations.

@DG any progress on your swap?

Now is finished got 488 glxt instead of 500


[15-Jul-18 11:44 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, you can't buy exact number


[15-Jul-18 11:45 AM] SHossain#0007
nice that it is finished


[15-Jul-18 11:45 AM] SHossain#0007
alternatively, you can try smaller volume for testing if you want. rather than using 500. i'm putting order for 10

Yes that‚Äôs correct


[15-Jul-18 11:50 AM] Jonathan#3687
it was in your second screenshot @SHossain


[15-Jul-18 11:50 AM] SHossain#0007

replicated bug on mac for manage coins drop down disappearing when clicked on "fetch coindb update" button.


[15-Jul-18 11:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
For a work around, if it happens, just pressing CMD/CTRL+R (View/Reload Menu) and going back to manage coins screen shows the updated drop down menu.


[15-Jul-18 11:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
So, it's the issue from in between the update process.


[15-Jul-18 11:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Will take a look a it some time soon, but would really appreciate if someone can help with this issue.


[15-Jul-18 11:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jorian the copy/paste issue is not with the text input fields.
the copy/paste issue is ONLY with the body text. You select text on the html body anywhere, and the shortcut keys for copy/cut/pate doesn't work.
that needs fix.

[15-Jul-18 11:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have already tried the shortcut accelerators you tried in your test code. Didn't work for me in my trials. Hope someone can find the core issue and could fix it.

Morning all.  How does a 'bob fell asleep' manifest itself?  I hear from people posting here that one should restart bob's periodically, is there a way to tell that it is time to do so?


[16-Jul-18 02:43 AM] jl777c#5810
if the bob goes unresponsive, maybe mem use over the days increases too much

The traditional Barterdex isn't working. I'm unable to add any coins with this new system that the gui has. We need a more reliable and intuitive way of adding coins. Currently it's difficult if not impossible to use.

you have to go in manage coins and reset all

it's the new coinsdb feature

yes that same thing... I found it confusing.

Yeah the difference between local coins db and startup coins isnt clear


[18-Jul-18 07:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
or why there is a distinction at all


[18-Jul-18 07:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I would assume local coins db is automatically are automatically startup coins, but they werent


[18-Jul-18 07:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
no, the marketmaker is "fed" a  "list" of coins on startup, but then you have to enable the ones you want to use.


[18-Jul-18 07:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
Before the entire "list" of coins was sent, but that exceeded 256 which is the limit of marketmaker.

I have that error on my Bob also, didn't seem to affect anything when I was testing yesterday, I will see if I can get it to happen again today for you.

Might explain the endless loops of wait for Bob deposit it had a few days back that forced a restart


[18-Jul-18 01:48 PM] tolken#2655
I keep getting almost all of my KMD‚Äôs reserved without any swaps lately. Restarting releases them, but unclear what‚Äôs locking them all up. Have yet to rebuild my setup, so probably just something specific to my config.


[18-Jul-18 04:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
What locks it is "swap never started"


[18-Jul-18 08:50 PM] tolken#2655
Thought some sort of timeout would autorrlease them. Ether that time out is really really long or something else is up.


[18-Jul-18 09:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
jl told me they should unlock in 5mins... but this does not seem to be the case at all. If you can reproduce it maybe he can fix it. I worked around it every time, by just having about 100x more UTXO than I need, but for real funds/ non dICO thats not really feasable.

I followed the directions on how to get my WIF from agama

might get quicker response from #ü§ù‚îÇgeneral-support @Bing


[18-Jul-18 09:48 PM] Mylo#8306
don't post WIF anywhere, that's your secret.


[18-Jul-18 11:09 PM] tolken#2655
@Deleted User it has been happening quite aggressively lately, as in all of my larger UTXOs are eaten up. 65s, 70, 100, etc. A couple times the kmd balance starts at about 615kmd, end of day it shows 12kmd.  I see no pending swaps. Reboot mm, they‚Äôre all back. I‚Äôll do what I can to isolate it, but not entirely sure what to look out for.

Firewall disabled, using canbind: 1. Have had many successful bob trades on multiple coins (btc, bch, etc) but still running into difficulty reliably getting Alice trades to go though. Probably rejected bob trades too. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs all related.

[19-Jul-18 10:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <cipig:matrix.org> i have written a perl-script to set prices in mm: https://github.com/cipig/mmtools
it uses CMC V2 API or CMC paid API
CMC paid API is great, since all prices can be fetched in one call (does not work in v2 API)
when using non-paid v2 API, prices must be fetched one by one for every coin, so take care how often you call the script...
config file like this is needed, including cmcid of coin (using coin symbols does not work reliably, since some symbols are used twice)
```
{
    "BTC": {
        "cmcid": 1,
        "bidmargin": 0.05,
        "askmargin": 0.05
    },
    "LTC": {
        "cmcid": 2,
        "bidmargin": 0.05,
        "askmargin": 0.05
    },
    "SIB": {
        "cmcid": 1082,
        "bidmargin": 0.07,

@jl777c found something that i think should be addressed either in mm directly or in the GUIs... if you withdraw Bitcoin Cash (BCH), mm accepts the old address format and creates the transaction, but the coins are sent to a wrong address... mm shows an error regarding address decoding, but creates the transaction
```added 64 of 64 from BCH listunspents

i think that if the error `bech32_decode error` is shown, the transaction should not be sent out...
if the new address format is used, everything is fine


[26-Jul-18 12:03 AM] jl777c#5810
this is just in withdraw, swaps work fine?


[26-Jul-18 12:06 AM] cipi#4502
yes, swap works fine, only in withdraw when you input old address format


[26-Jul-18 12:07 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, I will add a check to prevent old style adresses

[26-Jul-18 12:46 AM] cipi#4502
looks good... when i do withdraw with old address (1AfQJNq44qGMqbrTn2GkFNkkBNctsqKcwy), mm now shows this in console
```BCH LP_createrawtransaction 1AfQJNq44qGMqbrTn2GkFNkkBNctsqKcwy i.0 of 1 is invalid```
and returns this
```{"txid":"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000","txfee":1000,"complete":false}```


[26-Jul-18 08:42 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Agama Lite mode still uses old style bch addresses, i'm pretty sure. Is there a way to convert old addresses to new so that the withdraw could still work with old ones?

Does anyone know how the GUI fee is calculated and paid?


[28-Jul-18 09:31 AM] barv#0867
we are working on various GUI's for barterdex transactions and have to get the revenue model clear


[28-Jul-18 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
add a "gui":"guiname" to the trade commands


[28-Jul-18 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
10% of the fee from GUI. if both sides of a trade use the GUI, then it would be 20% of the fee


[28-Jul-18 10:05 AM] barv#0867
So the dex fee is 0,15%, > 10% of 0,15% is for the used GUI?


[28-Jul-18 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[28-Jul-18 10:17 AM] barv#0867
Cool. Thx @jl777c  And how do you collect these fees for a GUI?


[28-Jul-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
automatic, part of the protocol


[28-Jul-18 10:20 AM] barv#0867
To an address we provide somewhere?

[28-Jul-18 10:25 AM] barv#0867
?


[28-Jul-18 10:26 AM] jorian#4555
that's where dexfee goes


[28-Jul-18 10:27 AM] barv#0867
You put "gui":"guiname" with the tx. Then DEX splits to your GUI? Then DEX needs your address I suppose?


[28-Jul-18 10:28 AM] Meyse#0952
How does the both sides, 20% thing work, because only 1 side pays dexfees?


[28-Jul-18 10:28 AM] jorian#4555
the DEXfee is done through a hash, and that hash results in an address. that hash is fixed, james knows the specifics


[28-Jul-18 10:28 AM] jorian#4555
so for KMD it's RThtXup6Zo7LZAi8kRWgjAyi1s4u6U9Cpf and for BTC it's 1KRhTPvoxyJmVALwHFXZdeeWFbcJSbkFPu


[28-Jul-18 10:29 AM] jorian#4555
stuff is a bit blurry on the KMD side, since some assets are stored at that address. so you can't know for sure how much dexfees were collected, if you were to check atomicexplorer


[28-Jul-18 10:30 AM] jorian#4555
if you make 2 gui's, one for bob and one for alice, and both bob and alice gui you made were used in 1 trade, then you get 20%


[28-Jul-18 10:33 AM] barv#0867
And if bob uses cli you dont pay dex fee at all?


[28-Jul-18 10:33 AM] barv#0867
You being bob


[28-Jul-18 10:34 AM] Meyse#0952
bob never pays dexfee?


[28-Jul-18 10:34 AM] jorian#4555
the protocol requires that alice sends a dexfee


[28-Jul-18 10:34 AM] jorian#4555
bob never pays dexfeee


[28-Jul-18 10:34 AM] Meyse#0952
so its just about the gui i suppose


[28-Jul-18 10:35 AM] jorian#4555
yes, though i'm not sure that if you make a gui for bob, you get a piece of the pie too


[28-Jul-18 10:35 AM] barv#0867
It's what @jl777c suggested


[28-Jul-18 10:36 AM] barv#0867
But normally bob would use cli


[28-Jul-18 10:36 AM] barv#0867
However, the how is still fuzzy


[28-Jul-18 10:36 AM] Meyse#0952
yeah but wouldnt it be nice for a noob bob to have some advanced gui instead using cli


[28-Jul-18 10:36 AM] jorian#4555
until now it's the only way i think, no-one made a good bob gui yet. it for sure is the easiest way


[28-Jul-18 10:36 AM] barv#0867
I would like to undrrstand the whole process


[28-Jul-18 10:37 AM] barv#0867
Of the fee collection


[28-Jul-18 10:38 AM] Meyse#0952
if bob puts up liquidity thru the gui, its all registrered "add a "gui":"guiname" to the trade commands"


[28-Jul-18 10:38 AM] barv#0867
Thx @jorian


[28-Jul-18 10:38 AM] jorian#4555
np


[28-Jul-18 10:43 AM] barv#0867

[28-Jul-18 03:22 PM] debaas#3337
I think i figured it out already lol. If i wanted to test a ERC20 coin, i need the native wallet to be running right?


[28-Jul-18 03:22 PM] debaas#3337
it will detect the daemon and load the coin


[28-Jul-18 04:12 PM] DG#6934
Yes and to have it fully synched


[28-Jul-18 11:50 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
in BarterDEX you don't actually need ETH/ERC20 synced to local machine. I'm sure many machines today will just fill up the whole HDD with ETH blockchain.
in BarterDEX the marketmaker uses a public ETH Parity Node, which acts like a SPV node for ETH/ERC20.
but in marketmaker the API is set to use the same naitve API command, so just for that the GUI is using the native switch when activating the ETH/ERC20 coin.

In short just activate ETH/ERC20 coin in GUI with 'Native' switch/option selected and you Don't need to sync the full blockchain of ETH/ERC20 on your machine.

yes after I added etomic, the erc20 loaded instantly


[01-Aug-18 12:28 PM] cipi#4502
in CLI it is a bit faster then GUI, at least that was my impression, but i haven't measured this...


[01-Aug-18 12:32 PM] siu#3920
ok, perfect


[01-Aug-18 12:39 PM] cipi#4502
oh, the thing that should be tested is the output/display of successful swaps.... the output from marketmaker changed and i don't know how the GUI handles this... i hope it still works


[01-Aug-18 12:43 PM] siu#3920
hmm


[01-Aug-18 12:43 PM] siu#3920

[02-Aug-18 11:09 AM] cipi#4502
@CHMEX yes, i know, i participated in the beta phase. üòÉ  and i wrote a script to update mm-prices with that API:  https://github.com/cipig/mmtools (the setprices-thing)

[02-Aug-18 11:13 AM] cipi#4502
Problem is that it is still too expensive... i used it for 2 nodes and i need 2000 calls/day to update all prices every 2 minutes... that means i need the "Standard" plan, which costs 300$/month... that is a bit too much... will think about a solution... maybe we can make some kind of deal with cmc, integrate this API in mm, so that everybody can use it and pay for the "Enterprise" plan


[02-Aug-18 11:16 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes the pricing is bloombergish


[02-Aug-18 11:17 AM] cipi#4502
lol, bloombergish üòÑ nice word ...


[02-Aug-18 11:20 AM] cipi#4502
btw, i looked for some other API-providers and the others are not cheaper... cryptocompare.com has a free API though, but the data is not that good... for example, they don't filter old prices out, so you would have to do it yourself in your price-update-script, else it can happen that you set prices that are actually months old


[02-Aug-18 11:24 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes I used cryptocompare in the past nice thing is you can convert kmd to hush for ex. Directly


[02-Aug-18 11:25 AM] CHMEX#0686
Looks like big money can be made with a good pricing api


[02-Aug-18 11:35 AM] cipi#4502
yes, seems so... btw, the new cmc-API can do that too... i can convert all coins to KMD in one call, which saves calls (instead of doing it for each coin in part) and ressources


[02-Aug-18 04:51 PM] cipi#4502
@jl777c regarding the cmc-API-change: `The Public API will be taken offline on December 4th, 2018. Please migrate your application to the free tier of the Professional API.`
This means that simply switching mm to cmc v2 API will not be enough, everybody that wants to use the API will have to register, get an API key and use it to fetch the price updates.
I think this is not very practical and the problem is that the free API only offers 6k calls/month, or 200/day... this is not much, especially when you have more then one node.
The best solution would be to get a "Enterprise" key and configure it directly in mm, but someone would have to negotiate with CMC. This are the "normal" pricing for CMC API: https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/pricing
What do you think? Is this a way, or should we think about other ways?


[03-Aug-18 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a problem for mm2 to solve


[03-Aug-18 05:48 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Hi, if we pay for API key we shouldn't disclosure it to public by putting to open-source marketmaker code. I see a possible solution by developing a simple proxy which will bypass and cache CMC API responses. The API key will be available only to this proxy service.


[03-Aug-18 05:51 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Please also ping me or @artemciy_dice when MM2.0 is discussed, it's hard to monitor all groups and we can easily miss something important.

It seems to me that they don't like the idea of a proxy much.

[03-Aug-18 06:52 AM] CHMEX#0686
It might be a good idea to support several endpoints to the client can choose from which he wants to receive the data.
one can be CMC include the private client's api key
one can be cryptocompare
one can be the komodo price engine


[03-Aug-18 06:53 AM] CHMEX#0686
Personally I don't like the way cmc goes but this gives new opportunities for new players


[03-Aug-18 07:11 AM] tolken#2655
CMC seems like a convenient way to get market prices, but fortunately most exchanges are wide open to freely fetch prices. So while it isnt ideal to have to manually aggregate the data, it doesn‚Äôt seem that far fetched.


[03-Aug-18 07:13 AM] tolken#2655
Hah. Reading back I see I‚Äôm late to the convo, artem already stated this üòõ


[06-Aug-18 01:41 AM] Mylo#8306
yes, providing several api endpoints makes it easier for those api developers to then hook into marketmaker with a simple abstraction layer if necessary so the app developer can call popularExchange->getPrice(pair1,pair2) and marketmaker->getPrice(pair1,pair2) down the roadmap.

On dashboard I can see balances, but not in tradewindow


[06-Aug-18 07:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
because the webpage loads faster than electrum can supply info?


[06-Aug-18 07:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Not sure, the dashboard loads balances within 5 seconds or so


[06-Aug-18 07:43 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the call for dashboard isn't the same as the multiple calls on trade screen


[06-Aug-18 07:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Then the tradeview on the upperleft also takes a while to load kmd and eql for example

But it does not show the balance/address itself

once it's *loaded*


[06-Aug-18 07:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
wait a minute or so and the orderbook loads, so it's not connection related I would assume


[06-Aug-18 07:44 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
orderbook is all P2P and coinage calls go to the specific electrum servers

agama in lite mode worked for kmd but not for barterdex


[06-Aug-18 07:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
my guess is either the SPV itself or slimy possible that it's a change in API


[06-Aug-18 07:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
just downloaded new version and started that without restarting my system, going to restart system later and see if that fixes anything

you could just give all of your coinage to me and never have to worry about it again üôÇ

i will make a test swap and add the token to https://github.com/jl777/coins

[08-Aug-18 08:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
I've setup my own Bob with zcredits


[08-Aug-18 08:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
I can see the Bob orders from my Alice

but it shows as 0 zcredits


[08-Aug-18 08:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
checking the order book on the Bob node shows a positive amount of zcredits


[08-Aug-18 08:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
I can swap Alice<->Bob but it's not 0-conf


[08-Aug-18 08:41 AM] lukechilds#2707

@jl777c @artem.pikulin Any advice would be massively appreciated, really stuck with this


[08-Aug-18 08:42 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Hi, 0-conf is not available for ETH/ERC20. It's very easy to replace pending transaction just by setting higher gas price.


[08-Aug-18 08:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
ah ok, have you had any experience with 0-conf with BTC protocol currencies?


[08-Aug-18 08:44 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Not sure about non-eth 0conf swaps, I've not worked/tried them.


[08-Aug-18 08:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok, thanks for your help anyway


[08-Aug-18 08:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
@grewalsatinder did you test this when you added it to the BarterDEX GUI?


[08-Aug-18 09:42 AM] dan.#2473
ive done 0 conf swaps before. it worked on bdex gui


[08-Aug-18 09:43 AM] dan.#2473
well im not 100 percent certain actually. but pretty sure ive had instant swaps when there were z creds happen


[08-Aug-18 10:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
What pair did you trade on?


[08-Aug-18 10:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
If I inspect the order book responses I can't find any orders with zcredits


[08-Aug-18 10:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
I've tried on lots of popular pairs CHIPS/KMD BTC/KMD BCH/KMD etc


[08-Aug-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
likely the 0conf credits expired for all the LP nodes


[08-Aug-18 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
and it seems ERC20 it is not advisable to use it


[08-Aug-18 10:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
I've setup my own Bob


[08-Aug-18 10:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
and funded it


[08-Aug-18 10:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
and added zcredits


[08-Aug-18 10:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
I still can't do 0-conf swaps with it


[08-Aug-18 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
how much time for the zcredits?


[08-Aug-18 11:04 AM] lukechilds#2707
I made the zcredit deposit over 24 hours ago for both Alice and Bob


[08-Aug-18 11:04 AM] lukechilds#2707

[08-Aug-18 01:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
Bob has zcredits


[08-Aug-18 01:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
Alice doesn't think Bob has zcredits


[08-Aug-18 01:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
And that log was from Bob, so it sounds like you're saying Bob doesn't think Alice has zcredits either


[08-Aug-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
no, it shows that alice doesnt think bob has enough credits. it could be due to using BEER


[08-Aug-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
if a coin doesnt have a price in the orderbooks, it wont know what price to use against the credits

btw, ETH chain is broken agaian... bob payed nearly 4$ for the swap... this is totally crazy... will not implement any new erc20-tokens till the gasprice falls below 5 gwei

Does anyone have a tiny amount of SUPERNET they could send me to test 0-conf on HyperDEX?

@jl777c I've tried 0-conf with SUPERNET now too and I'm still unable to make a 0-conf swap

Both Alice and Bob have zcredits and can see their own zcredits


[09-Aug-18 09:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
Do I have to do anything on my Bob to enable 0-conf other than have zcredits?


[09-Aug-18 09:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
like manually set required confs to 0 or something?


[09-Aug-18 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
no, it should be automatic. I will need to duplicate this

That's Bob


[09-Aug-18 09:58 AM] lukechilds#2707
and on Alice calling `instantdex_claim` gives:

(not sure fi there's a proper way to just view zcredits without trying to claim)


[09-Aug-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
alice didnt print out bob's zcredits status?


[09-Aug-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
only during a swap does a node deal with another node's zcredits


[09-Aug-18 09:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
I mean to view your own zcredits


[09-Aug-18 09:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
sorry, I only updated to jl777 branch on my Bob


[09-Aug-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
just getcoin for KMD will print


[09-Aug-18 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
bob seems to be fine in all this, it is alice that isnt accepting bob


[09-Aug-18 10:00 AM] lukechilds#2707
But isn't Bob not seeing Alice's zcredits?


[09-Aug-18 10:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
when Bob says:
```
NUMCONFIRMS for SWAP alice.1 bob.0, otheristrusted.0 othertrusts.1
```


[09-Aug-18 10:01 AM] lukechilds#2707

side


[09-Aug-18 10:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
That's Bob


[09-Aug-18 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
RKdsx9P79H473wLWRg24VGRqErGNJgiBpr is alice's address?


[09-Aug-18 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
and 11 KMD is enough credits for the swap?


[09-Aug-18 10:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
yep, it was for 0.4 KMD


[09-Aug-18 10:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
and no, `RKdsx9P79H473wLWRg24VGRqErGNJgiBpr` is Bob


[09-Aug-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, so it seems alice's address didnt get approved, but it should have printed a rejection of it


[09-Aug-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems there is definitely some problem with 0conf, I will work on this tomorrow


[09-Aug-18 10:05 AM] lukechilds#2707

[09-Aug-18 10:05 AM] lukechilds#2707
and btw


[09-Aug-18 10:05 AM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think it's just Bob


[09-Aug-18 10:05 AM] lukechilds#2707
both Alice and Bob have zcredits and can see their own zcredits


[09-Aug-18 10:05 AM] lukechilds#2707
Neither Bob nor Alice can see each others zcredits


[09-Aug-18 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it seems the problem is communicating the zcredits from the other side


[09-Aug-18 10:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
yep


[09-Aug-18 10:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok thanks


[09-Aug-18 10:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
let me know if there's anything else I can do to help


[10-Aug-18 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
I setup a REVS/KMD 0conf swap and it worked fine, both sides showed:
NUMCONFIRMS for SWAP alice.0 bob.0, otheristrusted.1 othertrusts.1


[10-Aug-18 01:10 AM] jl777c#5810
one difference is I used SPV for KMD and not REVS. I will test both using SPV next


[10-Aug-18 01:16 AM] jl777c#5810
the side with autoprice set prints: 
KMD RHV2As4rox97BuE3LK96vMeNY8VsGRTmBj othercredits 10.00000000 debits 0.05010000 + 0.00000000 -> 9.94990000


[10-Aug-18 01:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it worked with both being SPV also


[10-Aug-18 01:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i made a 10 week deposit for 10 KMD on both nodes


[10-Aug-18 01:42 AM] jl777c#5810
I did make an improvement to SPV mode which should reduce false positive errors. one thing that could be happening is that it cant find the deposit txid on the other node


[10-Aug-18 01:43 AM] jl777c#5810
now up to 5 swaps using SPV for both coins on both nodes and all were 0 conf, so the issue isnt 0conf but more likely SPV returning some error looking up the 0conf deposit txid


[10-Aug-18 03:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
hmmn ok, for what it's worth I was using a full node on my Bob and SPV on my Alice


[10-Aug-18 03:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
is your Bob still up with zcredits?


[10-Aug-18 03:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
maybe I can test against that with my Alice and see if I can swap against it


[10-Aug-18 03:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes my bob is still running with REVS, but needs to be small order

[10-Aug-18 07:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
or it has to be over 10 KMD?


[10-Aug-18 07:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
running a little low on test KMD, would be good to just lock up 1 KMD for small test trades


[10-Aug-18 07:12 AM] CHMEX#0686
I sent you a refill to RQm8BNygniNVqVPRYXEosznRZ7uEiooqSm


[10-Aug-18 07:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
@CHMEX awesome, thanks


[10-Aug-18 07:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c just noticed in that output above, ti has our trade in zdebits


[10-Aug-18 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
the zcredit/debits uses a conservative estimate, ie. it might assume you used up zcredits when you didnt as it is safer to do that than the other way around


[10-Aug-18 07:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
ah ok


[10-Aug-18 07:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
re


[10-Aug-18 07:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
>ok bob is ready


[10-Aug-18 07:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
what do you want me to do


[10-Aug-18 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
try the buy again


[10-Aug-18 07:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
make a 10 week deposit and tr y again?


[10-Aug-18 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[10-Aug-18 07:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok üëç


[10-Aug-18 07:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
from the docs


[10-Aug-18 07:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
>It can take few minutes (about 10 confirmations) for the LP nodes to recognise you.


[10-Aug-18 07:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
want me to wait 10 blocks after deposit before trading?


[10-Aug-18 07:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
Is there a fee for making a 0conf deposit


[10-Aug-18 07:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
Just noticed there are 3 outputs


[10-Aug-18 07:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
one to timelocked address, one change and one small one to an address I don't recognise


[10-Aug-18 07:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
is that a fee?


[10-Aug-18 07:18 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes its a fee for BOTS should be 0.1%


[10-Aug-18 07:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
ah


[10-Aug-18 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it also tags the address so we can find all 0conf deposits


[10-Aug-18 07:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
Is it possible to decode when its redeemable from the trx?


[10-Aug-18 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[10-Aug-18 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
proof array is null


[10-Aug-18 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
apparently alice /Users/mac/SuperNET/iguana/exchanges/LP_instantdex.c:36:cJSON *LP_instantdex_txids(int32_t appendonly,char *coinaddr) is returning null array. you can do and instantdex claim so see what txids it is getting


[10-Aug-18 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
I see a 0conf now!


[10-Aug-18 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
NUMCONFIRMS for SWAP alice.0 bob.0, otheristrusted.1 othertrusts.1


[10-Aug-18 08:00 AM] lukechilds#2707
Yep looks like that one worked üéâ


[10-Aug-18 08:00 AM] lukechilds#2707
I got bobpayment before alicepayment was confirmed


[10-Aug-18 08:00 AM] lukechilds#2707
but alice spend still took quite a while


[10-Aug-18 08:00 AM] lukechilds#2707
is that expected?


[10-Aug-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
alice is polling it not very quickly. I guess I can speed up the poll time for 0conf


[10-Aug-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
fixing


[10-Aug-18 08:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
that would be great


[10-Aug-18 08:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
although we need Artems etomic builds for HyperDEX as we have ETH/ERC20 support


[10-Aug-18 08:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
and I think he's away atm


[10-Aug-18 08:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
so won't be able to merge your changes in too quickly


[10-Aug-18 08:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
so no rush for that


[10-Aug-18 08:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
so do you know what the issue is with 2 week deposits not being recognised but 10 week deposits are?


[10-Aug-18 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
proof":["73be50a0364b8f2d14bdcf6b57b7b858c0e899307c0c8e520878fbbe16512fa2", "a9be0b76d833b9684eb6a05daa4c2deaac7d9bb7faa7cd7e523c49d672cf3bc7"]


[10-Aug-18 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
I got both your depostis, so it seems the file tracking the deposit txids wasnt right for some reason


[10-Aug-18 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed a fix that removes a 13 second pause for 0conf swaps!


[10-Aug-18 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
also I am able to trigger artem's build


[10-Aug-18 08:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
oh, great


[10-Aug-18 08:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
does that auto merge changes?


[10-Aug-18 08:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think it does actually


[10-Aug-18 08:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
hmmn, I can try again on a new address, it would be great if we can track down the issue with the deposit file


[10-Aug-18 08:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
we can't really ship it in HyperDEX until that's resolved, users won't be happy if they're locking up funds that don't give them zcredits


[10-Aug-18 08:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
I will try on a new address


[10-Aug-18 08:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
is it safe to make a deposit < 10 KMD?


[10-Aug-18 08:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
I know I won't get interest on them


[10-Aug-18 08:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I don't want to go locking up a load of 10 KMD deposits if I end up testing a lot of them


[10-Aug-18 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it will reject less than 10


[10-Aug-18 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i triggered an autobuild of artem's repo


[10-Aug-18 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
also there are CONNECT.() and CONNECTED.() prints on alice and bob consoles


[10-Aug-18 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
inside is the proof:[] array which should just be the txids of the 0conf deposit(s)


[10-Aug-18 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
this way you can see that the other node is getting the proper info. the claim api call uses the same internal function as the proof:[] array so you should be able to use that to make sure the system knows about the 0conf txids


[10-Aug-18 08:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah that's what I've been doing


[10-Aug-18 08:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
`instantdex_claim`


[10-Aug-18 08:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
to check my own deposits


[10-Aug-18 08:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
will try another 2 week deposit on another address


[10-Aug-18 08:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
and if that doesn't get recognised try a 10 week and see if that clears it up


[10-Aug-18 08:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
is mm expected to work ok using multiple seed phrases btw?


[10-Aug-18 08:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
like if I log in with a new seed, is it going to se my old deposits in the file it uses to track the TXIDs and freak out?


[10-Aug-18 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it shouldnt see the other address, each passphrase should create its own environment


[10-Aug-18 08:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok, great


[10-Aug-18 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
artem's build is done


[10-Aug-18 08:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
perfect, testing now


[10-Aug-18 08:54 AM] cipi#4502
the last 2 builds don't contain a linux binary, only OSX and a strange OS called win :-D
intention or something broken?


[10-Aug-18 09:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
I just noticed that too


[10-Aug-18 09:15 AM] cipi#4502
https://travis-ci.org/artemii235/SuperNET
shows some strange stuff
`fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/artemii235/cpp-ethereum.git/': gnutls_handshake() failed: A TLS packet with unexpected length was received.`
wondering why it works for the OSX build... would expect that this part is the same for all OSes


[10-Aug-18 09:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c Tried again with a 2 week deposit on a new address and it failed


[10-Aug-18 09:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
so seems like the issue is reproducable


[10-Aug-18 09:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
(by failed I mean Bob can't see my zcredits)


[10-Aug-18 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, if 10 weeks works, lets set a min time of 10 weeks for now


[10-Aug-18 09:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's quite a long time


[10-Aug-18 09:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm not sure many people will be open to tie funds up for that long


[10-Aug-18 09:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
I will try another 2 week deposit


[10-Aug-18 09:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
see if just making a second deposit is what resolves the issue


[10-Aug-18 09:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
then I will try 4 weeks


[10-Aug-18 09:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
That a nice amoutn, roughly a month and I think most people would go for that


[10-Aug-18 09:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
btw, any chance you can use your key to return some of the deposits to me?


[10-Aug-18 09:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
otherwise I'm gonna have to lock up a lot of funds across a lot of addresses to test this


[10-Aug-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it isnt an easy automated process. I can just send you KMD for testing


[10-Aug-18 10:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok, thanks


[10-Aug-18 10:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
are you able to send some to `RKTCwkMM6Jf92YkXWkoQ3xG5eKThLSVXHN`


[10-Aug-18 10:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
I just did another 2 week deposit and that didn't work either


[10-Aug-18 10:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
so it definitely appears to be the length of the deposit that gets all of your zcredits recognised


[10-Aug-18 10:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
not the act of making a second deposit


[10-Aug-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
hopefuly bc89e424265a4d9455748bfa9b967b9dec64125463214b0d8ff5f6c4fd7daacf is enough, if not, let me know


[10-Aug-18 10:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
cheers


[10-Aug-18 10:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
hehe, got muddled up with the outputs and thought you sent 26356 for a sec!


[14-Aug-18 11:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
is there anywhere I can read about the gtc changes


[14-Aug-18 11:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think I just need to add `{gtc: 1}` to the JSON


[14-Aug-18 11:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
but is there anywhere I can read on how it affects the behaviour


[14-Aug-18 11:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think it appends the ID in `ccccc` or something right?


[14-Aug-18 11:34 AM] lukechilds#2707
didn't see it mentioned here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/BarterDEX-API-Summary-by-Category

yes, gtc:1 to JSON and then it will loop on the request every 5 minutes until cancelled


[14-Aug-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
there is also a fill flag that can make it accept partial fills or only complete fills


[14-Aug-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
a gtc order will stop even with a partial fill


[14-Aug-18 11:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
I see


[14-Aug-18 11:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
would be cool if there was an option to try and fill the remainding amount after a partial fill


[14-Aug-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it sets the first chars of the uuid with gtc, or something like that


[14-Aug-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
I leave that to the GUI


[14-Aug-18 11:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok


[14-Aug-18 11:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
and when it re-issues the order every 5 mins


[14-Aug-18 11:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
will it have a new UUID


[14-Aug-18 11:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
or re-use the same UUID?


[14-Aug-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[14-Aug-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the same trade as far as mm is conceerened


[14-Aug-18 11:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
perfect


[14-Aug-18 11:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
yep, that makes it a lot easier on our end too


[14-Aug-18 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
now this hasnt been thoroughly validated as far as uuid permanence, so might be bugs


[14-Aug-18 11:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
what do you mean by UUID permanence


[14-Aug-18 11:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
oh, that it reuses the UUID


[14-Aug-18 11:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
gotcha


[14-Aug-18 11:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok


[14-Aug-18 11:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
will test


[14-Aug-18 11:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
thanks üëç


[14-Aug-18 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, and gtc is for that session


[14-Aug-18 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
a restart and it is all gone


[14-Aug-18 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
unless DB/SWAP files were created from a swap


[14-Aug-18 12:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
ok, we will be saving them in our DB, so they will still be there in the UI


[14-Aug-18 12:01 PM] lukechilds#2707
and the user would probably be expecting them to resume next time they open the UI


[14-Aug-18 12:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
I guess we can re issue the gtc order


[14-Aug-18 12:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
can we pass in an id


[14-Aug-18 12:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
like we could with normal orders


[14-Aug-18 12:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
so we pass in the gtc id from the last session


[14-Aug-18 12:02 PM] lukechilds#2707
so if it matches all the socket messages will match the id we have internally


[14-Aug-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
yes if you pass in a uuid, it will use that


[14-Aug-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
this is for all orders


[14-Aug-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i think


[15-Aug-18 09:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
where should I report generic mm bugs?


[15-Aug-18 09:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c on your repo or artems?


[15-Aug-18 09:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
if they are related to general behaviour


[15-Aug-18 09:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
e.g withdrawing currency, not etomic specific


[15-Aug-18 10:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
James I made a gtc order on my Alice


[15-Aug-18 10:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
looked to all be working


[15-Aug-18 10:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
I could see it re-issueing every 5 mins


[15-Aug-18 10:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
however when I offer up a matching order on my Bob it doesn't seem to match


[15-Aug-18 10:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
it does do something


[15-Aug-18 10:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
but the trade doesn't seem to start

[15-Aug-18 10:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
it basically just repeats that last block (from `request  MYTH/KMD` to  `reserved  MYTH/KMD`) every 5 minutes


[15-Aug-18 10:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
after each order is issued from Alice


[15-Aug-18 10:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
(those logs are from Bob)


[15-Aug-18 10:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
but the trade never seems to actually execute


[15-Aug-18 10:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
Does `reserved  MYTH/KMD` mean Bob has reserved the order for himself?


[15-Aug-18 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it got the reserved, but maybe the price was fractionally not enough?


[15-Aug-18 11:34 AM] lukechilds#2707
Bob wants 0.1


[15-Aug-18 11:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
I set Alice's price to 0.15


[15-Aug-18 11:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think it normally gives a message in the logs if the prices don't match


[15-Aug-18 11:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
wait a sec


[15-Aug-18 11:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
just got back from dinner and it appears to have gone through


[15-Aug-18 11:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
odd


[15-Aug-18 11:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
it took about 4-5 of those request/reserved blocks before it matched


[15-Aug-18 11:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
normally when I'm not using gtc it matches instantly


[15-Aug-18 11:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
this seems to take 4-5 of the re-orders before it matched


[15-Aug-18 11:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
even though it saw all of them and got to reserved state


[15-Aug-18 11:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
also, it appears there is a bug with the IDs


[15-Aug-18 11:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
The `marketmaker` response when alice placed the order said the UUID is: `6194b5e826a4ba650d4c6f37d343763a7e8943db0239d0a085d1436f5d702fa7 `


[15-Aug-18 11:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
However from Bobs end the logs show the UUID as `6194b5e826a4ba650d4c6f37d343763a7e8943db0239d0a085d1436f5dcccccc`


[15-Aug-18 11:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
we didn't get any events in the UI


[15-Aug-18 11:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
presumably because it was listening for the UUID it was given from mm but the socket messages contained the one ending in `cccccc`


[15-Aug-18 11:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
what's the reason for replacing the last 6 characters with `c`?


[15-Aug-18 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess the uuid is changed to have the  cccccc after it is sent as an event


[15-Aug-18 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a signal that it is a gtc order


[15-Aug-18 11:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
would it be possible to either use the normal ID all the time, or if there is a reason it needs to end in `cccccc` make sure it's returned like that in the original order request?


[15-Aug-18 11:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
could gtc orders not be signalled with an extra property or something


[15-Aug-18 11:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
like gtc:1 in the order


[15-Aug-18 11:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
it doesn't seem like a good idea to hack meaningful info into something that's supposed to be a unique identifier


[15-Aug-18 11:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
also, why do gtc orders need to be signalled


[15-Aug-18 11:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
will they ever be treated differently to a normal order?


[15-Aug-18 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, bob treats them differently, but I can remove the cccccc


[15-Aug-18 11:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
thanks, that would be great üëå


[15-Aug-18 11:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
also, any ideas on why it took so long to match?


[15-Aug-18 11:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
it had to be re-broadcast about 5 times before the bob decided to swap


[15-Aug-18 11:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
but the Bob noticed it each time before, just didn't swap


[15-Aug-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
updated my repo, will trigger build in artem's when it propagates


[15-Aug-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
no idea why 5 times


[15-Aug-18 11:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
awesome thanks


[15-Aug-18 11:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok, maybe just a one off


[15-Aug-18 11:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
it's late here


[15-Aug-18 11:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
will test again with the new build tomorrow and let you know if I still experience matching issues


[15-Aug-18 11:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
thanks for your help üëç


[16-Aug-18 09:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c IDs seem to be working now, thanks!


[16-Aug-18 09:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
owever I only updated Alice


[16-Aug-18 09:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
not Bob


[16-Aug-18 09:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
I was assuming this would be a Bob side change


[16-Aug-18 09:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
as it looked like bob was sending the suffixed IDs


[16-Aug-18 09:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
is it expected that only an update to alice's mm is needed?


[16-Aug-18 09:59 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jl777c  I just got error -9999 (unmatched) on a gtc order


[16-Aug-18 10:00 AM] lukechilds#2707
is that a bug


[16-Aug-18 10:00 AM] lukechilds#2707
shouldn't it remain open until it gets matched


[16-Aug-18 10:00 AM] lukechilds#2707
and not time out


[16-Aug-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
well it times out, but comes back from the dead


[16-Aug-18 10:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think it does


[16-Aug-18 10:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
looks like it's a regression in the latest release


[16-Aug-18 10:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
doesn't seem to ever re issue the order


[16-Aug-18 10:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
almost like the gtc flag is being ignored


[16-Aug-18 10:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
just reverted to the old build and it worked as expected


[16-Aug-18 10:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
let me try on the new build again and double check


[16-Aug-18 10:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
also


[16-Aug-18 10:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
>is it expected that only an update to alice's mm is needed?

[16-Aug-18 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the cccccc was needed?


[16-Aug-18 10:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
how are you differentiating between normal orders and gtc orders internally?


[16-Aug-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
i have a gtc flag now, so if the JSON has gtc:1 it should work as gtc


[16-Aug-18 10:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
so do alice and bob both need to be updated to understand the gtc flag?


[16-Aug-18 10:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
or will it work with only alice being updated?


[16-Aug-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
you should update both


[16-Aug-18 10:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok


[16-Aug-18 10:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
doesn't that mean it's a network breaking change?


[16-Aug-18 10:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
only updated bobs will interpret them as gtc orders


[16-Aug-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
the gtc flag has been there for a while


[16-Aug-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
the SWAP JSON that prints should have it


[16-Aug-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
does it?


[16-Aug-18 10:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
I don't see any SWAP JSON because the swap times out before it matches


[16-Aug-18 10:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
I will try updating my Bob and see if that resolves it


[16-Aug-18 10:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
bit it seems like a clientside (Alice) issue to me


[16-Aug-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
i checked for the cccccc and there was only one place using it, so it seemed safe to remove


[16-Aug-18 10:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
there could be no bobs online, it should still keep re-broacasting


[16-Aug-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[16-Aug-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it should be very persistent


[16-Aug-18 10:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
so it seems strange that the version of mm bob is running would cause alice to kill early


[16-Aug-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
good point, you should be able to see it do things without any bobs


[16-Aug-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so it doesnt do more than one call?


[16-Aug-18 10:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, I can on the previous build


[16-Aug-18 10:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
not on the latest


[16-Aug-18 10:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
does one call


[16-Aug-18 10:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
then get the  -9999 (unmatched) error


[16-Aug-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
i am idiot


[16-Aug-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i disabled the code that queues a gtc order, when i got rid of the cccccc


[16-Aug-18 10:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
that sounds important


[16-Aug-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix to jl777, propagating to the usual places


[16-Aug-18 10:53 AM] lukechilds#2707

[16-Aug-18 10:53 AM] lukechilds#2707

if you can do whatever it is you need to do to kickstart Artems build I'll test that when I'm back

[17-Aug-18 01:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
gtc orders fail with -9999 (unmatched) if the don't get matched in the first request


[17-Aug-18 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
but it should issue again in 5 minutes


[17-Aug-18 01:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
ahhh


[17-Aug-18 01:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok


[17-Aug-18 01:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
let me wait a few more mins to check


[17-Aug-18 01:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
is there any way we can change that so it doesn't respond with the error?


[17-Aug-18 01:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think it's a unintuitive to respond with an unmatched error for an order id


[17-Aug-18 01:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
if the same id will then be matched later on


[17-Aug-18 01:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
there's no way to differentiate in the UI between an order that will never match and an order that won't match for the next five minutes


[17-Aug-18 01:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
currently it will appear in our UI as pending, then failed/unmatched, and then at some point in the future magically match and start swapping


[17-Aug-18 01:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
which is not at all intuitive to users, they may well think it's failed and re-issue the order


[17-Aug-18 01:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think it would make more sense to suppress the unmatched event for gtc ordrs


[17-Aug-18 01:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
so they just see it as pending until it matches


[17-Aug-18 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will try to suppress it for gtc:1 orders


[17-Aug-18 01:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
awesome, thanks


[17-Aug-18 01:24 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix, will propagate it to artem's branch in about an hour


[17-Aug-18 01:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
hmmn


[17-Aug-18 01:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
getting the same matching issues as yesterday


[17-Aug-18 01:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
the bob sees all the alice requests


[17-Aug-18 01:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
and does something


[17-Aug-18 01:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
but doesn't fully match


[17-Aug-18 01:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think if I leave it long enough it will eventually match one


[17-Aug-18 01:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
but if I do a normal order it matches instantly


[17-Aug-18 01:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
it seems specific to gtc orders


[17-Aug-18 01:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
I can see all the request messages on Bob


[17-Aug-18 01:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
every 5 mins


[17-Aug-18 01:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
then sometimes it progresses to reserved and connect


[17-Aug-18 01:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
and last time I left it over dinner and when I came back it had connected and swapped


[17-Aug-18 01:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
but something definitely seems not quite right


[17-Aug-18 01:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
are gtc orders any different to normal orders from Bobs perspective?


[17-Aug-18 01:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
or is it just an abstraction on the Alice end?


[17-Aug-18 02:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it just queues up a retry until done process


[17-Aug-18 02:00 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a 10 minute cycle will be better? could be bob still has utxo reserved for a prior swap


[17-Aug-18 02:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
no it's not that


[17-Aug-18 02:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm testing in an isolated environment


[17-Aug-18 02:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
my Bob


[17-Aug-18 02:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
no other traders


[17-Aug-18 02:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
you can seel all the messages I've got here


[17-Aug-18 02:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
(from alices end)


[17-Aug-18 02:01 AM] lukechilds#2707

[17-Aug-18 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it is getting to connect?


[17-Aug-18 02:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
no


[17-Aug-18 02:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
sometimes it gets to reserved


[17-Aug-18 02:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
but then restarts


[17-Aug-18 02:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think if I leave it long enough it will eventually get to connnected


[17-Aug-18 02:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's what happened the other day


[17-Aug-18 02:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
these are the logs from Bob's end:


[17-Aug-18 02:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i pushed an experimental 10 minute between gtc, it might increase the chance a lot


[17-Aug-18 02:03 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can try that one and let me know if it works better, I can propagate it

or maybe it's just the 5 min timer cancelling from alice's end before bob gets round to connecting


[17-Aug-18 02:04 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems pretty clear what is wrong:
alice not eligible 1.01415185 -> dest 0.10510000 0.10363340 (0.21976058 0.00096454) cd467afd9d7eb999bef00ebc019195566ca45a3ed3c3bfa3aee62777badf8ba2/v1 ca2952004522324bef4cdb83f2e2e3d1eb47d968c91b196ba275fd02e5bb1406/v1
quote MYTH/KMD validate error -3


[17-Aug-18 02:05 AM] lukechilds#2707
what does that mean?


[17-Aug-18 02:05 AM] jl777c#5810
bob thinks either: cd467afd9d7eb999bef00ebc019195566ca45a3ed3c3bfa3aee62777badf8ba2/v1 ca2952004522324bef4cdb83f2e2e3d1eb47d968c91b196ba275fd02e5bb1406/v1
is already spent


[17-Aug-18 02:05 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is, then it is an alice problem. if not, then a bob problem


[17-Aug-18 02:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
they definitely exist from alices side

what's the komod block explorer api slug?


[17-Aug-18 02:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
it's not the normal `/api` one is it?


[17-Aug-18 02:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think it's custom

thanks @CHMEX , a little too slow üòâ


[17-Aug-18 02:15 AM] CHMEX#0686
Hehe


[17-Aug-18 02:15 AM] jl777c#5810
then it could be the reservation time, the 10 minutes should help


[17-Aug-18 02:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok, will test with that as soon as artems build is published


[17-Aug-18 02:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
what do you mean by reservation time btw?


[17-Aug-18 02:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
like that UTXO is broadcast to the network as being in use for that trade?


[17-Aug-18 02:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
so when the next gtc order fires if it uses the same UTXO it might still be signalled as being in use so nodes won't trust it?


[17-Aug-18 02:23 AM] jl777c#5810
correct


[17-Aug-18 02:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i only put the 10 minute delay in jl777, do you want me to propagate it to artems?


[17-Aug-18 02:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
yes please


[17-Aug-18 02:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
but before you do that


[17-Aug-18 02:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
just an idea


[17-Aug-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
could you not tie the reservation time UTXO to the order id?


[17-Aug-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
so that UTXO is only reserved to that id


[17-Aug-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
so if a bob sees a gtc order


[17-Aug-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
which shares the same id


[17-Aug-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
it will still be able to use the UTXO


[17-Aug-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
or is that not how it works?


[17-Aug-18 02:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
does it select a new UTXO for each gtc re-order?


[17-Aug-18 02:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
lock the UTXO and re-use it for each gtc re-order?


[17-Aug-18 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
that will require entirely new logic.. of course it is a good idea, but I am somewhat distant from that codebase now and likely I will make it worse without diving back into it fully


[17-Aug-18 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
build is triggered in artem's repo


[17-Aug-18 02:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok no worries


[17-Aug-18 02:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
if the 10 min repeat fixes it then that should be fine for now


[17-Aug-18 02:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
can talk about other options with mmv2 team


[17-Aug-18 02:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
how long is the reservation time btw?


[17-Aug-18 02:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it depends on SPV or no SPV, but could be as long as 5 minutes


[17-Aug-18 02:56 AM] jl777c#5810
new build is there


[17-Aug-18 02:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
awesome thanks


[17-Aug-18 06:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
still doesn't seem to be working


[17-Aug-18 06:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
left it for almost an hour


[17-Aug-18 06:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
been watching the logs


[17-Aug-18 06:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
the Bob sees every re-order


[17-Aug-18 06:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
and does some stuff


[17-Aug-18 06:32 AM] lukechilds#2707
but never connects

what is MYTH?


[17-Aug-18 06:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
A test currency I'm using


[17-Aug-18 06:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
to make sure no one else uses it


[17-Aug-18 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is not ERC20


[17-Aug-18 06:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
it is ERC20


[17-Aug-18 06:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
we don't get any more `alice not eligible` since you made the latest change


[17-Aug-18 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe try a non-ERC20 for this first?


[17-Aug-18 06:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
And yes, Alice gets all the reserved messages


[17-Aug-18 06:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok, will try non ERC20


[17-Aug-18 06:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
from alice end in HyperDEX console:

```
swap._debug.messages.map(m => m.method)
(16) ["request", "request", "request", "request", "request", "request", "request", "reserved", "request", "request", "reserved", "request", "request", "request", "request", "reserved"]
```


[17-Aug-18 06:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
those are all the websocket messages


[17-Aug-18 06:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think the issue is related to ERC20 btw


[17-Aug-18 06:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
the swap works if it gets matched on the first request


[17-Aug-18 06:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
If a place a gtc order that I know won't be matched instantly


[17-Aug-18 06:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
THEN create a matchable offer on my Bob


[17-Aug-18 06:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
it will never match the future re-orders


[17-Aug-18 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
I will need to set this up tomorrow and see if I can duplicate this


[17-Aug-18 06:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok


[17-Aug-18 06:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
just set up a bob without any orders


[17-Aug-18 06:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
place an order on an alice in an empty order book


[17-Aug-18 06:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
so you can see the order on your bob


[17-Aug-18 06:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
THEN set the corresponding order on your Bob


[17-Aug-18 06:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
alice will see it


[17-Aug-18 06:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
bob will send reserve messages each time he sees a request


[17-Aug-18 06:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
but it doesn't seem to match


[17-Aug-18 06:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
although the other day I left it running for a very long time and seemed to eventually match


[17-Aug-18 06:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
but it is definitely not working properly


[17-Aug-18 06:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
because if the Bob order exists before you place the alice order they match almost instantly


[17-Aug-18 06:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
infact I will put this in a GH issue so it doesn't get lost

"*post your address in #dev-tradebots for free BEER*" (bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1605144.msg29117192#msg29117192).

I need free BEER to test the MM2 (in the context of issue 116, I want the test to touch the autopricing code, hopefully it does that for BEER / PIZZA).

i think that was something with the txfees... BCH uses a fixed fee `0.00001000 BCH`... but in this case it simply took so long for a new block

[05-Sep-18 08:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
@jl777c I asked this question in the dev channel and was referred to you:

Is anyone here familiar with Schnorr signatures? I have an atomic swap that uses adaptor signatures (involving key and signature aggregation) in lieu of traditional bitcoin-style scripts and I would like to integrate the new technique into the codebase. Would like to chat with the relevant dev if possible


[05-Sep-18 08:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
I'm afraid I don't know a terrible amount about KMD yet, but if you guys support Schnorr, I'd like to help implement a scriptless swap with you. If not, I'd be interested in at least adding scriptless swaps between Schnorr coins on barterdex


[05-Sep-18 09:51 PM] jl777c#5810
the bitcoin protocol atomic swap is pretty hard coded to use bitcoin script


[05-Sep-18 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
however it should be possible to create CC contract that implements schnorr signing

question, how important are relay nodes to the sucess of an atomic swap

they are only needed during ordermatch


[11-Sep-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
once the order is matched, then alice is connecting to the bob node directly

and after 60 seconds, there is empty in pending field and no swap is processing. Does anyone have an idea of what it happened and how to fix? Thanks

Does BOTS (and other asset chains) have their own websites, or more information about how to get involved and how to use them (like how to subscribe to a bot that someone else made)? I see this: https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/162234474/BOTS but it only has limited information.

@jl777c For ACs can we change the `coin` param in coins.json or will it break stuff?


[19-Sep-18 10:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
I ask because we use the `coin` value to look up the fiat price and EQL have changed their ticker to EQLI


[19-Sep-18 10:02 AM] lukechilds#2707
so I'm wondering if we can change:

        asset: 'EQL',
        rpcport: 10306,
```
to
```
        coin: 'EQLI',
        name: 'Equaliser',

        rpcport: 10306,
```

Wow, wtf? The PAX stablecoin gives **admin write access** to law enforcement. Basically, the government can FREEZE and BURN anyone's coins!

could be issue at the end user side. unless, someone can reproduce this (if this is a bug). ETH/ERC20 side is still under development.


[22-Sep-18 11:31 AM] cipi#4502
could be the ETH balance is 0 ... is so, no ERC20 withdraws are possible because ERC20-transactions are paid with ETH


[22-Sep-18 11:31 AM] Andersen#8337
send   bnb       https://etherscan.io/address/0x012f7e74120d3d002e8f215ccc6f6f65618f00cb

yes my  ETH zero ,  but heard about ETH same troubles


[22-Sep-18 11:32 AM] cipi#4502
you need ETH to pay the txfees


[22-Sep-18 11:33 AM] cipi#4502
and if you want to withdraw ETH, you can't withdraw all, because of the same txfees


[22-Sep-18 11:33 AM] Andersen#8337
in other words  if ETH  empty   ERC20 cant move ?

`After that trade fails, listunspent only shows the one 0.20789742 utxo, until I restart bdex. ` yes, it does, because it locks the utxos and releases them after a while or when you restart marketmaker


[25-Sep-18 05:11 AM] cipi#4502
and the swap fails to start, simply because it does not find the right utxos, it only has one `added 1 of 1 from LTC listunspents`

I disconnected from wifi to get that error message to confirm the changes I made shows the coin name now as well or not


[01-Oct-18 06:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[01-Oct-18 06:17 AM] siu#3920
Yes. Would be nice to have it off by default since it seems like the latest mm has some dificulty with it


[01-Oct-18 06:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c any suggestion?


[01-Oct-18 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if testing shows problems, leaving it defaulted on will create extra support issues


[01-Oct-18 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if you want less support issues, change the default


[01-Oct-18 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no need to ask about such things


[01-Oct-18 06:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay üëç


[01-Oct-18 06:18 AM] cipi#4502
the "problem" with GTC is that people are issuing swap requests without first looking in orderbook and so they try to buy amounts that are simply not available on the bobs... saw such requests spamming the network for hours up to days


[01-Oct-18 06:20 AM] siu#3920
but if that is the problem, it should be the same when not having them on


[01-Oct-18 06:21 AM] siu#3920
since you are aiming for a UTXO that is not available


[01-Oct-18 06:22 AM] siu#3920
but in my tests, once i turn them off using exactly the same price and amounts, it works.


[01-Oct-18 06:24 AM] siu#3920
Lets try to have them off in this release, if we get more support issues or problems we change it back.

@SHossain please let the qa team so that we can be sure its working for osx

@siu did you include the `build/` folder in the build too somehow ? üòÑ

hmm.. no, not really


[01-Oct-18 07:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have done that kinda things in early days


[01-Oct-18 07:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
let me try building on mine


[01-Oct-18 07:16 AM] siu#3920
i dont see anything out of order in the osx file


[01-Oct-18 07:16 AM] siu#3920
just the BarterDEX.app directory like all releases


[01-Oct-18 07:17 AM] SHossain#0007
checking on macOS


[01-Oct-18 07:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@siu I tested. Mine ends up as 58.4 Mb


[01-Oct-18 07:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
zipped


[01-Oct-18 07:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
.app is 146 Mb I think


[01-Oct-18 07:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
delete folders `build/` and `node_modules`


[01-Oct-18 07:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
do `npm install`


[01-Oct-18 07:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and then `npm run package:mac`


[01-Oct-18 07:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
then compress the app from `build/` dir


[01-Oct-18 07:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
should be expected app size


[01-Oct-18 07:26 AM] siu#3920

@grewalsatinder you confirm you get a smaller file on your side?

If I set autoprice on for a pair, should that affect my ability (from that same mm) to submit alice buys for that pair and get successful matches? @cipi

your electron framwork has 2 copies of it's version in package which is 236.3 MB


[02-Oct-18 08:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
mine is 118.2 MB


[02-Oct-18 08:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
because it's doing symlink to version instead of having a copy


[02-Oct-18 08:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
may be remove electron from your npm global packages and reinstall it


[02-Oct-18 08:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
check the files and sizes in dir as showing in screen shot to verify

ok, will do, thanks


[02-Oct-18 05:01 PM] cipi#4502
@tolken being bob doesn't affect your ability to submit alice buy/sells, but doing the buy/sells will change the price of your bob bids/asks (autoprice), till the autoprice is updated agaian... that was my experience last i did that on a bob... but i use "dedicated" alice/bobs since some time and didn't tried it again


[02-Oct-18 11:08 PM] tolken#2655
Interesting, great to know. I was wondering why it was mentioning autoprice when I was doing Alice buys. That said, it could be coincidence but on many occasions I have a trouble matching an alice Buy, but then I start mm without my autoprice set and the buy then goes through. Was so consistent I just assumed that was by design.


[03-Oct-18 04:46 AM] tolken#2655
@cipi I seem to have another failed kmd/btc swap, although my bob remained online the whole time. I noticed this error: ```

[03-Oct-18 09:30 AM] coiin | $ARRR#0708
could anyone help me with Barterdex? Want to trade KMD/DEX

offers there but no trade status.


[03-Oct-18 09:33 AM] Acura#2748
@coiin | $ARRR you can also buy from coinexchange.io or try HyperDex


[03-Oct-18 09:34 AM] coiin | $ARRR#0708
coinexchange is 3 times bigger Price. Hyperdex "hangs" also. We wrote yesterday in telegram


[03-Oct-18 09:35 AM] coiin | $ARRR#0708
Nabob on Hyperdex-official "send" me to #dev-tradebots


[03-Oct-18 09:36 AM] SHossain#0007
it could be the bob nodes need restart. you can test COQUI/BEER or COQUI/PIZZA to learn how the BarterDEX works. the orderbook should be live and @siu manage them.


[03-Oct-18 09:36 AM] SHossain#0007
or choose another active pair

to be sure a made one  make invetory

the the first option, immediate to start with testing or swapping


[03-Oct-18 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
2nd and 3rd option is to be a bob


[03-Oct-18 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
i don't see anything wrong with your screenshot


[03-Oct-18 10:05 AM] coiin | $ARRR#0708
but still hangs for one our. tried since yseterday several times


[03-Oct-18 10:05 AM] SHossain#0007
it's not hanged, your order is there as bob order. you need to wait for an alice to appear and fill your order


[03-Oct-18 10:06 AM] coiin | $ARRR#0708
but under buyers there is me and second one


[03-Oct-18 10:06 AM] SHossain#0007
then, it will be there until you cancel it or someone buy that order


[03-Oct-18 10:07 AM] SHossain#0007
you have selected the wrong option in the left box


[03-Oct-18 10:07 AM] SHossain#0007
use `Limit Price order - immidiate`


[03-Oct-18 10:08 AM] SHossain#0007
use HyperDEX, that would a good step for you. Easy to use.

use ZCL/KMD pair. i didn't have issue with that


[03-Oct-18 10:10 AM] SHossain#0007
barterDEX is not your traditional exchange. Atomic swaps happens here. It works bit different way than centralised exchange.

ok, i will try ZCL/KMD , but goal was to get DEX

you can try again

there is no guaranteed 100% success with marketmaker 1.0


[03-Oct-18 11:32 AM] coiin | $ARRR#0708
i don't need guatantee , but i get headaches. Many examples to read see about successful trades and i got no one working, nor with KMD wether with Beer


[03-Oct-18 11:34 AM] SHossain#0007
if it didn't work, try again. until you successfully complete a swap


[03-Oct-18 11:34 AM] coiin | $ARRR#0708
If i use Hyperdex, how long does it take more less to took swap


[03-Oct-18 11:35 AM] SHossain#0007
atomic swap time depends on block confirmation, order matching, bobs connectivity


[03-Oct-18 11:39 AM] coiin | $ARRR#0708
If i could startet the offer means in generell my Hyperdex appimage works, there isnothing missing on my machine


[03-Oct-18 11:41 AM] coiin | $ARRR#0708
thank you anyway, for help


[03-Oct-18 11:50 AM] SHossain#0007
it takes some time to understand all these and get them to work. once you will complete the first one, you will want to do more. atomic swap kind of makes everyone addicted in the end.

hey guys. i am learning the tech and getting familiar with cmd line barterdex.  stucked in with one problem. 
buying or selling, request is showing up nicely in log but orderbook is empty, can't start a swap. any suggestion much appreciated.


[03-Oct-18 12:58 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to give more information. which pair you are trying, native mode or electrum mode and what exact command you used to run?


[03-Oct-18 01:46 PM] phideas#8309
i am trying with btch/kmd pair. native wallets setup and synced on a  vps server. there i ran 2  bot orders.
```marketmaker-cli bot_buy BTCH KMD 0.0111 0.3
marketmaker-cli bot_sell BTCH KMD 0.0555 3```


[03-Oct-18 01:49 PM] phideas#8309
on a local machine i am running hyperdex with 2  open orders, i see them in log on a vps.
``` uuid.9b5ada3fbf7d0a1167cb6b647f14f1da M.0 g.1 f.0      request  BTCH/KMD     0.06030019 ->   0.06010000 ( 0.99684542)
 uuid.35095a53e9fd56afa58726e5454d9bb9 M.0 g.1 f.0      request   KMD/BTCH    0.03020119 ->   3.00010000 (99.37004802)```


[03-Oct-18 01:55 PM] phideas#8309
before bot_buy and bot_sell, i was trying a simple buy and sell orders on a vps. same results. request in a log, see them on a second machine  but empty orderbook.
i am probably doing something wrong, still learning the basics.


[03-Oct-18 01:58 PM] phideas#8309
local pc is behind nat, i forwarded port 7783 to my machine, it didn't help

don't use bot_*


[03-Oct-18 02:01 PM] SHossain#0007
use normal buy or sell script


[03-Oct-18 02:02 PM] SHossain#0007
if you want to put an order as bob aka seller, use `autoprice` script


[03-Oct-18 02:03 PM] SHossain#0007
copy or customize it as your liking

i am upgrading from 1.1.1 to 1.1.2 on mac 10.11.6
the 1.1.2 stays on Starting BarterDex. Please wait... is there a trick to upgrading on mac?


[04-Oct-18 04:47 PM] DG#6934
I will say more likely sometimes to make a fresh installation


[04-Oct-18 04:48 PM] DG#6934
is better than having to upgrade your OS


[04-Oct-18 04:49 PM] DG#6934
Barterdex is portable but still the Barterdex folder is created in Appdata....sometimes erasing that folder and launching Barterdex again can solve that issue, But bewarned only to do this if you don't have any pending or stuck swap ...because your swap file is in that folder I just mentioned.


[04-Oct-18 06:36 PM] Arcmark#8247
i‚Äôm on mac os. so no AppData. i deleted barterdex in library application support and rebooted.
 but on start is still sits on wait forever. is there another folder or file to delete on mac? What do you mean fresh installation?


[04-Oct-18 07:18 PM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
before you delete barterdex folder have you checked no marketmaker instance running in background
check with this
`ps -ef | grep marketmaker`

if it is, kill that process


[04-Oct-18 08:33 PM] Arcmark#8247
yes. i killed it. and then rebooted. still hangs.  at this point 1.1.1 and 1.1.2 do the same thing. even if i delete barterdex. another idea?


[04-Oct-18 08:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
have you already deleted/moved the BarterDEX data directory ?


[04-Oct-18 08:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
linux: ~/.BarterDEX
mac: ~/Library/Applications Support/BarterDEX
win: %AppData%\BarterDEX


[04-Oct-18 08:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
these are not the applications. these are the data directory.


[04-Oct-18 08:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
close BarterDEX
make sure `marketmaker` is not running in background. kill it with taskmanager/monitor if required
Move or delete barterdex data directory
start barterdex app
it should start.
if doesn't either the bundled marketmaker is not good or there is some other process like antivirus is causing it to not start for system security etc.


[04-Oct-18 11:25 PM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
@Arcmark provide screenshot on which point it hangs?


[07-Oct-18 10:09 AM] cipi#4502
@tolken the reason why bob couldn't send bobpayment is not contained in the log message
```swapdata rawtx has null txbytes
error from basilisk_swapdata_rawtx.bobpayment 0x103a3d8cc len.0
error sending bobpayment```
there should be some other output...
such swaps should be rewinded automatically after couple of hours (4-12) and you can try to speed it up by calling `swapstatus` manually

try to work out that but not getting there. tried both on linux and windows but cant claim. problem since its older type of claim? its 10kmd and not 10.1kmd.


[09-Oct-18 05:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
are you on CLI or on a GUI?


[09-Oct-18 05:55 AM] Mark81#4505
Gui


[09-Oct-18 05:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
ok in my experience it does something strange the GUI somehow connect first I believe with the default seed and than mixes up the addresses i could never reconstruct a proper way how to reconstruct it.
If you are comfy on a linux terminal it it much easier can do  that?


[09-Oct-18 06:00 AM] CHMEX#0686
or let me see if I can help you on windows command with a step by step


[09-Oct-18 06:02 AM] Mark81#4505
Ok i can go through that pain. Probably need to download marketmaker separately. If you can leave here fast instructions and once i have time more at evening I'll go trough it.


[09-Oct-18 06:03 AM] CHMEX#0686

cd ~/SuperNET/iguana/exchanges
nano passphrase   # export passphrase="YOUR PASS PHRASE HERE"
# start marketmaker
./client

# than you should see at some point
# userpass.(cXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXxxxx6)
# copy that one and save it in userpass export userpass="cXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"


#open new terminal

nano userpass

# now drop your claim file from the website in ./SuperNET/iguana/DB/
# than execute 

./claim

#that should claim your deposit.
# if the deposit is exactly 10 KMD you are not receiving rewards as it was to be >10 ( because of trx fee)

#I Hope it helps if not let me know I can claim it for you but I need the passphrase which is not the purpose of this exercise.
#also SHossain has done it for some people if so just make sure it does not have funds in it.

Seems like so. I wonder why?


[09-Oct-18 07:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
There was a time where exactly 10 KMD did not result in receiving the reward because the spend deducated 0.0001 hence <10 but it looks like this is now adjusted. Good news

@decentrali @udiWertheimer Just like relayers get front-runner abilities in off-chain orderbook systems, miners get front-runner abilities in onchain orderbook systems. I think a consensus engine like Hashgraph is necessary for decentralized order matching.

barterDEX uses a broadcast protocol so all nodes know about all offers in realtime. seems hard to front run that


[12-Oct-18 01:06 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
understood and replied


[12-Oct-18 01:20 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
ok he now said "That's only if first-seen rule is honored, and there is currently no proven way to force nodes to honor it"


[12-Oct-18 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
each client sends to multiple FR nodes


[12-Oct-18 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so, yes the first node could refuse to relay, but it would gain only a few milliseconds advantage and only if they were the first of the N to receive it


[12-Oct-18 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
also, the protcol extends the time the auction is open for up to 30 seconds with a minimum of 3 seconds


[12-Oct-18 01:24 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont think there needs to be any complicated proof that 3 seconds time an order is open for (at minimum) is enough to totally negate any few millisecond advantage the first node gains

this from a another guy: "what do relay nodes do if there's conflicting info?"


[12-Oct-18 01:45 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
"i.e. 1) sorting of who went first is different from different relayers 2) orders are conflicting for same user (buy 5 AND by 10 but can only afford one of them) "


[12-Oct-18 01:59 AM] jl777c#5810
all the requests are signed by the one making the request


[12-Oct-18 02:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it is broadcast to all that are online (via redundant relay nodes whose sole purpose is to relay orders)


[12-Oct-18 02:00 AM] jl777c#5810
the ones interested respond (with a signed offer)


[12-Oct-18 02:01 AM] jl777c#5810
the requestor evaluates all incoming signed offers and accepts the one that it wants


[12-Oct-18 02:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt matter who went first


[12-Oct-18 02:01 AM] jl777c#5810
orders cant conflict for the same user, as the utxo needed are specified in the offer. if any detail is different, it is a different offer

Was hoping to setup KMD/VRSC bob and assume I need to spin up VRSC as an assetchain.   Where might I find the max supply parameter for this coin, assuming I need that to start the chain.

```verusd -ac_name=VRSC -ac_algo=verushash -ac_cc=1 -ac_veruspos=50 -ac_supply=0 -ac_eras=3 -ac_reward=0,38400000000,2400000000 -ac_halving=1,43200,1051920 -ac_decay=100000000,0,0 -ac_end=10080,226080,0 -ac_timelockgte=19200000000 -ac_timeunlockfrom=129600 -ac_timeunlockto=1180800 -addnode=185.25.48.236 -addnode=185.64.105.111 -daemon```

yeah i'll have to try out hyperdex, i remember the utxo management was a bit difficult with barterdex maybe hyperdex is a bit more streamlined, at least that was one of the benefits being touted a while back about it


[07-Nov-18 05:46 AM] tolken#2655
@CiPhEr  HyoerDex is much more streamlined, but I still haven‚Äôt had any success trading with it. Most of my trades get to the ‚Äúconnect‚Äù stage then stall out. But yeah, I think yesterday there was maybe only 1 trade on BarterDex within a 24h period. My guess is that most people have the same experience I have when trying and just give up, otherwise BarterDex would be flourishing with a fair bit more volume. There‚Äôs plenty of liquidity on the Marketmaker side for most of the main pairs, but very few alices trying to buy.

Yes.


[19-Nov-18 11:28 AM] SHossain#0007
Includes all the barterDEX 1.0 API calls.

you can run `./help` and that will give you all API commands

@SHossain I am trying to write a simple market maker, is it possible you or someone else could answer a few questions that I have?  Some parts of the documentation are a little unclear.


[19-Nov-18 11:30 AM] SHossain#0007
post your questions here and you will get answer


[19-Nov-18 11:30 AM] wbradt#2043
Ok, thanks


[19-Nov-18 11:31 AM] wbradt#2043
Which method should I use to create a market order? `dump`? `fomo`?


[19-Nov-18 11:35 AM] SHossain#0007
`autoprice`, `setprice` `buy` `sell`


[19-Nov-18 11:36 AM] SHossain#0007
`dump` and `fomo` are special cases


[19-Nov-18 11:38 AM] wbradt#2043
But `buy` and `sell` require a price, don't they?


[19-Nov-18 11:38 AM] SHossain#0007
dump and fomo can't place bob orders. those need to be used when there are orders from bob


[19-Nov-18 11:38 AM] SHossain#0007
`autoprice` and `setprice` is needed to create bob orders

[19-Nov-18 11:40 AM] SHossain#0007
read other docs in the wiki in order to learn more


[19-Nov-18 11:42 AM] wbradt#2043
I have read that. I have an Alice and a Bob node set up.


[19-Nov-18 11:43 AM] SHossain#0007
bob uses `autoprice` or `setprice` and alice needs to use `buy` or `sell`


[19-Nov-18 11:43 AM] SHossain#0007
alice also can use `fomo` and `dump`


[19-Nov-18 11:44 AM] SHossain#0007
but, for that bob orders need to be present


[19-Nov-18 11:44 AM] wbradt#2043
So can a bob not specify the maximum volume it wants to sell?


[19-Nov-18 11:46 AM] SHossain#0007
use `amount` field on the autoprice script


[19-Nov-18 11:55 AM] wbradt#2043
What about for alice @SHossain ?


[19-Nov-18 12:01 PM] SHossain#0007
`buy` script


[19-Nov-18 12:02 PM] wbradt#2043
Can alice place an order without specifying price?


[19-Nov-18 12:04 PM] SHossain#0007
alice without price use `fomo` or `dump`


[19-Nov-18 12:05 PM] wbradt#2043
Ok, thanks. What is the difference between those two?


[19-Nov-18 12:05 PM] wbradt#2043
The documentation makes it look like they do the same thing.


[19-Nov-18 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
one buys, one sells


[19-Nov-18 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
standard industry terms


[19-Nov-18 12:06 PM] SHossain#0007
fomo is buy and dump is sell


[19-Nov-18 12:06 PM] wbradt#2043
Thank you.


[19-Nov-18 12:08 PM] wbradt#2043
The docs say the `buy` endpoint "will be added in the orderbook" if there is no matching order.  But in another spot it says `buy` is fill or kill. Isn't this contradictory?


[19-Nov-18 12:10 PM] SHossain#0007
BarterDEX is an auction system, not traditional exchange


[19-Nov-18 12:10 PM] SHossain#0007
there can be negative spread


[19-Nov-18 12:11 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have a winning bid, it will be filled. otherwise, not filled


[19-Nov-18 12:12 PM] SHossain#0007
why don't you perform tests first with BEER and PIZZA and learn how it works before diving deep


[19-Nov-18 12:12 PM] SHossain#0007
BEER and PIZZA is free coin for testing


[19-Nov-18 12:12 PM] wbradt#2043
Ok, thanks


[19-Nov-18 12:12 PM] SHossain#0007
barterDEX also doesn't use balance, it uses UTXO


[19-Nov-18 12:13 PM] wbradt#2043
So is it not contradictory due to the nature of BarterDEX?

[19-Nov-18 12:14 PM] SHossain#0007
it is not contradictory. any `buy` order will put it on the orderbook. it either gets filled or stay there doing nothing

Fill or kill
A fill or kill (FOK) order is "an order to buy or sell a stock that must be executed immediately"‚Äîa few seconds, customarily‚Äîin its entirety; otherwise, the entire order is cancelled; no partial fulfillments are allowed.Characterized as "extreme orders", FOK orders are "m...


[19-Nov-18 12:16 PM] wbradt#2043
But it stays on the order book, it doesn't get cancelled, right?


[19-Nov-18 12:17 PM] SHossain#0007
it doesn't get cancelled automatically


[19-Nov-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
a fill or kill order wont stay active very long


[19-Nov-18 12:18 PM] wbradt#2043
So it is not fill or kill?


[19-Nov-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it is, but it is given one minute to fill


[19-Nov-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no central ordermatch


[19-Nov-18 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to understand a fully decentralized orderbook cant work exactly like a centralized ordermatch


[19-Nov-18 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
the orderbook actually doesnt exist in any single place. each node constructs its own version of the orderbook


[19-Nov-18 12:25 PM] wbradt#2043
I understand.


[19-Nov-18 12:27 PM] wbradt#2043
I am just a little confused, because fill or kill has a very specific meaning--`buy` seems more like good-till-time, with time being a minute


[19-Nov-18 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
well the effect is that it is filled or killed


[19-Nov-18 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
one minute is the typical blocktime


[19-Nov-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is an "instant"


[19-Nov-18 12:28 PM] wbradt#2043
Ok


[19-Nov-18 12:28 PM] wbradt#2043
So can an alice leave an order open on the order book?


[19-Nov-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
not really, but alice can do a "gtc" order, which is simulated by submitting the same order over and over


[19-Nov-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
and once any part of it fills, it is considered done


[19-Nov-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
i know, i know, not what its supposed to be


[19-Nov-18 12:29 PM] wbradt#2043
What about `bot_buy`/ `bot_sell`?


[19-Nov-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
those arent really needed anymore


[19-Nov-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
it issues a stream of orders until it is done, or has 10 attempts


[19-Nov-18 12:30 PM] wbradt#2043
Oh ok


[19-Nov-18 12:31 PM] wbradt#2043
Making sure I understand this, bob can leave orders open on the book with `setprice` and `autoprice`?


[19-Nov-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
bob responds to alice requests


[19-Nov-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so bob "leaves orders" open, but it is a realtime auction between all the bobs for each alice request


[19-Nov-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt actually any normal orderbook


[19-Nov-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
the orderbook is a fiction, an illusion


[19-Nov-18 12:34 PM] wbradt#2043
Ok, that makes more sense


[19-Nov-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
try not to be so literal about the terms used


[19-Nov-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
alternative was to use totally new and unfamiliar language for concepts that are similar


[19-Nov-18 12:35 PM] wbradt#2043
That's fair


[19-Nov-18 12:36 PM] wbradt#2043
But I mean, from what you guys told me, `dump` and `fomo` match the definition of a market order


[19-Nov-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
yes


[19-Nov-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
but for crypto people, it has meaning


[19-Nov-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
you are free to rename things to whatever you want though, it is just the internal docs


[20-Nov-18 11:05 AM] wbradt#2043
Does every order have a uuid?


[20-Nov-18 11:12 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[20-Nov-18 11:21 AM] wbradt#2043
Where is it created? LP_autobuy? Also, is the uuid for each order stored anywhere?


[20-Nov-18 11:24 AM] SHossain#0007
the swapfiles are stored in `~/SuperNET/iguana/DB/SWAPS/`


[20-Nov-18 11:27 AM] wbradt#2043
Does that include data about orders? Or just swaps?


[20-Nov-18 11:31 AM] SHossain#0007
both


[20-Nov-18 11:32 AM] SHossain#0007
few different files gets created for a single swap. they contain all the information


[20-Nov-18 11:32 AM] wbradt#2043
I'm asking about orders not swaps


[20-Nov-18 11:32 AM] wbradt#2043
Can there be only one swap per order?


[20-Nov-18 11:33 AM] SHossain#0007
are you talking about alice of bob order?


[20-Nov-18 11:36 AM] wbradt#2043
Bob


[20-Nov-18 11:37 AM] SHossain#0007
there can be multiple swap per order. that depends on the amount of utxos bob has


[20-Nov-18 11:42 AM] wbradt#2043
So is there a uuid for bob orders? And is there one for alice orders?


[20-Nov-18 11:46 AM] SHossain#0007
for a swap it is same `uuid`, `quoteid` & `requestid` that bob and alice gets


[20-Nov-18 11:47 AM] wbradt#2043
I'm asking about orders not swaps


[20-Nov-18 11:47 AM] SHossain#0007
orders doesn't have uuid


[20-Nov-18 11:47 AM] wbradt#2043
Ok thanks


[20-Nov-18 12:21 PM] wbradt#2043
Can bobs use the "buy" and "sell" RPC methods?


[20-Nov-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
no, using buy and sell make you alice


[20-Nov-18 12:31 PM] wbradt#2043
Thanks @jl777c


[20-Nov-18 12:34 PM] wbradt#2043
@jl777c I asked someone else this earlier but wanted to be sure: Orders do not have UUIDs, right?


[20-Nov-18 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
well, a uuid is created when alice creates the order, but like one hand clapping, without bob answering it, did it really exist?


[20-Nov-18 12:36 PM] wbradt#2043
So they do have UUIDs?


[20-Nov-18 12:39 PM] wbradt#2043
If so, is that the UUID created in `LP_autobuy` here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/blob/master/iguana/exchanges/LP_ordermatch.c#L1828? @jl777c

[20-Nov-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, also the caller can set a uuid


[20-Nov-18 12:47 PM] wbradt#2043
Thanks--I spent a little too long trying to figure out if that was the uuid for a swap or the order


[20-Nov-18 12:47 PM] wbradt#2043
Are the uuid's stored anywhere?


[20-Nov-18 12:47 PM] wbradt#2043
For bob (and maybe alice too)


[20-Nov-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it ends up in the json for the swap request


[20-Nov-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
which then ends up in DB/SWAPS


[20-Nov-18 12:52 PM] wbradt#2043
Is that under the "uuid" key?


[20-Nov-18 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
yes


[20-Nov-18 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
what else could that be


[20-Nov-18 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
i try to make things clear


[20-Nov-18 12:55 PM] wbradt#2043
I thought it might have been the uuid for the swap


[20-Nov-18 12:55 PM] wbradt#2043
So multiple swaps for the same order can have the same uuid, right?


[20-Nov-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
no, each swap is unique


[20-Nov-18 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
there can be multiple proposed swaps for a single request, they would all have the same uuid, but only one can actually happen


[20-Nov-18 12:58 PM] wbradt#2043
An alice can't do two swaps with two different bobs for one order?


[20-Nov-18 12:58 PM] wbradt#2043
(One swap each)


[20-Nov-18 01:01 PM] SHossain#0007
1 order = 1 swap


[20-Nov-18 01:01 PM] SHossain#0007
2 orders = 2 swaps


[20-Nov-18 01:02 PM] wbradt#2043
@SHossain But I thought you said "there can be multiple swap per order. that depends on the amount of utxos bob has"


[20-Nov-18 01:02 PM] SHossain#0007
that is for bob.


[20-Nov-18 01:03 PM] wbradt#2043
Oh ok.


[20-Nov-18 01:04 PM] SHossain#0007
bob puts one order using `autoprice` or `setprice` and has multiple utxo. alice can keep swapping their coin that matches with utxo. it can be any number of swaps before bob finishes his sell.


[20-Nov-18 01:08 PM] wbradt#2043
Ok, thanks. To clarify, when @jl777c said "there can be multiple proposed swaps for a single request, they would all have the same uuid, but only one can actually happen," what is the "request"?


[20-Nov-18 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
alice posts a buy/sell trade request


[20-Nov-18 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
bob(s) respond


[20-Nov-18 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
alice picks the one she likes best


[20-Nov-18 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
swap starts


[20-Nov-18 01:13 PM] wbradt#2043
Thanks. So,  if "alice keeps swapping their coin that matches with" the "best" bob's utxo, is there one or multiple swaps?


[20-Nov-18 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
i think you are not understanding what a swap is...


[20-Nov-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it is for specific utxo for another specific utxo


[20-Nov-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
you cant double spend the same utxo


[20-Nov-18 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
alice can only swap her specific utxo once, with one bob, no more


[20-Nov-18 01:17 PM] wbradt#2043
Sorry, I understand. I was confused because @SHossain said " it can be any number of swaps before bob finishes his sell" but now realize he meant multiple swaps before bob finishes, not multiple swaps before alice finishes


[20-Nov-18 01:19 PM] wbradt#2043
To clarify, if alice places an order, only one swap can result from it?


[20-Nov-18 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it is for specific utxo for another specific utxo
you cant double spend the same utxo
alice can only swap her specific utxo once, with one bob, no more


[20-Nov-18 01:25 PM] wbradt#2043
What is "it"? A swap or an order?


[20-Nov-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
both


[20-Nov-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
an order from alice specifies the utxo


[20-Nov-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
a swap based on the order, uses the same utxi


[20-Nov-18 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
you seem to get hung up on some specific words


[20-Nov-18 01:29 PM] wbradt#2043
Ok. So all of bob's swaps are in iguana/DB/SWAPS, right?


[20-Nov-18 01:29 PM] SHossain#0007
yes


[20-Nov-18 01:29 PM] SHossain#0007
same for alice


[20-Nov-18 01:30 PM] wbradt#2043
what is `iguana/DB/GTC/orders`?


[20-Nov-18 01:32 PM] SHossain#0007
GTC = Good Till Cancelled


[20-Nov-18 01:32 PM] wbradt#2043
Yes


[20-Nov-18 01:32 PM] wbradt#2043
When is data for an order put in the file?


[20-Nov-18 01:35 PM] SHossain#0007
when bob or alice use `gtc=1` or `fill=1` in their order, that dir gets used


[20-Nov-18 01:37 PM] SHossain#0007
but, that is not widely used param


[20-Nov-18 01:41 PM] wbradt#2043
Which method can bob use that param in?


[20-Nov-18 01:46 PM] SHossain#0007
`autoprice` or `setprice`


[20-Nov-18 01:54 PM] wbradt#2043
Yesterday you said that `autoprice` has an `amount` field. Is that true for only `autoprice` and not `setprice`?


[20-Nov-18 01:54 PM] SHossain#0007
for both


[20-Nov-18 01:55 PM] wbradt#2043
Ok, thanks


[20-Nov-18 01:56 PM] wbradt#2043
So, using `amount`, bob can place a limit order for a certain amount at a certain price?


[20-Nov-18 02:05 PM] SHossain#0007
yes


[20-Nov-18 02:05 PM] wbradt#2043
Great.


[20-Nov-18 08:42 PM] ph03nix#3115
does barterdex still get price feed from cmc?


[20-Nov-18 08:43 PM] ph03nix#3115
i guess a better question is, where does the price feed come from?

CMC changed to a paid plan, so the pricefeed shouldnt be used. you should generate your own pricefeed and set prices for bob


[21-Nov-18 12:15 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as amount goes, i dont remember adding amount restrictions explicitly for bob. the available utxo implicitly limits the amount

```


[21-Nov-18 08:38 AM] SHossain#0007
if you can't set amount, just keep the amount you want to trade in the barterDEX address and send the rest to main account. in any circumstances, using main account for barterDEX is not recommended. always better to create a separate address for trading.

It would be a very powerful addition though, to have a min/max. Btc will generally require larger UTXOs, so it would be nice to just prevent 1kmd trades against btc before swap even starts, even if there is an appropriately sized btc UTXO.

And, to make sure I understand, IOC orders (`fill:0 gtc:0`) are not _immediate_, but cancel after one minute, or the "typical blocktime"?


[06-Dec-18 07:07 AM] wbradt#2043
So the effect is that an IOC order can only match with orders placed before it?


[06-Dec-18 07:10 AM] wbradt#2043
And what would be the effect of `gtc` on a `dump` or `fomo` order? Would `fill` work for these?


[06-Dec-18 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
gtc would just keep issuing it till it got some sort of fill


[06-Dec-18 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure if i tested fill on a dump or fomo, but i dont see why it would behave differently, their purpose is to autocalculate a price field

[12-Dec-18 09:34 AM] wbradt#2043
Is there any reason intrinsic to atomic swaps for why the trader using 212% is the liquidity provider?


[13-Dec-18 03:27 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@wbradt Hi, the swap protocol was designed at 2015-2016 when only few coins implemented BIP65 (CLTV opcode support). This approach allows 1 side of swap to send standard 2of2 multisig payment without timelock. Nowadays it's not really necessary as most coins seem to catch up and implement BIP65. According to this we will use simpler symmetric protocol version (both payments are CLTV) in MM2 so LP side won't need to have 212% balance anymore


[13-Dec-18 11:31 AM] wbradt#2043
Thanks! @artem.pikulin very informative


[13-Dec-18 11:34 AM] wbradt#2043
The docs say `recentswaps` "returns up to "limit" in reverse order the swaps on the node and the current pending swap (if any) so you can see what trade might happen." Does this mean it returns only swaps in which I have participated?

[14-Dec-18 06:58 AM] wbradt#2043
@artem.pikulin So in MM2 would both sides of the trade need only 100%? Or does alice still pay dexfee? Or some other arrangement?


[14-Dec-18 07:00 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@wbradt Alice will have to pay small dexfee = 1/777 of trading amount as it was previously.


[14-Dec-18 07:01 AM] wbradt#2043
Thanks--does bob then pay 100%?


[14-Dec-18 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i think bob might need to also pay 1/777


[14-Dec-18 07:12 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
In current implementation Bob does not pay any fee except standard transaction commission. So the protocol is (Bitcoin script example):
1. A fee, p2pkh output: `OP_DUP OP_HASH160 FEE_RMD160 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG`
2. B payment: 
```
OP_IF
<now + LOCKTIME*2> OP_CLTV OP_DROP <bob_pubB0> OP_CHECKSIG
 OP_ELSE
OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_HASH160 <hash(bob_privN)> OP_EQUALVERIFY <alice_pubA0> OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ENDIF
```
3. A payment:
```
OP_IF
<now + LOCKTIME> OP_CLTV OP_DROP <alice_pubA0> OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ELSE
OP_SIZE 32 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_HASH160 <hash(bob_privN)> OP_EQUALVERIFY <bob_pubB0> OP_CHECKSIG
OP_ENDIF
```
It's actually not hard to add Bfee as work is in progress.


[14-Dec-18 07:15 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`Bob does not pay any fee except standard transaction commission.`
So, no deposit anymore? at all?


[14-Dec-18 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
there would need to be something at stake for bob, so lets add the 1/777 fee to bobside also


[14-Dec-18 07:16 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Is it really required? There is always a case when someone loses fee if other side does not follow the protocol. Bob side didn't require a fee and it's introduced as liquidity provider advantage


[14-Dec-18 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
are you sure bob cant get an advantage without a dexfee?


[14-Dec-18 07:18 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@ComputerGenie Yes, no need for Bob deposit anymore.


[14-Dec-18 07:19 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'd think that the "need" would be to not be able to screw Alice out of dex fees for the cost of 0.0001 CoinX


[14-Dec-18 07:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
oh, you mean that whole stage is gone?


[14-Dec-18 07:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
sweet


[14-Dec-18 07:21 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
I mean that Bob did not have to pay fee previously, it's a bonus for being the liquidity provider. It's usual for marketmaker to pay less fees or not pay these at all.

{Reactions}
üëå 

[14-Dec-18 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, but if nobody is putting up liquidity anymore, then without dexfee, it seems bad things can happen


[14-Dec-18 07:22 AM] wbradt#2043
I think bob not paying a transaction fee would be ideal, as it provides the incentive to make liquidity.


[14-Dec-18 07:30 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@jl777c But with old protocol if nobody puts up the liquidity no fees would be paid still. Maybe I didn't understand something correct? Do we consider the fee as something that affects liquidity?


[14-Dec-18 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the 200%+ affected liquidity the most


[14-Dec-18 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
the concern is that without any dexfee at stake, what incentive does bob side have for completing a swap, especially the refund cases


[14-Dec-18 07:33 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
The bob could not send deposit after Afee, there was no incentive for him to do it if he's malicious and just wants the Alice to spend some funds and time for useless swap.


[14-Dec-18 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. but now we need to make sure that at every step in all other cases, bob has incentive to complete the next step


[14-Dec-18 07:40 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Maybe I miss something but nothing really changes, there is always a case that someone loses the fee if other side doesn't follow the protocol. I think the "incentive" to complete the trade is somewhere outside the atomic swap protocol: e.g. Bob wants to buy some beer for KMD, but beerstore accepts only ETH so Bob opens HyperDEX and puts the order to exchange his KMD to ETH.


[14-Dec-18 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess we eliminate a lot of the deposits coming back cases, without the deposits


[14-Dec-18 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
and once the first spend using secret is done, the trade is done other than the other side doing their half, which they are fully motivated to do


[14-Dec-18 07:47 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
1 side always have to start the swap, let's compare a couple of cases:
1. Alice doesn't send the fee - swap is aborted (both versions). There is no incentive that might force the malicious Alice to send the fee.
2. Alice sends fee - but then Bob doesn't send the deposit (old version) or payment (new version) - actually nothing changed. Alice loses fee in both cases. There is no incentive that might force the malicious Bob to send deposit/payment.


[14-Dec-18 07:49 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
The only incentive might be reputation system: nobody will soon trade with malicious keypair owner, however it's not hard to generate a new one and keep cheating.


[14-Dec-18 07:52 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`Bob opens HyperDEX and puts the order to exchange his KMD to ETH.`
And if Bob lives in a rural area Bob gets his beer 3 weeks later...


[14-Dec-18 07:52 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@ComputerGenie Wanna increase KMD blocktime to 3 weeks to make it real?)

block times have no impact on how well SPV interaction does/doesn't work for a large percentage of the population


[14-Dec-18 08:04 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
The other important thing to mention: we want to eliminate the difference between liquidity provider and taker (like it is on centralized exchanges). So the user downloads the app, puts an order and might just wait until someone comes to take it. Of course he needs his app to be running until trade completes, but imagine this on mobile devices: these are actually always on so (maybe, I'm not sure about the background apps limitations on mobile OS) in ideal situation he puts an order on his phone and goes to sleep like he can do with centralized exchange.

Hey @cipi can you help me out with this I followed what you told me to do in the last email we shared together, and I have restarted marketmaker and now getting this output when running `./enable_my` ```{"error":"couldnt find coin locally installed","coin":"ABP"}```

the coin daemon must run and the config file needs at least his entries
```server=1

Can bob put the fee at first, then during the swap Alice repays the fee @artem.pikulin ?


[14-Dec-18 06:25 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
If Bob went first then Bob would be Alice; because A B C...


[15-Dec-18 02:19 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Mylo Hi, could you please describe in more details the idea of `Alice repays the fee`? It's mentioned as `benefit` at wiki that Liquidity provider doesn't need to pay the fee: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform/wiki/Be-a-marketmaker-or-bob-using-barterDEX-CLI#benefits-of-being-an-lp-node.

[15-Dec-18 05:47 PM] Mylo#8306
@artem.pikulin let me try. 
Currently Alice pays dexfee in v1.  Bob puts a deposit.  To deter spammy traders.

Reading how you are trying to remove the Alice and bob -ness of a trade, and to remove the need for bob to have extra deposit.  Yes benefit of no fee to LP is there in v1 but requiring extra deposit exists.

Instead, bob puts order with dexfee paid.  When Alice comes to buy bobs order, Alice pays dexfee back to bob from Alice funds during trade.  Bob still has no fee trade, Alice still pays dexfee, bob doesn‚Äôt need deposit.

Bob 10xdexfee
Alice trade
Bob trade
Alice dexfee
Bob refund10xdexfee

OR
Bob dexfee
Bob trade
Alice trade+repaydexfee

Or some other combination where one party cannot inconvenience the other by canceling mid trade.

Maybe zeroconf deposits can be used by LP for dexfee in the protocol refactor?


[16-Dec-18 08:44 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Mylo Hi, the main purpose of previous protocol was to allow the swap of coins that do not support CLTV opcode as there were just few of them at the moment of discussion. I might be wrong but there is `always` a way for one of the parties to not follow the protocol making other side loosing the fee (or there might be the case that fee is not collected), examples:
Bob 10xdexfee -> Alice trade -> Bob trade -> There is no incentive for Alice to send the dexfee as Bpayment is already done and she can spend it.
Bob dexfee -> Bob trade -> Alice trade + repaydexfee -> Bob doesn't spend the Alice payment, both sides refund the payments after locktime passes, but fee is lost.
`Maybe zeroconf deposits can be used by LP for dexfee in the protocol refactor?` - the goal of protocol refactor is to eliminate the requirement to have much more funds that is really required to trade (212% for bob). We should start to think very different about it, just imagine centralized exchange that forces you to make `2xdeposit` to trade, I guess nobody will use it. Or the exchange where you need run app in CLI-mode on dedicated server to be liquidity provider.
Any additional deposits will confuse the end users (remember that we present HyperDEX as "grandma" friendly). Users shouldn't have a questions like "why do I need to put the additional deposit to start the trade?", because it's irritating them. If we irritate the user there is more chance that he closes the app and never comes back making the DEX platform using the liquidity.


[16-Dec-18 08:59 PM] Mylo#8306
Ok thanks @artem.pikulin so it‚Äôs a balancing act of usability and losing fee scenarios.  It‚Äôs nice to read the github comments and continuing development thoughts and goals üòÉ


[17-Dec-18 03:06 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`remember that we present HyperDEX as "grandma" friendly`
And one iteration of one GUI is now the base concept for the protocol? The new thought is that grandma is going to be a liquidity provider?


[17-Dec-18 02:41 PM] tolken#2655
I believe in gramma, just give her the tools. Imagine a million grammas providing liquidity, with not a single technical support issue/ticket opened. We‚Äôd be unstoppable.


[17-Dec-18 03:01 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
lol @tolken 
the point I was getting at was that I'm all for making the protocol simpler because it needs to be simpler; making the protocol simpler because gradma's simpler GUI needs it to be simpler, not so much


[17-Dec-18 11:11 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@ComputerGenie Actually yes, it's a kind of recursion, we want to make things simpler just to make some other things simpler:
1. Makes users life simpler - they don't need to understand why they need the 212% to trade.
2. Makes programmer life simpler - less steps are easier to code, the less code you have less errors you have in it.
Main motivation was to remove the 212% stuff. One of the MM2 essential goals is `UX similar to centralized exchange`. Did you see any CEX that requires you to deposit 212KMD to trade just 100?


[17-Dec-18 11:29 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@artem.pikulin You seem to still be missing my point, so I'll try to be more blunt...
There should be no mention of HyperDEX as it pertains to the protocol level of mm/barterdex, unless HyperDEX is the official GUI for the protocol.


[17-Dec-18 11:38 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
It was just one of arguments, and yes the idea is actually `new thought is that grandma is going to be a liquidity provider?` because `anyone` that uses DEX should be able to act as LP, not just IT experienced person that has VPS with public IP.

[21-Dec-18 12:39 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@jorian Please ensure that you either use latest `jl777/dev` or `artemii235/master` build, this error indicates that coin has Sapling activated but MM doesn't recognize it. The latest version have hardcoded Sapling support for KMD and all assetchains, if it's outdated "a bit" you might have to explicitly set `"txversion":4` in coins config. But config txversion won't help if you use too old version.

The Sapling support was implemented about 2 months ago and was tested at least by me on ZEC testnet. There are not many users as I can see, but according to https://dexstats.info/ few swaps are happening every day.

@Deleted User I see that on November 23th you had the error `fatal error: /usr/local/include/nanomsg/nn.h: No such file or directory` while building/updating the SuperNET repo. What was your solution to this?

Background information: I try to update the SuperNET repo after a pull. I use `cd SuperNET && ./m_unix`. I get the nn.h error above.


[24-Dec-18 05:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
It was for kmdlabs. As the install is different is was mainly because I did all manually

_For future reference_ // While updating the SuperNET repo using `./m_unix` I got ` fatal error: /usr/local/include/nanomsg/nn.h: No such file or directory`.

I could solve the error by doing this:

```sudo apt-get update

$ whereis nanomsg
nanomsg: /usr/include/nanomsg

$ ls /usr/local/include/nanomsg
No such file or directory

$ sudo ln -s /usr/include/nanomsg /usr/local/include/
$ ls /usr/local/include/nanomsg
> Folder contents. Yay.

$ ./m_unix 
> Succesful update. Yay.```

it is just set on the minimum setting now but PoW for each packet can be changed with a #define

also there are 14000+ different netids, each a totally independent networl

[02-Jan-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
@wbradt each packet would do some PoW to be valid


[02-Jan-19 09:57 AM] wbradt#2043
Sorry, I do not quite understand this. What PoW is being done? Doesn't PoW require computational resources? Whose are used? How is a packet "valid"--or rather how would one be invalid? @jl777c


[02-Jan-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
@wbradt each packet would do some PoW to be valid
any PoW that takes computational resources will force the sender to spend resources and thus make spam more expensive to do


[02-Jan-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
packet would be considered valid based on the PoW rules, whatever they are. I used the standard leading 0 bits


[02-Jan-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
but it can be like txpow, generate txids until first and last bytes are 0, then it would limit to once per 20 seconds


[02-Jan-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
so a bit too much PoW


[02-Jan-19 10:13 AM] wbradt#2043
Ok, I understand. So is the POW constant for all users? So it takes less time for a node with a "faster" computer to create orders?

@wbradt it would need to be a network wide rule. yes, faster nodes could make more orders


[02-Jan-19 10:30 AM] wbradt#2043
I think I may have misunderstood: Is requiring PoW to send a message (or "validate a packet") in place (or "a rule") on the main BarterDEX network? @jl777c


[02-Jan-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
i remember i had it in place, but set it to minimum work, so it only takes a few millliseconds


[02-Jan-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
not hard to add/change


[02-Jan-19 10:44 AM] wbradt#2043
Is the 1-second request limit in place? @jl777c


[02-Jan-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
each request needs a unique timestamp, which has 1 second resolution


[02-Jan-19 11:10 AM] wbradt#2043
Great. Thanks for the help.


[02-Jan-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
are you with some project @wbradt


[02-Jan-19 12:14 PM] wbradt#2043
Not really. I developed some market making algos last year 
 (https://github.com/wardbradt/peregrine) and was thinking of incorporating BarterDEX. I have more become generally interested in how BarterDEX works. @jl777c


[08-Jan-19 11:10 AM] wbradt#2043
Where in the ResDEX code are messages from other nodes processed?

@jl777c @artem.pikulin @artemciy_dice are any of you familiar with this: https://github.com/GuggerJoel/XMR-BTC-atomic/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf

Do you think it would be feasible to implement in mm?

I think the first practical BTC <-> XMR atomic swap implementation would be pretty big news.

I thought XMR needed more features added to be able to implement atomic swaps but this whitepaper seems to imply it can be achieved using just multisig on the XMR end.

[22-Jan-19 10:24 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@lukechilds Hi, I see this whitepaper 1st time. It looks similar to old swap protocol that was used in MM1, Hash/time locked txs on BTC side and multisig on XMR. It's possible to add/reimplement this in MM2, however there were no requests to add XMR previously.


[22-Jan-19 10:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah, possibly for political reasons? Because Zcash and Monero are somewhat rivals and Komodo is a Zcash fork, Komodo members are more likely to be interested in Zcash as a privacy coin than Monero. So that could explain why there hasn't been much demand for Monero from within the Komodo community.

But I think this could be more of a publicity stunt that could bring a lot of attention from people outside of the current community. The Monero community has wanted atomic swaps with Bitcoin for a very long time. A working implementation of this that people can test out would be big news and hopefully get some well deserved publicity for Komodo.


[22-Jan-19 10:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
But I'm assuming it would be quite a bit of work to implement so obviously you'd need to weigh up if it's worth implementing over other stuff you're working on


[22-Jan-19 10:40 PM] lukechilds#2707
Also, due to the private nature of Monero, it's very popular on decentralised exchanges, BTC/XMR is the highest volume pair on Bisq. It could bring in some much needed liquidity


[22-Jan-19 11:31 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
I'm not involved in any political discussions. Didn't ever see that XMR is not allowed to be mentioned here. From developer point of view it's possible to integrate. However it might be hard to support different swap protocol for every coin. Also it might confuse the user, e.g. `Why do I need to have 2 BTC to sell only 1 for XMR?`.


[22-Jan-19 11:32 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
We can discuss it later if there's a demand from `users` to add XMR or any other coin.


[23-Jan-19 12:59 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I remember many people asking for XMR, also ptyx or someone else approached fluffypony but XMR devs were not interested to collaborate

@cipi any suggestions?


[23-Jan-19 04:53 AM] cipi#4502
not really... besides making sure the config file has the same name as the datadir
`~/.electra/electra.conf` and not `~/.electra/Electra.conf` or something else...


[23-Jan-19 04:54 AM] cipi#4502
if the config file has the same name, confpath is not needed and everything works fine


[23-Jan-19 04:56 AM] cipi#4502
in Linux i made a symlink to correct this: `cd ~/.electra && ln -s electra.conf Electra.conf`


[23-Jan-19 04:56 AM] DRE#7875
@cipi where i can find electra.conf in barterdex


[23-Jan-19 04:57 AM] cipi#4502
electra.conf is the config file of the wallet... it is located in the datadir, where wallet.dat and blockchain-data is also located


[23-Jan-19 04:58 AM] cipi#4502
i would change the code of the daemon, so that the config file is named `electra.conf` and not `Electra.conf`

[23-Jan-19 05:00 AM] DRE#7875
@cipi okay i will try i changed the name it was with big E


[23-Jan-19 05:00 AM] cipi#4502
if you just rename the file, it will not work, because the wallet expects the file to be named Electra.conf... this must be changed in the code


[23-Jan-19 05:01 AM] SHossain#0007
rpcpassword needs to be defined if i remember correctly


[23-Jan-19 05:01 AM] DRE#7875
@cipi okay, because same file on Linux works fine


[23-Jan-19 05:02 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
coins/coins has
```JSON
"confpath": "USERHOME/.electra/Electra.conf"
```
so, I'm thinking `E` will be needed because js is case-sensitive, no?


[23-Jan-19 05:02 AM] DRE#7875
its normal, with big E


[23-Jan-19 05:02 AM] cipi#4502
yes, because confpath is evaluated correctly under Linux, but not in Windows


[23-Jan-19 05:03 AM] cipi#4502
but if the file is calles electra.conf, confpath can be removed

this is in barterDex coin


[23-Jan-19 05:04 AM] cipi#4502
yes... if the wallet would use electra.conf, confpath can be removed from the barterdex config... it is the best solution


[23-Jan-19 05:06 AM] cipi#4502
i can also remove confpath from coin database for ECA and let the people deal with it... either the devs correct this in the code, or the users make symlinks


[23-Jan-19 05:06 AM] DRE#7875
So to understand, I change nothing in Electra folder and remove only the electra path in BarterDex coin?


[23-Jan-19 05:07 AM] cipi#4502
yes, if you remove confpath and the config file is called electra.conf, it will work... even under Windows


[23-Jan-19 05:08 AM] cipi#4502
`"name": "electra"` is the paramater that normally tells BarterDEX where to find the config
it is `~/.$name/$name.conf`


[23-Jan-19 05:10 AM] DRE#7875
thank you, sorry for my english,

so I changed the Electra.conf to electra.conf in appdata and now change the line "confpath" in BarterDex Coin: "USERHOME / .electra / Electra.conf" to "confpath": "


[23-Jan-19 05:10 AM] cipi#4502
remove the line confpath completely...


[23-Jan-19 05:11 AM] cipi#4502
but as i said: the wallet expects the file to be named Electra.conf... it must be either corrected in the source code of the wallet or you will have to make a symlink electra.conf -> Electra.conf


[23-Jan-19 05:13 AM] cipi#4502
or make a copy... so that you have 2 files with the same content, one named `electra.conf` and the other `Electra.conf`


[23-Jan-19 05:13 AM] cipi#4502
but best is to fix this in the source code of the wallet, so that it uses `electra.conf`


[23-Jan-19 05:15 AM] DRE#7875
cant create second Electra conf windows says its already available


[23-Jan-19 05:15 AM] DRE#7875

just pop here


[23-Jan-19 05:20 AM] Jenova#8529
so i tested the Barterdex App on linux, all good. Electra is well added and setup in the Dex.


[23-Jan-19 05:20 AM] cipi#4502
i think best is if i remove confpath from github, so that it does not interfere...


[23-Jan-19 05:20 AM] Jenova#8529
on Windows App, the path is different so it doesn't recognize it


[23-Jan-19 05:22 AM] Jenova#8529
i tried to change the path in BarterDEX\CoinsDB\coins but it's reset at launch


[23-Jan-19 05:22 AM] cipi#4502
yes, confpath paramater has problems in Windows... saw this many times... so best is to not use it


[23-Jan-19 05:22 AM] Jenova#8529
ok


[23-Jan-19 05:22 AM] cipi#4502
it is reset, because it is in github


[23-Jan-19 05:22 AM] Jenova#8529
so if removed from github/code
the app will find the .conf itself or do we have to add it manually?


[23-Jan-19 05:23 AM] Jenova#8529
yes i saw that


[23-Jan-19 05:23 AM] cipi#4502
BarterDEX uses the paramater `name` to find the config file... in Linux it then looks for `~/.$name/$name.conf`


[23-Jan-19 05:24 AM] cipi#4502
confpath was added later because there are coins that don't name the datadir the same as the config file... no idea why


[23-Jan-19 05:25 AM] Jenova#8529
ok


[23-Jan-19 05:25 AM] Jenova#8529
so remove it from code should solved the problem


[23-Jan-19 05:25 AM] cipi#4502
ok, will remove it

`sorry for the delay`
Some days I really wonder what kind of setup one has that a PR merge to 1 of 50 repos in 2 minutes time constitutes a "delay" :trollface:

lol ... wasn't a delay, i just made the PR minutes ago, but wanted it to be merged so that we can see if it works...

what is the problem?


[23-Jan-19 12:43 PM] DRE#7875
@cipi I can add ECA to BarterDex, no problem. In the settings I add ECA to StartUp, works.

1. Then I add ECA on the dashboard, works.
Now, when I restart BarterDex, I have to add ECA to the dashboard, it will not automatically appear.

2. if I have added eca to the dashboard, then i will send my ECA to BarterDex address and they will not arrive

i am not familiar with the GUI, since i don't use it, but afaik the coins you add are not saved permanently... but i think there is a way to do it, but i don't know
what does blockexplorer say? can you show me the txid/smartaddress of ECA?

@cipi just wanted you to be aware, that when enabling Snowgem via advanced in Agama, in Litemode, no valid backend servers can be found. Not sure if hostname changed or what, but wanted you to be aware


[18-Feb-19 07:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
@cipi they changed their ticker to XSG a while ago, and that may have something to do with it, electrumX probably needs updating. maybe they changed electrumx hostname/ports when the ticker changed

@dukeleto https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/electrums/XSG tells me the XSG servers are `
[{"electrumsvr.snowgem.org":50001},{"electrumsvr2.snowgem.org":50001}]`, but those are not run by me
they are both down, it seems... i think we should remove them if they are not working

@Ridz , does the clone have a public repository? Any changes in the coin APIs that you know of? Have you tried adding the ETH clone into our `coins` file and how did it go if you did?

I presume with a JSON field to indicate it is an ETH clone and another to specify its infuria servers, it wouldnt be too hard to add support

For mm2 the presence of the "etomic" field in the `coins` file switches us into the ETH mode.

kk! @artem.pikulin will later add a definitive answer on these. Meanwhile, @Ridz , I think it'll help if you could give us an example of the Web3 URLs that ought to be used with EGEM.

any CURL request like for infuria would/should work like ```curl -X POST \

@Ridz Hi, to swap EGEM with other coins you also have to deploy etomic swap smart contract (https://github.com/artemii235/etomic-swap) to EGEM network, I can see `0xc9360dC1CACCf570B0A73404C7Ba2eca465AC58F` address in your PR (https://github.com/jl777/coins/pull/277/files#diff-cb00e2d742e5694f0c91a60aa30a9431R2), but the source code is not validated on explorer: https://explorer.egem.io/addr/0xc9360dc1caccf570b0a73404c7ba2eca465ac58f. Could you please add contract source to help us be sure that it would work?

We have discussed for a long time that #dev-tradebots & #dev-marketmaker are pretty much the same thing. I think we agreed to merge these channels long time ago but it was never done.

I'll move this channel to the "archived" category and we can start using the remaining #dev-marketmaker channel.

If you disagree let me know and we can always undo this change or find an alternative solution.
