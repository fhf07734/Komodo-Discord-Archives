50 KMD up for graps for someone who is able to guess the seed correctly. We will show the first clue soon on the stream.

Instructions:
 – Guess the seed and add it to your AtomicDEX wallet
 – If the seed is correct you will login to a wallet with 50 KMD in it
 – transfer it to your own wallet

Seed info
 – only words, written IN ALL CAPS
 - separated by space (like normally)

What "claim rewards" button mean and what does it do?


[26-Feb-21 11:29 AM] t0sma#0368
When you have more than 10KMD you get active rewards


[26-Feb-21 11:29 AM] Cypher#9999
Can we ask how we will be working on marketing Delton, KMD has an awareness issue, it used to be a top 50 coin however it has slowly lost attention with time, how would we go about turning this around ? 
How can the community help with this?


[26-Feb-21 11:30 AM] t0sma#0368
it's 5% APY and you have to claim it at least one a month


[26-Feb-21 11:30 AM] ZokiZok  $ARRR#9247
in atomicdex wallet the KMD wallet, you can claim reward when you hold 10 or more KMD.

can we expect in next versions to have compatibilty with hardware wallet and access to all KMD assetchains (like VOTE for example for Notary node election)


[26-Feb-21 11:40 AM] cipi#4502
it is, you need to reset asset config under settings if you used atomicdex before


[26-Feb-21 11:40 AM] ZokiZok  $ARRR#9247
is the Remote Procedure Call RPC a secret in settings and what can i do with it?

Regarding Cypher's question on marketing and related to AtomicDex: Feel like we are not getting noticed amongst the other "dexes", but someone just said some magic words there like "sort of p2p torrent exchange. For money. On blockchain", in other words something that sounds completely different to your avg crypto enthusiast.

[26-Feb-21 11:43 AM] lightspeed393#5403
it should be kept a secret from others. It's so you could send commands to mm2 without using the app.


[26-Feb-21 11:43 AM] Dio#0919
Could I ask a couple of questions please ?
1) is any way for the US citizens to run dex in desktop mode ?
2) Is bitcoinz available in this version? I still cannot find it in the desktop latest beta.
Thanx

please do it's the new major communication. 

MM2 was always a placeholder with no equity intentions or power behind it unfortunately. It's advancement became a perfect opp to redub it with it's own title and PR teams helped us develop a strong equity strategy around it. 

We've also deprioritized Antara as a set of terminology and are instead talking about Custom Contract - Custom Consensus on Komodo Independent Smart Chains is the best terminology moving forward.

yes


[26-Feb-21 02:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
Back in the first wave of ASICs after Avakons, small single chip ASICs could come on USB sticks


[26-Feb-21 02:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
and inserted into large USB boards


[26-Feb-21 02:07 PM] daemonfox#6136
Then a CLI app on Linux or Windows could detect them all and mine

The old Gridseeds for LTC and many other miners had USB interfaces rather than an onboard controller like large enterprise ASICs now

☝ This is true @Well Done  - your seed your coins whichever the platform. 

Atm there are some subtle variations between mobile and desktop - mobile does not have everything listed that desktop does so if you log in and can't find your EMC2 for example no need to worry it's just because that or a different coin isn't enable on mobile yet.

We did, and def feeling like we're continuing to build this new strong syndication network which didn't exist before. 

To dovetail another answer and talk about new to marketing project - every month is a sprint with a specific theme, goal, and set of OKR's in mind for the first half of the year.  
https://blog.komodoplatform.com/en/explore-komodo-marketing-roadmap/

Next month we'll be seeking to become active on desirably at least a dozen different platforms besides twitter that we aren't already. 

@Churro just stepped up to take care of reddit which is one day already before the month is starting - the biggest issue is getting some dedicated people to champion these. 

Telegram and CrpytoNotification networks are high on our list to work out this scheme as well (things like blockfolio and CMC calednars etc)

[27-Feb-21 10:25 AM] tolken#2655
@Nora Gretz when next one?


[27-Feb-21 10:27 AM] squidcell#1363
If someone knew your IP address, could they flood a taker and cause the taker to lose money?


[27-Feb-21 10:28 AM] squidcell#1363
I.e., interrupting a swap?


[27-Feb-21 10:31 AM] squidcell#1363
This is mainly from the support item that says you must both remain online, otherwise there is a risk of cancellation as a maker, or loss of funds as a taker.


[27-Feb-21 10:33 AM] squidcell#1363
But that could feasibly turn a simple flood attack into a direct monetary loss for a taker, right?


[27-Feb-21 10:37 AM] tolken#2655
You could interrupt, but I don’t see how it could lead to loss.


[27-Feb-21 10:38 AM] squidcell#1363
Ah.  Is the fourth note in the 'support' section of AtomicDEX app  incorrect, then?


[27-Feb-21 10:38 AM] Audo#5667
there's a way to blacklist IPs and bad players – so the nodes know to avoid such spammers – a link to the full answer was posted here yesterday but I don't have that handy right now


[27-Feb-21 10:38 AM] squidcell#1363
Ah. thanks, @Audo

[27-Feb-21 10:43 AM] RNI#2666
if someone guesses the phrase, he needs to select revover wallet to get access or how do you import the phrase?


[27-Feb-21 10:44 AM] Audo#5667
yes, you need to recover a custom seed and login to the wallet, and send to your wallet

Does Komodo have a team scaling leadership plan?  What I mean is -- there's a decent chance you'll need to grow quickly.  Do you have something in place to handle that?

KMD is the perfect platform for an independently-valued stablecoin.  What I mean is, one that takes multiple fiats and cryptos into account, and is a representation of the mean of the larger market (by cap).

Verus is a project developed on Komodo ecosystem they have staking rewards.
I guess Komodo father's stuff🤣🤣🤣


[27-Feb-21 11:29 AM] Jcharming#2693
honest answer - we are building and going through some significant growing pains atm. 
@Audo has organized marketing pushes into monthly sprints surrounding topics like this - next month in March for example there is a push to find and cultivate a team of SM managers to be present on a dozen or more so important channels. 

@ca333 is on the lookout for more talent to add to the development team all the time - blockchain talent is limited as it's a new sector and it's a complicated niche with high demand and low supply

@PTYX & @polycryptoblog handle biz so well that they have a backlog list and Komodo is never going to run out of opportunities.

@Sdunbar just gotta have a good game plan to ensure there’s some good DOGE volume when DogeDex launches. Would hate for users not be able to do some good trading on day one. Doge users in particular might be really confused by empty orderbooks.

I see DOGEDEX now says available in the google play store and wondering is there any difference between Atomic Dex and DogeDEX?


[01-Mar-21 08:17 AM] cipi#4502
i uses the same https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API and the same network, just a different GUI
don't know about the exact coin list, but i will try... i see it is also available through Aurora Store on GrapheneOS... nice


[01-Mar-21 08:19 AM] c2k#6034
just asking bc i only want to download 1 of them


[01-Mar-21 08:32 AM] cipi#4502

It mentions chainzilla.io on the playstore for Dogedex. Are they related to Komodo in some way?


[01-Mar-21 09:31 AM] PTYX#6840
Chainzilla is my company, I used it to publish the app. It was faster than opening a new company and publishing under a dogeDEX company for example.

Same netid as atomicdex, so in theory every adex coin is also available on dogedex I assume? Cc @PTYX

What's the difference between atomicdex and dogedex??


[01-Mar-21 03:59 PM] PTYX#6840
dogeDEX is a branded dex built on AtomicDEX core


[01-Mar-21 04:00 PM] PTYX#6840
no difference in the technical level


[02-Mar-21 12:01 AM] Mitos.lthn#8324
Two separate projects? What Benefit will it have komodo from this? What if all users go to dogedex?

shared liquidity, fees collected from both

Good morning, I am trying to am trying to get my csv to report. my original wallet on android will not update, I can still view trading history but not balance showing. I re-installed the wallet on an i Phone and there's no history at all but I have the balance showing. I don't see an export option on the android phone.

So it's possible to have the same account in the desktop and smartphone at the same time?? does it sync the trades ? that would be great because can't keep open my laptop 24/7


[03-Mar-21 06:07 AM] phm87#7395
I did it between 2 AtomicDEX-API, you have many possibilities to run into troubles but if you pay attention, it can works. i did it a while ago but it worked (trades of each one were visible on the other one). I stopped doing it because you can easily run into troubles and it increases the surface attack (the private key is present on 2 devices)


[03-Mar-21 11:41 PM] samurai321#0681
yeah, i guess my question was wrong. i mean to ask, can you move directly from desktop to mobile or you have to recreate the orders?


[04-Mar-21 08:01 AM] jansako#3330
AFAIK the open orders are local. Or at least they used to be for sure.
