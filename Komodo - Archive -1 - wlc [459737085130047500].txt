remove the space in front of you and you will be automatically sucked into that space. a nuclear mass reactor that hyper drives the object in any direction at almost the speed of light. that is how you time travel forward

too much to explain = except it would take a lot of mass or energy - so a mass/energy repeater would need to be created like poles of a magnet - energy would need to be reused it would circulate around the machine

To clarify our previous email, the date of the coin delisting announcement is 9 October 2018 and trade markets are now closing. The last day the coins will be on the exchange will be 11 November 2018, you have until this date to withdraw any balances to a compatible wallet.

Anyway will try

Dont worry, you still have 2 weeks, They will not keep any WLC.  Metaphilibert is the one who bought the licence to get WLC in Cryptopia...All the coins that are not claim will go to Metapilibert wallet, Please Metaphilibert  make sure thats the case.  They will not keep a single WLC...I am  travelling  and I am builidng the bus time machine. The reason I dont give any update as I am not time waster of your time , as soon I get the money to build the bus I will. I promise, you have my word of President of Komodo


[28-Oct-18 04:11 AM] MR_President#6999
WLC  will be a success,  WLC will not die  even when I am dead You know why? because  there is a book  and  songs what will be the  trip like and someone in the future  will read it and beleive on it if I am not successful,  but I will try.. once I am rich ....I will make a movie and buy land to build all necessary to build our transpotime21bus

I don''t have the possibility to test before tomorrow but @here please try to remove your wlc from cryptopia.
It will be not be possible after the 11th of November, date of delisting

There is one wat you can make more money than Crypto when  it goes stream! and  its having the best domains big companies will buy from you!   but they are all gone.  Check  it out!  googlecoin.com,  facebookcoin.com ,  HSBCcoin.com. Check all the banks, airliines, superstore, anything that is big companies, and add coin at the end of their domain,  You will not find anything,  they are all taken,  The owners of thses domains will be millionaires


[16-Jan-19 08:22 AM] MR_President#6999
I bought some of the best ones in the year 2013


[16-Jan-19 08:23 AM] MR_President#6999

My philosophy ‚Äúmore work and less speak‚Äù  we cannot  speak with something to talk about , not like 90 per cent of project that all they do is talk and taking the money from people and will never deliver anything !I will never talk when I dont have the funds to build the bus, So I am patient and will not take money from not one and deliver nothing, I m the opposite, one day I will  be rich and will build the bus with the help of some appreciated friends from Komodo Community but till then I will not bother you and let you do what you love more , in the meantime I am working working in preparing things once I have the funds, You will see the Future with me, and Roberto will see the past with Cleopatra üòÉ

I know there is a list of people who are eager to be Transpotimers, but to be a real Transpotimer, you need to believe in this project, be active and not just wait to get on the bus without contributing anything to deserve it. Only a few people on that list will get onto the bus as you need to prove that you are dignified enough to be called a Transpotimer.

[11-Sep-19 03:34 PM] MR_President#6999
Perhaps sooner than later and it could happen than the bus will travel from the future to the present day before the bus was built, thats a possibility, because this project  exist, think about it,the genuine project with a strong heart existence means that it has the potential to affect the future without even being built yet but to be seen, detected in some way even if not already detected now but in the future to come back to us for some  paradox reason, and there we will see the real transpotimers coming off the bus


[11-Sep-19 03:39 PM] MR_President#6999
I have done all I could to make that paradox a reality , I can not do more, now let the future decide the present, my intelligence and good  will have reached its  top level. the level destiny has decided for me to reach. Alone can not do more

How many project have disappered collecting money from ICO...90 per cent? all these  call potencial projects never started anything with all the money they collected NOTHING!! WLC project did not collect any money no a single dollar and  we are still here alive and you can call us crazy and whatever but  no deceivers and scammers like those 90  per cent of projects that run away with your money!  All I did was to start and not to end....I will never end because Tranpotime21bus will never let the end ever to end!

At this point, going to the past seems to be a myth but going to the future was a supposed myth many years ago until now where it is extremely possible from many collected physicists minds. Looking forward to what the future will bring to this grande project that is wlc and its success! üôÇ

On Friday 1st November, we will have a new chain and provide a 10:1 token swap to all existing holders.  Old supply 210 millions , New Supply 21 millions. 

Failure to comply will result in the said tokens being lost without any SWAP.

As you know there will be two buses, The reason for the two buses is so that one could be used as backup if the need to rescue the first bus in the past or the future arises, So we need two teams I can trust..so the driver of the other bus has to be of my entire trust, @metaphilibert  you will be the driver of the other bus, you can chose the members of the team, conditon to tavel in the bus has to have done something for the project and at the time of travelling needs to have 30K WLC21 in their wallet so we know are real fans and supporter of the project, there will have to be people in the Komodo community, so half of the team will be in one bus and the other half will be in the other bus, @Madmats you are in my team and will be the co-pilot of the Bus ( second driver and second in command) you are in my team and @Alice  and @ca333  in my team too, @kolo and @phm87 will be in @metaphilibert  I don't want perberts  in my bus lol.  Please no porno stars in the bus, we will have plenty of sex with ancient and slaves women in the past, and with robot women in the future,  metaphilibert you chose your team but will only 11 members as 10 will have to be specialists. Professor will be also in my bus,  Academy partner of Professor will be in Metaphilibert bus


[16-Nov-19 11:31 PM] MR_President#6999
I know there are a list of 24 transpotimer than register in 2017 but you can not get in the bus without moving a finger for the project , it would not be fair and will damage the project

Here is the reason why the below transpotimer in my bus are worth to be in my bus, Metaphilibert will give the reason for his bus members:

1)Madmats ------> Roberto Team why? my left hand full support and looking after the media all the time, very active

2)CA333 ------> Roberto Team Bus, why? provided full support and provided a key elememt to the project

3)Alice ------> Roberto Team Bus why? provied full support and created a video for us

4)House ------> Roberto Team Bus why? provied full support and let me write in his magazine 3 years ago where the idea of transpotime21bus was born


5)Artik123 ------> Roberto Team bus why? provided full support, created a real logo and hanging down on his wall, also he offered something very nice to the project I couldnt accept


6)Yassinkomodo ------> Roberto Team Bus why? provided full support and twitter our project and he was a great friend in bad times


7)Shossain ------> Roberto Team bus why? Provided full support and father of WLC21

Metaphilibert is a great man and full support from the beggining and is a person I can put my life on his hands thats why he is the commander of the other bus ad he will have to provide also a reason why the people on his list are worth to be called transpotimer and  to have a ticket for the bus

I meant it was already built, or it will be built in the future & someone from the future did travel back using the bus & confirm it will be built
I'm also interested in space-time travelling & have a few questions to ask, if this project is serious.


[22-Nov-19 12:41 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
or if the busses aren't being built yet, then what is the current progress on the theory research ?


[22-Nov-19 11:08 AM] MR_President#6999
@PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator my question to you is the following, how many projects have  completed or deliverved anything? How many of them is  a joke? I guess 95 per cent of them as they took your money and run away with it without even starting!  those are the real jokers! We are very serious and I have a team who is loyal to this project and above all decent! we started 2017 and we are evolving and still here not collecting a single penny and still here after 3 years...we will build the bus for sure, we need funds, we have a great professor and as soon we have the funds we will fund him to build the time machine and at the same time building the two buses structures! we are not a joke, we are still here...the jokes are the one we all sponsored and run away with our money. We will build it!


[22-Nov-19 11:12 AM] MR_President#6999
Our project is different, not boring , no doing the same staff as all project out there, most will fail as they dont have imagination or ideas. just only to create a project to make money without personality! My team have a personality, real transpotimers who did something for the project.


[22-Nov-19 11:12 AM] MR_President#6999
We did a free ICO not taking money! that is decency!


[22-Nov-19 11:14 AM] MR_President#6999
We are not here for the money, we are here to build a bus time machine! Look all the project ouit there...how many coins they keep for themselves 85 per cent or more?


[22-Nov-19 11:19 AM] MR_President#6999
We have delivered free to the community more than half...and the team dont have much more than anyone who got free wlc, the same with me I have less  than 5 per cent. I have worked my bollets on this and spent a lot of money from my own pocket making aware of this project


[22-Nov-19 11:21 AM] MR_President#6999
The roadmap will be publish in December


[22-Nov-19 11:24 AM] MR_President#6999
We dont want transpotimers who only want to have popcorns in the bus, we want real transpotimers, real beleivers who do something for the project, I want peace and harmony in all we do, we are doing things and at the monent we are doing a swap to have a better coin where you can mine it and stalk it with a new algo

well I'm only interested in the theory part of time travelling, that's what I'm asking, I don't really care about how the coins are distributed though
> how many projects have  completed or deliverved anything? How many of them is  a joke?
I agree most of them are
> Our project is different, not boring , no doing the same staff as all project out there
I'm sorry, no offense, but that's what said by the others 95% projects too üòÖ 
> We are very serious...we started 2017 and we are evolving
Then what were your team progress on theoretical research during the past 2 years ? That's what I'm interested in, please answer straight into my question.


[22-Nov-19 01:48 PM] MR_President#6999
As I said all will be reveal beginning of December so its only less than 10 days , it will be very specific , you will have all the details there


[22-Nov-19 02:40 PM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
ok I'll wait till December 1st then.
But if it doesn't answer my question, then I'll keep asking.

Only 5 days left for the swap, if you don't swap your WLC for WLC21 you lost them

whoever is in your bus you will have to describe what they have done like I have done in my list. We dont want parasits, we want real transpotimers

But I got your point Mr President


[26-Nov-19 12:27 AM] MR_President#6999
My point is I know we have been too generous, kind and of course too naive for being extremely good to the rotten ones, I have seen who sold all their WLC that was given for free ,its good you sell and trade but sell all and then do or say bad things a I will not tolerate those to be in the bus, we have been treated unfairly and know who they are  . they will be hunted by karma in their life. Life is not free for their actions, you do wrong you will pay your wrong, if you live with no morals you live without a soul and all your friends will be just non existence as sooner or later will know the kind of person they are behind the mask


[26-Nov-19 12:44 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
if you made WLC a minable coin, with no premine, and reasonable emission curve, then that wouldn't happen


[26-Nov-19 07:25 AM] SHossain#0007
premine is there to airdrop the coins to existing holders at 10:1


[26-Nov-19 07:25 AM] SHossain#0007
rest of them are minable


[26-Nov-19 07:25 AM] SHossain#0007

I think there will be an update soon for agama so don't need to rush and with one electrum it is OK

Ah phm it is very easy
You need a node with wlc21 running and launch a quite light electrum service

A quote from the video:
> We are not a castle in the air type of project. This is not a project that has no realistic goals.
Well among all things, time travelling is 1 of the most unrealistic ever ...
I'll be waiting for the publication of your scientific papers, research results & documented videos then, as stated in the video.


[02-Dec-19 02:43 AM] MR_President#6999
everything is unrealistic till it happens! You can tell how unrealistic was Jules Verne but now all he wrote is very realistic.   Time travel is not real now but will be tomorrow


[02-Dec-19 03:16 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
it's a bad comparison & Jules Verne's novel has nothing to do with time travel, deep-sea creatures & time travelling are not the same thing ... What makes time travel practically impossible for humans is the acceleration to nearly the speed of light has to be done slowly, otherwise instant acceleration to the speed of light would crush time-travellers by their own weight, but slow acceleration means you need a lot of energy to achieve the speed of light.


[02-Dec-19 03:27 AM] MR_President#6999
If you want to argue for the sake of arguing will not lead anywhere, I did not say he has something to do with time travel, what I said what he wrote in his book was unrealistic on his time but its not anymore now. The same with time travel now is unrealistic but tomorrow will not as we will have the tools to make it a reality, Don't manipulate my words. Travelling to the moon was unrealistic then but not anymore. Time travel is unrealistc now but tomorrow not anymore , its a matter of time, as science progressing so the possibility of travelling in time

> The same with time travel now is unrealistic but tomorrow will not. Time travel is unrealistc now but tomorrow not anymore , its a matter of time, as science progressing so the possibility of travelling in time
I'm arguing because your comparisons are off. Just because travelling to the space, or deep-sea diving was not doable in the past, it is now doable, doesn't imply that time travelling will be possible in the future (btw this is what people call "hasty generalization", or "over-extension", a type of informal fallacy). 
> Don't manipulate my words
Lol I just quote what you said üòÖ 
And yes arguing with me will lead to nowhere, just show me the scientific papers, research results & documented videos, I'll be patiently waiting.
But I see no scientific paper, research result & documented video published so far, so there isn't any progress during the past 2 years since the coin was created ?


[02-Dec-19 04:24 AM] MR_President#6999

I was pointing out what is off with your comparison (it's up to you to acknowledge it or not), and asking a legit question on the progress of scientific papers, research results & documented videos. Is that considering annoying people ?


[02-Dec-19 04:57 AM] MR_President#6999
I am familiarizing myself with your personality, I am minding my body language to protect my energy and focusing into good things, I did answer your question and you still in the same loop of comparition, I will not let anyone to drain my energy into stupidity discussion or raise my ire by limiting the amount of time spent in your loop, its pointless, loops are endless circle, you are invited to stay there, I have better things to do that spinning around the same thing.  ...only you set a time limit..where you want to go not only with your body but with your mind...Cleopatra is waiting for me in her milky bath..

Again, I was asking what did I say that doesn't make sense, or stupid, I'll kindly explain
> I did answer your question and you still in the same loop of comparition
where did you answer my question ? I was asking a question on the progress of scientific papers, research results & documented videos (or any progress during the past 2 years), and where could I find them if there is any. 
You are just avoiding my questions ...


[02-Dec-19 05:12 AM] MR_President#6999
the answer is in the video if you listen to it with attention.


[02-Dec-19 05:21 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
lol why don't you just answer my question directly, I'm asking  if there is any scientific paper, research result or documented video published yet ? in the video it just mention that there will be scientific papers, research results or documented videos published. 
So I assume no scientific paper, research result or documented video has been published so far ? ok I'll be waiting for them to be published & peer reviewed

All question can be answer when they are done with good faith and spirit....The bus will be built  as soon as we get the  funds for it and as result only reports can ne done if thats the case...all takes time and more when we are project with rely on  honesty and not stealing money from  anyone...I believe in Karma and as such we will survive if we do everything with honesty....what we have done the last two years ..to survive and be alive before get  a much better website and a new air. We have been let down by many and many others has kept the project alive thanks to kind people.....I have been offered money as a gift for the project and I did not accept not just $10K but $40K before the bum of 2017 a very good spirit...this is the kind of people who make a good transpotimer! no the one who sell all his wlc at the first chance to get $100  and shit on us.... I will not take money from not one. not even from angels.......we will only use the funds we have once we get it trading and deliver to buy a bus and for professor to get what he needs....all that is said in the video roadmap...we said : WILL have reports, no that we HAD reports or if We had done something .....We have the ideas and principles how to start the investigation and experiments....you can not do that without money.....Only good spirits can bring this project to a good end...I am trying to get it to an exchange......... A good person who blindly wanted to be a Transpotimer  is making it possible to trade in atomidex, another one very kind heart made the new WLC21 with the help of another nice man! they did not ask for anything ...while others sold all their WLC and did nothing for this project....I like to live with my conscious clean and I will build the bus.. we will build the bus

the answer I'm looking for is for example how are you going to locate the wormhole if there is any, once enter the wormhole how passengers on the bus can sustain the acceleration from the wormhole, may be the questions are too specific, I'll be waiting  for the papers & experimental results to be released

Guys I am in talk with an exchange and we have to wait to have it there as its an exchange that was born this year but looks promising, all takes times and more a project like this that will make the difference .


[03-Dec-19 12:57 AM] MR_President#6999
We will be in atomidex anyways that its the future and we are the future üôÇ


[03-Dec-19 01:05 AM] MR_President#6999
all exchange ask above $10K hahaha I remember Iwhen we put WLC in Cryptopia for $1000 lol that was old times.  We have to bet for the future decentralised exchanges safer and the Future. Cryptopia was hacked... Its stupid to pay that amount of money and then get hacked...we are not in a hurry we have the time in our hands


[03-Dec-19 01:08 AM] MR_President#6999
The key is to adapt what present  time offer us so we can conquer the past and the future


[06-Dec-19 09:52 AM] MR_President#6999
we are securing our place in Verus wallet with the new WLC21.  in the next update WLC will not be available that was very important you did the swap, We have given 2 month for that and I was kind enough to send private message to the people I know had WLC . I did all I could , in our twitter and TG and also once in General komodo in TG and DIscord

This is our website https://wlc-time.com/


[06-Dec-19 09:55 AM] MR_President#6999
Its in English and Spanish, Once we have all settle down we will introduce our project to the time travel community where people believe in time travel 100 per cent and its not only here to moan and argue just becuase they are not making money in any project and are only traders or money makers. This is to build a bus time machine...I promise  once we have the money we start building it, but i need a real community who participate and do things not only watchers


[06-Dec-19 10:05 AM] MR_President#6999
We need to build a community of Time Travel...its like asking a vegetarian to eat meat...we can not ask people to believe in time travelling or they think this is either a fantasy or impossible. Its like believing in God or no....for some is a myth for others their meaning of life and whole passion.  I am not a beleive of any religion but does not make me to say they dont exist or start arguing. If you are not a beleiver of time travel  then this is not the right place for you...I would not be in a forum of religion as I dont beleive in it and respect it


[06-Dec-19 10:13 AM] MR_President#6999
We will move and bring the right people to create a community of peoole who get involved and passion about it....we can not  sell vegetable in a meat market

We gave WLC to some people promising they will do all and that and all they did was to sell their WLC. I will never mention names as its not my style


[06-Dec-19 10:21 AM] MR_President#6999
We are not going to fool naive generous anymore as crypto has proven its as cruel as the real life sometimes....The people from Crypto as not different from the people from the banks...They are the same...they are all humans as humas are capable of doing bad and good....Crypto was not created to free ourself for the rich people of the banks....thats all bulsshit! It new technology that will make life better in manty ways

Those who missed the migration process are unable to claim anything as WLC is delisted from Agama wallet and the new WLC21 will be listed...I have advertised in our WLC channels a few times for 2 months even in private to some of you, I could not do more


[18-Dec-19 06:16 AM] metaphilibert#0926
You can still use old verus agama but on native mode
Or with cli or qt wallet, WLC chain is still alive and still notarized for a few months

Hi! Has anyone got WLC21 working in native mode with latest verus wallet? On mine it loads forever and when  trying to "getinfo" from CLI it responds: "CLI response:

Stay with us we are still working...once all is complete we will bring real time traveller beleivers into this community....crypto traders just care money, they are not different than the banks.....We need a sea with fish not with sharks. We need a community of time travellers beleivers not crypto tradees that just care about exploiting projects and run to the next one...This is not about money...this is about getting funds for professor to start the beginning of time travelling


[16-Jan-20 12:43 AM] MR_President#6999
We are still working...we will work and we are planning to get awareness of our project to real genuine fans of time travellers, we all know we can not raise a  big community from crypto as 95  per cent just care about making money and the  dont give a damm sh8it about the rest if they can not make money quick. All we will get if this a scam , laugh If this and if that , can you prove all and bla bla bla....We need a community a real community that does not come here asking questions about if Time travel if possible and question of doubting all the time...its like you go to a religious forum and you have people denying the existence of God continuously , if you are in a forum of God and  religion you are there to talk good and positive things about God...no bad things or question where is God and his actions. I dont believe in God so I will never be in  a forum of God or related because I will deny all and ask questions why I dont believe in God but I respect it and I keep  myself out of those  forums and let them believe what they think is in their heart and mind as you can not change an idea that was put in their minds since they were born, you can never fight of change a strong believe not matter if is true or not.... For that reason we will get a community, a positive community that believe in time travelling and bring positive spirits,attitude and ideas no just question why this and why that, but  people who says we can do this and we can do that!  We need the right mindset to move forward

In a more serious point this project still alive, its a matter of time for tih project to lift up, could be a loop! just by the existence of this project make it more possibe the future transpotime21bus ccome to us before even has been built.

Now you seem to be locked in a timeline where the bus will not be released before at least 2 years (I don't remember exactly but it was just after covid-22 pandemia)

@MR_President do you accept an old transpotimer lost in time to get his right to swap?
I mean nobody can cheat as the swap was about sending all WLC coins to a end address, and receive WLC21 at 10:1 ratio
