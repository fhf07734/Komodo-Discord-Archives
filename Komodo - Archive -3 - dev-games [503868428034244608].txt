I talked to JL777 in #talk-other-topics  about the future of games on blockchain.

I firmly believe that games will work on the blockchain as well.  Of course we need funding and developers.

There are really good games on NEO and Ethereum already.  We on Komodo have the big advantage of scaling already now.

An example:

I'm a big football (soccer) fan, that's why this example. 
 
A simple football game.  A penalty shootout.  A tournament and everyone pays a small stake in the pool.  The winner of the tournament gets the pool at the end minus small fees.

I was already successful with Flash and HTML5 games.  With game sites and affiliates.  But the blockchain opens new doors for us.

The market is so big!


[22-Oct-18 03:06 AM] Seko#7408
Casino games, but also RPG games, everything is possible.  These games already exist, some are very complex.  But even simple games work.  Just like Flashgames a few years ago and applications today.


[22-Oct-18 03:10 AM] Seko#7408
There was once a simple penalty shootout that many fans from Europe played for their club.  It was very simple, but it still worked. 

The name of the game was „play for your club“.
 
The operator made money with Affiliate.

On the Blockchain you can earn money with fees.  And as an incentive for the game there are rewards, for example if you win.


[22-Oct-18 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
CASINO games is already being worked on

Might be worth doing a PoS instead of PoW so people can use coins to play instead of a few miners


[22-Oct-18 03:13 AM] Seko#7408
But the possibilities are greater.


[22-Oct-18 03:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Seko I could of of some help in some non-dev part somewhere. 😉


[22-Oct-18 03:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
find the devs.


[22-Oct-18 03:14 AM] Seko#7408
For which programming languages?


[22-Oct-18 03:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
whichever gives us the working game.


[22-Oct-18 03:17 AM] Seko#7408
Developers will need and a financing model.


[22-Oct-18 03:18 AM] Seko#7408
An ICO, Crowdfunding or whales...;)


[22-Oct-18 03:25 AM] Seko#7408
Or a game on the Blockchain which simulates the Blockchain technology.  A simulation game in which each player can make his own crypto currency.  Just an example, but you can really max out everything.

Oha! Very good idea already implemented, but anything is possible.


[22-Oct-18 03:32 AM] Seko#7408
There used to be an affiliate platform.  The name was Mochiads.  Every developer could host his games there and earn money with it.

Such a platform would also be possible.


[22-Oct-18 03:33 AM] Seko#7408
A review and trust portal, but this can also be implemented in Utrum.


[22-Oct-18 03:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
why not wait for CHIPS to be ready with CC and use that for games


[22-Oct-18 03:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is meant for games already.


[22-Oct-18 03:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that chain already exists


[22-Oct-18 03:40 AM] jl777c#5810
@sg777 is very slowly making progress but single player games of chance against the house is technically quite different than multiplayer


[22-Oct-18 03:40 AM] jl777c#5810
also, we cant stop a decentralized community from launching chains


[22-Oct-18 03:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree


[22-Oct-18 03:44 AM] jl777c#5810
and i imagine we will get a variety of emission plans, locked funds, airdrops, etc.


[22-Oct-18 03:44 AM] jl777c#5810
may the best chain win

As an example, this games as dApps are already running on the NEO blockchain:

launch a chain


[22-Oct-18 06:34 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Yup, this is my second mention about fantasy football. My friends describe the football season as 16 weeks of Christmas. Fantasy leagues and block chain go hand in hand like peas and carrots.  🥕


[22-Oct-18 06:34 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Unfortunately, the only thing I can make at the moment is suggestions.


[22-Oct-18 06:36 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
"American" football btw. 🏈


[22-Oct-18 08:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
Fantasy football on the blockchain in the US would be a juggernaut.


[22-Oct-18 08:34 AM] Seko#7408
And European football in Europe, I‘m sure. But we should bake smaller buns. ;)
A simple game for now.


[22-Oct-18 08:35 AM] actionslacks#4072
The added benefit would be the market you would create and the millions who could be on-boarded into the cryptosphere.


[22-Oct-18 08:39 AM] Seko#7408
Yes. Even now there are apps where the developers have implemented Fantasy Coins, which you can buy against FIAT.  Just not on blockchain.

I am sure that such a manager game can be financed by an ICO.  With the coins you can then build a stadium and environment, make transfers, etc.


[22-Oct-18 08:41 AM] Seko#7408
The best thing would be an interoperability coin for all games in the ecosystem...


[22-Oct-18 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
prices CC + oracles CC will let you use the blockchain to bet in fiat equivalent

good to hear!


[22-Oct-18 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
just ask if you need help with designing CC


[22-Oct-18 10:43 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
We were going to use previously other platform but Komodo seems to fit perfectly


[22-Oct-18 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
good to hear. doing a bit of an airdrop to KMD holders can also jumpstart your userbase


[22-Oct-18 10:43 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
Thanks James will for sure


[22-Oct-18 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
not a requirement, but people love airdrops


[22-Oct-18 10:44 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
Yes that is the idea


[22-Oct-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
a simple command line dice game is surprisingly popular. a well designed and fun to play game that is monetized via crypto should be quite the hit as long as it can maintain realtime performance


[22-Oct-18 10:45 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
We were going to use Elastos but the Komodo community is better and the technology we are looking for is here.


[22-Oct-18 10:47 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
Thanks James we will be here getting ideas.


[22-Oct-18 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
there was a long discussion on making the dice entropy cheat proof, even under reorg


[22-Oct-18 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and if you can determine game outcomes from 2 hashes, it is pretty solid and 512bits should be enough entropy for most game transitions


[22-Oct-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the best part is that it can have realtime (a few seconds) response


[22-Oct-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
and of course txfees in your coin


[22-Oct-18 10:51 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
We can make that game the first one on PIXDUM


[22-Oct-18 10:52 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
As you can see our ideas is for a Decentralized Gaming Platform, where all the games share the same coin


[22-Oct-18 10:52 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
So we can trade inside of the game with other Komodo assetchains


[22-Oct-18 10:53 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
And buy non-fungible assets


[22-Oct-18 10:53 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
Like weapons, powers, characters, and so on


[22-Oct-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems you will be using assets CC for tokens, oracles CC to get offchain data onchain, dice CC for RNG


[22-Oct-18 10:53 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
It will be like the REAL PLAYER ONE movie on Blockchain

[22-Oct-18 10:59 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
Yea @Seko this could be the killer application from Komodo


[22-Oct-18 11:00 AM] Seko#7408
In which language you program the games?


[22-Oct-18 11:01 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
I am not the main developer but I think those can be made on Unreal Engine


[22-Oct-18 11:02 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
We are going to make it agnostic an open to the most used platforms.


[22-Oct-18 11:02 AM] Seko#7408
@Nacho Figx I‘m sure, a gaming platform on a blockchain launches a rocket to the moon.


[22-Oct-18 11:02 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
So we eliminate the barriers of entrance.


[22-Oct-18 11:03 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
Yes, there are so many people asking for this solutions but no one seems to see the potential here.

That is the next step. Really big vision!!! 👍🏼


[22-Oct-18 11:07 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
Our first step will be to build the platform on top of the Komodo Technology


[22-Oct-18 11:07 AM] Seko#7408
But realistic, I believe in that...


[22-Oct-18 11:08 AM] Nacho Figx#4221
Using Atomic swaps, a decentralized exchange inside the platform, lighting network for gaming purposes and so forth.

@jl777c for something like rogue is the seed that determines path(same seed, same user input, same outcome) defined by the user?


[05-Feb-19 10:44 PM] jl777c#5810
no


[05-Feb-19 10:48 PM] jl777c#5810
each rogue seed determines the exact game, so this is something that is based on future blockhash

Existing demonstrations are coded in C/C++ lanaguage, it's Crypto-Conditions code which is coded in C/C++.
So, it's not specifically what langauge is used for game(s).
Mix of languages is possible to code a crypto-conditions code, but it has to compile be linked as a library to komodo code.
An interpreter can be built for this, which I'm not sure how long it might take. In my opinion, the first thing needs is to sort and make libraries for crypto-conditions in other languages, including WASM and such.


[13-Feb-19 02:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but since you talk about games for web, it is possible to create a game engine, and let other languages use that to build games using it, including HTML5 games.


[13-Feb-19 03:44 AM] fredrik#2289
Great. Do you think there is a performance loss using interpreters builds. I’m using PHP a lot and do mainly text based games. No graphical stuff as per se.


[13-Feb-19 04:06 AM] Seko#7408
But theoretically it’s possible to connect Html5 games with the Blockchain or better program HTML5 games on a Blockchain. I have a good idea, can we talk about? I don’t know what do Pixdum, I don’t want a conflict, but maybe somebody interested in this idea...

How about a simple game like CryptoKitties?  Same game, our Komodo graphics.

Not because it was successful do, but to show that the system is still fast despite the game.

And to show that it's time to prove to everyone that Komodo is better than Ethereum.

why not make a rogueplayerdata visualizer + DEX

@grewalsatinder When an idea comes to fruition, I'll get involved.  I myself work with HTML5 and JavaScript games.  I publish and share them online.  Such a game distribution with an affiliate program on blockchain basis would be an idea for example.

Also one idea came to my mind was that if players play as a team in multiplayer games and their data would be collected together making their team valuable. in that way their would create value from successful gaming performance as together.  which could be direct statistic for sponsors if they want to be involved with esport events with these teams.

well, you can't natively compile within Unity, but basically, you create either C# dylibs that convert to native through Visual Studio, or just separate the  whole DLL and expose its methods in Unity.

@Cryptofist this is my friend and fellow indie developer @fmproductions who I've worked with before, has Unreal, C++ experience and knows how horrible my coding can be, and has the same bad taste in jokes.

[07-Mar-19 04:55 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Excellent!


[07-Mar-19 04:56 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions my new buddy @Cryptofist loves gamedevs and has a merchandise dream (yup, t-shirts and swag), but really wants to dig into things that are not-technical


[07-Mar-19 04:56 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Would you having your own chain and tokens built on that chain also be responsible for speed ? 
With Ethereum it would have just been tokens on their chain, so you're speed is partly based on how congested the ETH network is... Correct?


[07-Mar-19 04:57 AM] fmproductions#2904
cool stuff!


[07-Mar-19 04:57 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup yup


[07-Mar-19 04:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
now, the awesomeness is in the fact they got everything I already could think off, ONE tiny fugliness


[07-Mar-19 04:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I will pump meta data in a field called description, and use a guid in a field called name


[07-Mar-19 04:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so its cosmetically a pain for our perfectionist eyes, but I decided I can live with it


[07-Mar-19 04:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ok, so 6AM is the replacement that otherwise would be Solidity, but I figured out 2 hours ago, I can transpile Solidity version 3-4 to my beautiful 6AM syntax


[07-Mar-19 04:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Happy to see another games dev here 
Welcome @fmproductions 🙂


[07-Mar-19 05:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, maybe maybe a little bit of haxory there!


[07-Mar-19 05:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@grewalsatinder yeah, I invited him to come here to port my Unity stuff to Unreal


[07-Mar-19 05:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions ok, so 6AM looks like the following (still need to document it properly, but you'll get it right away)


[07-Mar-19 05:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Don't make me excited++
M already excited with all things you guys doing

@fmproductions these guys have made a retro game on their blockchain called Rogue.


[07-Mar-19 05:02 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions it was my first fisher price test


[07-Mar-19 05:03 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Added Blockchain to the original 1980 BSD Rogue game.

😃 

[07-Mar-19 05:03 AM] fmproductions#2904
how does the game use the blockchain tech?


[07-Mar-19 05:03 AM] Cryptofist#7504
You can exit the game by quiting, this will save your character stats and items in your pack as a token.


[07-Mar-19 05:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
anyways, 6AM has a decent lexi, no loops (no for/while), only an each to iterate through lists


[07-Mar-19 05:04 AM] Cryptofist#7504
In addition, your game gold is converted to ROGUE our coin on chain.


[07-Mar-19 05:05 AM] fmproductions#2904
so, basically your save file is decentralized stored in a pretty secure way?


[07-Mar-19 05:05 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions basically in a short version; a NFT (its called a non-fungible token), which in our terms would be a Serialized Object with at max 6 fields, that will always be unique

There's a built in exchange system a well, as marketplace to buy and sell your character tokens

superparse!


[07-Mar-19 05:07 AM] Cryptofist#7504
The gold conversion means you're getting paid in real currency to play.


[07-Mar-19 05:07 AM] fmproductions#2904
oh, interesting. 
I heard that blockchain data is permanently stored and not edited, I am wondering, with a lot of games or other applications for block chain, won't there ever be a storage issue?


[07-Mar-19 05:07 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist you'd be surprised, but we aren't that much into the money thingie

@fmproductions decentralization sir


[07-Mar-19 05:08 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Just a feature. 😉


[07-Mar-19 05:08 AM] jl777c#5810
ROGUE has unforgeable player data as there isnt even player data submitted. only the game keystrokes are


[07-Mar-19 05:08 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
also, le data is le petite


[07-Mar-19 05:08 AM] jl777c#5810
and from that the player data is recreated on each node to verify it


[07-Mar-19 05:08 AM] jl777c#5810
a dedicated chain per game should be enough. if not you can make a cluster of chains


[07-Mar-19 05:08 AM] fmproductions#2904
ah I see


[07-Mar-19 05:08 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

second, we create a production ready, lean mean skyrim machine of 6AM that can beat the crap out of any Solidity contract and use the solc low level api to transpile Ethereum DApp like logic into Komodo stuff

maybe along the way @jl777c might have a suggestion or two


[07-Mar-19 05:28 AM] jl777c#5810
without game events validation, how will it be ensured to avoid fake items?


[07-Mar-19 05:29 AM] jl777c#5810
seems the issuance of new item needs to be strictly controlled


[07-Mar-19 05:29 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup, but for that I got something special 😛


[07-Mar-19 05:29 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be a key part of the SDK


[07-Mar-19 05:30 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
do I hear a spec 😄


[07-Mar-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
part of the black box


[07-Mar-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
as without it, things dont really work right


[07-Mar-19 05:31 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yes, I was going to make a full spec since there wasn't any, but it is part of my plan (I just have an other name for it)


[07-Mar-19 05:32 AM] fmproductions#2904
Thank you for the gracious tip! appreciate it. May I ask where the tokens come from? does there need to be a wallet connection for those who tip for the bot?


[07-Mar-19 05:32 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions basically, all those questions will make sense after the initial setup. I'll write everything down somewhere tonight

alright!


[07-Mar-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
the tipbot is a centralized thing, you interact with it in the special channel


[07-Mar-19 05:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
certain parts are so easy, but all the jargon will make you search for days


[07-Mar-19 05:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@jl777c I only used it for demonstration purposes, I was shocked to see it, so I wanted to prepare my friend here for such things.


[07-Mar-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
for the dilithium CC, i implemented unique handles. so you register a handle with your pubkey (and dilithium bigpubkey)


[07-Mar-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
after that it would be possible for gui to "send" to a handle, which underneath is converted to the registration txid

[07-Mar-19 05:35 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions what testing strategy do you prefer? UT/E2E or some sexy TDD/BDD?


[07-Mar-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and the validation uses the registration txid to obtain the pubkey to use


[07-Mar-19 05:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions the CC usage refer to the smart contract modules, which are Crypto Conditions

the spherical combat system from Twilight Punkster Retro


[07-Mar-19 05:50 AM] fmproductions#2904
I think that might work!


[07-Mar-19 05:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
another possible one is to use the isometric one, that never made it

Example is the dragon punch - applying the "the bigger they are...", where the distance to ground (up to 3 meters) adds extra damage.

Of course, even when enemies are to smart, you can still outsmart them with secondary attacks - which cast effects like "stunned"

In Twilight Punkster, inverse kinematics are part of the combat system, specifically for combat: blocking reflexes and countering  (3/3)

I would probably prefer the approach of a 2,5d  game approach where the centers of the players make the plane the cam look on in an normal angle.


[07-Mar-19 05:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Wouldn't that be crap, as you will need to constantly lerp?


[07-Mar-19 05:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
because when you fight, and give an uppercut, the character flies up


[07-Mar-19 05:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
the only way to make that look good is to prep a bounding box with a calculated center and offset that with the camera angle


[07-Mar-19 06:00 AM] fmproductions#2904
sure, but cam movement is important no matter the game, so you might not be spared from that. 

street fighter has incredibly easy abstracted hitboxes, or better said: hit-rectangles, all manually set, 
to have a more automated approach, instead of manually crafting the hitbox animations, we can just place hitboxes on the separate body parts


[07-Mar-19 06:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
you probably have to fuck with easing curves just to make the camera move smoothly to prevent keyboard barfing


[07-Mar-19 06:00 AM] fmproductions#2904
one of the modern mortal combats does it like that


[07-Mar-19 06:00 AM] fmproductions#2904
probably


[07-Mar-19 06:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions yes, I do that already, even have a script for colliders that are attached per transform

Has been a while, so time for an update storm. So, what's new? A lot! Like hair that is not only so much better, but moves responsive to physics like movements but also in windy areas. Also, a full rewrite of inverse kinematics and foot placement.

Dana's beloved scooter has been upgraded to a low top speed vehicle with superior handling. Vehicles are using a similar mechanic like mounts have in fantasy RPG. The scooter can be upgraded too.

neat stuff! 

with that approach, we could also say that hits that specifically go to the head deal a little bit more damage.

camera angle would have a game design indication too though, one of the advantages of the side angle is that you can focus on movement in 2 axis. You could do that with isometric too, if you say that characters are not able to jump of course


[07-Mar-19 06:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
of course they can jump

[07-Mar-19 06:17 AM] fmproductions#2904
so basically, the yellow sphere, which could also be abstracted as capsules for some body parts, follow the positions of the body parts. so you have all of the hitboxes that will register damage moving automatically, without manually doing them for animations


[07-Mar-19 06:18 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
those hairphysics suck


[07-Mar-19 06:18 AM] fmproductions#2904
they sure do


[07-Mar-19 06:18 AM] fmproductions#2904
and the green box is calculated from the bounds of the hitboxes, not necessary if it is only a game with 2 players, but if you have more than that, it is an easy performance improvement for collision detection.


[07-Mar-19 06:19 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[07-Mar-19 06:21 AM] fmproductions#2904
perfect for performance.


[07-Mar-19 06:22 AM] fmproductions#2904
or rather, perfect as a mix of dynamic animation and performance


[07-Mar-19 06:22 AM] fmproductions#2904
it looks really nice. in a lot of fighting games, those things are just preanimated though, at least in the older ones


[07-Mar-19 06:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
no this is dynamic


[07-Mar-19 06:24 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
is half rigged, half shader, flavored trails


[07-Mar-19 06:24 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
regarding hit boxes, you need them to be dynamically scale based on the animation event

[07-Mar-19 06:25 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
like a dragonpunch has a massive force build up and should defy the physics engine for the opponent player


[07-Mar-19 06:25 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically inverse normal force times 10K but over multiple frames


[07-Mar-19 06:26 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
your fighting game


[07-Mar-19 06:26 AM] fmproductions#2904
I have seen someone animating smear frames into a 3d fighting game, quite interesting. 
but if you use the animation to exaggerate the sizes for let's say the fists for certain moves, that needs to be considered for the hitboxes too ofc.


[07-Mar-19 06:27 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
depends on the crazy move


[07-Mar-19 06:27 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
you don't want that for every move


[07-Mar-19 06:27 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
in fact, by default they are tiny


[07-Mar-19 06:28 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but based on the type, mid-attack you can then decide to switch to projectile or capsule


[07-Mar-19 06:28 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
like a kamehameha like attack, never projectile but capsule that grows and bangs  the opponent through Rigidbody

@Meyse - Was it you and your dice app that brought this wonderfully energetic fellow, @TwilightPunkster K64  into the fray?  He mentioned "A dice app on the blockchain" and it went from there.


[07-Mar-19 09:38 AM] Meyse#0952
@FishyGuts i think so, yes, showed him last week something from our upcoming project for KMDICE


[07-Mar-19 09:39 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Perfect example of why we ALL need to break out of our Bubbles.

If anyone has skills taking code and writing a manual for an SDK, for this specifically, reach out please. 
Have a great day everyone, I only slept 2 hours last night and I need a nap 😛


[07-Mar-19 12:45 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts always energetic. Gonna have a swift break for 2 maybe 3 hours and get some stuff done. Also I got  with me some help @fmproductions to port the sdk to Unreal (and happens to proficient in Unity too). BBL

@barv awesome slides - I'm a bit sceptic about the slides, but I am super biased of course as a game developer myself


[07-Mar-19 07:46 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
just some points for the "future" when you are going to interact with game developers;


[07-Mar-19 07:52 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
- don't use games as example that are from Rockstar; they are very hostile towards blockchain gaming and have been a driving force to hold back the industry in blockchain technology adoption. Ubisoft on the other hand, is something different :)
- usage of the Playstation console image is probably going to contradict, because technically speaking, Komodo would breach about five terms of service (there is a NDA regarding Playstation development so I can't be very specific), but if you read the public EULA, a real "ownership" of assets on the  console is not going to happen plus there is PSN that is required for distribution of games that would further limit the tech,


[07-Mar-19 07:54 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@barv Integration is probably covered with the RogueCC demo, but I'd probably would suggest a SWOT in blochchain development; the missing links for example.


[07-Mar-19 07:54 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
just my two cents

@TwilightPunkster K64 just for the option, please let me know if Apple TV could be used as games testing at some point 😅


[07-Mar-19 09:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
whenever and whatever that might be 😁


[07-Mar-19 09:41 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@grewalsatinder have never really testing gaming on Apple TV... However, I technically could test on any Samsung as I did some Multiscreen stuff, and I am pretty sure I could run Komodo on one xD  can you do some homework for me (I am currently compiling testing writing stuff), so can you check what specs AppleTV can do for any regular game? (like is it an iOS application)


[07-Mar-19 09:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Apple TV is arm64


[07-Mar-19 09:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so just like a mobile or iPad


[07-Mar-19 09:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, it's iOS varient


[07-Mar-19 09:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
On second thought it might not be good idea to run full blockchain on it.


[07-Mar-19 09:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
When we'll be able to make CC transactions via mobile, we would be able to use SPV servers


[07-Mar-19 09:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
then it'd be good idea to think of arm devices


[07-Mar-19 10:03 PM] Mylo#8306
thanks for feedback, especially with PSN/Rockstart stuff - we're blind to that side of the business of games.

[07-Mar-19 10:04 PM] Mylo#8306
apple TV1 you would have had a chance, gentoo used to run on it.   not sure about current gen atv


[07-Mar-19 10:06 PM] Mylo#8306
Yes the CC (tx signing) via mobile (SPV/lite mode) will make the next iteration of blockchain gaming go stratospheric.   we are currently looking at the "CEX for games" atm.


[07-Mar-19 10:06 PM] Mylo#8306
via rest api.  or you run your blockchain with your game (or embed it into the game).


[07-Mar-19 10:07 PM] Mylo#8306
only my opinion.    but CEX works still for a lot of ppl that want instant gratification of trading....same for games no doubt.  as long as assets/value can be transferred out of the hosted gaming env to your own wallet - it works.  like "save game" you own.


[07-Mar-19 10:37 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@grewalsatinder  that probably will give some issues with blockchain natively


[07-Mar-19 10:37 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
has there ever been made a browser POC of Komodo?


[07-Mar-19 11:11 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions most stuff done, got some extra support from the Komodo Team, we are gonna do this stuff on steroids

@fmproductions I made 6AM twice as fast and it basically can consume solidity sols now on the fly, and transpile them without solc


[07-Mar-19 11:39 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
honestly, I just inlined solc's low level


[07-Mar-19 11:39 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

this shit is on loop


[07-Mar-19 11:40 PM] fmproductions#2904
is this an interpreted or compiled language? have never tried my own before, 
and do you use another interpreter or parser for it, or completely your own?

interpreted


[07-Mar-19 11:41 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically abusing JS to act like what solidity does


[07-Mar-19 11:41 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Remix uses a JavaScript VM and in production it uses the Ethereum VM


[07-Mar-19 11:41 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, I thought, hey that shit is done in WebGL and in Meteor too


[07-Mar-19 11:42 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so I basically tore out the wrappers


[07-Mar-19 11:42 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
now, basically, in a madness kinda way


[07-Mar-19 11:42 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
you could just it as a Chrome Extension (utter useless)

mwuahhahahahahah


[07-Mar-19 11:44 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
now, basically 6AM runs in Unity in Play Mode xD xD xD


[07-Mar-19 11:44 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
utter useless too


[07-Mar-19 11:44 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but basically I want it to be able to be embedded in anything that has a JS layer


[07-Mar-19 11:45 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but the grand idea is basically put it on top as a wrapper


[07-Mar-19 11:45 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
the code is 100% haxe friendly, and C transpilable


[07-Mar-19 11:46 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so that shit should be dope enough on Unreal too, and it now works mostly as a logic layer / bridge to Komodo


[07-Mar-19 11:46 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, from Unreal / Unity, basically use similar API and map it against 6AM


[07-Mar-19 11:47 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
pretty much the basics of application integration with crapsy connectors / transformers / adapters


[07-Mar-19 11:47 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but you know I hate that jargon crap


[07-Mar-19 11:47 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[07-Mar-19 11:59 PM] fmproductions#2904
alright, 
last time I checked there was a js interpreter for unreal engine, the asset basically slaps the interpreter code on an actor and you just have to place it in the level. not sure if that would be helpful in any way though, I suppose not


[07-Mar-19 11:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

there is a lua plugin for around 35 bucks,

well, since you just mentioned it, I dig a bit on the store page, and it seems like we are lucky, 
this seems like an aseprite deal, or even better, you can get the plugin from the store to support the dev or you can get it for free on github and it has an mit license. wow


[08-Mar-19 12:14 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
woot


[08-Mar-19 12:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
someone should find the MIT license dude or dudette, fly over there and fucking hug him or her

Thanks for feedback @TwilightPunkster K64 . PSP's are meant as 'a console'. Good you point out that you take it literally, others might too. I'll will express this while presenting.


[08-Mar-19 12:19 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts probably gonna work on the game stuff at BCB, need to setup that on my Windows box anyway, which has a great videocard and prep the unity project - will send some screenies during the day

hahahahahahaha @FishyGuts 0.5.2 works "partially", but it works good enough, so old solidity remark might be just solidity, but will work on that later

hello dudes


[08-Mar-19 02:17 AM] Artist#0765
so one of the pioneers told me game Dev stuff going on


[08-Mar-19 02:17 AM] Artist#0765
I am also a game dev


[08-Mar-19 02:17 AM] Artist#0765
had ideas and stuff


[08-Mar-19 02:17 AM] Artist#0765

hey @Artist awesome, please do share


[08-Mar-19 02:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
What kind of game dev are you coming from?


[08-Mar-19 02:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Mobile, Console, Desktop?


[08-Mar-19 03:22 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@Artist 👋


[08-Mar-19 04:44 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions doing a windows build, seems like line endings were a bit fucked up, did you face that stuff (osx/linux builds were fine), using bash linux subsystem


[08-Mar-19 04:46 AM] fmproductions#2904
can occasionally happen it seems, but didn't have problems with it yet


[08-Mar-19 04:49 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
did you compile from src?


[08-Mar-19 04:49 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically at the last step, but I was lazy, seemed that line endings were a bitch


[08-Mar-19 04:52 AM] fmproductions#2904
oh, no, haven't done that


[08-Mar-19 04:53 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

{Reactions}
😄 

[08-Mar-19 04:54 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well, the fetch thingie, and the build thingie script are definitely not having the line endings, so EOL -> Unix


[08-Mar-19 04:56 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
use apt-get dos2unix


[08-Mar-19 04:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
dos2unix on /zcutil and /depends


[08-Mar-19 05:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
running at the moment, probably a git config line ending conversion bla


[08-Mar-19 07:57 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well, do they have the patent or did they apply for the patent?


[08-Mar-19 07:57 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I wonder the legal implications regarding this


[08-Mar-19 07:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I wouldn't care shit though xD


[08-Mar-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
seems just an application limited to a single country? and relates to multigame usage


[08-Mar-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
all depends on the scope of the claims that are granted and what existing open source projects they pretend dont exist


[08-Mar-19 07:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Yes, its like using the same database for different applications


[08-Mar-19 07:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
xD


[08-Mar-19 08:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Probably trying to secure the market, Unity had a 400 million boost somewhere last year iirc, but at that time I was really sick


[08-Mar-19 08:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
correct 2 years back


[08-Mar-19 08:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I think they had a second boost too


[08-Mar-19 08:02 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Anyway, that application might be because of the Enjin partnership, who were mostly talking about their amazing "multiverse"

[08-Mar-19 08:02 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I have an idea


[08-Mar-19 09:06 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Seems very specific to me in the articles description, but very vague in some parts of the patent.  I feel like they researched til they found a unique white space use for blockchain and gave themselves a good bit of room.  http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&Sect2=HITOFF&p=1&u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&r=3&f=G&l=50&co1=AND&d=PTXT&s1=blockchain&OS=blockchain&RS=blockchain

[08-Mar-19 09:48 AM] FishyGuts#5085
"Based on ethereum, not Blockchain.  Blockchain by definition should be immuteable and open source.  This patent only applies to Ethereum, a specific protocol that does not specifically cover all blockchain projects."

have ideas and stuff


[08-Mar-19 10:25 AM] Artist#0765
marketing plugs etc


[08-Mar-19 10:26 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Just got out of Blockchain Bar. Cool stuff and had fun! So I have imported some stuff into Unity, gonna grab something to eat and take a short powernap. After that, flame on


[08-Mar-19 10:27 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions did you got komodod to compile? Had some funky errors.


[08-Mar-19 10:30 AM] Artist#0765
I also wanted to implement blockchain in my games but can't understand what is the need why? whats the tech used in it


[08-Mar-19 10:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
There are a couple reasons.  My favorite I had a few weeks ago was "Cheaters can go fork themselves"


[08-Mar-19 10:44 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Verifiable gameplay and mechanic turn of events in tournament play.


[08-Mar-19 10:45 AM] FishyGuts#5085
RTS like Starcraft and Warcraft 2/3 are big tourney games in Korea and other places in the world.   Having a verifiable sequence of events would make players, viewers and sponsors know who REALLY wins 😃


[08-Mar-19 10:45 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Being able to trade items for real world value instead of in game gold.


[08-Mar-19 10:45 AM] FishyGuts#5085
That's just a short list. @Artist


[08-Mar-19 10:46 AM] Artist#0765
yeah I knew a bit like its mostly used in multiplayer stuff


[08-Mar-19 10:46 AM] Artist#0765
well need a short team for a hyper casual game


[08-Mar-19 10:46 AM] Artist#0765
idea that I have


[08-Mar-19 10:46 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Single player games where player progress matters..


[08-Mar-19 10:46 AM] FishyGuts#5085
can have items/cahracters/skins treaded and verifiable.


[08-Mar-19 10:46 AM] Artist#0765
yeah its good


[08-Mar-19 10:47 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If you have an idea for a game, pitch it here.  People are watching 😃


[08-Mar-19 10:47 AM] FishyGuts#5085
👀


[08-Mar-19 10:47 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@Artist  There is a variety of features you can add to a game if it has a blockchain.  In addition there are benefits between games and for the studio/company as well.    I'm getting ready to PM  you my book of conversations on the subject.


[08-Mar-19 10:47 AM] Artist#0765
what about bro I have heard that mining can be also done like through scripts people playing with internet and coins getting mined


[08-Mar-19 10:48 AM] Artist#0765
well I can't pitch here unfortunately its not a billion dollar idea xd @FishyGuts  xd its a simple hyper casual game but can say the million dollar idea I am working on is still in modeling phases xd but first I need to build hyper casual games so


[08-Mar-19 10:48 AM] Artist#0765
need good designer and one helping coder in it


[08-Mar-19 10:49 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Any ideas you don't need to keep as IP you are free to share here.   You may be surprised at the skill level of some people watching 😃


[08-Mar-19 10:50 AM] Artist#0765
I know that people are skilled xd will share if someone wants to work


[08-Mar-19 10:50 AM] Artist#0765
yeah want to keep IP on one of the ideas


[08-Mar-19 10:51 AM] Artist#0765
but not on hyper casual ones


[08-Mar-19 10:53 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Sent the PM, feel free to ask as many questions as you want!


[08-Mar-19 10:58 AM] Artist#0765
thanks got it


[08-Mar-19 12:02 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist @FishyGuts for the RTS, can you think about what gameplay mechanic would be cool to play on the blockchain. Keep it simple, its a demo. Also play Warcraft 2: Tides of Darkness to get that feel of the game again. I am gonna nap now and read up.


[08-Mar-19 12:02 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I think a 1v1 would be cool.


[08-Mar-19 12:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
With set resources and a fresh map.


[08-Mar-19 12:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Winner can keep either aesthetic upgrades or starting resources upgrade perhaps?


[08-Mar-19 12:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
This would require a matchmaking protocol but I think James could help there.


[08-Mar-19 12:03 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Or a simple campaign mode.


[08-Mar-19 12:04 PM] FishyGuts#5085
3 phase....
1 - Establish a basecamp and destroy the enemies. 
2 - Find and release the Dragon(Komodo) to fight for your side
3 - Retake the enemies base and save the queen?


[08-Mar-19 12:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Top scores can be defined by time?  
Also by completeness?


[08-Mar-19 12:05 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Anyone else feel free to chime in.


[08-Mar-19 12:29 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TwilightPunkster K64 absolutely


[08-Mar-19 12:31 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@FishyGuts ask your kiddos too. I assume they have some understanding of Blockchain?


[08-Mar-19 12:33 PM] fmproductions#2904
@TwilightPunkster K64  okay, I see. Just tried to build the repo you linked earlier (master branch) with linux, also didn't succeed, got an error 127 or something (no further details)


[08-Mar-19 10:07 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions you need the fsm branch, but got still some errors too.


[08-Mar-19 10:46 PM] FishyGuts#5085
They do Fist.  I will ask them about stories for the RTS.


[08-Mar-19 10:47 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I think what is above is adequate for a demo though too.


[08-Mar-19 11:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
awesome thanks @FishyGuts


[08-Mar-19 11:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sorry, I went in a coma 😄 I had 3 beers


[08-Mar-19 11:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Shouldn't drink beer in my condition but wow 8 hours sleep


[08-Mar-19 11:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
that rarely happens xD


[08-Mar-19 11:08 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I am thinking what will make a blockchain asset may be valuable in this demo


[08-Mar-19 11:09 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
a RTS isn't that hard to make as demo, but it isn't an inventory game


[08-Mar-19 11:09 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
for example what smart contracts would be applicable here?


[08-Mar-19 11:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Fair play - High scores for speed - Saving resources for future replays.


[08-Mar-19 11:10 PM] FishyGuts#5085
resources / skins earned through performance.


[08-Mar-19 11:11 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
keep thinking out loud


[08-Mar-19 11:11 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
we nerds call it duck debugging


[08-Mar-19 11:13 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
probably saving resources could be a thing, but eventually that wouldn't make it so interesting


[08-Mar-19 11:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
how about the map being created on the blockchain?


[08-Mar-19 11:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and that map has certain resources


[08-Mar-19 11:15 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and once you have won, you own the map


[08-Mar-19 11:16 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
until someone challenges you


[08-Mar-19 11:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Maybe.
Let's see what James thinks.  
What sort of things would you blockchain in a Real Time Strategy game?
- Verifiable Gameplay, Cheaters Can fork off.
- Start point resources based on past performance as NFT
- Skins for items/buildings for past performance as NFT
Any other ideas @jl777c


[08-Mar-19 11:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i have no preference


[08-Mar-19 11:35 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Still not clear. I kind of want a very specific scenario or better a set of scenarios so I can forge this in the game. There are so many ways to cheat in these games (scruffs, trainers, etc.) and primarily focussing on that will be out of scope for a demo. If its good enough, we can actually plan a good game, this is just "hey, we jammed this baby"


[08-Mar-19 11:35 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
one idea I had was to have cryptokitty orcs


[08-Mar-19 11:36 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
having their own dna, which could be blended if you sacrifice them to the Ogre god, having the best of two attributes


[08-Mar-19 11:38 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
That being said, you keep units as "collectable cards" like as in Magic: The Gathering; prior the game begins you can pick 5 units from your "unlimited deck".


[08-Mar-19 11:38 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so instead of keeping resources, you will have to begin each map with minimal resources and work out your economy.


[08-Mar-19 11:41 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts is your artist friend someone who can whip out a model fast?


[08-Mar-19 11:42 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
there should be a komodo mascotte xD


[09-Mar-19 12:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
perhaps sacrificing cryptokitties could be implemented via etomic where you can truly sacrifice them for unique attributes. that would be hilarious and awesome.


[09-Mar-19 12:41 AM] actionslacks#4072
kittie slayer


[09-Mar-19 12:57 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
evil and blood... I like it


[09-Mar-19 12:58 AM] actionslacks#4072
The OG Command and conquer is the GOAT rts for me. thinking about how I would  implement blockchain in that type of game makes my  head spin a little though.


[09-Mar-19 12:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup thats why I am asking


[09-Mar-19 12:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
give me a bean and I'll make it a magical one.


[09-Mar-19 12:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Still need the fucking bean though


[09-Mar-19 12:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Magic comes with its limits


[09-Mar-19 01:03 AM] actionslacks#4072
Things like this usually just pop in from out of the blue. I think if we iterate over what we want the blockchain part to do enough, maybe it's best application will magically appear.


[09-Mar-19 01:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
no


[09-Mar-19 01:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
thats bad gamedev


[09-Mar-19 01:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically, I am now importing typical stuff, fix game mechanics, convert fonts, write shaders for the look and feel


[09-Mar-19 01:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but its based on an existing game


[09-Mar-19 01:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Warcraft 2


[09-Mar-19 01:05 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
blockchain isn't an add-on, but it should be a fundamental


[09-Mar-19 01:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
its like when someone says, "lets add joypad support later"


[09-Mar-19 01:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
thats what rookies do, and they fuck up a game before it even gets released


[09-Mar-19 01:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
any individual player advantage enabled by blockchain would ruin that type of game playability wise I would think


[09-Mar-19 01:07 AM] actionslacks#4072
I like the maps idea


[09-Mar-19 01:07 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but what and why


[09-Mar-19 01:07 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
what would be beneficial to use the blockchain


[09-Mar-19 01:08 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
because its like building a ferrari and say, hey, lets add a blockchain to it


[09-Mar-19 01:08 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
might seem cool for some, but I find it fanboy mentality


[09-Mar-19 01:08 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
added-value


[09-Mar-19 01:08 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sorry I am always a dick prior doing something awesome

some people just like to go back to the drawing board every iteration or try to fit a brick inside a newborn baby's ear. I just like Freddy Mercurify shit. Pass the test first time.

you have a seed for a randomly generated map that you get to keep associated with your pubkey if you win? you can trade the map, sell it, the blockchain insures that that exact map wont be used or generated by anyone else otherwise that would constitute a double spend.

unit generation or resource gathering buffs that accumulate. Its all unfair advantage to noobs though

@FishyGuts @Cryptofist can you do orc voices that instead of the classic "woik woik" say "mine mine", "mmmhhh crypto" and a battlecry "Koomodooo!"

@fmproductions I'm on overdrive, I need you for some stuff


[09-Mar-19 01:28 AM] actionslacks#4072
Instead of orcs vs dwarves or whatever it could just be like imaginary crypto coin projects fighting each other. you start with your node and generate your wallets. the coins are like resources. you need power. the troops are like devs walking around with macbooks


[09-Mar-19 01:28 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
first orc vs orc, more models require more logic


[09-Mar-19 01:29 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

can you set up a default unreal project, basically with HDR, Linear coloring, PP, and look into plugin development, wrap me a good example, I can basically then port 6AM and the core plugin to connect with Komodod

yeah, they have the unreal marketplace


[09-Mar-19 01:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ok, definitely particle system for UI, LUT support, DOTween stuff, and AA text fonts like TextMeshPro


[09-Mar-19 01:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
make a shopping list, I'll buy them

multi units attacking a single unit

some unity with different strategies like snipers, or depending on the setting, archers, sword fighters, or even units with special abilities, like cloaking and only being visible after initial attack could be interesting


[09-Mar-19 02:02 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nah, pumped up a fog of war


[09-Mar-19 02:02 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so mostly a 5 tile max range


[09-Mar-19 02:02 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
probably go for 3


[09-Mar-19 02:03 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
cloaking not necessary due to FoW


[09-Mar-19 02:03 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
they are orcs, big ugly and cant really hide behind a rock

ok 2 secs


[09-Mar-19 06:12 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
3 kind of units (worker, combat, rider)


[09-Mar-19 06:12 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
on selecting unit


[09-Mar-19 06:12 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[09-Mar-19 06:13 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
for the worker just one voice, maybe 2 different ones

combat 4 kind of units


[09-Mar-19 06:13 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
rider just 2 units

"mine mine" (instead of work work)


[09-Mar-19 06:14 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
probably at max 10 minutes recording, another 10 remastering

[09-Mar-19 06:14 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sure, but no need to overdo it, as long as the audio have a master equal volume


[09-Mar-19 06:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
definitely have "HODDLLLLL"


[09-Mar-19 06:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(in WC2 "we are beinggg attaccckeed")


[09-Mar-19 06:15 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I can  hit record and then send them


[09-Mar-19 06:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
can you hit up a Google Drive folder, share that, its easier, working on multiple machines at moment


[09-Mar-19 06:20 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'll be back home in a little while. If speed is the priority here, someone else please step in. I'll alert here when I sit down to do it.


[09-Mar-19 06:22 AM] Cryptofist#7504
If you think there are any ones that should be a higher pitch, my 6 year old will want to help.


[09-Mar-19 06:23 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Also, got a real wicked screechy goblin voice if that fits anywhere.


[09-Mar-19 06:24 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
relax, let me know when


[09-Mar-19 06:24 AM] Cryptofist#7504
What is relax?  😂


[09-Mar-19 06:24 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
relax as in don't panic


[09-Mar-19 06:24 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
worse case I can pop those myself too


[09-Mar-19 06:25 AM] Cryptofist#7504
You'll figure out mastering? I have recording down, it's been a long time since I've altered audio.


[09-Mar-19 06:25 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
mastering is easy, basically use Audacity


[09-Mar-19 06:25 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm good. 😉 Just excited.


[09-Mar-19 06:25 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok, that's what I used


[09-Mar-19 06:26 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
its easier to master on the box you are recording, and for one make the clips in one recording, and use background noise filtering, test them with and without headphones, cut them into wave clips and bang


[09-Mar-19 06:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
what were the max amount of units per player in wc2


[09-Mar-19 06:57 AM] Cryptofist#7504
50?


[09-Mar-19 06:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
don't guess, find


[09-Mar-19 06:58 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I really don't recall a number, I remember there being one.


[09-Mar-19 06:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
there is always a manual


[09-Mar-19 06:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
never reinvent the wheel if the wheel aint broken


[09-Mar-19 07:02 AM] Cryptofist#7504
One version 600 total, battle.net was 1200


[09-Mar-19 07:02 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Food limit 200


[09-Mar-19 07:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
600 per player?


[09-Mar-19 07:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
damn


[09-Mar-19 07:07 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I think age of empires had like a max of 200 and default 100


[09-Mar-19 07:07 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
holy crap


[09-Mar-19 07:07 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ok, let me refactor some shit

ok, 200 units per player per 4, but probably gonna lag like hell with more than 4 players

@fmproductions what do you think, dither the stuff?


[09-Mar-19 08:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
a little retro flair?


[09-Mar-19 08:59 AM] fmproductions#2904
dither has a nice effect on some 2d stuff, would have yet to see it for 3d, 
not sure if it fits here though


[09-Mar-19 09:00 AM] fmproductions#2904

I like both options, the regular approach and the cell shading, 
but the contrast in the regular one is better, and also the global illumination.

For a simple campaign mode.
3 phases....
1 - Establish a basecamp, secure resources and destroy the enemies. 
2 - Find and release the Dragon(Komodo) to fight for your side
3 - Retake the enemies base and save the queen?
Top scores can be defined by time?
Also by completeness?
Salvaging as you mentioned "Bred orcs" or building skins perhaps purchased with extra resources after missions.


[09-Mar-19 10:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
It should be fun and engaging for 15 - 60 minutes.   We aren't looking to hook people up to 100 hours a game (yet 😀 )


[09-Mar-19 10:31 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ah, well, that would be a campaign, at this point, just polishing the look and feel


[09-Mar-19 10:31 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
most likely I'll play this 100 hours


[09-Mar-19 10:31 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
its quite fun


[09-Mar-19 10:32 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Understood.  Was just maybe giving you direction for a directive to you and the players.


[09-Mar-19 10:32 AM] FishyGuts#5085
3rd mimssion, need to recapture the dragon control crystals before attacking the base.


[09-Mar-19 10:32 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Sick dragon on base, raid and finishing move 😛   Retrieve the relic/save the queen


[09-Mar-19 10:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085
As I understaood that was a question earlier.


[09-Mar-19 10:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, single player?


[09-Mar-19 10:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If not, then I am rambling as usual.


[09-Mar-19 10:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
cool


[09-Mar-19 10:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I think single player enables the test and integration phase easier yes?


[09-Mar-19 10:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sure, makes my life way easier


[09-Mar-19 10:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
alrighty


[09-Mar-19 10:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
gotcha


[09-Mar-19 10:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Multiplayer can just be randomized maps.   Cap the flag or resource victories.


[09-Mar-19 10:33 AM] FishyGuts#5085
But we don't have to start with 1v1.


[09-Mar-19 10:34 AM] FishyGuts#5085
If it's easier for you, then yeah, but both modes would be cool eventally.

sobel is an algorithm.

[09-Mar-19 10:36 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
cel shading is a custom flat color rendering based on light reception


[09-Mar-19 10:36 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(toon shading)


[09-Mar-19 10:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ok, I'll stick with cel shading then. Its a post processing additive, so its not something permanent, but I am going to fix up the Hud's to match the styles.

Nice @TwilightPunkster K64 - for Rogue I downloaded a game on my phone that is similar and really fun, a KMD touch to be put on something simlilar

I think the name is awesome as well. If the associated asset gets on an exchange we should come up with a ticker.. WARRR?


[09-Mar-19 06:11 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
on an exchange?


[09-Mar-19 06:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
$WAR - and the exchange is likely in game. 
This is also only a DEMO for now.  It would need much polish to be a full game.


[09-Mar-19 06:14 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
gee thanks xD

looks better than most games that take months xD

also, working here without a design document xD


[09-Mar-19 06:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
the biggest question is, how long until we can start play testing? I mean it's taking forever.

well, I was hoping on voice tracks, but those never came 😛 but I just finished the code on the RTS camera movement


[09-Mar-19 06:17 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(basically when you move with your cursor to the screen edges it smoothly scrolls the camera along


[09-Mar-19 06:18 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
kinda a crap thing to make, as a mouse pointer is 2D, and 3D is well errr 3D, so a raycast, conversion, an easing algo and calculating the screen width and height, plus acceleration

isnt there a minecraft blockchain? what do they do?

Not that I know of.


[09-Mar-19 06:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@benohanlon isn't there a minecraft game attached to blockchain? I'm fairly sure I've heard of it


[09-Mar-19 07:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
The “feature” is the cheat free gaming.


[09-Mar-19 07:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
We can add NFT skins or something.  Maybe base resources to start but too much skews fairness especially if we move to a 1v1


[09-Mar-19 07:11 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
cheat free should be specific xD


[09-Mar-19 07:12 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Can you provide mor einfo on how the game itself works @TwilightPunkster K64 ?   Is it really the same as W2


[09-Mar-19 07:12 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
did someone write up a standard, or a set of use cases? Rogue is all about cheat-free


[09-Mar-19 07:16 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup


[09-Mar-19 07:16 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
only difference is that its 3D, with a survival mode like minecraft, but that would be similar as playing a campaign


[09-Mar-19 07:16 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Rogue also has some more features that are blockchain based, Your avatar is a token, multiple sell-able accounts which can be used for winning multiplayer, and your in game gold is exchanged for a real currency ( getting paid to play)   

I think maybe we will find some good ideas as the game devlops more, I feel like we will need to add features to it.


[09-Mar-19 07:16 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
too late


[09-Mar-19 07:17 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Rewards based on gameplay was an idea.


[09-Mar-19 07:17 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Also, never add too many features to a game.


[09-Mar-19 07:17 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
you end up breaking stuff.


[09-Mar-19 07:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Why not to start from cool 3D GUI for Rogue? Or cool 3D Rogue warriors marketplace 😃


[09-Mar-19 07:17 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Also, since I'm the only one coding this, I rather don't have too many features


[09-Mar-19 07:18 PM] Cryptofist#7504
All good


[09-Mar-19 07:18 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@TonyL lol, the whole idea to do this was to keep the terminal flair of Rogue as is


[09-Mar-19 07:18 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I was more thinking features as something built around the game.


[09-Mar-19 07:18 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(and add something new)


[09-Mar-19 07:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Ahh I see @TwilightPunkster K64


[09-Mar-19 07:18 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
features are the RTS in itself, but it should show the benefits of using the blockchain


[09-Mar-19 07:19 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
my personal one is to use cc-assets (Token)


[09-Mar-19 07:19 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but, the question is, what will make it the most fun for players


[09-Mar-19 07:20 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
what is valuable to "keep"


[09-Mar-19 07:20 PM] TonyL#3577
😂  skins


[09-Mar-19 07:20 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@TonyL what do you think about the game so far


[09-Mar-19 07:20 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
hahahaa


[09-Mar-19 07:20 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well, I had that idea


[09-Mar-19 07:20 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
cryptokitty meets orcs


[09-Mar-19 07:21 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm not sure so far how to connect RTS with collectables


[09-Mar-19 07:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Any item which you save will change balance


[09-Mar-19 07:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@TonyL - we talked about doing a 3D GUI for rogue and may pursue it after this and after rogue testing is “complete”

[09-Mar-19 07:22 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
what idea?


[09-Mar-19 07:23 PM] Cryptofist#7504
crypto kitties orcs


[09-Mar-19 07:23 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well, start exploring


[09-Mar-19 07:23 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I am, just needed to dump it inmy brain


[09-Mar-19 07:23 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

doing something liek cryto kitties at all on KMD is good too, so everyone can see the chain can handle such things.

I just stumbled on this channel, is this GUI being built to be put onto ROGUE??


[09-Mar-19 07:25 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Maybe a certain level of gaming can be done to generate an orc legend (NFT orc)


[09-Mar-19 07:25 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@wookie  seperate game system at the moment.


[09-Mar-19 07:26 PM] wookie#7663
Thanks, is there a beta out for testing or is the GUI the focus atm?


[09-Mar-19 07:26 PM] actionslacks#4072
will every game generate a new  entity on the blockchain?


[09-Mar-19 07:27 PM] Cryptofist#7504
It doesnt have to be that way, however more often than not, it will.


[09-Mar-19 07:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Only idea I have so far is a NFT "commander" which is not in-game movable unit but like a command  gameplay and can give some unique buffs


[09-Mar-19 07:27 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Say for ROGUE we can make additional games that used the same chain and tokens.


[09-Mar-19 07:27 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@TonyL  killer


[09-Mar-19 07:28 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@TonyL can you elaborate more, I think I had that kinda in my head


[09-Mar-19 07:28 PM] Cryptofist#7504
like speed bonuses or something? (or is that too much)


[09-Mar-19 07:28 PM] actionslacks#4072

ok, that might be mean.. but so is filing for a patent


[09-Mar-19 07:29 PM] actionslacks#4072
Do they have a proof of concept out yet? I mean we dont want to do the exact same shit right?


[09-Mar-19 07:29 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
they have their fanboys gathered for GDC


[09-Mar-19 07:30 PM] TonyL#3577
@TwilightPunkster K64 yes, thinking - such commander or "hero" can have items also which should be hard to find (maybe in some tournaments or when you finish campaign)


[09-Mar-19 07:30 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
they call it MultiVerse


[09-Mar-19 07:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Buffs are like a +x to trees cutting, +x to unit armor, +x to attack, some unique building


[09-Mar-19 07:30 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@TonyL yup, probably can even make it only spawn on certain conditions


[09-Mar-19 07:30 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ooooh


[09-Mar-19 07:30 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

as long as the buffs aren't permanent... it would still be balanced if the buff wore off.

[09-Mar-19 07:58 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Music would be amazing!


[09-Mar-19 07:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup


[09-Mar-19 07:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sounds good


[09-Mar-19 08:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Was the trimming on the sample good? @TwilightPunkster K64


[09-Mar-19 08:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I assumed it should be as tight as possible.


[09-Mar-19 08:11 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup


[09-Mar-19 08:17 PM] Cryptofist#7504

well, the good news is that I just build the very first executable with Unity. It's not a real playable game yet, but the important parts for the gameplay are made


[09-Mar-19 08:44 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

after my nap, I'll work on the buildings, stat objects, and use the bridge. Meanwhile keep on talking about how Komodo will change the world of blockgames

@TwilightPunkster K64 if you need help purchasing asset packs, let’s do that.

@FishyGuts wuaa awesome. Well, ehm, there are plenty asset packs out there and a lot of things that could totally could rock this development even more. Have you tried the preview build (no it is not a demo, not for testing, just to see what I am making screenies about) ? Anyway, just prepping so a Linux build is going to be possible too. Don't worry about too much what I need. However, financial boosts are always more than welcome and I could definitely use them to buy tools and toys.


[10-Mar-19 04:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
But basically, the most stuff is more fun to make myself.


[10-Mar-19 04:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
if you want to provide voices, or sound fx, please follow the same things I asked @Cryptofist to do; make sure they are equal in volume, sound good with headphones and without, recorded in equal volume. I can understand its fun for the little ones to help, but I rather not spend a hour in Audacity comparing 2 second sound bytes 😛

@FishyGuts wouldn't be a bad idea at all, a kickstarter like thing for blockgames on Komodo.

quick question about the game style btw.


[10-Mar-19 04:31 AM] Regnar#6164
random generated in fog, permadeath type?


[10-Mar-19 04:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well as off now, we are still talking about what would be the most fun thing to demo. I'm personally a fan of permadeath. A map could be procgen of course, but I don't think I want to spend too much time on that feature (this is just for fun)


[10-Mar-19 04:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh sorry, proc gen is dynamically generated


[10-Mar-19 04:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
"nerd jargon"


[10-Mar-19 04:34 AM] Regnar#6164
yea I'm a permadeath fan too, especially within blockchain space, non-fungibles and such


[10-Mar-19 04:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

I've been playing a ton of those io games, usually multiplayer involving killing each other. but they often seem much quicker than what would constitute a chain. It seems there would be a cool place for longer gameplay pvp games, but not sure if that was in store here. good items should be hard to get imo, especially if they're on chain/traded


[10-Mar-19 04:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Well, just describe me the scenario's in a Gherkin like way

mac build works fine awesome


[10-Mar-19 04:45 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
if the preview works, the final game will also work so 2 down, just 1 to go


[10-Mar-19 04:46 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@TonyL pray to the coingods, just hitting on the build button for x86_64 for Linux


[10-Mar-19 04:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Regnar do you know an example of a game that got backed with a dICO?


[10-Mar-19 04:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
or just an app?


[10-Mar-19 04:54 AM] Meyse#0952
no examples, but it should work. but only when a game works with coins and they have actual value. Its just crowdfunding, and you get GAMECOIN for your support


[10-Mar-19 04:57 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Meyse so pretty much fire up komodod, create stuff and DPoW that baby and integrate coins. Mhm..


[10-Mar-19 04:57 AM] Meyse#0952
yes


[10-Mar-19 04:58 AM] Meyse#0952
create some coins, and sell those coins for btc/kmd to fund your game development


[10-Mar-19 04:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
DPoW costs like 350 KMD right?


[10-Mar-19 04:58 AM] Meyse#0952
yeah


[10-Mar-19 04:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and to sell these coins, probably need that DEX thingie too right?


[10-Mar-19 04:58 AM] Meyse#0952
no it happens peer2peer with a dico app


[10-Mar-19 04:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, where is the bloody tutorial for dICO's xD


[10-Mar-19 05:02 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

awesome - gimme a holla here if it "works"


[10-Mar-19 05:07 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
if that preview works, its pretty much home free, because most logic in that is what we need


[10-Mar-19 05:07 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
secret, it already has the bridge in it, but it isn't called


[10-Mar-19 05:08 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
also, it has ransomware that locks your machine and demands furry porn.

Thanks! 👍


[10-Mar-19 05:52 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ok, so here is my basic new story line(while Unity imports)


[10-Mar-19 05:53 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Good morning BTW. I’m here for what you need.  

If you need assets let me know.  I’ll send you funds or disposable CCs. 
@TwilightPunkster K64


[10-Mar-19 05:54 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
- you were an orc slave captured by the evil elves to be sent to a far away continent, but caused by a shipwreck, you ended up on unclaimed territory. All you could salvage was a barrel, and little tool. So you made a fire. (you get randomly spawned on the map)


[10-Mar-19 05:56 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
- you now must gather resources: wood, stone and meat. So you must get out there and explore. However, you can't just grind, because your barrel will only hold up that much. So you need buildings/constructs to make your life easier.


[10-Mar-19 05:59 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
- on the map there are possibly other (up to 3) orcs, but since they aren't part of your clan, and if they are - there is no way to verify - its all about survival; thus you treat them as enemies. There are only so many resources on that map. As long as you maintain ownership of that map, you will get resources over time in the next expansion of your territory.


[10-Mar-19 06:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
- sooner or later you will be able to research, to create better units, but they will be capped to a certain level. However, you can try to sacrifice 2 units, to create a new one, which *might* have better statistics.


[10-Mar-19 06:00 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
- you can capture wolves for meat or in exchange for meat keep them in a wolves den, so you can have calvary like units.


[10-Mar-19 06:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
- once you are killed as you will be permanently dead. Like protecting the king in chess. Every victory will grant you a reputation point, which increases your leadership skill, that allows to give a special bonus to a certain unit. You can pick between "Ruler" (buff your workers), "Overlord" (buff your combatants) and "Holy" (buff your science and research)


[10-Mar-19 06:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
To me, that sounds like a fun game to play.


[10-Mar-19 06:05 AM] Meyse#0952
yes yes yes


[10-Mar-19 06:05 AM] Meyse#0952
you can make a blockchained leaderboard


[10-Mar-19 06:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts awesome, I'll keep it in mind. Disposables might work because that would be easier to purchase directly to my Unity environment, probably good to get some other races, maybe some buildings/animals.


[10-Mar-19 06:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Meyse please, elaborate in detail


[10-Mar-19 06:06 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Where to store, how to store and how to prevent malicious behaviour

``Every victory will grant you a reputation point, which increases your leadership skill, that allows to give a special bonus to a certain unit. You can pick between "Ruler" (buff your workers), "Overlord" (buff your combatants) and "Holy" (buff your science and research)``
every player should have a pubkey right? For every player you can store Ruler points, Overlord points, Holy points and the reputation points. When you die you start again from scratch (if you exit, your stuff will be saved). You can make an overview, a leaderboard, who has most points etc. If you saved and want to continue to play with your epic "army" or "city", you can even get matched with people who have same points as you


[10-Mar-19 06:15 AM] Meyse#0952
``Where to store, how to store and how to prevent malicious behaviour``
these questions i dont really know how to answer


[10-Mar-19 06:19 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nice nice nice


[10-Mar-19 06:19 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but that sounds like an idea to cultivate


[10-Mar-19 06:22 AM] Meyse#0952
yes, a player would want to be nr1 on the leaderboard. and even if you died, youre still on the leaderboard. so it would be an incentive to keep on playing i think


[10-Mar-19 06:23 AM] Meyse#0952
10 KMD spent wisely ;D


[10-Mar-19 06:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup


[10-Mar-19 06:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
together we are strong

oh, that would be super easy


[10-Mar-19 06:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
my first integration with 6AM and Unity was with Token


[10-Mar-19 06:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I know that baby by heart


[10-Mar-19 06:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Where to store? 
On the blockchain in a private key/public key combo.


[10-Mar-19 06:36 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yes, I meant a little bit more technically, but as token that should fly


[10-Mar-19 06:37 AM] Meyse#0952
OOHH yes you can sell your king with your epic stats, for all those lamos who dont want to grind but still want to call themselves the best


[10-Mar-19 06:38 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
lol


[10-Mar-19 06:38 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sell your king xD


[10-Mar-19 06:38 AM] Meyse#0952
i would sell my king for some sweet komodo


[10-Mar-19 06:38 AM] Meyse#0952
or GAMECOIN and exchange GAMECOIN for komodo


[10-Mar-19 06:39 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

its gonna be epic


[10-Mar-19 06:41 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
probably need to create a UI to make your king look super epic as you progress


[10-Mar-19 06:41 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[10-Mar-19 06:42 AM] Regnar#6164
Oh definitely have a way to tell if a king has been sold or created. There will likely be a market for old school kings and definitely a reputation built on "my king is built not bought"


[10-Mar-19 06:42 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
where you find like jewelry and you can forge them into one

Should be on the chain anyway :P

just put everything on the chain and then let us pick and choose

building placement done, upgrade system in place, now working on "Kings Seat"


[10-Mar-19 08:22 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
probably gonna think about creating a skill tree, that must be reached before you can become a "king"

I saw a pretty cool random city generator you might like @TwilightPunkster K64 

<https://watabou.itch.io/toy-town> 
No idea if it could be useful to you but figured I'd post it


[10-Mar-19 09:16 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nope, the idea of RTS is to build your own economy, or do the same versus a campaign map


[10-Mar-19 09:16 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
thanks though


[10-Mar-19 09:17 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

too bad this is a demo and not a fully backed project, else shit would've been even more awesome, but hey every game starts with a version 1

Make it work with CCs and we will figure something out. 💪


[10-Mar-19 10:13 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
already bought some assets, but still it needs a little extra love


[10-Mar-19 10:13 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
else it would be just flipping and I dont like that


[10-Mar-19 10:13 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
maybe it gets popular and a crowdfund after will do the trick


[10-Mar-19 10:14 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
wouldnt even take much


[10-Mar-19 10:14 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
code doesn't need to change, probably have modeler and 2d designer, an audio engineer and a level designer


[10-Mar-19 10:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
maybe 30-40 days work, and there would be a super polished thing. But thats not now, so I just row with my magnificent self xD

{Reactions}
👑 

[10-Mar-19 10:24 AM] Regnar#6164
Haha I will for sure chip in to the crowdfund, especially if I can get some non fungibles out of it by playing. What a cool way to calculate a ROI :P


[10-Mar-19 10:24 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
xD


[10-Mar-19 10:28 AM] Meyse#0952
Now I want to build a Komodo crowdfunding dapp, just a very advanced dico app+kickstarter in one app, that would be awesome

{Reactions}
👍 (2) 

[10-Mar-19 10:38 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea that would be cool. dICO would involve swapping some coins, but if coins are generated through gameplay it might be better to swap a special dICO NFT, that is in game, like a green kings robe, or a pet komodo dragon, probably non perfomance, but won't ever be available again. Give an incentive to pitch into the development fund (rare non fungible).


[10-Mar-19 10:41 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Easy peasy, probably the dICO thing and just throw in a parallax Vue powered template xD


[10-Mar-19 10:42 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Funding this game. Dico funder, I think that's all possible. Just need to explore it more and have the right people interrested in making it. 

I mean, look at this specific project, it became a decentralized game dev channel just from an initial boost from a few people  and then built from a community with ideas.


[10-Mar-19 10:43 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@TwilightPunkster K64 can you make single use/permadeath tokens ? So give away a rare dragon unit, that is gone when it dies?


[10-Mar-19 10:44 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea definitely. I think people are used to buying early versions of games to get exclusive content and are comfortable with it, maybe even more so than buying ICO coins.


[10-Mar-19 10:44 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Legendary tokens that are balanced some how.


[10-Mar-19 10:45 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'd feel 100% on board with something that was focused on NOT being an ICO.


[10-Mar-19 10:47 AM] Meyse#0952
whats the difference between an ico and a crowdfunded game? nothing imo, except with an ico you get part of the "company", with crowdfunding you get early access or some fancy whatever whatever


[10-Mar-19 10:47 AM] Meyse#0952
whit crypto you can combine those and have a magical recipe


[10-Mar-19 10:49 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Both **would** be cool. 
Regulational BS is why I say otherwise.


[10-Mar-19 10:50 AM] Cryptofist#7504
+/-  lawyer involvement.


[10-Mar-19 10:50 AM] Cryptofist#7504
A platform wher you could do one or both at your own discretion would be super amazing.


[10-Mar-19 10:50 AM] Meyse#0952
who cares, if a group of people want to make a game they should just do so, AND get funding with crypto, i dont care about regulations


[10-Mar-19 10:53 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist I have this very simple philosophy; impossible is never an option. So, I could. But if I will, thats to be seen.


[10-Mar-19 10:54 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Never the less, a kickstarter like interface is almost a necessity to make crowdfunding work.


[10-Mar-19 10:55 AM] Meyse#0952
I could easily do interface/ux/branding 😄

{Reactions}
treasure 

[10-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Cool. I wasn't sure on the dynamics with the game itself.  @TwilightPunkster K64


[10-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@Meyse  Are you a web dev and designer?


[10-Mar-19 11:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Meyse if this becomes something bigger than a demo, absofuckinglutely - UX is probably one of the things that people under estimate in games


[10-Mar-19 11:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
coders are bad UX designers.


[10-Mar-19 11:01 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(in general)


[10-Mar-19 11:04 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
From the top of the map to the bottom, it takes 30 seconds to scroll, and 40 seconds for the basic unit to move.


[10-Mar-19 11:05 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, basically if a unit would walk the borders it will take 160 seconds to get back at starting point


[10-Mar-19 11:05 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
sounds like a big enough map to me


[10-Mar-19 11:07 AM] Meyse#0952
@Cryptofist im a designer, in the broadest sense i would say. i just dont do code


[10-Mar-19 11:08 AM] Meyse#0952
@TwilightPunkster K64 yes, coders arent the greatest designers 😄 but thats okay haha


[10-Mar-19 11:08 AM] Meyse#0952
pretty big map i guess yeah


[10-Mar-19 11:08 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nah, could easily be bigger, or could even make it seamless


[10-Mar-19 11:09 AM] Meyse#0952
it also sounds like a combo of a MOBA/RTS somehow


[10-Mar-19 11:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but its cool enough


[10-Mar-19 11:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
hahaha indeed


[10-Mar-19 11:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
its a combo of a lot of things


[10-Mar-19 11:58 AM] Regnar#6164
by seamless do you mean like a globe? kind of like Civilization type games? or pacman lol


[10-Mar-19 12:04 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
those are all seamless xD


[10-Mar-19 12:04 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
in technical sense


[10-Mar-19 12:05 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but, to be specific, like Skyrim


[10-Mar-19 12:05 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
you don't "feel" when the world ends.


[10-Mar-19 12:13 PM] Regnar#6164
ohh got ya. yea I like the mini earth feel. 😃


[10-Mar-19 12:16 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
yup


[10-Mar-19 12:26 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
to make the king thing more "real", instead of stranding solo, one starts with three worker units


[10-Mar-19 12:27 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
else, there will be a problem in creating the first orc xD


[10-Mar-19 12:27 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh wait


[10-Mar-19 12:27 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
mhm


[10-Mar-19 12:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Trust me, a dICO has already been discussed 😉


[10-Mar-19 12:37 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I would think a kickstarter or crowdfund would fit better.


[10-Mar-19 12:39 PM] Meyse#0952
why?


[10-Mar-19 12:42 PM] Meyse#0952
maybe this will be the future. all games having their own little economy, with coins having a value that can be exchanged for something more "real" like btc or kmd


[10-Mar-19 12:42 PM] Meyse#0952
the more players the more the value rises

{Reactions}
💯 

[10-Mar-19 12:43 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
why not a combo xD


[10-Mar-19 12:43 PM] Meyse#0952
yes a combo is also FINE!


[10-Mar-19 12:59 PM] Regnar#6164
yea I think the dICO/crowd fund model makes sense. People are definitely used to buying early "packs" to get some unique stuff, probably non advantage based stuff though. which they can trade, or hold.


[10-Mar-19 01:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
What do the dICO tokens buy?


[10-Mar-19 01:15 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Rare NFTs?   In game gold on launch?


[10-Mar-19 01:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
A single currency in a dual currency system.


[10-Mar-19 01:16 PM] FishyGuts#5085
One is earned the other is crypto and can be bought.   The earned kind can be converted to crypto in game.


[10-Mar-19 01:17 PM] Meyse#0952
the earned kind and bought kind are the same no?


[10-Mar-19 01:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I’m doing this if I can.  Setting up a Corp tomorrow or Tuesday with Sam.  (RadioARRR tomorrow).  👍

@Meyse you’re a gem for finding this gem.


[10-Mar-19 01:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085

This allows for varying rewards for varying playstylrs but also


[10-Mar-19 01:18 PM] FishyGuts#5085
For the economy to allow for sales and switching across economies.  Gaming the economies would be what a large % of the players would play for.


[10-Mar-19 01:20 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Sell their earned / grinded items for real cash.


[10-Mar-19 01:20 PM] Meyse#0952
i dont understand. a crypto is a crypto. you can earn GAMECOIN by playing, and you can buy GAMECOIN. with this GAMECOIN you can do/buy all kinds of stuff in your game (NFTs, etc.), you can also sell these NFTs and such for GAMECOIN. GAMECOIN is traded with other cryptocurrencies. The more player there are in your game -> the more buying pressure there is, the more the value of GAMECOIN rises


[10-Mar-19 01:21 PM] FishyGuts#5085
K.  I hear what you’re saying. 
My question is how to bring value to a dICO token.  What’s the link/in game purpose?


[10-Mar-19 01:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As opposed to making a kickstarter and having people only interact with the token economy once the game releases?


[10-Mar-19 01:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Would seem to curb legal issues of selling a “token for a future perceived value”.  
Remember I am in USSA 😉


[10-Mar-19 01:26 PM] Meyse#0952
Ahh you are being held back by laws and such. But this is new territory, maybe some people dont care about it.

You can sell the coins for BTC/KMD, then the people who have the coins can shill the game, because they want the game to be good too and have lots of players, so their value in GAMECOIN rises. And you can sell special NFTs for GAMECOIN etc etc.


[10-Mar-19 01:27 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I hear ya.


[10-Mar-19 01:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I’m thinking more along the lines of creating the underlying tech for companies to license / use. 

To write design code test and release games is no small or cheap task.


[10-Mar-19 01:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But making the blockchain piece for gaming companies to tie into is great for many reasons.


[10-Mar-19 01:28 PM] FishyGuts#5085
They can take care of the hard exepmsive@oart while integration with KMD tech takes care of economies and cheaters.


[10-Mar-19 01:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Something like that.


[10-Mar-19 01:29 PM] Meyse#0952
Hmm okay, this target group is not interesting for me (tech companies and such) haha, I would like to see people who just want to create games are able to just do that without any hassle


[10-Mar-19 01:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Now if twilight or others have legit game ideas and legs , that’s a different story.


[10-Mar-19 01:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Yeah so im@woth you.


[10-Mar-19 01:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
100%


[10-Mar-19 01:29 PM] FishyGuts#5085
1,000%


[10-Mar-19 01:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But I also want to see KMD tech recieve the use and acknowledgment it can earn/deserves.  It’s a two sided attack.


[10-Mar-19 01:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
This demo is to show capabilities.


[10-Mar-19 01:30 PM] Meyse#0952
true true


[10-Mar-19 01:30 PM] FishyGuts#5085
And other game devs twilight knows can go to town.


[10-Mar-19 01:31 PM] FishyGuts#5085
At the same time.   @n2okpride can take the demo to big places like activisipn and Ubisoft to pitch the underlying tech strengthening their games.

I have just finished sorting 200+ small models, gave them a shared material, and optimized their outlines, so its going pretty fast


[10-Mar-19 01:34 PM] Meyse#0952
ouch thats sounds like a shitjob haha


[10-Mar-19 01:34 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
it is, but long live dragging shit to a folder, ctrl-A, and adjust properties, plus experience with naming things


[10-Mar-19 01:34 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
half of gamedev is doing tasks as these.


[10-Mar-19 01:35 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
they call it "pipeline" preparation


[10-Mar-19 01:36 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
thats why if you have a dedicated modeler you get all geometry right, and a level designer usually does this

@Regnar they could, but  but there isn't much elevation change in this demo.


[10-Mar-19 08:32 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
units have a line of sight, but there is a maximum zoom out level and the difficulty doesn't lie that much in scouting at the moment


[10-Mar-19 08:33 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
However, a simple trick would just do give certain objects a blocking / absorbing collider that simply the raycast from the unit would render useless in order to block vision

haha wildlife to hunt.  i watched an ultima online interview a cpl months ago about this aspect of their game when they started out.
the tl;dw; is they had to remove it cos players just went around killing wildlife, even though it had no effect on game scores

ICO have heaps of regulation bs.  correct.
might one day be considered scalping, plus heaps of fraud.

decentralized crowdfund, though - different story.   can have blockchain enforced/validated early access or bonus-multiplier in different eras of the game.  e.g. 
support crowdfund with $5 ...
support crowdfund with $20, get 1.1 multiplier after block 50k, get 1.2 multiplier after block 250k.
support crowdund with $50 get 1.2 multiplier after block 50k, get 1.25 multiplier after block 250k +  gift a $5 crowdfunder with multiplier 1.2 after block 250k

lots of crowdfund gift mulitplier possibiliites.

When you click on the ground and a unit moves there, there should be a little circle where you clicked I think no?

@Regnar hahaha, I would, but setting up a kickstarter or dICO would take probably 3 months or so; I would totally love to completely finish this, but I already spend a some resources on this (too much than I should've xD xD)


[11-Mar-19 04:43 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Its fun, but small things eat a lot of time; and a MVP will take at least a week.


[11-Mar-19 04:44 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
So, just the basics and moving forward 😛 the initial idea was a simple Warcraft 2 clone; and I already have spies, killable animals, multiple units, skill trees, formation AI and all kinds of other stuff.

Anything we can do to make things easier for game devs?


[11-Mar-19 05:21 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I think I already made a contribution, I integrated Unity with Komodo - and basically writing up a spec as WarChain is computing light for its API so it kinda becomes a SDK


[11-Mar-19 05:22 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
what definitely would help are incentives, but I think they are already being made (like firing up instances in a click)


[11-Mar-19 05:22 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Probably, in general, video tutorials 😛


[11-Mar-19 05:30 AM] Regnar#6164
Ahh good to know. Obviously we want to make it all as easy as possible, videos I think are in the works, i know dev documents are being built out on https://developers.komodoplatform.com/  maybe we should include a section for games too including the unity stuff

wouldn't that also be something for Komodo because gaming is also in focus???


[11-Mar-19 08:40 AM] Regnar#6164
What's the thought on dual currency in games? For example in game playing to get WAR, betting in KMD, or random treasure chest with KMD in it. I dont think there are any blockchain games with multiple currencies integrated like that, though funding it would probably have to be creative

GDC would be this year a waste of money imo. But I personally feel that Komodo can do much more for gaming.

For example, a specifc community manager for gaming or at least accelerating it; attracting devs and speak their jargon.


[11-Mar-19 10:29 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh my I got an idea!


[11-Mar-19 10:42 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I think @Cryptofist wants to be that or create that .


[11-Mar-19 10:45 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ah, you're right


[11-Mar-19 10:46 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist what about that


[11-Mar-19 10:48 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Meyse are you going tomorrow?


[11-Mar-19 11:09 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I've been trying to fulfil that role as much as I can now.  😉


[11-Mar-19 11:10 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I learned a lot on how to handle that, just from assisting and showing you around last week  @TwilightPunkster K64.

Also Iooked at GDC. I thought it would be too hurried to try and get something together.

There's a con here in April though that might be wonderful to attend/exhibit/sponsor


[11-Mar-19 11:12 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
want my personal opinion?


[11-Mar-19 11:12 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Those events are expensive, time robbing and rarely effective unless you spend a lot of money. Instead of doing that, take a fraction of that and do more awesome things


[11-Mar-19 11:14 AM] Meyse#0952
@TwilightPunkster K64 of course I'm going tomorrow, gonna present gambling app


[11-Mar-19 11:15 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
ah ok, I might get my injections earlier, so if I am not entirely in agony, I might come along


[11-Mar-19 11:16 AM] Meyse#0952
Alright cool, hope you can make it


[11-Mar-19 11:17 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Cryptofist instead of cons, do meetups with things like this (only with Ethereum/web3 xD)

Indeed. I've ran a con(horror) and attended them. They are a crapshoot for all parties.


[11-Mar-19 11:20 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@TwilightPunkster K64 yep


[11-Mar-19 11:24 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm gaining my footing here and in my schedule, setting up some meet ups keeps crossing my mind as well as some smaller in person e deavors. 
Alot of the gaming community(as in players),
 would be interested to see this stuff.  Dropping into game shops feels beneficial to me.  (Acquiring Micro influencers)

no triggered rerendering on change


[11-Mar-19 11:37 AM] fmproductions#2904
maybe another object is blocking, but then to raycast all elements should usually work


[11-Mar-19 11:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
nah, its unity ass hat implemention


[11-Mar-19 11:37 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
there is like mouseexit mouseover methods too, but those are all about fisher price things

Absolutely, i lurked in crypto for close to a year before speaking up


[11-Mar-19 02:35 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
but I like powerful, uptempo music


[11-Mar-19 02:36 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically what I call "shit-that-makes-me-feel-like-a-fucking-hero" genre

Understood!


[11-Mar-19 02:38 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
mhm, to make this game more appealing, I think it needs a 4:3 look


[11-Mar-19 02:43 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@fmproductions the reason why UI objects are bitching with raycasting isn't object related, but caused by some form of "z-fighting" only for the cursor.

Elves:
"Back to the pit, foul beast"
"I'll end you and with it, your smell"
"Onwards, slay these green bastards"
"Hahahaha, all your base are belong to us"
"Disgusting."
"It reeks like Orc around here."
"Blow them into the ground. Where they belong."
"No... no... Noo!"
"My end.. by the hands of these creatures.."
<damage sounds>
<combat sounds>
- wolf (cry, growl, panting)
- bear (roar, growl aggressive, growl warning)
- tortoise (aggressive, passive)
- lion (growl, roar)
- raccoon (passive/ambient like)

Tzar is an awesome game


[11-Mar-19 05:57 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@n2okpride a super puzzle fighter? Got a title you were especially in love with?


[11-Mar-19 05:57 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I am personally a big fan of Dungeon Keeper Gold.


[11-Mar-19 05:58 PM] Regnar#6164
I have been thinking about useful features for blockchain games to have, I think having easy access to multiplayer information like PvP results, and a really simple way to get a Streaming key (like for Twitch) would be huge. I'm not sure what information will be visible on a block explorer, so having a way to read match results would really help with leaderboard and gambling sites . And the streaming key (OBS is open source <https://obsproject.com/>) would be helpful for getting the word out and showing the gameplay.


[11-Mar-19 05:59 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm pretty new to "streaming" games, so I'm not sure what exactly goes into the key. I figured you'd have more info on that, but overall I think it could prove useful to help spread awareness


[11-Mar-19 05:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Regnar I got a record button on my laptop that makes instant MP4 in 720p or 1080p, sadly I don't have Discord Nitro (so I need to crop stuff and hit that 5mb limit)


[11-Mar-19 06:00 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
or do you mean for Twitch?


[11-Mar-19 06:00 PM] Regnar#6164
Twitch is what I was thinking


[11-Mar-19 06:00 PM] Regnar#6164
for live streaming


[11-Mar-19 06:00 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
lol and who would do the streaming


[11-Mar-19 06:00 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I am not a fit person for that, I am horrible


[11-Mar-19 06:00 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

more niche


[11-Mar-19 06:01 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
blockgame version; with leaderboard?


[11-Mar-19 06:01 PM] n2okpride#1967
but after tetris it should be columns then super puzzle bobble


[11-Mar-19 06:02 PM] n2okpride#1967
yes! and 1on1 betting


[11-Mar-19 06:02 PM] Regnar#6164
but I'm more talking about building those types of easy integrations, like if there is a simple way to generate a Twitch key. Komodo games could have a feature to give access to a Twitch key to players right in the settings (should the developer choose to incorporate it)


[11-Mar-19 06:02 PM] n2okpride#1967
capcom tried to reboot it as a mobile game but abandoned it again sadly


[11-Mar-19 06:02 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
heh, well maybe KMD rises to the moon so instead of a lambo I'd just work a whole year just making games.


[11-Mar-19 06:03 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
the big studios have shareholders, so they need over 35% return.


[11-Mar-19 06:03 PM] Regnar#6164
the 5% rewards you can use for the lambo


[11-Mar-19 06:03 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
5% rewards?


[11-Mar-19 06:03 PM] Regnar#6164
KMD


[11-Mar-19 06:03 PM] Regnar#6164
it accrues 5.1% yearly on itself


[11-Mar-19 06:03 PM] Regnar#6164
claim it once a month


[11-Mar-19 06:03 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Regnar I am here just for a week, haven't really read into the details


[11-Mar-19 06:04 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh, thats nice


[11-Mar-19 06:05 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I basically have two "dream games" I'd love to create, but can't because of copyright


[11-Mar-19 06:05 PM] Regnar#6164
ahh well yea, if you have some KMD. Use Agama or another wallet that will let you claim rewards and it will grow with more KMD every second. Just claim it once a month (press a button on the wallet)


[11-Mar-19 06:05 PM] Regnar#6164
which ones?


[11-Mar-19 06:05 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
One is dungeon keeper gold and the other one is Star Fox


[11-Mar-19 06:05 PM] Regnar#6164
ohhh star fox


[11-Mar-19 06:05 PM] Regnar#6164
just make "star Badger"


[11-Mar-19 06:05 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
I have some KMD, but its like from tips I got here.


[11-Mar-19 06:05 PM] Regnar#6164
ah yea I don't know if the tipbot accrues rewards

Maybe a list of games and dICO's per title wouldn't that be a cool thing?


[11-Mar-19 06:08 PM] Regnar#6164
yea, you'd have to have a token to trade for the funds in the dICO model though


[11-Mar-19 06:09 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
oh, I wouldn't even go into that kind of detail, I just love tech and games (mostly games)


[11-Mar-19 06:09 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
that kind of stuff is more for the crypto economist kind


[11-Mar-19 06:09 PM] Regnar#6164
dICOs are all atomic swaps, coin for coin. Makes sense for selling NFTs to raise funds for a game though, plus I think it would be much more friendly legal wise, as they are buying an asset that has a function (in game) and isn't for speculation... 😉

there isn't a blockgame store

there should a game store for blockchain powered games xD

and also the blockchain game assets, to include p2p stuff like full characters.

@TwilightPunkster K64 - that’s what I was talking about yesterday.

$CREDS chain.   dICO for an online arcade and game store.


[11-Mar-19 06:51 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@FishyGuts well, Komodo Team has been super supportive regarding my game dev, so my bet is that they would love that too.


[11-Mar-19 06:51 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

I’ve already written down some plans


[11-Mar-19 06:54 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
you probably need to write proposals, as you most likely have to attract funds before you can pull that off.


[11-Mar-19 06:55 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and a reel of games


[11-Mar-19 06:55 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
finished games, not half assed ones


[11-Mar-19 06:56 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
basically around 30-45 titles on launch, else you'd be a studio, and 10-15 releases monthly.


[11-Mar-19 06:56 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
That's one full time job for you, cap.

Yes, just a base level for save game data for portability across platforms.


[11-Mar-19 09:20 PM] Mylo#8306
Simple solution.
If gamestate and rules are onchain, cross play also much easier because of unified data format (protocol + state) for a game, its characters etc.


[11-Mar-19 09:22 PM] Mylo#8306
Tools like construct.net where game rules are GUI programmed/ easily scripted can live as a json description.  If you follow


[11-Mar-19 09:25 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
well, simple solutions end up in me documenting stuff xD


[11-Mar-19 09:26 PM] Mylo#8306
We can create this with no fan fare.   New chain, billion coins in a faucet.  Game dev and players can all access faucet for tx to enable save game features.
Any ingame economy can be at token level with little or no relationship to underlying coin.


[11-Mar-19 09:26 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and I hate documenting


[11-Mar-19 09:27 PM] Mylo#8306

At game integration level, I hear ya.

[11-Mar-19 11:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
so, if we look at all the things are set in motion, yet haven't been born yet, all I see its just a resources issue.


[11-Mar-19 11:07 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Now, what if we create a whole chain that is pragmatic, intuitive, for the people by the people that is an end-to-end solution.


[11-Mar-19 11:19 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
So for starters, Team Komodo provided me with some resources to make an infinite amount of royalty free games (thanks @Team  Admin). As you probably have noticed, I can make games, and so can others. What needs to be in place are turnkey solutions - plugins and tutorials to onboard people to create content. 

Now, who have noticed, I did manage to create a bare bones Unity plugin with ease, and a little logical layer on top of that. However, before that is properly "usable", that will take at least some days of my dedicated time, probably some weeks to actually create decent tutorials for it. However, this missing link can be a driver, as it is one of the most popular engines for indie game developers.

Eventually games need to be published somewhere so players can find them and purchase them (either through single fee or monthly subscription), which could be bought either through KMD and maybe support other coins that are "powered by Komodo". Not just games, but related can be tools - like Itch.io

All this stuff is easy, but it will cost time, resources like money and hardware. I am willing to pitch in where I can but remember I am (partially) human, so I can do only so much.

For example, my brother from another mother @TonyL uses Linux. At this point, I have to wait a whole hour to switch platforms. That kinda sucks, There are plenty of Linux users out there, who'd love games. So I'd definitely would vouch for a "build" pipeline that makes life easier. But that would take at least 2 grand at bare minimum, and trust me, you don't want bare minimum.

[11-Mar-19 11:25 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Now, take something simple like beta testing (thank you @FishyGuts and @Cryptofist), which is cool, but that stuff should be done with forms and at very least a fucking Trello plus an issue tracker. All these tiny things require often a microservice to be in place.


[11-Mar-19 11:27 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Yet, everyone loves multiplayer. Which is cool, but basically that stuff is expensive as fuck. Either you get stuck with DIY or vendorlocking cloud services. Either way, to support a huge amount of players, bet on burning 5K at least just to fire shit up. Remember demos and funky dunky apps are not production apps. It takes next level shit.


[11-Mar-19 11:29 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Now, you don't want just games, you want people to adopt the technology; this means streaming, creating added-value content. You can't do a good video with crap sound or a bad camera; this might work for a random video, but sadly us humans aren't cats (no near that cute factor purrrr).


[11-Mar-19 11:30 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
(also if someone disagrees about the networking stuff, imagine the things that aren't blockchain related - builds, chat service, etc.)


[11-Mar-19 11:32 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Probably you are gonna need some dedicated people who can manage community and distribute information; creating visibility and moment. Evangelist are great, but great battles are won when people connect with each other; together we are strong. But beer and pizza are sadly not free either.

networking.  noted.   i wrote low level comms stuff 15 years ago and our dPoW service and marketmaker v2 uses bittorrent DHT to punch holes thru NAT.
i miss the old LAN style games, but now requiring a connction to the net to play locally is bollocks.

what is this "linux build pipeline" that takes 1 hour to switch, you mean reboot and get in the flow?   or does it take a while to build the game and the content into a package?   what kind of specs?


[11-Mar-19 11:35 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
No, when you create a game in a game engine, you need to "port" for a target build. Also rebooting is often not an option, as the perfect solution is to build in parallel.


[11-Mar-19 11:35 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Unity has Cloud Build but it does come with some "caveats"


[11-Mar-19 11:36 PM] Mylo#8306
"port" = corss compile?


[11-Mar-19 11:36 PM] Mylo#8306
*cross


[11-Mar-19 11:37 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Also, you want for a games outlet that game developers can provide games, but also update them. This would be easy like with a bdiff tool.

[12-Mar-19 04:09 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Oh, tiny note, I am going to talk about this game at a local event, if some of you are going somewhere like a meetup and want to do a lightning talk and demo this game (almost done), DM me. Make sure its a registered meetup, as @Cryptofist and @FishyGuts somehow enjoy writing stuff, so that might be a good thing to cover that exposure.

(Just one demand - don't superhero me, I am just a person that happened to be at the right time, the right place with the right amount of time. So if someone asks who did it, say @TonyL - which is true facts, because he helped me make it happen)

@TwilightPunkster K64 at your request I ripped all the stuff about you outof it, which when originally written it was a bit longer. So I then waitied and added more and it works quite well I think.  I'd still like to share your intial experience about finding and deciding on KMD.

First we set up a base camp, prepare our requirements, careful but bluntly emboss our objectives and look at our milestones for the upcoming year. We will move hard, yet without rush.

Now having said that, Team Komodo has provided us with resources to produce content, along with supportive community members like @FishyGuts to make gaming a first class citizen. We don't only believe this is good for the community, but to bring the world to the inevitable future of cryptocurrency.

This morning a short brainstorm session, three powerful words to deliver the message that will encapsulate the vision ahead. Now a little time with my son, as working hard is important but that great things happen through the people who empower us and charge us to make a change. Expect great things. Magic.

So, here is the super update.


[17-Mar-19 10:28 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
1. Games
========================================================


[17-Mar-19 10:31 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Adding to "powered by Komodo" will by my own developed RPG, which I've been partially porting to use Tokens CC (cc-assets here, Token CC in the docs), probably considering cc-oracles and cc-heir), which has MMO capabilities. Probably will take a month or so to finish.


[17-Mar-19 10:32 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Secondly, a racing game that focuses on custom made tracks, ghost rider bets at super high speed - thank you @Meyse for that idea. Most likely be finished somewhere this week.


[17-Mar-19 10:34 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Two fast arcade shooters; one a zombie survival (like Resident Evil's mercenaries) where you have to survive for a certain amount of time and you can extend time by finding hourglasses. The other being a doom-like shooter, where you play as a humanoid komodo dragon in an intergalactic war.

[17-Mar-19 10:36 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
In the RTS department, a re-factor of WarChain; everyone in this channel has already seen this going around in this channel.


[17-Mar-19 10:38 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
For the sake of insanity, a set of smaller, extendable classic top-down RPG's, most likely going to use some old doujinshi material I've written. Basically, pointy haired heroes, magical legendary swords, monsters.


[17-Mar-19 10:38 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
One brawling game, but still have to work out the details on that one.


[17-Mar-19 10:39 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
A bunch of platform shooters - metroid classic type - aimed for speedrunning.


[17-Mar-19 10:46 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
2. SDK's and more
========================================================
Primarily the focus are on Unity development, because well, I work in Unity. Yet the SDK's should be super duper portable, but all small things need to be set up. I've been using Odin Inspector to make a sexy tool that fetches news, updates, but also can install "modules", straight from git, but its fairly bare bones. To call it a SDK, takes a while to be tested, and I prefer to focus on quality and turnkey, instead of massive features. Never the less, the Unreal variant should match functionality. The high level layer 6AME (6AM Enhanced) has a dedicated dude working on the documentation and some optimization, writing out some tutorials, and I'll orchestrate something crazy so there is stuff to be distributed on the YouTubes, because that is what kids like these days. The SDK development will mostly be on-the-fly as I work on the games, finding the use cases for crypto condition contracts as I go. The SDK's will be **open source** for anyone to improve and tamper with; at this point there are like 400 things I like to add, so bear with me; probably up somewhere this week.


[17-Mar-19 10:52 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
3. Awesome things and PR stuff
========================================================
Making cool stuff is one, but making sure they are getting noticed are equally important. So, I got myself a decent haircut and hoodie sweater. Yes, it aint much, but a lot better than my former grunge look (which I have grown fond upon, but hey... team stuff ya know).
To make turnkey things possible, we are going to need make blockchain - and specifically the Komodo solution - understandable for mortals. These things can be in small details; like one liners for solutions like oracles or an onboarding into blockchain for gaming. For this a little PR strategy is important. Of course this is going to be streamlined with Komodo Team, so its still decentralized team thingies, but we don't want to shock Steve. Yes, more presentation, less disfuckingclaimer stuff.


[17-Mar-19 10:54 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
4. Game Store
========================================================
Sorry, but we are going to need more control on the outlets where we put our games. So we are going to roll our own. Yes, you read that right. We are going to build a genuine virtual arcade hall and bring those babies to the world. Intuitive design, sexy buttons, super duper ultra performance and a lot of eye candy. Working towards that.


[17-Mar-19 10:55 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Good morning, and Sam is now going to take a shower, head over to our local news city, talk with some important people and head back down to the Hague to talk to our president (jk jk jk)

@Surfer007 the current game reels are native apps, so yes, the store will be a website (but probably create a native app too).

minor note a screamer of a game has roughly 50k downloads, where the target is between 100k and 250k. Those are the ones that get nominated.

tyvm  I did not mention Unity3d in it for (hopefully) obv reasons

@Mylo yup, I think also that the tooling should not just focus on Unity but also include Unreal. Working on that though 😂😂😂

Alrighty, time for the update! So, I am wrapping some stuff up, to make sure everything good in the legal department with a privately held entity (games, intellectual property, yada yada). I made a massively big boillerplate that allows me to whip out games fast and easy. Meanwhile in the batcave today, UX and UI wizards are thinking about the arcade hall and every fancy buttons. As you all know already, that crazy stuff is already named and baptized with Komodore64. I set up a blank Twitter account, @komodoregames don't expect much interaction at this point, but slowly towards the end of this week, things will become more "tangible".


[19-Mar-19 11:56 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533

[19-Mar-19 11:59 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Last update for this morning; I managed to setup a streamer setup; microphone, camcorder, HDMI capturing, etc., which makes it possible to create a lab design the streaming process of the games as we go. Since Twitch, YouTube and others probably have heavily moderation and are overcrowded, I was thinking about to roll our own. I also read somewhere two smart peoples invented the flux capacitator that allows streaming over the blockchain with Komodo, so that's pretty awesome.

If Komodore64 arcade is going to be a website, do you have any thoughts on what type of wallet you will use? preferably not hot wallets, for liability purposes, maybe see if we can integrate Magnum or Guarda browser extension wallets? @PTYX any idea on this?


[20-Mar-19 06:41 AM] Regnar#6164
But likely need a custom wallet (maybe similar style as magnum/guarda, where keys are stored locally) but supports the various blockgames or gamechains coins and assets or w.e.

If we can use Agama it could be more flexible as a proof of concept and then later that can be integrated into fancier guis. Although Agama would be a hotwallet unless the user uses a cold storage address as a watch-only


[20-Mar-19 06:54 AM] Regnar#6164
I was thinking it would be more like Metamask. You access it just to make main transactions in crypto. The blockgame assets would still need their own wallet, the Komodore wallet

@Meyse thanks for clearing that up

Now, regarding all the "details" around Komodore64, remember, we barely started all this fuzz up, I actually don't have a desk yet at The Hague Tech, but progress comes in small details. So, I rather disclose details about the what, how and why's when we are off the drawing table; I can't spend the day discussing details, so I try to give a daily update about things we are doing.

Secondly, @Meyse came with a horrible idea for a horrible gameplay that became something awesome. Now, we figured out the streaming part, we are talking with The Hague Tech about a streaming studio, had a brief meeting with a talented photographer who loves streaming technology and basically just as crazy, a phone call with an experienced PR/Event Manager in gaming, who also happens to be an ace in marketing.

Also, a poster was stuck on my front door with a super nintendo controller saying "Sleep, Eat, Repeat", we were partially dancing and not to forget, a really awesome talk to secure some financial stuff. I also had horrible chinese food in our local china town, talking with a high up municipality dude talking about shaping the future. Oh, I forced three people to install Chameleon.

Just finished up a new part of 6AME, which is now an integral part of the Unity SDK


[20-Mar-19 03:34 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
When you create logic in 6AME, its stored as an Unity asset, which makes them really easy to migrate from Unity versions. I am currently working to make its editing way more user friendly; however its runtime is still very, very beta.

@Paul - This here is exactly what I was talking about with to @TwilightPunkster K64 a few weeks ago, and was my ultimate discovery goal with paying him to do WARCHAIN.

@Strob and I were discussing this in February.  
It just took the right person to find to make it happen, and I think @Meyse finding and bringing in @TwilightPunkster K64 at that meetup one day was the critical catalyst.  

He is the proverbial Rats tail to Komodo as it was to Final Fantasy I.

@Paul define "strong" ? They released one SDK for Unity that has barely been changed since last year. Bunch of games made by only self-funded indies that aren't even close to live playable or tested massively yet, with 100% vendor lock. And you still need Ethereum to transfer your ENJ from your wallet, so you still need to keep that secure. Also, they partnered AND locked themselves with Unity. Which is great, BUT... Unity isn't the only game engine around. Let's be honest, I love Unity, but its only secondary in performance compared to Unreal. That's just the bare fucking truth. Now, let's not mention all other engines, or even custom 3D engines. Oh, well. Enjin had the financial backing of kadzillion dollars and took two years to create a wallet. A wallet. Yes. I think we can expect maybe a gem, maybe five gems in the giant mountain of turds.

Actually, I want to apply for a lot of grants (a lot of the exist). However, they come with a lot of paperwork. At this moment, @Meyse and I are focusing on Komodore64 which will be the beginning, which now is mostly done in Unity. I really would like to develop with Unreal too, and definitely will work out the SDK port towards it; as the grant applies to that. However, that would require me to get at least two experienced developers in Unreal Engine that spend their time for a month to create a concept that can apply for a 100-250K grant , who have to sit somewhere, consume beans and pizza, work with high end machines. So, unless if someone is batshit crazy enough to drop 30Ks, I'll think I just focus on the tasks at hand 😉 There are plenty game ideas, but developers that can keep up with our insane velocity, workflow and open communication is a hard task. Also, don't underestimate that a good demo takes real time and effort; of course a smaller project will apply, but my aim is never to go for second place, but passing the test first time.

Also, some grant applications for Unreal games have been filed, so that's gonna be fun. I found a new 2D concept artist, the Unity SDK is being written out with video tutorials and such. Together with @Meyse we have a rollercoaster of ideas and things in the pipeline, @FishyGuts and @Mylo are strategizing some non-tech stuff, to make stuff work. So, since we got some serious things going, we both got a desk at The Hague Tech, a vibrant co-working environment, where magic is happening on the 4th floor. We are going to bring things to next level.

So, awake and alive, it has been a busy week. So, action plan is to recruit a 2D artist, secure some funds for that person to be onboard. Also working on the basic Komodore64 Virtual Console menu, which manages KPG's (Komodo Powered Games). Easy to use, turnkey and rock and roll.

This channel has inspired me to try and learn a bit more programming. Traditionally I only really do stats stuff (R, Python) but nothing really 'game friendly' got any recommendations for someone who is interested in building some little games on the side @TwilightPunkster K64 ?


[23-Mar-19 06:41 AM] Regnar#6164
Pygame seems pretty old and not sure about Phaser.js but there are some easy tutorials on it

lol doing codecademy for javascript right now...


[23-Mar-19 07:40 AM] Regnar#6164
doesn't seem too tricky or different from python


[23-Mar-19 07:44 AM] Regnar#6164
by that I mean it seems intuitive


[23-Mar-19 07:52 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
want to have solid good advice?


[23-Mar-19 07:54 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Learn Unreal or Unity (C++ or C#), its always uncomfortable to learn new things, but Unity is easy to learn and someone here happens to have a working SDK that could need a tester and better an adopter.


[23-Mar-19 07:54 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
and C# is an easy language.


[23-Mar-19 07:57 AM] Regnar#6164
hmm good to know. I'll definitely look at that then

I'm going to look at C++, I figured I have some experience in higher level languages so I want to go lower, plus I have some particle photons to mess around with which are for C++ (currently I flashed them to run python)

Just like you have too think in bytes, hashes and transactions in blockchain, gamedev requires you to think in frames, budgets and mechanics.

So, the update of today. If you didn't knew, RedFOX Labs is accelerating projects in South East Asia, but but but, I had an awesome talk with @Bitcoin Benny. More news to come, so cooking up stuff in the kitchen. Meanwhile in the batcave, I have started to working on a long term plan for the gaming SDK's, and together with @FishyGuts thinking about a profile for us to set out. Thanks to @Mylo we got 90 days to bring our best out to apply for grants, and @Meyse keeps feeding me game ideas. Tomorrow, I've a meeting with a potential 2d artist, tuesday getting budgets, marketing and branding alive with cool stuff. Komodore64 has a way more retro look and the skillful fingers and help from our hero @n2okpride are praised with hands reaching the roof. It's sunday, and we are cooking, planning, moving, hyping and fired up.

Together we are strong.

Today's grand news - just kidding. Offices tuned, gamified and a boilerplate of 270Gb of game assets pure for fun and profit, and wrapping up the last parts of it. Pretty much, we can now build almost *anything*. Hardware set up, and we have a rough plan of things; hopefully our team gets an extra power up, so fingers crossed. I made a small plan for world domination and bought some donuts. Keeping ya'll posted!

RPG's are the most intensive games to create. We got funding, and budget, but money burns fast and we have a lot of things to do. If you want to support us, believe in proper investment, holla at me or @FishyGuts. Our fridge is supported already by 5 KMD, and our operational stuff, well, you'll hear more on friday

Have you played any of these IO games @TwilightPunkster K64 ?


[26-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Regnar#6164
there's two in particular I'm very fond of, surviv.io and krunker.io  Those are the URLs the games are at, every time you go to it, it assigns you to a server to play in.


[26-Mar-19 11:01 AM] Regnar#6164
Surviv is a top down battle royale style, and Krunker is like a blocky 1st person shooter


[26-Mar-19 12:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Slither.io was my kids fave when younger because they could get it to work at school 😛


[26-Mar-19 12:16 PM] ronyi#5719
agar.io, superhex.io, hexagor.io


[26-Mar-19 03:08 PM] Regnar#6164
I wonder what type of engine those games are generally built on


[26-Mar-19 04:18 PM] Chipmoon#7477
my fav is starblast.io

Just wanted to do a placeholder website until Tpunk and the team can get the finality in sight.  Will finish it up today.  Again, just basic and for informational purposes only.. for submitting grant applications and such.   NOT the official site.

So the update of today! A lot of meetings, calls, investors, development, planning... we are working towards a website, and we are creating a profile pictures of the team, writing texts and so on. Meanwhile at after hours, I am working on the SDK's and the game content. Last weeks have been a wild rollercoaster ride.

Yup, to make things properly happen though takes a lot of things. We already had to make some serious investments, and remember we have been just been doing this for some weeks (first week with desks).

Today's update: the formula 1 team has been assembled. We have decided that we will not use typical titles, but descriptions that tell you the stuff we do. Like fighter pilots have Maverick, Iceman, Goose, Viper, we are going for those instead.


[29-Mar-19 01:33 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
The core team: Sam (Tech), Max (Creative), Willem (Numbers), Renzo (Promo), Miranda (Operations), Ryan (Growth). We now have 2 assisting game developers, Simon and Otgoo, our concept artist Nik and our media magician Kenny.


[29-Mar-19 01:34 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
We made photos yesterday, we are working on the website, the reel of games and all the things that brings our profile out in the open.


[29-Mar-19 01:40 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Thanks to @Team  Admin who have super duper supported us in getting started up, @Mylo helping out in the shadows, and not to fucking forget the 35K boost from @KomodoWorld and  financial backing, support and endless energized @FishyGuts (Growth), we were able to secure the base of Komodore64. @Regnar even though not in k's, your 5 KMD for the fridge is just as important 😃 

Together we are strong.  Now let's disrupt, let's build, lets spread and take over the fucking world.

Thank you @n2okpride - I will keep that in mind for future.   I think TPunk has someone working on an official site.   Mine was just going to be VERY basic.   Im glad he didn't like it 😂


[29-Mar-19 02:21 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
😎 its not that I didnt like it or at all appreciate the effort. We are working to get things streamlined, which just takes time; its the ocean that makes it difficult to sync properly. If it was up to me some people would fly in and we'd be super efficient, yet we have to be careful to burn money. We have funding and great things in the pipeline, but flights and residence are an investment and I rather spend the budget wisely.

Alright. Great day. Daylight savings are funny, so amping up the velocity. Lotsa work has been done and much more needs to be done. So today a lot of work into the composition of the website, the reel - but also preparations for the upcoming week. Like freeing up my hands to prepare the operational things to run this all. Even though most things have been set up, the devil is in the detail.

Alright, so Twitter set up, a bunch of videos made and making notes, plans and stuff at the same time. The office has finally got trashcans, and 2 months before we move to the new office. Meanwhile finalizing the Unity SDK, and making some plans for next week. We're going as fast as we can, but sadly there are only 72 hours in a single day. Be patient, we are moving forward.

A minor accident created some delay in things. But that wont stop the music. Komodore64 is moving forward. We are writing up a whitepaper, setting up a website and gearing everything into motion. With partnerships in place, the team working hard to make gaming ready for the next level. A lot hasn't been displayed yet, such as the look and feel of the Komodo for Unity SDK, which embeds the 6AME language to quickly develop games that are powered by Komodo blockchain. We are moving as fast as we can. ❤✌😎

<https://krunker.io> is a cool block type game with rewards in it called KR. They aren't on chain or anything but I wonder if we could make something like that, or get them to use Komodo for their KR


[07-Apr-19 11:23 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm not sure of the specifics of how the SDK would help them integrate that, but would the SDK have tools for current games to easily switch current in-game credits to a blockchain based on?


[07-Apr-19 01:04 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Regnar migration tools are not part of the SDK, however every coder understands the process of refactoring. If they use Unity or Unreal, it should be painless. However, in a perfect world, we'd help them to migrate

[07-Apr-19 01:06 PM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
The philosophy behind the SDK is that we enable game developers to develop games with Komodo with ease and turnkey. Thats why we are creating materials and guides too, kind of like Loom does, with less buzz, fuzz and more pragmatic. However that will take some time.

We are going to need about 100 testers for UltraFighter K64. As a requirement, it is mandatory you have some experience with blockchain, you are computer savvy enough to know your system specs (these will be required to make a "supported" list). You can find our Discord invite link in #komodore64, do ping me there.

A hard day of work here at @komodoregames where we are preparing #UltraFighter #K64 for upcoming friday.  On Apr 19 we will demonstrate this fast paced #flightgame that brings back that #arcade button bashing right back at your fingertips powered by @KomodoPlatform.

We are setting the #Komodo Gaming SDK out there on GitHub. This version is an early release with @KomodoPlatform and #Unity support, and not intended to be production ready at all. Still, great news though!  #K64

But I suppose someone could set up a Minecraft server with a mod to work with a Kmd NFT assetchain.

A Beginner’s Guide to Modding Minecraft (With Java)
In this post I’ll be explaining how to get started modding Minecraft. For the sake of this tutorial I’ll be working with Minecraft 1.7.10…
https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/IYCt1_5P_89_mo2oLJxZcbJXS2seD9bEBb-d6VR5QHE/https/miro.medium.com/max/856/1%2AJb5TWvHxFdVSTNqhQHJnFQ.png


[16-Jan-20 02:29 PM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
It looks like in order to integrate an nft with minecraft it will need to be done in java.


[16-Jan-20 02:30 PM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
maybe the token keys would need to be added as a block attribute?


[16-Jan-20 02:31 PM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
If that was the case, then this could be something quite unique. It would easily allow individual blocks and items to register as NFT and be traded via atomic dex, I hope.


[16-Jan-20 02:33 PM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Right now there is an official market, using a centralized pay token, and an unofficial market as well. User accounts are sold, as well as access to adventures and minigames, and game skins, but no individual unique items.


[16-Jan-20 02:48 PM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
The minecraft brand seems to be fairly extensive. Modding is encouraged and there are several custom servers where users play with their own mods, as well as minecraft learn to code sites for children. As was mentioned in an above medium link, a user prestonplayz, his company pulls in 14 million a year by producing youtube videos, merchandising, and selling various mods and games on his custom minecraft servers. There is a very healthy market for NFT minecraft, would love to see it traded via an in game dex.


[17-Jan-20 02:01 PM] Regnar#6164
yea I need to read up on Minecraft, it would certainly be cool to get nSPV wallets working, basically using Minecraft as a GUI/interface to spend. and the nSPV stuff is on the back end. Commands in minecraft wrap the RPCs. Probably just need things like `login` `logout` `spend` `getnewaddress` and `listunspent`

I agree with regnar about the python nspv wallet being a good way to integrate in. In order to use the nft with minecraft, it might be able to work creating these datapacks. Datapacks are in json I believe. I even found an example of someone creating an in game coin (minecoin) with some basic wallet features. But a kmd assetchain datapack would I assume save nft system state.

Dont know if dev-games is the right place, but here goes. I'm wondering if this is already possible with Komodo's CC's, probably oracle-cc, and others? Im thinking of creating (I actually already started on branding/ui) a betting application where groups of friends can bet on outcomes of sports matches, for now Im gonna keep it easy and only football matches, and the users can only make unique predictions. So either 1 of them is right, or all are wrong (and all get their coins back). I think this will simplify for now. If someone can give me feedback if this is already technically possible, I appreciate it. 

Reliable football data feeds would be important for the oracle-cc. 5mins before a game starts no more predictions can be placed (ui or blockchain enforced?). Reliable handling of outlier situations like when a match is postponed or cancelled. 

I cant post pictures so here a link to a little graph of how I would imagine it to be:

This idea actually came from something I really want for quite some time now. Before a soccer match my friends and me always make a prediction, but it has to be a unique prediction, so you gotta be fast too to get a "good" one. But there are never really consequences for it if, but if actually money would be involved (coins), in a user friendly and fast way to get in, I would really use it alot.

I think football matches are a bit more difficult cause the scores have way more variations, like 40-60 whatever. Instead with soccer its mostly 1-2, 1-1, etc.

@Slyris About the Komodo gaming sdk, was there ever any review of the Enjin sdk when designing the kmd sdk? Has there been a comparison between the two? In this link, it begins to describes how the Enjin sdk interfaces with the Minecraft framework, Enjin sdk uses Java and apparently so does Minecraft. 

https://blog.enjincoin.io/minecraft-java-sdk-development-update-9cd06bf8d074

Could komodo sdk also interface with Minecraft's Java code or api? Or would this require porting kmd sdk to Java?
Thanks

We would likely have to build a wrapper that connects the Komodo RPCs to the minecraft server but definitely possible. I haven't even touched minecraft since we were last talking about it, but it would be interesting to get an nSPV RPC wrapper for it.


[31-Mar-20 01:35 PM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
So here's what I'm thinking, I got donated some community funds. I wanted to sponsor a bounty towards advancing this conversation. I think there are a couple of interesting things here. 1 is potential kmd integration with the large Minecraft audience. The other avenue is integration with Enjin sdk or a clear migration path from ETH to kmd. If we were able to provide an integration with the Enjin sdk, Enjin devs or devs who use Enjin sdk, some might consider moving away from ETH. Having Enjin come to Komodo would be a great goal. So I have  mere 200 kmd to spend on this potential bounty. What information would be good to advance this conversation? Example: a review of Enjin sdk so as to be able to compare to kmd sdk?


[31-Mar-20 02:12 PM] Regnar#6164
I think we need to get whoever is working on the Komodo gaming SDK to come in and talk about what has already been done, no point in paying for something that has already happened

[06-Apr-20 05:49 PM] Regnar#6164
an infinite universe of micro planets, each planet, like in real life, requires energy to produce. to create a new planet you have to basically mine it.


[06-Apr-20 05:50 PM] Regnar#6164

I found a free and open source version of minecraft which has modding support, called Minetest.

Minetest modding guide<https://rubenwardy.com/minetest_modding_book/en/basics/getting_started.html>
Someone built a currency mod <https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=21339>


[20-Apr-20 10:16 AM] Regnar#6164
I've been looking through the modding docs and looks pretty straight forward. However, I'm not seeing too much on being able to interact with external servers or programs.


[20-Apr-20 10:17 AM] Regnar#6164
My initial thought was to be able to run commands from inside minetest chat (like this: <https://rubenwardy.com/minetest_modding_book/en/players/chat.html>) that perform commands on either a nSPV wallet via CLI or by making HTTP requests to a locally running python server (that interacts with nSPV)


[20-Apr-20 10:18 AM] Regnar#6164
I haven't found any docs that show this is possible. the commands seem to stay online on the minetest server. So if I can find a way for the server to interact with external program or http then we might be able to set up a "Discord tip bot" style that runs on the minetest server.

Looks like it might be pretty difficult <https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=10390>
```There's not much you can do to interact with a running server, except telling it to run the contents of a file every n seconds or similar.```
If that's the case, then perhaps there's a way to update contents of a `file` from chat prompt, that gets grabbed with Python.


[20-Apr-20 10:50 AM] Regnar#6164
for example:
In chat you say `send 1 KMD to <address>` that saves to a local file called `commands_to_execute.txt`, then a python script periodically scans that file, reads it's contents and executes the commands. Then the python file clears the `txt` file and periodically checks it again until the game isn't running anymore.

I think of the main issues with RFOX/KOGS is that they were looking for high liquidity market and the AtomicDEX just doesn't have that much volume at the time.


[03-Feb-21 03:42 PM] PTYX#6840
It's something we're working on and it's one of the main focus of this year. For their NFT to be successful and sell they needed a NFT market.

Hi, I'm starting a project to develop a NFT game. As an early kmd believer but non-techy person, I wuold like to know if kmd tech is ready to be used for this purpose. I've got a lot of questions but the most important is: It is possible to mint NFTs that can be transfered to other blockchains?

@tese This is a kmd based project dealing with NFT. They are currently building the tools (wallet, explorer, nft creation app, nSpv support) to use with KMD based NFT. I asked the same question a few days ago, yes it's possible. However dev resources will be needed to accomplish this.


[04-Apr-21 06:29 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
It's interesting that you say you are developing a game. I was just about to suggest we have a simple nft game available for Tokel launch or soon after.


[04-Apr-21 06:34 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
The idea for Tokel is that if you need a CC for your NFT game, then once the CC is developed, it will be included in Tokel with the other already available CC. There is a tokeltest chain currently to experiment on, including experimenting with new CC if you dev one


[04-Apr-21 06:42 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
I will also add, since Tokel is currently being built and conceptualized any suggestions on how you would like something to work are greatly appreciated. That doesn't mean they will automatically get adopted but who knows?


[04-Apr-21 09:32 PM] Mylo#8306
@tese NFT easy to create since 2019.  the tokel project will make it more accessible.  here is a tutorial i co-created  with kmd team from 2019 https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-tutorials/beginner-series-part-4.html#create-a-non-fungible-token - it may be out of date/unmaintained tutorial steps, so plz don't try to repeat the steps verbatim, but the underlying tech is there.

Komodo Developer Path | Understanding Tokens
Each Smart Chain in the Komodo ecosystem can act as a fully tokenizable platform. This provides many opportunities to the developer for creating on-chain assets that represent varying types of value for their users.

You start as an Argonian, by birthright, you are to grow and train from the egg to the swamp, learning the Art Of Komo-Don, the Ancient Ones Fighting & Magical abilities. Born on a planet called "ワールド オブ ドラゴンズ" or "World Of Dragons" you grow, learn spells, abilities, build a habitat, plant food, gain knowledge and communicate, travel, group with new friends and engage in fights, puzzles, and mini-games to level up your techniques and enhancements. PVP, PVE, side missions, lore, and easter eggs. NFT's are Armor, Weapons, Spells and certain items, and more goodies!! Choose from 10 Common Species upgrade for Uncommon, Rare, Legendary. Mythic creatures are very rare and can't be purchased, only found by finding and completing secret missions. Buy, sell, trade NFT's live, live market, There are 2 in-game currencies, Komodo, The Main Coin and, "Komo-Toshi" used for most purchases. The planet is divided into 10 main areas to explore, each will unlock as you progress, make time-based decisions that totally alter, your character, gameplay, and whether you run into a "Mythic" or not... Mini-games include Ade-Ko, a card game based on rock, paper, scissors, where you can choose specific NFT's to place in your deck...For instance, each game will; 1. Start with which table you want to play at, common, uncommon, rare, legendary, or Mythic. 2. Choose PVP or PVNPC 3. The "Games Guard" will announce the cost of the game depending on which table you start with. 4. You will be able to choose  3 cards, any mix, etc..2 weapon cards, 1 rock card, so forth, and so on. Armor = Rock, Item = Paper, Weapon = Scissors. You will have a set of 2 out of 3 card battles and the winner gets "Game Tickets to spend in the areas' main citys' "Gameroom" where you had the battle. The tickets you win will not be NFT's. You can, however, trade them in other areas but know, depending on your faction, group members, or "Komodo Type", you may or may not have a little trouble in certain areas. The tickets are to purchase NFT items in the category you won them in, common, uncommon, etc. Game 2 is "Aku-Ko, This game is triggered by finding tattered notes with emblems about komodo within an area where your level determines how easy or hard the questions are and you must remember the icon to place in order, Rules are as follows; 1. As you travel and encounter friends and foes, will find "Lore Scripts" throughout an area, once you find them all, you will be "summoned" to a place and you will start the game. 2. The game starts by popping up your notes/side missions where you will read the "Lore Scripts" in order and remember the emblem on each Script, You can always do this game/mission as it is not required to progress, but you only have one chance to do the side mission win or lose. Once you start, your notes will disappear and you must answer as many questions as Lore Scripts you found, and if you win you will receive game tickets and a common, uncommon or rare NFT. Game 3, As your story builds, you will have found an "Egg" on your journey, triggers after a specific event, and a boss battle. When this specific mission ends, you will be greeted by a mysterious Argonian that will guide you through a few encounters before you reach their abode. The Argonian, asks you of a few favors ended by a sub-boss and gang you will encounter throughout the game. When you return, they will teach you a "gift" the ability to grow and change the DNA of the species of the egg and how to hatch it. The mini-game requires you to play "Utero-Ko" a wheres waldo style game where you are timed but you must find 10 items needed to maximize the growth of your egg within the allotted time. You must find all 10 in order to win and get the common NFT. If you fail, you can do the mission, once every 24 hours, once you complete it, they will "disappear" for a while. Once you hatch your egg, it will be considered a travel companion and gives small bonuses depending on the type.


[13-Oct-21 12:11 AM] Franswa Andre#2142
Game 4: Liuef'r-Ko: When your "follower" gets to a certain age, "mission triggered", You will receive a note about further training your "follower". Note: In game 3, fails' will diminish the prizes' "worth", and you may or may not have the ability to choose either gender/type/style/color, etc. of your "follower" when it hatches, depends on choices up to this point. The note leads you to a shady character who offers you a few choices before they upgrade your "follower", After a few "encounters" the shady character will have you enter Liuef'r-Ko, an automated racing game where you pit your "follower" against 7 other "Runners", winning the first 3 games really give you an advantage as, before the race, you will receive a common NFT specifically for your "follower" to equip before the race. Win the first race, "you will, it's scripted, regardless of the first three games. This game also saves the best race time. After this, you will be able to find races, other types of "Runners" and you will be able to bet with "Komo-Toshi" against NPC, Players or both. Each race you enter after this sceanrio.


[13-Oct-21 12:23 AM] Franswa Andre#2142
Will ask you to choose common, uncommon, etc, as you can level up and upgrade your "follower" to a full-fledged companion or max out at evolution levels. Game 5: Suqix-Ko, This is an Arena Battle where you can fight PVP or PVE within your chosen Rarity Level. You choose 3 characters, armor up, and fight other groups. This game is an Iron Man To The Death battle and is for only certain higher levels, and requires Komodo to enter, gets juicy because if you lose a character here, they are sent to  a healing place where they will regenerate over a period determined by the type of death. All of your equipment will be returned and you may have to recruit until your character regenerates. Sub-game is to visit them once a day to give an offering to "Komo-Don" and a healing item, Non-NFT, to help speed up recovery. Depending on the type of character, certain items may harm them...More games to come...

10 Starter Types To Choose From, varying from Locale, 10 Base Types, Earth, Fire, Wind, Water, Dark, Light, Lightning, Poison, Ice, Zombie, Triangle system, for < / >


[13-Oct-21 12:59 AM] Franswa Andre#2142
Areas. 1. Starter area depends on the type of Komodo chosen when starting the game. Areas and Types: 1. (Jueiju-DO-Gisap "Ice Types"), 2. (Deo'Hia-DO-Gisap "Water Types"), 3.

(P'xiz-Hado-DO "Fire-Types"), 9. (Omai'Gi'-SIvle'Kel-Formaw "Poison-Types"), 10. (Shu-HUI-AHX "Light-Types").


[13-Oct-21 01:06 AM] Franswa Andre#2142
Un-Common Rarities: Can be merged from 2 or more Common types, Can have up to 2 elemental styles, depends on choices and pick-ups and purchases. Specific items for specific merges can add a third elemental attribute 1/3 less strong than full blood breed or half-blood breed.


[13-Oct-21 01:12 AM] Franswa Andre#2142
Rare: Merged from 4 Un-Common, Maxed stats characters. Depending on merges and accessories or rarity and DNA traits, a small percentage to drop common and un-common eggs, small chance to auto-learn enemies attack, defense, or magical moves, and companion and allies gain small buffs from same type attributes.


[13-Oct-21 01:25 AM] Franswa Andre#2142
Legendary: Can be hatched, 5% chance, (1 will be found later in your journey, will be able to choose between a variety, but must fulfill the requirements, Can be purchased with Komodo, or Can be "Created"??? Well on your journey you will find some "Activists" and "Explorers" that have their own agenda and you will uncover a very eerie and creepy tale of an "Evil Genius" and  the horror that plagued a few species and made them "Outcasts" to their cultural tribes...


[13-Oct-21 01:38 AM] Franswa Andre#2142
Mythic: Heheheh...so, can't be purchased, merged from any other characters in the game, can't be hatched or dropped... When you finish the first area, whichever character you started with, You will trigger a cut scene and the first Mythic will appear, the game will hint around this up until right before you get ready to travel to the next town. I won't name-drop the Mythics but just know, whatever type you choose to start with, That's the Mythic type that will haunt you throughout the main storyline + It will have 4 other elemental Powers giving it 5 total, You will only Ever have 1 Mythic unless you know a guy, "wink-wink"... PVP, Mythics, and you. Once obtained, you will only be able to use the Mythic for Special Events that require Komodo to Enter and are Live Battles, 1 vs 1, 2 vs 2, 3 vs 3, and "Lai-GSPO-UPIGNDLOI" or Survive where you and 2 other players choose your Mythic and battle waves of enemies. This event gives out Exclusive NFT's, Game Tickets, Komo-Toshi, and gives building items to create an in-game node for hodl, staking, or ROI, and get Komo-Toshi for non-NFT, in-game items!!

[16-Oct-21 02:40 AM] cryptosammy#3587
well, the game world will need population. Most of it should be players of course, but i think my approach is to build an environment. These characters do not need a lot of text, but they make the environment more lively. I have read last week about characters. For now, I want to stick with 1 dimensional characters, and some story lines for each "region". So, look at that repo. Think about roughly 30 characters that would live in that region. And how they could give the player an impression of the game world in a single line. Look at the video I made, or play the demo game and bump into a character.


[16-Oct-21 02:41 AM] cryptosammy#3587
(and maybe give a 200 char description of the character for its reason to live in the game world)

A lot is happening in in the #gamedev for #LoreoftheTokels. With BitGo working as a charm - even in its experimental phase, we want to combine offchain data using the @KomodoPlatform Oracles CC. Why? Because #NFT alone will not cut it - we want to take it to the next level.

We are populating the map as we go, starting with Espive, a fishing town in Tokelina. Taking inspiration of designing towns like one would in #tabletopgaming, our #indiegame starts with a central building, a boulevard and facilities to simulate the economy and a small harbor.

Life should be easy for gamers on the #blockchain. That's why we made an electron dApp, which means our #indiegame will start like a native application, with the right settings, no funky browser glitches and available on your favorite operating systems.

With the exception of retrieving your $TOKEL balance directly from #blockchain, we finished porting the stack of #LoreoftheTokels to nSPV. Don't worry, its a feature we now still retrieve through a GET request and when we migrate it, Knights won't feel a disturbance in the force

When you create your knight, you can pick from twelve astro charts; Five perks that will impact on your stats Attack (AP), Defence (HP), Speed (Hit %), Agility (Dodge %), Dexterity (Precision %) when you engage in combat when playing our #indiegame powered by #blockchain.

Just a little taste of the gameplay, changes and the music you can expect from Lore of the Tokels. This test area displays for example the new jumping feature, the interaction with objects in the environment, weapons you can find as #NFT and a lot of detail is added. https://t.co/jmGV8dnuSh

This might not seem very impressive, but being able to playback streaming video in a game engine that doesn't require transcoding every build took a little effort. Oh and ingame recording to add that little extra to cutscenes. And to show this logo when you start #LoreoftheTokels https://t.co/LsK79634lV

Hunter coin started out as a Namecoin fork. I played day 1-3 (no sleep) made a few hundred $. Then the original dev died and snailbrain took over. Some random info for you

Good news is that the bugs are identified and fixed. The "sorry, but we are delayed" news is that we are a little overdue, but the release is coming as soon as the last test and uploads are complete. Working almost around the clock.

**SUPER UPDATE**
Almost 14 days overdue on the release date. But here is some good news. All release bugs have been resolved, and some updates have been made. There is also more - some changes were necessary that did result in some cool new features that haven't been tested properly. And here goes.

Who is willing to invest their Saturday to play test Lore? The goal is to find 30+ concurrent testers that will play Lore to stress the network, the game play and exchange earned NFT's from Lore. From freezes, glitches, crashes and color incorrections, Lore of the Tokels need you. To play and help others to play this game without possible issues. This test version will run on testnet, so there will be no real earning, but you can bet on it that your participation will be greatly rewarded with Lore NFT. 

Why? Because it is nearly impossible to test everything again without any further delay. I would like to have people who are willing to play on 1) Windows 10, Windows 11 2) Mac OSX Monterey and Big Sur 3) Ubuntu 18 and 20. I am also going to ask testers to use a part of the test build to gather screenshots for Lore promotion purposes. 

DM and let me know as soon as possible! Also, if you are a Lore fan and you want to contribute to the project with development, support it by backing or tips or are willing to become a code curator, same thing applies.

And if you aren't excited already, Lore of the Tokels is after all, Play to Earn. Tomorrow will remain a little bit of a mystery, but there will be Tokel to win! Five times loot as NFT, which you can exchange ingame to receive Tokel. there are FOUR chests that contain 333 Tokel and the BIG chest has 777 Tokel* for you to earn. You'll have to sweat for it, so its going to be a fun day? If you want to playtest, you can leave a DM. Also every test player will get get something good 🙂

Lessons learned from #gamedev. Give players the ability to swim in a gameworld and they spend most of the time finding bugs just by trying to swim everywhere. And magically find a way out that you never intended to have in that area.

Hey @KomodoPlatform @TokelPlatform check this out. The technology from @Jl777News, nSPV implemented in the bitgo implementation from #Tokel, thats how we are doing our #gamedev. Check out the tx on TKLTEST 7b21fc0d15c3fd7233bf67dc1c9352f14af4bd8f1ab879cfa8ee3bf9c4635ffe https://t.co/hP3GKtsxm5

You can do it perfectly in code, but testplaying is so important to discover runtime bugs and glitches. Footslip, accidents in combats and missed targets. But doing organic #gamedev is bearing fruit. And who else better to guide players to pick a weapon than a Komodian? https://t.co/hXnIRGgxZP

Lore always had a console. But this one is powered by some heavy features. And like all #retrogames, its got ascii art, a fancy prompt and the READY message. Be careful, its dangerous out there!

When your #gamers ask you to add a feature like running and run jumps, there is no excuse. So, adventurers, knights, cliff jumpers... Just hold down Shift to run. This feature was easy with the InputSystem in #unity3d and Mecanim. Gotta love #IndieGameDev. https://t.co/3SKCzB40m0

Wait, what? Yes, Lore GE is versatile. This new feature is already inside the console, allowing other viewmodes to the gameplay. So besides accessing #blockchain, the console can be used to add and test expansions easily. Gotta love #gamedev with #unity3d  and @TokelPlatform. https://t.co/gieciuhiAw

Who can resist the color of the summer sky? Linear color space is provides accurate rendering, but mostly creates a more vivid experience when playing Lore of the Tokels. A little LUT added to that list and with some tweaks to the output results in this before and after image.
