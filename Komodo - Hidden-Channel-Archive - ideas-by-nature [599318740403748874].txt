[12-Jul-19 12:24 PM] Audo#5667
We were thinking one option would be to do something like on the above mockup for the team members without a profile picture. Just their initials / first letter of their name.

For jl777 we wanted to do a bit more. For example a very generic picture of a person with just outlines... i.e. similar line art that you have been using throught the site.


[12-Jul-19 12:30 PM] ideas_justin#1384
Hey Audo, thanks for the invite! Yeah I think we should be able to do the first initials, but we‚Äôll have to check with Chris to be sure.


[12-Jul-19 01:25 PM] Audo#5667
welcome @chrislabeard


[12-Jul-19 01:26 PM] chrislabeard#2645
Hey guys thanks for the invite. Doing the initials should be fine. And we can do one specific for jl777


[13-Jul-19 10:13 AM] TS#7923
I‚Äôve updated the issue tracker with a few visual glitches, padding, etc

@TS thanks we're taking a look at it all now

@Audo @TS @Daniel CP are any of you in the site editing currently? i'm assuming no since you are probably asleep

Hey guys, what action would you like the discord icon to take when a user clicks on it?


[13-Jul-19 07:41 PM] ideas_justin#1384
@n2okpride  see above question


[13-Jul-19 09:03 PM] ideas_justin#1384
@Audo or @TS maybe you can answer the question?

@ideas_justin ^^^


[13-Jul-19 09:37 PM] ideas_justin#1384
@TS thank you. Would you like that for all the discord links? Not individual DMs? I tried to search for how to link to someone's individual Discord DM but it doesn't really work.


[13-Jul-19 09:37 PM] ideas_justin#1384
So to make sure I am correct: everyone on the team should have a discord icon under their name, and that discord icon should link to the link that you just posted.


[13-Jul-19 09:51 PM] TS#7923
Oh no no


[13-Jul-19 09:51 PM] TS#7923
The link above is for the footer etc


[13-Jul-19 09:52 PM] TS#7923
Honestly, I don‚Äôt think it makes sense to add Discord links to the individual team members. I am not sure it‚Äôs even possible, and even if it is, that can be a spam magnet.


[13-Jul-19 09:53 PM] TS#7923
Individual team members shouldn‚Äôt have Discord links, only Twitter, Github, LinkedIn


[13-Jul-19 09:53 PM] ideas_justin#1384
OK cool, that works. Yeah I tried to figure out if it was possible and I couldn't find a way.


[13-Jul-19 09:54 PM] TS#7923
Great, thanks!


[13-Jul-19 09:54 PM] ideas_justin#1384
No problem


[13-Jul-19 10:44 PM] Audo#5667
Another minor thing that came to my mind. 

Currently we use several easy to remember URL's that should carry over to the new site. We should set redirects to these:

komodoplatform.com/discord
komodoplatform.com/newsletter
komodoplatform.com/whitepaper
komodoplatform.com/explorer (currently not in use)


[13-Jul-19 10:45 PM] chrislabeard#2645
@Audo I was going to import all of the current redirects from the old site.

When is the earliest you guys will be ready to review?


[14-Jul-19 09:31 AM] butthole.finance#0577
@n2okpride 3PM PST will be good so that Chris can have much done as possible. i'll put it on the calendar for now, text me if that doesn't work


[14-Jul-19 09:39 AM] n2okpride#1967
Might be good to do 1 earlier so my team can attend. We can also do 3pm with just myself.


[14-Jul-19 09:47 AM] n2okpride#1967
I also really need the brochure template


[14-Jul-19 10:04 AM] butthole.finance#0577
Justin was up until 4am last night working on the site design tasks so I will check in with him as soon as he is up.


[14-Jul-19 10:04 AM] butthole.finance#0577
If there are other design asks he still hasn't gotten to, should I prioritize the brochure over the website design tasks?


[14-Jul-19 10:05 AM] butthole.finance#0577
I'll reschedule for 1pm your time but Chris will not have had time to finish the video by then.


[14-Jul-19 10:28 AM] n2okpride#1967
Depends on what's outstanding on his web related tasks


[14-Jul-19 10:28 AM] n2okpride#1967
I need to finish all content pieces today, so the earlier I get it the better


[14-Jul-19 11:16 AM] TS#7923
Still adding a few items to the issue tracker. Trying to be reasonable and not to add every minor thing, just the more important ones üòÉ


[14-Jul-19 11:28 AM] butthole.finance#0577
@n2okpride here are the tasks:
For website stuff I still need to:
1. design the contact form
2. go through the site and switch out icons where needed
3. design a graphic for the mutually beneficial symbiosis section
4. change the icons on the atomic swaps in 7 steps section
5. Antara logo


[14-Jul-19 11:29 AM] butthole.finance#0577
Justin will work on the brochure immediately, but just know it pushes those other things down.


[14-Jul-19 11:29 AM] butthole.finance#0577
@TS thanks, I will review them and prioritize accordingly for chris

[14-Jul-19 07:36 PM] TS#7923
Morning guys! I am sure you are still working on the site but I wanted to point out the two major major issues:

1. The video animation is not ready. The UX doesn't work, some slides don't load. There's also an issue when you click on the "Continue" button twice or more as it messes up the video loading.

*PROPOSED FIX*: All slides need to load correctly. A temporary fix is not displaying the "Continue" button until the current scene ends, and fading it in when it's ready to display the next scene. This is not the ideal solution but it should fix the UX mess.

We should also think about how to make the fold a bit better designed, but this is not a priority.

2. Mobile view is very messy. We didn't bring this up earlier as we were assuming this will be the last part you'll be working on, but it still needs a ton of work. For the animation video, we'll probably need to display the text below the animation.


[14-Jul-19 08:46 PM] chrislabeard#2645
Yes working on the mobile responsive part of the site now that most of the content and layouts are finalized.


[14-Jul-19 09:01 PM] chrislabeard#2645
@TS  I think what happened was I got my seek times mixed up. Trying to fix now. The first like 4 layers have pauses in the video so that was easy to track on but once we get to 34 seconds. I'm not 100% sure where the correct spot to stop is.


[14-Jul-19 09:22 PM] TS#7923
@chrislabeard will send you the timing in less than an hour


[14-Jul-19 09:24 PM] chrislabeard#2645
Thanks @TS


[14-Jul-19 09:30 PM] TS#7923
@chrislabeard Added the exact timing to the doc


[14-Jul-19 09:49 PM] chrislabeard#2645
thank you, i'll update that


[14-Jul-19 10:39 PM] TS#7923
Added two new timeline items but the order is off, they were inserted as items #2 and 3. Can we enable reordering?


[14-Jul-19 10:54 PM] chrislabeard#2645
@TS I've turned on the drag and drop ordering for timeline items


[14-Jul-19 11:03 PM] TS#7923
Thank you!


[15-Jul-19 03:04 AM] chrislabeard#2645
@TS I added the timestamps you gave me, and also the button hides when the video is playing. The time stamps don't seem correct still to me.


[15-Jul-19 03:19 AM] TS#7923
Hey @chrislabeard , yea, it‚Äôs not right. The problem is that you‚Äôve added the one that should start at 0:09 to 0:01 so the whole sequence is shifted


[15-Jul-19 03:21 AM] chrislabeard#2645
just to clarify the timestamp is where it pauses. Not where it starts from. So when you first come to the page its going from 0 :00- 0:01, then the next layer would be 0:01 - 0:09 , etc.


[15-Jul-19 03:21 AM] TS#7923
No


[15-Jul-19 03:21 AM] TS#7923
The time stamp is when the text following the time stamp should appear


[15-Jul-19 03:21 AM] TS#7923
Sorry I thought it‚Äôs clear


[15-Jul-19 03:21 AM] TS#7923
So scene 1 is from 0:00 - 0:09


[15-Jul-19 03:22 AM] TS#7923
Pause, new text, animation with the new text until 0:17


[15-Jul-19 03:22 AM] chrislabeard#2645
okay I get what you are saying. Thats not what I was thinking this would be.


[15-Jul-19 03:23 AM] chrislabeard#2645
I built it off of the old apple mac pro page as a reference.


[15-Jul-19 03:25 AM] TS#7923
I am not aware of that site. Ideally the pauses shouldn't come mid-animation like half of the labels on the left side are already there but the scene pauses.


[15-Jul-19 03:28 AM] chrislabeard#2645
Here is an example of how the mac pro page worked -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fmFSfCwNVJw

[15-Jul-19 03:28 AM] chrislabeard#2645
The video basically freezes and the text comes in.


[15-Jul-19 03:29 AM] chrislabeard#2645
so yah the only thing I'm not doing is fading in the text when it gets to that frame.


[15-Jul-19 03:36 AM] TS#7923
ah yea I see, but this is done with parallax, and looks like parallax was not feasible to implement


[15-Jul-19 03:39 AM] chrislabeard#2645
its actually a video


[15-Jul-19 03:39 AM] TS#7923
and the text is part of the video?


[15-Jul-19 03:39 AM] chrislabeard#2645
no its on top of the video


[15-Jul-19 03:39 AM] chrislabeard#2645

[15-Jul-19 03:40 AM] chrislabeard#2645
we are just keeping the text in the same place on our version


[15-Jul-19 03:41 AM] TS#7923
Ah OK, I see. What was the main reason we couldn't implement it like this? I know we've tried but it didn't seem to be working very well


[15-Jul-19 03:41 AM] chrislabeard#2645
The main issue was the mac pro page took up the entire page. Ours is a section within the page, and capturing the scroll events like that is not a great UX.


[15-Jul-19 03:42 AM] chrislabeard#2645
So the solution was going to be to allow the user to just click through the sections within a frame.


[15-Jul-19 03:42 AM] chrislabeard#2645
As if they were scrolling through it.


[15-Jul-19 03:43 AM] TS#7923
Got it, OK. Let's stick to the solution what we have now, just let's adjust the timing. Thank you!


[15-Jul-19 03:43 AM] chrislabeard#2645
okay sounds good, just ping me when you have updated the timestamps.


[15-Jul-19 04:08 AM] TS#7923
@chrislabeard updated according to the mac pro logic


[15-Jul-19 04:08 AM] TS#7923
i.e., pause at this timestamp, with this text


[15-Jul-19 04:08 AM] chrislabeard#2645
okay cool i'll go update it


[15-Jul-19 04:08 AM] TS#7923

@808 for the gifs, just match the image size that you sent over, we can work with that

@n2okpride can we push our standup to later while we're making changes?


[15-Jul-19 10:19 AM] 808#8446
Im now using 800x800 as the resolution. 3000x3000 is too much to render on such short notice. 10mb is ok. I will deliver the gif and png sequence if you want to further optimize.


[15-Jul-19 10:54 AM] n2okpride#1967
@butthole.finance yes we can

@butthole.finance please see ; https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IolPnwm2p8uqMrvRzjXe1QqOBkPbGAme for the first GIF loop.


[15-Jul-19 10:58 AM] 808#8446
You can see two folders, 'GIF Animations' are my looped exported GIFs. It is very difficult to stay below 10MB. The first GIF has only 90 frames at 12fps / res of 779x558 and its 9,92 MB in size. I have included a 25fps and 12fps PNG sequences so you could try to better compress this.

Ok, actually let's do this:
 - delete the three "learn more" buttons on http://dev-kmd2019.pantheonsite.io/komodo-basics/ (the wallet cards)
 - change the remaining CTA button from "Browse All Available Wallets" to "Browse All Wallets"

Could the  OceanQT simply link back to http://dev-kmd2019.pantheonsite.io/komodo-wallets/ ? (More specifically, to the OceanQT Wallet fold as the downloads are there)

Hey @butthole.finance 

Fixed the links for OceanQT

We need to provide a disclaimer for our own wallets such as OceanQT. Once of the links was to a disclaimer but there's no disclaimer page so I just removed it for now. I think there are two options for disclaimer
 - new page
 - pop-up window

Disclaimer is here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f5SYl2NzJ47nPztT6H6XMWAIrS9vzYl3TctbTY_QT0k/edit

Please add that task to your tracking sheet. We can do it after launch.

@butthole.finance I figured out the shadow issue. I render a matte for the alpha based on a dark or light background. The gif you used was made for a dark background. When placed on white, the shadow goes all wonky. What I will do is create a new folder with gifs that have no shadow. When you run into the issue you can use that version.

@butthole.finance that antara logo is good! Thanks.

We would like to drop the word "framework" though.

We also need a horizontal version. And SVG file (we need to get the logo to the Antara Composer site)


[15-Jul-19 03:56 PM] Audo#5667
Guys, @butthole.finance 

The website is starting to look better and better. However, the blog post / news section is cearly unfinished and everyone will be able to see that.

The problem is that we are forwarding people to read the announcement posts right after launch, and that will be their first impression on the brand. So although the rest of the site is better, our community's opinion might turn out to be negative.

How long would it take to fix the news post formatting? Can we reconsdier?


[15-Jul-19 03:57 PM] ideas_justin#1384

guys it getting late on our end and we will get some rest shortly - we can config DNS now and the next 15-30 mins and afterwards when we are back in the morning


[15-Jul-19 04:55 PM] TS#7923
yea we need to go live ASAP


[15-Jul-19 04:59 PM] n2okpride#1967
Yes I agree. We were targeting early afternoon at the very latest. We've already missed launch date for both EMEA and APJ. We really just need to launch at this point.


[15-Jul-19 04:59 PM] butthole.finance#0577
yes, we got these last minute tasks which weren't easy


[15-Jul-19 04:59 PM] butthole.finance#0577
getting the composer image in was not as easy as just dropping it in


[15-Jul-19 05:00 PM] butthole.finance#0577
we are launching now


[15-Jul-19 05:00 PM] n2okpride#1967
ok thanks.

looks like we are live, let's quickly test the links etc


[15-Jul-19 05:12 PM] TS#7923
the internal links still point to the staging site


[15-Jul-19 05:13 PM] TS#7923
it's probably just the base URL that needs to be updated in WP


[15-Jul-19 05:14 PM] ca333#0333
yes i updated it immediately when i got the DNS data


[15-Jul-19 05:14 PM] ca333#0333

some good technical feedback here re: SEO etc from a community member


[15-Jul-19 07:08 PM] TS#7923
The typeface, kerning and 'm' in the new logo are off. 

Dropdown menu should happen on mouseover, not by having the user click to access the dropdown menu and then another click to access the submenu item. When you click to open the dropdown menu without clicking a submenu option and scroll the page down, that dropdown remains open and blocks content. The submenu items do not need a horizontal line spacer, white space is best, people will not get confused if hr is removed. Remove mouseover text underlining as well. This is all just lazy megamenu editing by the devs that should have been changed from the start.

Remove drop shadows on everything. It is 2001 fad, not a clean look.


[15-Jul-19 07:08 PM] TS#7923
Buttons: Change the button look and animation. The button mouseovers moving the text up and underlining the word and jittering back to default position is bad. Kill all dropshadows, text underlines and button borders.

Keep the buttons simple. On mouseover have the button background color change and that is all. There is a lack on consistency as well with all the buttons - footer, 'view all news' buttons respond differently.

For text links, just change the font color on mouseover, do not underline the text link.

The infinite scroll on the news page will not be processed by search crawlers. They cannot not access all individual items in the feed. If crawlers cannot access your content, it is unlikely to surface in search results. SEO will fail there.

The Antara animation on the home page is good. Since the rest of the site has fluid edge to edge backgrounds, that section should also have a edge to edge background tying in with the color on the block animation to keep the flow. If at all possible, remove the fade to black transitions and just fade in and out the animations sequences on each other. Also remove the outer dropshadow.

Although the content is organized well, the site itself appears like a plug and play wordpress theme, a megamenu with no tweaking, and general css changes. Designers did not make this site, wordpress hackers did.

[17-Jul-19 01:03 PM] ideas_justin#1384
Hey Steve. Yeah the font for ‚Äúantara‚Äù is work sans semibold and ‚Äúframework‚Äù is Rubin light. I just learned the second line out until it fit underneath Antara. It isn‚Äôt exactly the same width, because that would make it look like it was actually wider than the top text, it‚Äôs a few pixels shy of being the same width as the top line.

Hey guys! We have an issue. A community member alerted us that buttons don't work on "many pages" (not sure how many), including https://komodoplatform.com/wallet/komodo-oceanqt/

Now the problem is that this page is not accessible from the site in this form, and it should not be accessible. But it is from Google if you search for "komodo oceanqt", which is something an advanced user would realistically do.

Same if you search for "Komodo Magnum wallet", the 3rd result is https://komodoplatform.com/wallet/magnum-wallet/ and the button doesn't work there either (plus there's no footer padding).

How can we fix this?

Can we make sure to add this in before we push the rest of the changes to the live website?


[02-Aug-19 08:38 AM] ideas_justin#1384
Hey Daniel. Chris will work on getting that page incorporated as soon as he is able to.


[02-Aug-19 03:14 PM] ideas_justin#1384
@Daniel CP the blockchain security page is up on Dev.

hey guys, I was going through the dev site and got few final things that I recorded to the airtable: https://airtable.com/tblPGwMwJRaQ8dqcd/viwobUEFYH1HjGgOJ?blocks=hide

I made a new category "final feedback" to make them stand out.

When do we plan to bring all these changes online?

@Audo would it be possible to get the translations for the homepage, so I can do some testing. I'm starting with Chinese first.


[09-Oct-19 09:55 AM] Audo#5667
Soundsgood @chrislabeard 

I believe @TS got those translaters somewhere handy. 

@TS can you link the translations here?


[09-Oct-19 10:02 AM] chrislabeard#2645
Thanks @Audo

hey @chrislabeard 

Can you guys research and double check that we can use these two plugins we found? If yes, then we will put more thought into how we will use them and purchase the plugins.

@Audo the social stream one works just fine -- https://dev-kmd2019.pantheonsite.io/stream/

It looks like the elink plugin will use javascript to embed the posts. I'm not 100% sure how y'all are planning on using this, but from a technical standpoint this one will work as well.

great! Thank you


[10-Oct-19 10:30 AM] Audo#5667
@chrislabeard looks like there are some bugs on the dev site that are not on the live site

for example the bottom of this page doesn't show up: https://dev-kmd2019.pantheonsite.io/atomic-swap-technology/

also blog posts: https://dev-kmd2019.pantheonsite.io/four-core-requirements-true-dex/

Maybe some update broke something


[10-Oct-19 10:36 AM] chrislabeard#2645
@Audo thanks for bringing that to my attention. The language templates weren't updated with the correct priority for blog posts. That should be fixed now.

I'll look into the atomic swap page see what is going on there as well.


[10-Oct-19 10:38 AM] Audo#5667
no problem


[15-Oct-19 09:25 AM] chrislabeard#2645
@TS hey wanted to check in on getting a page to translate. Have you had a chance to put that together?


[16-Oct-19 10:27 AM] Daniel CP#2020
@chrislabeard  Hi Chris


[16-Oct-19 10:27 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I'm noticing some weird formatting issues with blog posts


[16-Oct-19 10:27 AM] Daniel CP#2020
The author and date of the posts no longer appear and the width of the text boxes is way wider than it was


[16-Oct-19 10:28 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Also, I updated a lot of content Mon and yesterday and now I'm not seeing any of the edits and updates we made


[16-Oct-19 10:28 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Do you know what might be going on?


[16-Oct-19 10:30 AM] chrislabeard#2645
I pushed an update last night with the changes that have been made. I'll revert back to the old site.

So with the changes being made they require database changes, so the only way I can do that is to pull a snapshot of live over to dev and then repush. So we may need more coordination so I don't overwrite work you are doing. e.g. you guys let me know what changes you have made or you make them on both live and dev.


[16-Oct-19 10:31 AM] chrislabeard#2645
@Daniel CP do you have some sort of record of the changes you made so I can make sure dev is up to date with live?


[16-Oct-19 10:32 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I don't have a list. Most of the changes were made directly in WP


[16-Oct-19 10:33 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I updated a blog post, added a lot of content to it, changed a number of links in a number of blog posts, and changed a few redirects


[16-Oct-19 10:33 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Pushed it all live in what wouldve been early your AM yesterday


[16-Oct-19 10:33 AM] Daniel CP#2020
When did you push changes? What changes were they?


[16-Oct-19 10:33 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Might be worth reverting. I spent a lot of time making updates and edits


[16-Oct-19 10:34 AM] chrislabeard#2645
yah I reverted already


[16-Oct-19 10:34 AM] chrislabeard#2645
I just need to know when you guys make changes as I am working on the site.


[16-Oct-19 10:35 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Ok thanks


[16-Oct-19 10:36 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I don't think I was working in your day time (was maybe 7am Denver time)


[16-Oct-19 10:36 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I'lll try to not be in WP at all from 8am--8pm your time


[16-Oct-19 10:36 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Does that sound good?


[16-Oct-19 10:36 AM] chrislabeard#2645
Yah the version of the site I had was from I think middle of last week, which is why I didn't grab your changes.


[16-Oct-19 10:37 AM] chrislabeard#2645
Yah that sounds good, it would be great if you could ping me if you push any changes just so I know to look for them when puling the databases around.


[16-Oct-19 10:38 AM] Daniel CP#2020
OK sure, will do. I'm generally just making changes in the frontend on WP, I very rarely work in Pantheon


[16-Oct-19 10:38 AM] Daniel CP#2020
But I'll ping you when I make changes, I'm editing and updating things pretty regularly


[16-Oct-19 10:39 AM] chrislabeard#2645
Yah its tricky because of the way WP works, when I implement new features that requires database changes. I just need to make sure I have the latest database version before I do any changes and push them up while you aren't working.


[16-Oct-19 10:42 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Ah ok I see


[16-Oct-19 10:42 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I'll keep you updated üëç  thanks for the help and quick fix


[16-Oct-19 10:43 AM] chrislabeard#2645
yah absolutely, i'm gonna look into a way to sync the content between the two instances of the site so its a little less work on you.


[16-Oct-19 10:43 AM] chrislabeard#2645
I'll keep you updated.

[04-Nov-19 12:45 PM] Audo#5667
hey @chrislabeard , I am tring to make a more interesting blog post layout and started to play around Bootstrap.

I followed the instructions and inserted the required HTML code to the blog post page to get what I want. You can check out my draft post "Community Bounties"

It works otherwise but doesn't show up correctly on mobile. I found this is because of the blog post template we use.

When I choose "Default (Blog Post)" under "RENDER PAGE USING TEMPLATE" it doesn't show up correctly on mobile.

When I choose "Page" instead it works on mobile! However, then we don't have the default header as with other blog posts.

so it seems there's an issue with the 'default (blog post)' template. Would it be possible to fix it so I can use that bootstrap code on my blog post?

[04-Nov-19 12:51 PM] chrislabeard#2645
@Audo It would make more sense to create a new template for blog posts that want to use this alternate layout.


[04-Nov-19 12:52 PM] chrislabeard#2645
Then you just pick that version when using this ,so we don't break the old blog posts


[04-Nov-19 12:52 PM] Audo#5667
alright, makes sense. Is that a quick thing to do?


[04-Nov-19 12:53 PM] chrislabeard#2645

@Audo if it would be okay, I could put that new template in tonight when no one is working or viewing the site? I'll have to do it on dev and then push to live.


[04-Nov-19 01:10 PM] Audo#5667
Yes, that sounds good @chrislabeard 

I just logged out of Wordpress and no one else should be editing it. Daniel is sleeping.

no problems

@Audo is this something you would want to include on every post? I could do in a little more of a programmatic way. Allow you basically to check a box, and fill in the content and image.


[04-Nov-19 01:38 PM] Audo#5667
yes, this would be a reoccuring post type, every month.

If you can make it even more convenient to use that type of layout that's great, although I think I can manage to do it with Bootstrap like I did there. Seemed pretty straight forward.

It would be also good to have one blog template that is compatible with the bootstrap overall, giving us more flexibility. We might want to do something else in the future. I noticed we can use buttons and call-out boxes and other things with the bootstrap right in a normal blog post.

gotcha alright I'll try and get something that will work with bootstrap

@Audo so I've included bootstrap on the base blog template, this shouldn't conflict with any the other posts. I'm not using the same classes as bootstrap thankfully.

But when you are editing the page with bootstrap HTML all you will need is the stuff that goes in the body for example

```<div class="row">
<div class="col">...</div>
<div class="col">...</div>
</div>
```

The JS and CSS are already included on the blog template. Play around with that and let me know if that works for you.

ok! Thanks @chrislabeard


[06-Nov-19 06:14 AM] Audo#5667
hmm, it's again not working @chrislabeard , not sure why

I can use a normal layout for this post instead


[06-Nov-19 07:18 AM] chrislabeard#2645
@Audo could you save a post with it not working, so I can see if I can figure out what the issue is? Just some placeholder post with it in there.


[06-Nov-19 07:18 AM] Audo#5667
ok, one sec


[06-Nov-19 07:20 AM] Audo#5667
okay, done @chrislabeard


[06-Nov-19 08:25 AM] Audo#5667
let me know if you find a solution. I would like to post it in few hours


[06-Nov-19 09:11 AM] Audo#5667
any update @chrislabeard ?


[06-Nov-19 09:15 AM] chrislabeard#2645
@Audo can give you an update here in about 30 minutes.


[06-Nov-19 09:15 AM] chrislabeard#2645
Are you using something to generate this code? Or are you doing it by hand?


[06-Nov-19 09:16 AM] Audo#5667
ok sounds good! Thanks

I got the bootstrap elements from here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/media-object/

and then manually edit the code to change the heading and picture

@Audo this seems to be doing what its supposed to be doing.


[06-Nov-19 10:11 AM] chrislabeard#2645
There is a little bit of a margin on list items, we can remove that by taking it out of a list.


[06-Nov-19 10:11 AM] chrislabeard#2645
But otherwise this looks correct to me.


[06-Nov-19 10:11 AM] Audo#5667
ok let me check


[06-Nov-19 10:11 AM] chrislabeard#2645
on mobile it seems to be acting kinda wacky


[06-Nov-19 10:12 AM] Audo#5667
yeah, that was the problem. Otherwise it looks good

@Audo I need to pull the site down to dev real quick, just want to make sure you aren't making any changes for like 5 minutes.


[06-Nov-19 10:18 AM] chrislabeard#2645
@ca333 I sent you more info on the error I'm getting on live when trying to post to that URL. Captcha challenge....


[06-Nov-19 10:21 AM] Audo#5667
yeah I am not, no problem


[06-Nov-19 10:27 AM] chrislabeard#2645
@Audo alright take a look, should be correct now.


[06-Nov-19 10:27 AM] Audo#5667
prefect, I'll


[06-Nov-19 10:27 AM] chrislabeard#2645
the one at the very end, you may want to also wrap in the media stuff as well


[06-Nov-19 10:28 AM] chrislabeard#2645
not sure what you were trying to do with that one


[06-Nov-19 10:28 AM] chrislabeard#2645
I have to head out for an appointment, i'll be back in a few hours. But I think you should be good to post this. @Audo


[06-Nov-19 10:28 AM] Audo#5667
yes, it works now! Thanks

Atomic Swaps
ÂéüÂ≠ê‰∫íÊç¢
Atomic swaps are trustless peer-to-peer exchanges of digital assets from one user to the other, without any middleman or intermediary. Atomic swap trading is magnitudes more secure than trading crypto on a centralized exchange, as users never need to give up control over their assets.
ÂéüÂ≠ê‰∫§Êç¢ÊòØ‰ªé‰∏Ä‰∏™Áî®Êà∑Âà∞Âè¶‰∏Ä‰∏™Áî®Êà∑ÁöÑÂéª‰ø°‰ªªÁÇπÂØπÁÇπÊï∞Â≠óËµÑ‰∫ß‰∫§ÊòìÔºå‰∏çÈúÄË¶Å‰ªª‰Ωï‰∏≠Èó¥‰∫∫Êàñ‰∏≠‰ªã„ÄÇ ÂéüÂ≠ê‰∫íÊç¢‰∫§ÊòìÊØîÂú®ÈõÜ‰∏≠Âåñ‰∫§ÊòìÊâÄ‰∫§ÊòìÂä†ÂØÜË¥ßÂ∏ÅÊõ¥ÂÆâÂÖ®ÔºåÂõ†‰∏∫Áî®Êà∑Ê∞∏Ëøú‰∏çÈúÄË¶ÅÊîæÂºÉÂØπÂÖ∂ËµÑ‰∫ßÁöÑÊéßÂà∂„ÄÇ

Digital Asset Trading Is Still Centralized
Êï∞Â≠óËµÑ‰∫ß‰∫§Êòì‰ªçÁÑ∂ÊòØÈõÜ‰∏≠ÂåñÁöÑ
Today, trading one digital asset for another is risky, inconvenient, and costly. Here‚Äôs what the trading process looks like when using centralized exchanges:
‰ªäÂ§©ÔºåÂ∞Ü‰∏ÄÁßçÊï∞Â≠óËµÑ‰∫ß‰∫§Êç¢ÊàêÂè¶‰∏ÄÁßçÊï∞Â≠óËµÑ‰∫ßÊòØÊúâÈ£éÈô©„ÄÅ‰∏çÊñπ‰æøÂíåÈ´òÊàêÊú¨ÁöÑ„ÄÇ ‰ª•‰∏ãÊòØ‰ΩøÁî®ÈõÜ‰∏≠Âåñ‰∫§ÊòìÊâÄÊó∂ÁöÑ‰∫§ÊòìÊµÅÁ®ãÔºö
Step 1: Purchase Coins
Á¨¨1Ê≠•ÔºöË¥≠‰π∞Êï∞Â≠óË¥ßÂ∏Å
Purchase coins using a fiat gateway service. These services only offer a few major assets, so acquiring smaller market cap assets is difficult.
‰ΩøÁî®Ê≥ïÂ∏ÅÁΩëÂÖ≥ÊúçÂä°Ë¥≠‰π∞Êï∞Â≠óË¥ßÂ∏Å„ÄÇ Ëøô‰∫õÊúçÂä°‰ªÖÊèê‰æõÂ∞ëÈáèÁöÑ‰∏ªË¶ÅËµÑ‰∫ßÔºåÂõ†Ê≠§Èöæ‰ª•Ëé∑ÂæóËßÑÊ®°ËæÉÂ∞èÁöÑÂ∏ÇÂÄºËµÑ‰∫ß„ÄÇ
Step 2: Send To An Exchange
Á¨¨2Ê≠•ÔºöÂèëÈÄÅÂà∞‰∫§ÊòìÊâÄ
Send the newly-acquired assets to a centralized exchange and wait for the deposit to be confirmed. This may take several hours.
Â∞ÜÊñ∞Ëé∑ÂæóÁöÑËµÑ‰∫ßÂèëÈÄÅÂà∞ÈõÜ‰∏≠Âåñ‰∫§ÊòìÊâÄÔºåÁ≠âÂæÖÂ≠òÊ¨æË¢´Á°ÆËÆ§„ÄÇ ËøôÂèØËÉΩÈúÄË¶ÅÂá†‰∏™Â∞èÊó∂„ÄÇ
Step 3: Place An Order
Á¨¨3Ê≠•Ôºö‰∏ãËÆ¢Âçï
Place trade orders for the desired coins or tokens. A limited variety of trading pairs or a lack of liquidity may make this difficult.
‰∏ãËææÊâÄÈúÄÊï∞Â≠óË¥ßÂ∏ÅÊàñ‰ª£Â∏ÅÁöÑ‰∫§ÊòìËÆ¢Âçï„ÄÇ ÊúâÈôêÁöÑÂêÑÁßç‰∫§ÊòìÂØπÊàñÁº∫‰πèÊµÅÂä®ÊÄßÂèØËÉΩ‰ºö‰ΩøËøô‰∏ÄÁÇπÂèòÂæóÂõ∞Èöæ„ÄÇ
Step 4: Withdraw Funds
Á¨¨ÂõõÊ≠•ÔºöÊèêÂèñËµÑÈáë
Withdraw the funds to a wallet that allows you to control your funds and hold your own private keys. This may also take several hours.
Â∞ÜËµÑÈáëÊèêÂèñÂà∞Èí±ÂåÖÔºåÂÖÅËÆ∏‰Ω†ÊéßÂà∂Ëá™ÊúâËµÑÈáëÂπ∂ÊåÅÊúâËá™Â∑±ÁöÑÁßÅÈí•„ÄÇ ËøôÂèØËÉΩËøòÈúÄË¶ÅÂá†‰∏™Â∞èÊó∂„ÄÇ
This process is a hassle and makes digital asset trading an overly complicated task.
