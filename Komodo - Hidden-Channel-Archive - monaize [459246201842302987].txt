[dscrdmnz] <ryman112> Took a break and started to read up on slack but seen you started a discord and joined.  Whats new on Monaize lately?  Hows the project?  Thanks


[15-Aug-18 01:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdmnz] <Zadig> Monaize is operating in France, we  are opening bank accounts for French SMEs at the  moment and will be going on full speed at the end of the year. And we are going thru our Pre-ICO with some high end investors, brought by one of the major Fundraising  investment firm in France. And we are also offering our long time social network followers a special bonus for the pre-ICO , but a minimum investment will be asked . Those  Telegram followers interested on our pre-ICO please send us an email to ico@monaize.com


[15-Aug-18 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdmnz] <Zadig> Monaize will also be launching in the UK for the end of the year and we will be heading to Germany and the US for next year.  Four biggest western economical countries  with the most regulated banking laws.

[17-Aug-18 07:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdmnz] <Zadig> Well let‚Äôs repeat it again , Monaize is already running in France, we will going to the UK end of the year , Germany and US next year, that the reason we are raising funds.

That's the same card you guys used in the demo. Guillaume's card.


[17-Aug-18 07:27 AM] PTYX#6840
The reason I ask is because I was under the impression that regardless of an ICO or precio as you are Carrying out now, that the Monaize banking platform was tested and would be up and running within a very specific time frame that you explained last year. Based on your comments above the time line changed and the banking platform isn't operational yet.


[17-Aug-18 07:30 AM] PTYX#6840
I've been watching the videos where you guys talk about timeframes. I'm wondering why there is such a big delay on the banking side of the platform. Also, why there is a need to raise pre-ico funds for you to become operational


[17-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
because financial industry is the most restrictive?


[17-Aug-18 09:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdmnz] <Zadig> #PTYX  Is my English that bad, or do you have a personal gruge to your questions ? 1. like what was already said we are already opening accounts  for French SMEs.  2 .  We spent 6 months  to build an ICO platform  and Electrum crypto wallets to conduct the ICO. 3.  We are the only banking platform that managed to come out to the market without any private investments., meaning that we invested  more then 1.5M$ since the last 1 8 months  4. We are operating in a highly regulated and   highly costly activity, we are not a decentralized crypto organization.  5. Scaling up wants your technology is finely tuned  and strategy is in place is very easy.  6. And yes we need investors so that we can scale in the real world.


[17-Aug-18 10:33 AM] PTYX#6840
The points you mention above don't correlate with the expectations laid out by your team last year. If it was, you'd be in the UK already. I don't have personal grudges against crypto projects. I'm approaching this in an unbiased manner with the information that I have available to me.


[17-Aug-18 10:41 AM] PTYX#6840
Thanks for answering my questions üòÉ I got all I needed to know


[17-Aug-18 10:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdmnz] <7kharov> Hi PTY, how is it going? Been a long time.

Yes, the planning has shifted, since the dICO was postponed in November 2017, we spent a lot of time with the whole team to come up with a solution for the MNZ ICO. It was heavily tested publicly in May 2018. (6 months). In the mean time, we haven't got the funds to spread & expand to the UK. However, even with small resources we managed to also go further on the French market by executing a large scaled closed b√™ta. 
IBANs and Cards are released every day for french entrepreneurs. If any of you have a french company, we'd be pleased to welcome you in this b√™ta test... It's free of charges for the first year.

Contract & Program for the UK market is waiting for us.... Now, it's about paying it.

I'm not impressed with the card program to be honest. Peer2group managed to get cards in place fairly quickly and distributed them to many users. In any case, thanks for the info.

[dscrdmnz] <Zadig> @KMD-Gateway  PTYX  you are clearly showing  us  your  lack of knowledge on banking .  For your info Peer2group https://peer2.krd/home/  is providing a crypto  (BTC & KMD)  to FIAT debit card , clearly indicated with NO bank account and a B2C product .  Monaize provides French IBAN bank accounts , we are B2B and we also provide  financing, payment solutions and insurance. PTYX I really don‚Äôt understand the spirit behind all your questions, please let‚Äôs be more constructive , collaborative and helpful . We got to share the real spirits  behind Blockchain. If not Blockchain is just a nice word  in vain.

Why are you so threatened by the line of questioning? I'm simply asking things a diligent investor would ask.

Let's talk statistics. How many active user registrations do you have? How many cards have gone out? What is the daily usage of those cards?

[17-Aug-18 01:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrdmnz] <Zadig> @KMD-Gateway  PTYX,  your questions never was a threat, but you are just playing a dumb game. If you are in the real world with a real business, you will not give your key informations to the  competitors . We already have our goals of users for 2018 on our WP and we will stick to it. I‚Äôm sure you have gone thru it.  We are not a decentralized crypto. We are a registered company, we pay taxes, we follow regulations.  So  PTYX please , the politeness wants, to wash your dirty clothes in your own homes.

the reality and the ideal are so different.
look at the bitcoin cash, which is armed with practicality.
on the other hand, look at the bitcoin core team and the blockstream, which is maybe a vain ideal.
It is necessary to narrow the gap between reality and ideal and respond wisely. 
the public is not interested in decentralization.
don't assume that all the public are smart and wise.
the public just likes convenience and ease.
