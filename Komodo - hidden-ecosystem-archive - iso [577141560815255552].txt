Hi


[12-May-19 07:38 AM] McSpirit#4690
This group is regarding the interoperability standard for Blockchains.
https://www.iso.org/committee/6266604.html
It is currently being let by Gilbert from Quant Overledger. That means that they are defining the industry standard for their market. A market that they share with KMD and Blocknet and a few other contenders.
Quant operates from the UK office. 
ISO is an international standards organization. That means that most countries have an standards office. If your country has a standards office then you can submit to participate in defining and reviewing a standard.

I can volunteer and cover for Germany give me information what you need


[12-May-19 07:40 AM] McSpirit#4690
It would be in Komodo's interest to participate in this work. It doesn't have to be Jason who joins, rather it can be community representatives.
You need to find your countries standards office.  In Germany it is DIN


[12-May-19 07:40 AM] forkwitch#6080
Can you share with me the iso proposal


[12-May-19 07:42 AM] McSpirit#4690
After that you  should get in contact with them and ask them if you can do sit-in as a guest in a meeting and get information of how you can get involved. the standard for Blockchain interoperability is ISO/TC 307/SG 7 also see the link in above post.
Some Standards offices carry a fee to join. Komodo might classify as NGO? so that would be a low fee.


[12-May-19 07:44 AM] McSpirit#4690
Collectively you guys have to find out if there is a benefit in joining several countries. Since Komodo is geographically spread out you might be able to influence the process. From what I've been able to gather each country has a vote, so the more countries you operate in the more influence you have. 
With that being said, I understand that @jl777c seeks to cooperate with Quant rather than compete in this matter


[12-May-19 07:45 AM] McSpirit#4690
Once it comes to defining the technical part of the standard then you can take it home to discord and have the support of the devs to define it.


[12-May-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
technically the decentralized solution is to make DTO chains for all the merkle roots


[12-May-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
that allows validating any tx from any chain with just SPV access to the appropriate DTO chain


[12-May-19 07:48 AM] McSpirit#4690
There is a couple of meetings each year. You sit for a couple of hours and run through the proposals of each working group. Then you talk about who to support, sometimes taking into account if supporting one group will further your countries agenda.. This is why it isn't strictly needed to send a dev, it is politics


[12-May-19 07:48 AM] forkwitch#6080
as i am from Germany I can ask for info for all country with German language but I can only go to German offices

If anyone if from Denmark then I can get you the contacts. If there is none from Denmark then I will talk to the people I know in the group and let them know to send some love the way of Komodo


[12-May-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
I think @Audo is from denmark


[12-May-19 07:51 AM] McSpirit#4690
He can DM me for details if it has interest


[12-May-19 09:51 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
this is all new to me, I'll see what exists in Italy


[12-May-19 01:17 PM] McSpirit#4690
@KomodoWorld Italy has a strong group in the Blockchain standards.


[12-May-19 01:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@Malti works for a blockchain company in Belgium, maybe he can look into the standards used there?


[12-May-19 01:36 PM] Malti#3948
Hmm looks new to me. But I know some people in the ‚ÄúBelgian blockchain task force‚Äù so I‚Äôll check it out with them

@polycryptoblog in the US it's ANSI with offices in DC and NY


[12-May-19 11:33 PM] Audo#5667
Not from Denmark but close, Finland


[13-May-19 02:44 AM] Malti#3948
so but how can we get involved?


[13-May-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
first step is to make sure we have enough people who want to be techno-politicians


[13-May-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
then we can make a plan on how to achieve the goals


[13-May-19 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
@miketout is interested in making the awesome tech proposal, we can all get behind that and push it through in as many countries as possible

It would be great if people reported back in this channel once they've talked with their local office.


[14-May-19 02:16 AM] Malti#3948
In Belgium it's 'Agoria' that is currently occupied with the TC307 ISO for blockchains

SG7: Interoperability of blockchain & DLT Systems


[14-May-19 02:16 AM] Malti#3948
I'll see if I can get in touch with them to be a member of the studygroup


[14-May-19 02:23 AM] Malti#3948
it seems agoria is a 'members only' clan and only companies can be members.. My company isn't (yet) but going to inform with some of our strategic partnerships. Will keep the channel posted

might have a way in, but he asked me why I wanted to join and what I have to offer. Told the guy that my view on interoperability is that it's the only way blockchains will be able to succeed. However now, what are the topics I'd need to defend in that studygroup when it comes to a participation from my side?


[14-May-19 05:19 AM] Malti#3948
read the WP long time ago, time to dig in again üïµ


[14-May-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
the tech proposal I will recommend is miketouts merkle mountains approach that is a fully decentralized way


[14-May-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
even though others might try to make their centralized service into an ISO standard, I feel that is the wrong way


[14-May-19 05:26 AM] jl777c#5810
a true standard needs to be accessible to all, so we need to make a platform neutral solution that solves this problem in a fully decentralized way


[14-May-19 05:26 AM] jl777c#5810
for now the main feedback to the ISO committee is the attempt to sneak in a centralized solution into an ISO standard


[14-May-19 05:26 AM] jl777c#5810
just say no!

it is like MSFT trying to make win 3.1 the ISO standard OS to use


[14-May-19 01:35 PM] McSpirit#4690
I would say Komodo one of the oldest interoperability projects has a great justification in helping define the optimal blockchain interoperability standard. Most people in these groups represent business interest or are scholars. Many of them lack more in-depth technical insight into Blockchain technology. The current proposal for an official Blockchain meta-model is lacking at best. You guys can provide insight from the frontlines of where this technology is actually being developed and you have a huge team to pull technical insight from. The meetings are only a couple a year, and most work is done in writing so you can take it back here for insight.


[15-May-19 09:08 AM] Malti#3948
Update; Got a connection who is involved in standardisation discussion in BE who agrees decentralization is key. So should be good to go here!


[15-May-19 09:08 AM] Malti#3948
he'll defend it during the discussions as well


[15-May-19 09:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Try to get invited to these discussions as well


[15-May-19 09:46 AM] Malti#3948
it's difficult, companies only and I don't really have a business case for my boss atm


[15-May-19 10:43 AM] McSpirit#4690
it might vary from country to country. Ask if you can join for a meeting as a guest. Komodo isn't a registered entity so it is difficult to go as Komodo. They must be able to see that


[15-May-19 11:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What are the requirements for companies to enter/participate?


[15-May-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
should be open to any registered company


[15-May-19 12:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
maybe wait for @Malti if he can do it through his job, otherwise if needed @Malti can rep kmd through my company if that is ok for you guys?


[15-May-19 12:25 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and if any company is allowed as mine is not really active in blockchain...


[15-May-19 12:26 PM] Malti#3948
Plus I want to avoid going as ‚Äòkomodo‚Äô


[15-May-19 12:27 PM] Malti#3948
I‚Äôm just a guy who is very pro decentralization

[15-May-19 12:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm if other companies are going as themselves, why not go defending the colors of kmd?


[15-May-19 12:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd = decentralization

For interoperability, a multilaw/multicode standard is needed. I totally agree with @jl777c the standards should be set to allow complete decentralization allowing each community to be independent but at the same time allowing them to be integrated.


[26-May-19 04:28 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
In our community, We had drafted a multilaw protocol last year. I share it below.

Article 7 is interesting, a bit like LGPL and GPL are compatible whereas MPL and GPL are incompatible, transactions across these types of chains and agreements would be non-binding/non-valid.

Terminology is a good exchange - eg simply classifying consensus, and what roles the actors have within the given consensus, the name of the application framework within the chain (crypto conditions vs ABCI), what an input and output is and it‚Äôs state and what it‚Äôs called in


[29-May-19 10:29 AM] McSpirit#4690
from the 27th to the 31st of May the countries are meeting to talk about ISO including the study group for interoperability. It will be interesting to follow if it gets promoted from study group to work group.
