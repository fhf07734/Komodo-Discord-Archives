In the overview tab is it possible to tap on the coin to select them?


[18-Jul-18 11:25 AM] DG#6934
I haven't been able to do it maybe is my touch screen

[18-Jul-18 11:54 AM] Jonathan#3687
it cleared up @pbca26 .......it's still loading though, happened ever since I created a PIN


[18-Jul-18 11:54 AM] DG#6934
Ok got it


[18-Jul-18 11:55 AM] Jonathan#3687

someone in #spanish channel asking why we dont put a PIN on agama, "what sort of security is this?"


[18-Jul-18 06:38 PM] Mylo#8306
and to be fair, i'm on native mode you take my laptop and start agama you've got my wallet with no 2nd layer of security


[18-Jul-18 06:38 PM] Mylo#8306
how do we explain the reasoning?

@Mylo https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/460423170/Why+can+t+I+encrypt+Komodo+Wallet


[18-Jul-18 07:51 PM] Mylo#8306
Legend, thank you!!!


[19-Jul-18 12:31 AM] pbca26#5430
@SHossain back arrow button on the right side doesn't make sense


[19-Jul-18 12:57 AM] ca333#0333
@Mylo pins, 2fa, etc. wont provide any additional security layer since a blackhat could still screw your funds solely with the seed. 
A pin could be used to decrypt a locally stored/encrypted seed, yes - but same story - you always have to ask yourself: will the pin/2fa prevent a 3rd party to empty my seed if it gets hold of it? no - you re screwed anyway.


[19-Jul-18 01:11 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes for sure....but i'd make two less technical / circumstantial what-ifs:
 1.  what-if a pin makes me feel safe
2.  my laptop / phone / tablet physically goes missing - in the hours of realising they are missing, and the dumb-hat systematically guesses my 4 digit combo, i have an opportunity to pull seeds into another app and transfer.
3.  contracts in wallet, just with physical access to an open full chain wallet, make immutable changes (prankster friends or siblings)

You get a bonus third @ca333 - for smart contract developments :P

Credit cards have pins - may be ineffective but make people feel safe for adopting.


[19-Jul-18 01:31 AM] pbca26#5430
pin codes fall into ease of use category
not sure why people feel safer with 4 digit pins to access their bank accounts
we already have pin encrypted option for lite mode
in theory it's possible to use local komodod as a relay node only and keep priv keys encrypted locally
that's what already happening if you use tools -> split/merge utxo feature
but for z tx it's still have to be pure native implementation for now


[19-Jul-18 01:42 AM] Mylo#8306
yep, ease of use / comfortability.  different types of users too i guess, native vs lite.  if native, you have to know what you're sign up for.

thanks!!


[19-Jul-18 01:43 AM] Mylo#8306
i should use lite mode more often.  my wallet habits should improve!


[19-Jul-18 03:11 AM] SHossain#0007
@pbca26 i didn't mean the back arrow button.

that menu seems to be always right @SHossain


[19-Jul-18 04:38 AM] ca333#0333
i just checked two apps i use with 10m+ downloads/installations on droid


[19-Jul-18 04:38 AM] ca333#0333
same here - its always right-sided


[19-Jul-18 04:40 AM] SHossain#0007
The apps i checked, are on the left side. i.e. Play Store and other Google Apps, Twitter, Slack, Discord etc. There are few apps that uses right sided hamburger menu.


[19-Jul-18 04:40 AM] SHossain#0007
iOS uses mostly right sided


[19-Jul-18 04:44 AM] SHossain#0007
google chrome on Android uses right side. my guess is that is to keep it in line with desktop chrome browser experience. 
but, it is ok if no change.


[19-Jul-18 04:45 AM] SHossain#0007
i was just thinking out loud 😃

[19-Jul-18 01:03 PM] DG#6934
Hi @pbca26  do you think that we can get a feature for users to change their pin on Agama?


[19-Jul-18 01:04 PM] pbca26#5430
we sure can


[19-Jul-18 01:04 PM] DG#6934
I think the current version only allows users to destroy the pin but yeah technically is the same at the end


[19-Jul-18 01:04 PM] DG#6934
they will only need to destroy the previous pin and then roll back a new one


[19-Jul-18 01:06 PM] pbca26#5430
i added it to my todo list


[19-Jul-18 01:07 PM] pbca26#5430
i guess i should also add it on mobile

No mention of "default placement for a hamburger menu" https://material.io/design/components/menus.html#theming

however, the hamburger menu (3 _ lines stacked) is usually on LHS and an alternate 3 dots (. stacked) menu appears on the RHS (right hand side).

ok. i should have said better android experience for me as an user than `default`. :)
@Mylo I'm a huge fan of Google Material Design since they released it.


[20-Jul-18 02:53 AM] SHossain#0007
I've been using Android since Google released the first Android phone HTC Dream/T-Mobile G1. I've seen the whole evolution of Android and how it just keep getting better and optimised. It was exciting to root, use custom kernel, recovery, overclock that 528MHz processor and free some extra RAM to make it faster. and, of course trying different ROMs for different features.


[20-Jul-18 11:35 PM] Mylo#8306
Ah I lost track of ROMs when my sony screen broke and got a samsung s5.  flashing the sony was cool.

In agama news, i have osx 10.12.5 and agama 0.2.41 and it just has a blank screen.  ps aux | grep komodo doesn't list any daemon running either.  From d/l page.  I'll have another look later today hopefully what is going on with it.


[20-Jul-18 11:35 PM] Mylo#8306
@SHossain in case you have had reports ^


[21-Jul-18 12:14 AM] pbca26#5430

https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/30441474/Reset+Agama+Settings  I can't get to this screen because of blank at start up.

Are the settings available to be reset/rm from somewhere near wallet.dat location (e.g. https://support.supernet.org/support/solutions/articles/29000010755-where-are-the-wallet-dat-files-saved-for-komodo-on-agama-if-using-in-native-mode-)


[21-Jul-18 02:23 AM] Mylo#8306
actually ../Agama.  mv config.json to config.json.bak but still same


[21-Jul-18 02:34 AM] pbca26#5430
can you check if dev prop is set to false in config?


[21-Jul-18 02:34 AM] Mylo#8306

About 2 weeks ago I deleted the CoinsDB folder when I updated to 1.1.0.

Is the app's "Trade History" window failing?  Does it need to fail more gracefully?

Coinsdb folder issue did you overcome ? @Mylo


[22-Jul-18 05:36 PM] Mylo#8306
No it's only recent (last 30 mins) when i used barterdex.


[22-Jul-18 05:36 PM] Mylo#8306
Do i need to create CoinsDB folder?


[22-Jul-18 05:38 PM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
like i said on my previous chat,  you need to click "fetch coinsdb update" and restart bdex


[22-Jul-18 05:38 PM] Mylo#8306
Maybe I don't have CHIPS in my new CoinsDB and my trade history has CHIPS trades, so the info isn't there for it to get icons/explorers etc.


[22-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Mylo#8306
Yep, i didn't re-initialize CHIPS in new CoinsDB - only other coins.


[22-Jul-18 05:42 PM] Mylo#8306
Yes, makes all the difference.
Need to add coins to local CoinsDB that you have previous trades in, otherwise trade history screen stalls.

@Nabob | $ARRR does the latest video or guide work for you?


[23-Jul-18 03:41 AM] SHossain#0007
Latest BarterDEX GUI with `coins` repo feature is designed that way. Everytime you fetch update or want to add coins to your local db, you need to restart. If you don't restart BarterDEX GUI, you will not be able to use them.


[23-Jul-18 04:00 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004

on a second thought i'd rather make it more forgiving

https://github.com/pbca26/agama-mobile/releases/tag/v0.1.0a
updated proxy error behavior + added animation on retry button tap
now it will make 3 consecutive retries before displaying manual retry button
this should make it less annoying when a connection is temp lost
3 retries logic should reapply whenever a connection is restored and then lost again
also, i installed cron scripts on both proxies to start every 5 min if nodejs session is dead and on reboot event
hopefully no more annoying proxy error thing
btc spv servers are updated as well

i couldn't reproduce scaling/resizing issues i've seen on @DG's screenshots
does anyone else have anything similar, ui not centered properly/cut off?

all in all i think i addressed most of the serious issues/feedback from qa team
i will work on navigation improvements somewhere in sept/oct

[24-Jul-18 06:52 PM] DG#6934
Good evening @pbca26  and gentleman  do you think we can push the release of the mobile version for users that have issues with the web wallet ?


[24-Jul-18 06:58 PM] Jonathan#3687
They aren't the same version are they?


[24-Jul-18 07:02 PM] DG#6934
No they aren’t I believe the app should be coded in other version


[24-Jul-18 07:03 PM] DG#6934
But maybe first we confirm with pbca how he see things


[24-Jul-18 07:03 PM] DG#6934
Other than the issue that we saw I haven’t seen any other major one.


[24-Jul-18 07:03 PM] DG#6934
Apparently there are lots of mobile users


[24-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Jonathan#3687
Makes sense but I don't see web wallet issues impacting mobile releases. Agree though for @pbca26 to confirm

[25-Jul-18 12:28 AM] pbca26#5430
no it's impossible as both are different code bases
however desktop and web are 90% the same code and look wise
any improvements i make to either of the two can be applied to the other agama type


[25-Jul-18 12:30 AM] pbca26#5430
i will try to fix the issue with the web wallet asap
it's been bugging users since mid last year on desktop


[25-Jul-18 12:32 AM] pbca26#5430
please let me know about any issues with mobile wallet
i have a feeling we're pretty close to stable release

Well the balanced was finally updated after a while , I think is also maybe the cellphone connection that can take into effect


[25-Jul-18 10:26 AM] DG#6934
I have to many programs on the phone


[25-Jul-18 10:44 AM] DG#6934
I am using the pin to enter by the way


[25-Jul-18 11:18 AM] Jonathan#3687
Yeah that was the big time difference for me with loading, pin vs no pin


[25-Jul-18 11:32 AM] pbca26#5430
@DG what's you phone model and android version?


[25-Jul-18 11:33 AM] pbca26#5430
so it's finally working for you
that's a good sign


[25-Jul-18 11:49 AM] SHossain#0007

Galaxy tab 3 can't run the wallet


[25-Jul-18 03:06 PM] DG#6934
maybe I need to put it in the trash


[26-Jul-18 01:03 AM] pbca26#5430
do you have android 7 on it or lower?


[26-Jul-18 07:53 AM] DG#6934
its lower let me check


[26-Jul-18 10:18 AM] SHossain#0007
Galaxy Tab 3 most probably have Android Lollipop


[26-Jul-18 10:18 AM] SHossain#0007
5.x


[26-Jul-18 02:54 PM] DG#6934
Yes I just got a hold of the tab and it’s 4.4 I will try to update it


[27-Jul-18 12:20 AM] pbca26#5430
4.4 is a bit too low
i'm testing on 5.1

Curl_openssl_3 error persists on  Agama Portable version, Ubuntu OS 18.04
Can we overcome  this error,  instead going through workaround solution

sudo apt-get install libcurl3 @pbca26  @ca333


[27-Jul-18 01:20 AM] pbca26#5430
if you're using linux it's expected you know what you're doing

Agama works fine with Ubuntu 18.04


[27-Jul-18 11:42 AM] SHossain#0007
I have switched to fresh Ubuntu 18.04 installation recently and testing everything on this base.


[27-Jul-18 11:43 AM] SHossain#0007
Also, Komodo CLI daemon works fine. Only thing is we need to use gcc 5 to compile. the default gcc 7 version is not working properly. @libscott is working on it.


[30-Jul-18 08:07 PM] DG#6934
Guys the issues that we are seeing with Agama getting stuck on assets like Chainzilla and Equalizer how can we fix it? Siu is telling me that a new daemon fixes it


[30-Jul-18 08:09 PM] DG#6934
mostly a False Alarm


[30-Jul-18 08:09 PM] DG#6934
it just seems to get stucked and then it finishes the loading at the end


[30-Jul-18 08:09 PM] DG#6934
will keep testing


[30-Jul-18 09:12 PM] Jonathan#3687
@DG Yeah Sui gave the EQL people instructions to replace komodod.exe in C:\Program Files\AgamaApp\resources\app\assets\bin\win64\  for the fix and for Windows specifically. It didn't happen with the other OS's


[30-Jul-18 09:26 PM] DG#6934

[31-Jul-18 09:40 AM] SHossain#0007
i was testing today with Agama v41. EQL chain sync got stuck from fresh start


[31-Jul-18 09:42 AM] Jonathan#3687
Got stuck right away or the 61xxx block?


[31-Jul-18 09:43 AM] SHossain#0007
61428


[31-Jul-18 09:43 AM] DG#6934
yes thats the same block that I had , the thing that I don't know


[31-Jul-18 09:44 AM] DG#6934
is that I went to sleep , and in the Linux and Mac version it also got stuck on that same block


[31-Jul-18 09:44 AM] DG#6934
but after a while it synced completely


[31-Jul-18 09:44 AM] DG#6934
so I don't know if it will happen the same with the Windows version because I was sleeping


[31-Jul-18 09:45 AM] DG#6934
I will do it again just in case


[31-Jul-18 09:46 AM] Jonathan#3687
yeah I'll run it too on my windows vm, still syncing ocean on my host at the moment


[31-Jul-18 09:46 AM] SHossain#0007
Ocean sync should be much faster than Agama


[31-Jul-18 09:46 AM] SHossain#0007
for Komodo


[31-Jul-18 09:47 AM] SHossain#0007
using Linux CLI, me and jl777 had 1.5 hours for full Komodo blockchain sync


[31-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Jonathan#3687
something got corrupted and had to do it from scratch, it's been quite slow (on windows at least)


[31-Jul-18 09:52 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
its not the same i agree with @Jonathan , OceanQT wallet taking  long time to sync


[31-Jul-18 10:06 AM] pbca26#5430
all builds are updated
let me know if that fix the issue

It doesn't happen in win 10 btw


[01-Aug-18 12:12 AM] pbca26#5430
it's a well known issue
i'm not sure about exact cause
seems to me only a portion of users is affected by it
i never had anything similar on any of my vm/laptops even after hardkill (taskkill, pkill)
can you suggest to the user to try bumping cliStopTimeout settings option? say to 10000ms
another thing they can try is stopping daemon manually before closing the app

one of eql servers spits errors on mobile, nothing i can do now

Agama sync for EQL & ZILLA works fine in Linux as well.


[01-Aug-18 09:51 AM] SHossain#0007
@pbca26 Agama still shows version `v41` rather than `v41a`


[01-Aug-18 09:57 AM] pbca26#5430
guys i think vrsc is also affected with the issue
i'm not sure how all 3 chains are relevant


[01-Aug-18 09:58 AM] pbca26#5430
@SHossain you mean in the app it shows v41?


[01-Aug-18 09:58 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

yes, could be


[01-Aug-18 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
users may get confused and provide us with wrong version number while reporting issues. another build with the correct version displayed would be great 😃

Please Add "Claim Reward" On AGAMA Wallet For Ledger Wallet Users ...
There are many of users who invest a lots of money into Komodo and stored them with Ledger Wallet because it safer than storing it into our computer and plus Ledger is easy to use. So we want Komod...

IF the QT is going to be released for new users then I will recommend making the complete launch installation procedure of Agama because if you have never installed Komodod or the Zcash Params it won't run

[01-Aug-18 08:12 PM] Jonathan#3687
For the current user base I agree but for expanding to new user groups I think Agama is the go to app. Of course both apps will please everyone in the long run 😃


[02-Aug-18 03:16 AM] SHossain#0007
yes. i think you are right @Jonathan . Agama offers few convinience which will retain it's own userbase.

[02-Aug-18 03:30 AM] SHossain#0007
The linux dependencies for compiling Komodo installs libcurl4 which in turn removes libcurl3 from the system. Yesterday, I installed libcurl3 and now getting errors with compiling komodod.
Tried installing the deps again and here is the terminal printouts:
```
The following additional packages will be installed:
  libcurl4
Suggested packages:
  libcurl4-doc libidn11-dev libkrb5-dev libldap2-dev librtmp-dev libssh2-1-dev
The following packages will be REMOVED
  libcurl3
The following NEW packages will be installed
  curl libcurl4 libcurl4-openssl-dev
```
I guess it would be nice if Agama supports libcurl4


[02-Aug-18 03:46 AM] pbca26#5430
i don't control where linux renders app titles
agama doesn't need libcurl4
apt-get install is a normal way to install necessary perquisites on linux
not really sure what's your suggestion


[02-Aug-18 03:56 AM] SHossain#0007
when i have libcurl4 installed as normal deps of komodo source, that didn't let me use Agama native mode. yesterday @Nabob | $ARRR suggested that i install libcurl3 which fixed the issue (also removed libcurl4 automatically). this morning i got error compiling komodod and running already compiled VRSC daemon with libcrurl3 installed in my system. 
then, i installed libcurl4 which allowed me to compile komodod from jl777 branch successfully, but, EQL native wallet using Agama doesn't work.


[02-Aug-18 03:57 AM] pbca26#5430
is it a problem with agama specifically or komodod?


[02-Aug-18 03:58 AM] SHossain#0007
as far as i see
- komodod works with libcurl4
- Agama native wallet works with libcurl3


[02-Aug-18 03:59 AM] SHossain#0007
or, at least that is the case in Ubuntu 18.04


[02-Aug-18 03:59 AM] pbca26#5430
>Agama native wallet works with libcurl3
that's still komodod under the hood


[02-Aug-18 04:00 AM] SHossain#0007
that is also true.


[02-Aug-18 04:01 AM] SHossain#0007
let me run some tests compiling master branch from jl777's repo and KP repo. will post my findings


[02-Aug-18 04:02 AM] pbca26#5430
okay
by the looks of it we have several komodod variations in the wild


[02-Aug-18 04:37 AM] SHossain#0007
I tested compiling komodod from both repo. they compile only with libcurl4 installed in system. wouldn't compile with libcurl3. if you compile komodod with libcurl4, it will work with libcurl4. does not work with libcurl3. tried downgrading to libcurl3 in my system and ram `./komodod &` outputs this error `./komodod: /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libcurl.so.4: version `CURL_OPENSSL_4' not found (required by ./komodod)`


[02-Aug-18 04:38 AM] SHossain#0007
is it possible that the bins we are using inside Agama are being built with different setup? 🤔


[02-Aug-18 04:41 AM] SHossain#0007
compiling with libcurl3 spits this error
```
...
Fetching native_ccache...

```


[02-Aug-18 04:45 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
If you add softlinks for curl3, Libcurl.so.3, Can you check if it works ?


[02-Aug-18 04:46 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
atm, i dont have Ubuntu 18 to test


[02-Aug-18 04:48 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll try that. if you have ubuntu 16.04, please test on that as well. we need to isolate this and provide consistance experience for users.


[02-Aug-18 04:54 AM] SHossain#0007
this may be only related to Ubuntu 18.04


[02-Aug-18 04:58 AM] SHossain#0007
other apps also has issues running in Ubuntu 18.04 due to libcurl4 and libcurl3 conflicts. https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=libcurl3+conflicts+libcurl4&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiYpNvOps7cAhXFSsAKHckrCSAQ1QIIjAEoAA&biw=1853&bih=956

I have tested on Barterdex, seems CoinsDB Issues still have, As we see recently  Users asking abt electrum servers not loading

--  Latest Version  ensure CoinsDB works, but fails with default KMD Img and its electrums
--  Reset button :  It reset Coins on Bdex  refresh back to default state(removes startup coins), earlier it just reset coin info (explorers,electrum). 
--  Tested Bdex without Bdex CoinsDB folder, By deleting caoins DB folder.
 no electrum issues, images Not loaded on startup -- all this routes to this missing folder

After deleting, https://www.screencast.com/t/TbF2y5wgof

expected : --
When mandatory folder(CoinsDB) missing, gui relaunch should fix all mandatory fixes like default images and default coin electrum details

-- Some electrum coins like Etomic taking time to Load(just a headsup)

@Jonathan @pbca26 the issue still exsists on macOS version as the komodod binary for macOS is still the old one. @ca333 is working on fixing it.

I just explained that there are only 2 situations user can have issue with coinsdb:
- user upgraded from 0.xx version to 1.xx version, and see undefined or no images for coins.
Solution: go to coins manager, push red reset button. restart. It HAS to be done for Every install which is upgrading from 0.xx to 1.xx. There is no way around. Old version did not had coinsdb and since this added to 1.xx this process has to be followed.

- in 1.xx version the user gets no drop down box to select and add new coin to the new list.
Solution: it happens when user pushes the blue fetch coins update button. It somehow does mess up the drop down rendering after getting the update from coinsdb database from github, and just deletes the html element of drop down. Until someone looks into it, just use the workaround. Restart barterdex and go to coins manager screen and you'll see the drop down with latest upates. not need to re do the fetch updates again as it's been done before restart.

@everyone 
**ATTN: ALL TESTERS!!! HIGH PRIORITY!!!**
Team, as you might already aware that we have a hardforking change coming up at block height 1,000,000 (1 Million). Before that we need to make sure the komodo source is working as expected across all OS and does not contain any critical bug. Please compile CLI binaries from **beta** branch in Linux, macOS, (and if you can in Windows, otherwise use pre-compiled binary for Windows which we are hoping to be available soon, @ca333  is working on it.)

jl777 just synchronized jl777 -> dev -> beta. So, we only need to test this branch and once testing is passed, it will become the new master branch.

I have created a test plan spreadsheet https://goo.gl/sR4NuC and already populated some names in there. If your name is not there and would like to test, please create a new column at the right-end and copy-paste a single tester profile or ask me to create a profile for you.

You can use this guide for the first test https://goo.gl/ZGw8Vp (This doc mentions jl777 branch, please make sure you use beta branch instead of jl777).

Please let me know if you have any questions

What's the plan for testing the new rewards code? regtest?


[07-Aug-18 11:21 AM] Mylo#8306
testing rewards & CC stuff - probably however you like.  i think it's good you guys use real chains whilst duke and i get regtest stuff going because it's early days.  the return on our time investment in regtest will be realised, however the regtest stuff is still a cpl weeks off catching up with live chain capabilities.  there's minor bugs in regtest mode that stall our work by a few hours at a time.


[07-Aug-18 11:22 AM] SHossain#0007
I have completed the first test from beta branch in Linux. Everything is working fine.
Only, CHAIN went on fork twice and that terminated the daemon. Starting the chain 2nd time after deleting the full CHAIN data dir, it synced all blocks without issue. This seems a normal behaviour. Please keep an on this when you are testing. on any platform.


[07-Aug-18 11:22 AM] Mylo#8306
and it's a bit unpredictable.  i'm also testing curl/rpc instead of cli.


[07-Aug-18 11:27 AM] Alright#0419
How could we get a testnet up with block height triggers activated?


[07-Aug-18 11:27 AM] Alright#0419
or will we rely on regtest for that?


[07-Aug-18 11:41 AM] Mylo#8306
testnet vs a live blockchain?   dn't think there's a difference.   regtest allows for interesting scenarios, like having up to 1000 nodes and have a % of them not synced to 100%


[07-Aug-18 11:41 AM] Mylo#8306
as an example, but we're not shooting for that atm


[07-Aug-18 01:39 PM] SHossain#0007

Use beta branch from jl777's repo. not KP repo, as KP repo beta branch was last updated 19 May, 2018


[08-Aug-18 03:55 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
Thanks, @SHossain corrected, working on it


[08-Aug-18 03:58 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
same error failed at autoreconf


[08-Aug-18 04:06 AM] SHossain#0007
i just compiled from fresh source in my mac. no issues so far. check if you are using latest version of libraries and deps


[08-Aug-18 04:08 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
ok, I ll check, may be am doing in wrong way somewhere


[08-Aug-18 04:16 AM] SHossain#0007
my mac already synced 57k blocks


[08-Aug-18 06:40 AM] SHossain#0007
763k blocks synced in my mac


[08-Aug-18 08:29 AM] SHossain#0007
@Decker does the KomodoOcean-QT wallet already have the 1M block hardfork changes?


[08-Aug-18 08:35 AM] SHossain#0007
@geforce209ad has installed and syncing blocks from scratch in his Windows machine in order to make a video on how to install and use KomodoOcean-QT wallet.


[08-Aug-18 09:34 AM] SHossain#0007

assetchains sync is next


[08-Aug-18 09:42 AM] DG#6934
on Mac I had to update to Gcc6 in order for it to complete the zcash params build that's not in our current guides...


[08-Aug-18 09:42 AM] DG#6934
Also my Linux machine crashed after almost finishing the loading of the blocks lol so I had to switch to a server just now


[08-Aug-18 03:21 PM] Decker#3767
@SHossain Sorry for delay with answer. Yep. Komodo-Qt is fully compatible with 1M KMD changes. But it have some issues with sync some assets (ZILLA for example), we already have solution for this and will release new updated version in 1-2 days. But what about KMD chain - it's 100% compatible.


[08-Aug-18 03:21 PM] Decker#3767
I'm using Komodo-Qt every day as a main KMD wallet.


[08-Aug-18 03:22 PM] SHossain#0007
I have tested Komodo CLI from beta branch in Linux and macOS. Everything seems to be working fine on my end. Will test AC sync in macOS in the morning.


[08-Aug-18 03:22 PM] SHossain#0007
by theory windows should have issue either.

all other AC seems to be fine


[09-Aug-18 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems there are many CHAIN peers on the wrong chain, making it easier to go on fork

fyi i spoke to miketout today
he asked if i want their (verus) changes to be merged and i said yes
so we might have a certain number of unexpected new features in agama in future


[09-Aug-18 07:53 AM] SHossain#0007
Nice


[09-Aug-18 08:02 AM] pbca26#5430
on another note
since i'm quite a lazy person
i've spent some time to make a small agama linux build server
this will allow me to (re)build agama for qa so we can have it all well tested before making a public release


[09-Aug-18 08:05 AM] pbca26#5430
as a side effect i also updated install/build instructions in readme and fixed shell scripts for easier cloning
in case someone else would like to fork agama

I was testing Barterdex on a windows server and sometimes it crashes when you add a lot of coins at the same time. But I am seeing users that have 1 core CPUs  are getting difficulties loading their coins. Could this be a hardware issue at the end?

@Nabob | $ARRR 
> For asset chains:  Assetchains.old doesn't have GLXT, ZILLA, EQL and RFOX chains params entries

This may be due to using old version of `assetchains.old` file
use:
```
cd ~komodo/srcc
git reset --hard
git checkout beta
git pull
```
this should fetch the latest file with the params.


[10-Aug-18 09:25 AM] DG#6934
I did get the RFOX ZILLA GLXT EQL ACs without doing a reset , but that was on my second attempt on Linux , the first time I got errors running .


[10-Aug-18 09:32 AM] SHossain#0007
sometimes due to low system resources, one or more chain will stop working when we use `./assestchains.old` script to start all at once.


[10-Aug-18 09:33 AM] SHossain#0007
this is normal. Also, i have seen RFOX daemon stops when using the script. need to use the script 2nd time to start it again.


[10-Aug-18 09:35 AM] DG#6934
hmmm yeah that's what happened to me I think

@ca333 @jl777c Linux and macOS seems stable based on the test reports. Once we have compiled Windows binary, we can jump on testing that.


[10-Aug-18 09:38 AM] SHossain#0007
I am sure Windows should be stable too as they are using same source. 
Once Windows is verified, we just need a new Agama release with latest binaries.


[10-Aug-18 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
windows is always having windows issues though...


[10-Aug-18 09:45 AM] ca333#0333
the crosscompilation build succeeded finally on travisubuntu VM ! i had to use a 18.04 with an exotic dependency setup. couldnt get it to successfully build on 14.0x, 15.0x or 16.0x without issues and additional efforts compared to my debian setup which is the same setup i implemented on jenkins. i am adding it to travis for a test-build now. gonna share the win version with you personally - we need to compare the debian and ubuntu crossbuilds. also we might have found a little issue regarding proper tagging. We splitted the deployment into branch and os based deployment. for the master branch we have a reoccuring issue where a wrong tag is being set although the config say the opposite. we opened a issue ticket on travis github. (we can rename the tags manually so that doesnt have any neg. effect on the binaries and their functinoality) - just a beauty-detail.

[10-Aug-18 10:29 AM] DG#6934
Talking about Resources...do the latest Barterdex release is demanding more resources than previous versions?


[10-Aug-18 10:30 AM] DG#6934
I am having issues on 1 core CPUs and 2 core CPUs are running without so many glitches


[10-Aug-18 10:31 AM] DG#6934
I can confirm this from my side ...some users also have mentioned the previous versions of Barterdex were working fine and now if they try to add their full portfolio they will get the endless spinning wheel or MM crashing


[10-Aug-18 11:31 AM] SHossain#0007
marketmaker uses at least 1 core. minimum another core is necessary for running other things


[10-Aug-18 11:31 AM] SHossain#0007
1 core system is not recommended for barterDEX


[10-Aug-18 11:32 AM] SHossain#0007
and most likely will have issues

I'm testing thw windows binary now now. Syncing from scratch. It is slow sync compared to other OS. (KomodoOcean-QT should have faster sync in Windows).

I'm launching a new chain tomorrow to try to incentivize testing. 
http://pad.supernet.org/staked
Post an address there, you will receive an equal amount from the initial premine as everyone else. The plan is to snapshot/airdrop every 6 days with 1 day in between.(testing different params each week) If you break the chain, you will receive extra coins from the premine of the new chain. We will continually do this until we arrive at a stable chain, and this stable chain will live on as STAKED.(name up for discussion)


[12-Aug-18 12:35 PM] Alright#0419
premine will be distributed at 3 PM GMT, pay attention to the POSTEST64 channel in the CHIPS discord if you're interested

[13-Aug-18 12:40 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
@grewalsatinder  In windows while loading chaincoin,  Coins  file has referring  linux path  of conf file directory

`confpath":"USERHOME/.chaincoincore/chaincoin.conf"`
It should be 
`confpath":"%appdata%\chaincoin\chaincoin.conf"`


[13-Aug-18 01:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
USERHOME string should automatically be changed to the windows %AppData% directory path if marketmaker is run on windows.
it's the code condition added in marketmaker binary. If it's not happening, then most probably it's a bug. Unless the JSON settings are incorrect somehow.

@SHossain Should I use pre-release binary (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/tag/master-multios-201808101223-32f6814) for Windows column in this list?

@Jonathan can you make a ticket for #1?
also, can you share any details about what happens exactly when you use pin?


[14-Aug-18 09:04 AM] Jonathan#3687
made one for all three, yeah I'll update the ticket - basically the button wouldn't work


[14-Aug-18 09:06 AM] pbca26#5430
how are you updating the app?
uninstall/install or just install new version?

works fine everywhere else though

@SHossain  Please help to create private channel for uptime Monitor. I need an discord webhook for that channel, Need to check bot listens to uptime , else we use slack channel


[14-Aug-18 09:31 AM] SHossain#0007
can't we have the alert coming to supportdesk as we currently have?
kmdexplorer.io is very stable, didn't see them going offline. seprate channel is not needed in my opinion unless we see frequent downtime.


[14-Aug-18 09:36 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
We will get flooded with support tickets, If we have a channel, Team also knows explorer status. so we can handle support questions instead seaching in ticket stack

kmdexplorer.io is healthy, Just testing the monitoring


[14-Aug-18 09:37 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
earlier, we enabled to both helpdesk , slack and individual mails for monitoring alerts


[14-Aug-18 09:55 AM] SHossain#0007
simply help desk is fine. they won't flood with tickets as i have not seen them go offline since Decker started them in a dedicated server in a data center. without them going offline, there wouldn't be support tickets.


[14-Aug-18 10:06 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004

@Jonathan https://github.com/pbca26/agama-mobile/issues/10
can you explain what exactly is wrong in your case?
after install you're supposed to create a new pin
there's a toggle on the login screen that allows you to do it
i'm trying to understand if i'm missing something or it's not intuitive enough

@pbca26 on a fresh install I toggle Create/Override PIN -> enter a PIN -> the button isn't selectable


[16-Aug-18 11:36 AM] pbca26#5430
do you enter your seed/wif as well?


[16-Aug-18 11:37 AM] Jonathan#3687
Nope, used a PIN I created in the last version


[16-Aug-18 11:38 AM] pbca26#5430
you need to provide both or just a seed/wif in case you want to access several addresses


[16-Aug-18 11:39 AM] pbca26#5430
i guess i should add a descriptive message

i couldn't reproduce #9 related to inability to add a coin while fetching another coin's data
changes in build 48:
- added animation to spv server selector button so that it doesn't look broken
- disabled btx, ninja, vote2018, mesh and shark
- added coins sorting in alphabetical order for easier navigation
- enabled pin toggle by default on login and added a message as we discussed yesterday

[20-Aug-18 10:13 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm trying to create multisig, fund it and send funds back in a raw transaction. 

Am I missing something conceptual? 

1) Created multisig 
```
./komodo-cli createmultisig 2 "[\"02b259160904639c1afba971771e234ca3cf89885ebe595c4f420b3b67424dca8a\",\"03b747beafb26ffbecac879b3a5501638f1401e9089d1a9cb5fab3cd9976c22e76\"]"
{
  "address": "bR2TmHRXHqkHVM5XZAUcqLDEPAaaAbekAn",
  "redeemScript": "522102b259160904639c1afba971771e234ca3cf89885ebe595c4f420b3b67424dca8a2103b747beafb26ffbecac879b3a5501638f1401e9089d1a9cb5fab3cd9976c22e7652ae"
}
```

2) Funded it
https://www.kmdexplorer.io/tx/0e8eeed4247dbdfe04ef8c4bada9fd248ec6ef391e1ed48983e369024701dc24

3) 

But cant see UTXO to create a rawtransaction:

```
./komodo-cli listunspent 1 9999999 "[\"bR2TmHRXHqkHVM5XZAUcqLDEPAaaAbekAn\"]"
[
]
```

And my wallet balance still 0

```
./komodo-cli getbalance bR2TmHRXHqkHVM5XZAUcqLDEPAaaAbekAn
0.00000000
```

But it's valid
```
./komodo-cli validateaddress bR2TmHRXHqkHVM5XZAUcqLDEPAaaAbekAn
{
  "isvalid": true,
  "address": "bR2TmHRXHqkHVM5XZAUcqLDEPAaaAbekAn",
  "scriptPubKey": "a91486e1d249289dfaa287e1b72deada3f650ed4c3f887",
  "segid": 45,
  "ismine": false,
  "iswatchonly": false,
  "isscript": true
}
```


[21-Aug-18 12:46 AM] jl777c#5810
the multisig address is not in your wallet


[21-Aug-18 12:46 AM] jl777c#5810
you can probably add it as a watchonly address, but need to do it before the txid is processed


[21-Aug-18 12:46 AM] jl777c#5810
btc is amazingly primitive in its multisig support

@everyone Team, I would like to thank you all for your continued hard work in the last few weeks, testing the contracts and other things. We found plenty of bugs and those are now fixed. The codebase is pretty solid now. Our target was to finish testing and be ready before block 980,000 and we have done that.
Also, huge shout out to Support Team, they closed a lot of tickets which has been pending for a long time.
Well done to all of you and thank you again for your efforts.
Next 2 weeks will be crucial for all of us with the hardfork activation. We need to ensure that pools, exchanges, service providers & end users are using latest Komodo version. If we work together, we can easily ensure a smooth operation.

@Angelina @Nabob | $ARRR @DG @Jonathan @Mylo @jusoaresf @Yassin @goldenman Please test this new Agama version 0.2.41c https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama/releases/tag/multios-0.2.41c
Contains latest komodo binary for Linux, MacOS & Winodws. I have tested all 3 OS releases and all of them are working on my end. There was an issue with macOS build, @ca333 fixed it. The current version has been remvoed from the website, artifacts site and users will not be able to download them until we test and upload the links to our website.
This is a high priority testing.!!!

@jusoaresf Ubuntu 18.04 update is not mandetory, upgrade only if you wish to. I'm using Ubuntu 18.04 in my computer.
@ca333 i didn't find  issues from side. sync, import priv key, send, reveice working as expected.

So it would not break our stuff. Will update after done with tests


[26-Aug-18 04:56 AM] SHossain#0007
it shouldn't break anything. i didn't upgrade my computer. i installed directly from installation media


[26-Aug-18 04:57 AM] ca333#0333
perfect - i will initiate the installer build.


[26-Aug-18 04:57 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks very much @ca333


[26-Aug-18 05:04 AM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 Pleaes let me know what do you think about the following:
1. When Agama repo gets updated, this pulls latest komodo master branch bianry from KP/komodo repo and auto builds Agama
2. When we update KP/komodo master branch by merging from jl777/master, this should also trigger a build for Agama using the latest binaries after the komodo binaries been compiled and uploaded to github


[26-Aug-18 05:17 AM] ca333#0333
thats already the current build procedure. same on jenkins - only difference is the pull from git instead of artifacts.

{Reactions}
💯 

[26-Aug-18 05:17 AM] ca333#0333
we can have autobuilds set for any branch we want


[26-Aug-18 05:18 AM] ca333#0333
right now i have master branch for Agama - always using master komodod.
and komodod we get autobuild triggered on commits to master or dev.


[26-Aug-18 05:19 AM] ca333#0333
we can also configure it with further conditions - i.e. only if a tag is pushed to github, etc.


[26-Aug-18 05:19 AM] ca333#0333
just let me know what the preference would be. as for master branch - we should only do rare updates on that base (only if necessary via merge). so that should keep the master base stable all the time.


[26-Aug-18 05:24 AM] SHossain#0007
@pbca26 ^^


[26-Aug-18 05:39 AM] ca333#0333
for your info @SHossain - i talked with pbca26 yesterday while creating the Agama build jobs and we agreed to use master and dev branch for Agama builds where dev branch builds are specially for QA/tests.


[26-Aug-18 05:39 AM] SHossain#0007
perfectly fine with me

[26-Aug-18 05:40 AM] ca333#0333
i just tested the electron builder (instead of bitrock install builder) and it seems its not suitable/stable and creating a oversized installer. `➜  Agama_git git:(pkg_automation_electrum) ✗ ls -lah dist/Agama-0.2.40.dmg
-rw-r--r--@ 1 crypto  staff   344M 26 Aug 14:34 dist/Agama-0.2.40.dmg`


[26-Aug-18 05:41 AM] ca333#0333
also it produces a huge 344MB installer - i ll try to reduce size and check against the included dependencies. but if we cant get it to the legacy size we ll just use the old install builder.


[26-Aug-18 05:42 AM] ca333#0333
"only" benefit was that it didnt ask you for root permission...

@Nabob | $ARRR @DG what are your testing results?


[26-Aug-18 07:59 AM] ca333#0333
@SHossain https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama/releases/tag/multios-0.2.41c - those are all files. the "portable" ones are one-click bundles. For windows and linux we also have an installer. For OSX i removed the installer and we will only distribute the bundle (which is usual release procedure for OSX software) since this way we wont require root permission from the users. Let me know if installers are good to go and i will push them to CDN and artifacts.

OSX and  Linux binaries working with no issues, currently waiting Agama for the chain to sync again using Linux for some reason it had a bad rpc connection and had to erase the blocks loaded from the CLI , Windows version will be fully synced shortly.

[26-Aug-18 11:18 PM] DG#6934
Quick update Windows binaries , portable and installer version tested on server worked without issues, Send / Received  transactions / Imported WIF keys , Lite mode also working. Linux binaries and Agama native mode also passed the test with the installer and portable version. Mac OSX binaries also finished syncing and passed the same test. Agama 2.41c on Mac also confirmed to pass . I only encountered the issue on my actual  Windows PC while running the portable version of the wallet but after a restart it worked.


[27-Aug-18 12:06 AM] Mylo#8306
OSX package from github release. 
i d/l it.  then just drag Agama.app to "Applications" and it replaces existing.

What about a feature on Agama that reminds users to claim the reward monthly 😃  that's an idea from a user

I have observed an issue with Linux installer version of Agama after loading the full chain , going to confirm if it happens again ...basically it gets to the full porcentage but sometimes for some reason the bar goes back and gets stuck on loading blocks...it shouldn't happen because it's running on a server and the resources shouldn't be the issue

@grewalsatinder Did you build by `build-mac.sh` script?


[29-Aug-18 12:45 AM] TonyL#3577
I've faced similar issue when accidentally build from `build.sh` not `build-mac.sh` on Mac

Oh it's correct path for libs on Mac, nevermind

okay, I see build-mac file is 25 days old on master branch


[29-Aug-18 01:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
others are like 3 months old


[29-Aug-18 01:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@grewalsatinder On Mac I've compiled yesterday from jl777/dev

[29-Aug-18 01:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that branch on jl777/dev has 3 months old build-mac file 🤔

🤔 

[29-Aug-18 01:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
also, I thought like Zcash Komodo will also be fetching sapling parameter files


[29-Aug-18 01:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but fetch params is only have sprout


[29-Aug-18 01:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that means sapling changes are not in komodo yet?

glad to know... I'm compiling komodoplatform/master on my mac


[29-Aug-18 01:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it complained of missing C


[29-Aug-18 01:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[29-Aug-18 01:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[29-Aug-18 01:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
anyway, let's see how far compilation goes

{Reactions}
🙌 

[29-Aug-18 01:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'd like to know about sapling params.... if anyone knows


[29-Aug-18 01:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I compiled zcash on my mac and has sapling params, so in case the build script requires sapling params I guess on my system it won't complain.


[29-Aug-18 01:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but the fetch-params script from komodo repos doesn't have sapling params fetch commands


[29-Aug-18 01:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and in case sapling params are needed by lates update I guess users will probably face issues 🤔


[29-Aug-18 01:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in case sapling params are not required then yet, it should be ok


[29-Aug-18 01:31 AM] TonyL#3577
@grewalsatinder isn't it this step of build? : 
```

Got it now. They will activate it in two months as I see https://z.cash/upgrade/sapling.html


[29-Aug-18 01:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so that means still more sapling code yet to be merged to komodo


[29-Aug-18 01:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
coz zcash latest update 2.0.0 already fetches and requires these sapling files at build times


[29-Aug-18 01:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
komodo doesn't


[29-Aug-18 01:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
komodo still compiling... so far good 😁


[29-Aug-18 02:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
compilation finished.


[29-Aug-18 02:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
executed komodod -daemon


[29-Aug-18 02:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
let's see if this crashes


[29-Aug-18 02:07 AM] TonyL#3577
I've removed gcc-6 `brew uninstall gcc-6 --force`
Agama started to sync. Did it crash on some specific block for you @grewalsatinder ?


[29-Aug-18 02:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the own compiled one is doing sync


[29-Aug-18 02:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
not issues so far


[29-Aug-18 02:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
compiled without issues, and running without issues


[29-Aug-18 02:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it was a fresh clone from komodoplatform/komodo master


[29-Aug-18 02:26 AM] jl777c#5810
when did I say sapling was integrated into komodod?


[29-Aug-18 02:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i didnt


[29-Aug-18 02:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so it doesnt make much sense to load 1GB sapling files when sapling code isnt in komodod yet


[29-Aug-18 02:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I haven't been keeping eye on code updates chat. totally unaware. so asked.


[29-Aug-18 03:29 AM] TonyL#3577
One more user faced same issue with MacOS Agama 0.2.41d as @grewalsatinder and gcc6 installation solved it. 
Hmm, Is there any way to avoid it? I think it would be a big problem since not much users have this compiler package.


[29-Aug-18 03:32 AM] TonyL#3577
And we've posted this version already in #📢┃announcements - maybe add some notice here as well like a that Mac users have to execute in terminal: 
```
1) /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
2) brew install gcc@6
```


[29-Aug-18 03:41 AM] Mylo#8306
Yeah I was told gcc6 dont have good experience with brew in the past.  No native on Mac for me


[29-Aug-18 03:42 AM] TonyL#3577
It may be very scary for non technical users to execute something in terminal

[29-Aug-18 02:12 PM] DG#6934
Also , still facing the same issue with Agama2.41d the wallet doesn't finishes to sync on Linux for some reason it goes to unable to establish rpc connection fail...will try to do a resync from scratch and will let you know


[29-Aug-18 03:59 PM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 testing success. i wiped my macbook pro and got back factory settings. downloaded your latest tar containing latest binaries. installed homebrew, flock & wget. used ./zcutil/fetch-params.sh. created the komodo.conf file in Komodo data dir, started `komodod` in terminal and it started syncing blocks.


[29-Aug-18 04:02 PM] SHossain#0007
I did NOT install gcc6 or anything else manually


[29-Aug-18 04:20 PM] ca333#0333
perfect - this was the last komodod bundle that i shared with you today?


[29-Aug-18 04:21 PM] ca333#0333
can you now please test the same with this OSX version https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases

[29-Aug-18 04:32 PM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 this is what i see using the macOS version


[29-Aug-18 04:33 PM] SHossain#0007
Looks similar to Linux's libcurl3 & libcurl4 conflict


[29-Aug-18 04:33 PM] DG#6934
erasing the appdata Agama folder would help?


[29-Aug-18 04:34 PM] SHossain#0007
@DG this is the first time i'm running Agama on this mac


[29-Aug-18 04:34 PM] SHossain#0007
there was no previous run


[29-Aug-18 04:34 PM] DG#6934
it looks to be having the same issue as I had with the linux server


[29-Aug-18 04:35 PM] DG#6934
Unable to establish RPC connection is what I am getting


[29-Aug-18 04:35 PM] SHossain#0007
in linux the fix is you have to run `sudo apt-get install libcurl3`


[29-Aug-18 04:36 PM] DG#6934
perfect will apply this


[29-Aug-18 04:53 PM] ca333#0333
can you test the binary above please - the komodod


[29-Aug-18 04:53 PM] ca333#0333
without agama @SHossain


[29-Aug-18 04:53 PM] ca333#0333
afterwards i will replace komodod in Agama OSX and republish it.


[29-Aug-18 04:54 PM] SHossain#0007
sure. jsut a sec


[29-Aug-18 04:54 PM] ca333#0333
thanks


[29-Aug-18 04:54 PM] SHossain#0007
sorry. i misunderstood and tested Agama


[29-Aug-18 04:54 PM] SHossain#0007
🤦🏽


[29-Aug-18 04:59 PM] SHossain#0007
komodod for macOS is working fine


[29-Aug-18 04:59 PM] SHossain#0007
started syncing blocks


[29-Aug-18 04:59 PM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 no issues here


[29-Aug-18 05:25 PM] DG#6934
is working from my side also


[29-Aug-18 05:25 PM] DG#6934
it doesn't have the issue that I saw earlier


[30-Aug-18 03:44 AM] ca333#0333
@SHossain thanks - we will keep the current version than thats already on github. the user who did run into issues must have a outdated OSX version and should be adviced to update his osx. 
which OSX version are you using @SHossain and @DG ?


[30-Aug-18 03:45 AM] SHossain#0007
macOS High Sierra 10.13.6


[30-Aug-18 03:50 AM] ca333#0333
thanks


[30-Aug-18 04:06 AM] ca333#0333
@SHossain so the linux version is not working?


[30-Aug-18 04:10 AM] SHossain#0007
it is working


[30-Aug-18 04:11 AM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 some users for the first time has to use `sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 libgconf-2-4` before they can install the Linux version


[30-Aug-18 04:13 AM] ca333#0333
ok i see - is this for all users or just a few?>


[30-Aug-18 04:13 AM] ca333#0333
in this case we should be able to add this to the ubuntu installer. like check if libc6 and libgconf are installed - if not then install like above.


[30-Aug-18 04:16 AM] SHossain#0007
that would be nice


[30-Aug-18 04:17 AM] SHossain#0007
please add them in there. this will completely solve this issue for everyone.


[30-Aug-18 04:37 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
those who use vps linux servers have this issue. they dont have pre installed dependencies.


[30-Aug-18 04:41 AM] SHossain#0007
I have experienced the same as well on fresh desktop ubuntu installation


[30-Aug-18 07:16 AM] DG#6934
Mac OS 10.12 Sierra here


[30-Aug-18 08:06 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
@ca333  @SHossain  I have reproduced same Issue on MacOS, I have uninstalled gcc@6, Gcc@5 and tried with different test cases, 

Also, found another user have faced the same Issue with 41d, Suggested gcc6 document, It works for him 

User:OSX 10.13.6 

Tried with 41d It fails with --- ___emutls_get_address

With gcc@5 installed  It fails with --- ___emutls_get_address

with gcc@6 installed It works


[30-Aug-18 08:08 AM] SHossain#0007
@Nabob | $ARRR the latest komodod binary from here doesn't require user to install gcc6 manually https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases

Yes


[30-Aug-18 08:27 AM] SHossain#0007
uninstalling may not help. ca333 advised to use fresh OSX. i wiped my macbook pro and tested it


[30-Aug-18 08:27 AM] SHossain#0007
until you wipe your current macbook there is no reliable data


[30-Aug-18 08:58 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
I dont have new MacOS machine for now for testing given use case,  But users who have issue already, what can we suggest them


[30-Aug-18 09:07 AM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 ^^
would an update of Agama for OSX be a good idea with the latest komodod binary?


[30-Aug-18 09:46 AM] ca333#0333
@Nabob | $ARRR did you test it with the old komodod?


[30-Aug-18 09:48 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
@ca333  Can you point me which build you are referring to 41d or Komodo_master_bin ?

https://bintray.com/komodo/Agama/download_file?file_path=Agama_OSX_0.2.41d.tar.gz
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/download/master-multios-201808271317-b7dd118/komodo_osx_master.tar.gz

Tested on both builds


[30-Aug-18 09:54 AM] ca333#0333
this is the new build of komodod with an additional lib linked against the daemon exec


[30-Aug-18 09:54 AM] ca333#0333
@SHossain you tested on a fresh wiped MAC - right?


[30-Aug-18 09:54 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[30-Aug-18 09:54 AM] ca333#0333
like deleted all data and reinstalled the OS


[30-Aug-18 09:55 AM] ca333#0333
ok - that is a clean test


[30-Aug-18 09:55 AM] ca333#0333
from a userperspective


[30-Aug-18 09:55 AM] SHossain#0007
i wiped my whole drive and then re-installed OS from recovery


[30-Aug-18 09:55 AM] ca333#0333
Nabob might have deleted/overwritten native libs by using brew and gcc install/deinstall ,etc.


[30-Aug-18 09:56 AM] ca333#0333
ok thanks - when you reinstalled OS - did you do it by recovery tools or by recovery backup via timemachine?


[30-Aug-18 09:56 AM] SHossain#0007
i did it from recovery. didnt' use any external tools

[30-Aug-18 11:24 AM] ca333#0333
@Nabob | $ARRR i think its because you have changed your std setup. by installing own versions of gcc/++ via homebrew. @SHossain has done it on a fresh machine 10.13.x and now on a fresh 10.12.x - can you please test it on a "clean" OSX - that is the only test through a user-perspective.


[30-Aug-18 11:28 AM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 just to clear the confusion:
1. Using fresh 10.13.6 - Agama does not work. But, the komodo binary bundle you shared, works
2. Using 10.12.2 - Agama works


[30-Aug-18 11:29 AM] SHossain#0007
i have not updated the 10.12.x machine since march 2018

[30-Aug-18 11:30 AM] SHossain#0007
this is what i get using the 10.13.6 High Sierra fresh machine


[30-Aug-18 11:32 AM] SHossain#0007
if you update Agama with the latest komodod binary you shared, i can test


[30-Aug-18 11:36 AM] SHossain#0007
Could this be a curl issue I wonder?


[30-Aug-18 11:37 AM] SHossain#0007
In Linux I get similar type issue when I have `libcurl4` installed. Fixed by installing `libcurl3`


[30-Aug-18 11:48 AM] ca333#0333
ok - so using the new komodod in the Agama should make it work on both OSX you tested on.


[30-Aug-18 11:49 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, i am guess that it should work


[30-Aug-18 11:49 AM] SHossain#0007
with the new binaries


[30-Aug-18 11:49 AM] ca333#0333
lets test this constelation. i know for sure that using gcc5 instead resolves all those issues. However using the new version is better - i am currently moving the setup to gitlab. The current release bundles are still being built on travis. So thats a potential "issue" as well.


[30-Aug-18 11:49 AM] ca333#0333
i ll bundle a fresh one quickly


[30-Aug-18 11:50 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. thanks


[30-Aug-18 12:06 PM] DG#6934
let me know if you need to test more, currently I haven't experienced no difficulties with Mac OSX Sierra 10.12

[31-Aug-18 01:12 AM] TonyL#3577
@ca333 Should it be tested with some special conditions?


[31-Aug-18 01:12 AM] ca333#0333
nope just run it on your mac/hackintosh if you have one


[31-Aug-18 01:13 AM] ca333#0333
preferably "clean" mac without any developer dependencies.


[31-Aug-18 01:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Will test it now. What is the best solution to "clean" mac?


[31-Aug-18 01:16 AM] TonyL#3577
`brew list -1 | xargs brew rm` will try this way


[31-Aug-18 01:16 AM] ca333#0333
for a clean cleaning you d need to restore it to factory status (wipe HD and reinstall OSX via recovery modus)


[31-Aug-18 01:17 AM] ca333#0333
cuz after using brews gcc and dev deps you most likely had relinked to those versions - only reinstalled isnt enough in most cases


[31-Aug-18 01:17 AM] ca333#0333
so unless you dont have important data its probably not an option


[31-Aug-18 01:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Since my Air is only working machine I have at the moment cannot afford full wipe 😃


[31-Aug-18 01:17 AM] ca333#0333
no worries - that is understandable


[31-Aug-18 01:41 AM] TonyL#3577
@ca333 chain started to sync in native mode (run after `brew list -1 | xargs brew rm`)
All basic calls worked in SPV mode

[31-Aug-18 02:01 AM] ca333#0333
thanks for the test - i will update the download URLs andf bintray bins.
ref. the modal error - that actually means that your seed/passphrase is weak. lets see what @pbca26 thinks and if adding a checkbox to the modal (allow onetime weak passphrase to transfer funds, etc.) is a good idea.

@SHossain - i updated https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama/releases/tag/multios-0.2.41d
and https://bintray.com/ca333/komodoplatform/Agama/0.2.41d/view/files#files/ - URLs are still the same so we can leave them on website. @everyone can you please run a quick test on them (i rebundled differently reducing all package/bundle sizes by ~30 - 50%) - just SPV startup and native startup (if komodod launches up properly).

i used 10.11.X for the build and backwards compatibility. on 10.11.x and 10.12.x its working fine. issue is releated to the libgomp - for some reason it does ref. to libSystem.B for the listed Symbol def but cant find it there because the osx 10.13. is lacking it.

thanks @siu - the issue we had seems to be a more exotic one just with a specific version of osx - (10.13.x)
i sent shossain two new builds to test against (10.13.x targeted build and a gcc-5 based build = legacy gcc) to clear this issue


[31-Aug-18 06:28 AM] siu#3920
ok... linux working as intended. At least ubuntu 16.04

@ca333 @TonyL reproduced the bug, will fix it


[31-Aug-18 07:14 AM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 the last 2 version of komodo binary is working fine on my macOS 10.13.6. Could you please build 2 different version of Agama using those binaries?

@DG there seems to be a specific bug on 10.13.x as ca333 mentioned. on other version of macOS, Agama is working fine.

Would be nice if we have some sort of desclaimer in github release pages about these BitCoinMiner detections.


[01-Sep-18 02:47 AM] SHossain#0007
As you mentioned before that these are not harmful and only the mining code.


[01-Sep-18 03:02 AM] ca333#0333
yes win and linux got cleaned up - OSX will remain like this since the daemon libs (crypto libs) are also included in some mining-malware. Its a wrong flag (singalised by the "not-a-virus" and "potentially unwanted").


[01-Sep-18 03:13 AM] SHossain#0007
Linux portable version is being flagged. but not the installer version


[01-Sep-18 03:13 AM] ca333#0333
for OSX i am also bundling a new Agama based on the last komodod that i sent you (the gc5 version)


[01-Sep-18 03:14 AM] ca333#0333
is this the current version? (Agama linux flag)


[01-Sep-18 03:14 AM] ca333#0333
in that case i will rebundle it as well since this shouldnt happen


[01-Sep-18 03:14 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

[01-Sep-18 03:16 AM] SHossain#0007
funny that Avast and AVG found macOS miner in Linux portable and Kaspersky and ZoneAlarm found Android miner in the same version


[01-Sep-18 03:18 AM] jl777c#5810
since komodod can mine, maybe it isnt so strange to fine mining code in the executables?


[01-Sep-18 03:19 AM] SHossain#0007
you are right.


[01-Sep-18 03:20 AM] SHossain#0007
and, if we have a standard desclaimer in the github release page regarding this, we can simply point users in that direction when they ask


[01-Sep-18 03:42 AM] ca333#0333
yes like james said - those AV engines do scan for specific low level schemes and libs/funcs() to flag the suspicous software. thats also why majority of the AV engines dont flag them at all. Its just for the case that there is a new mining malware out which is unknown - it could still be tracked with the crypto-libraries/mining related code. 

We can but shouldnt add a notice ref. the wrong flag - there is always the small chance that it could be a real flag after all. If we take the fear away people wont take such flags serious anymore. I think the best is we just let them ask us in case they wonder why some of the AV engines do flag Agama/komodod - and majority of the other crypto related software out there (bitcoin, etc.).


[01-Sep-18 03:54 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[01-Sep-18 03:57 AM] SHossain#0007
The latest gcc6 version macOS komodod binary bundle you sent me, working in both 10.13.6 & 10.12.2. i'll monitor and report in 30 mins time before i go offline for couple of hours.

[01-Sep-18 04:06 AM] ca333#0333
thanks for the quick test - yes the initial issues were like aforementioned library inconsistences. So OSXs own native libs are unfortunately not compatible with each other - switching to the approp. SDK libs solved the issue so we can stick to the gcc6 built version for osx.


[01-Sep-18 04:07 AM] ca333#0333
ps. its the 10.11.x SDK - so we cover majority of the used OSX version


[01-Sep-18 04:08 AM] SHossain#0007
no issues so far on both machines


[01-Sep-18 04:09 AM] SHossain#0007
we need to test the next version of Agama using this binary


[01-Sep-18 08:53 AM] SHossain#0007
@Nabob | $ARRR @DG and @everyone who has a macOS computer please test the latest Agama version 0.2.41d https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama/releases/download/multios-0.2.41d/Agama_OSX_0.2.41d.tar.gz

[05-Sep-18 03:05 AM] TonyL#3577
My current idea regards content is to write something like a CC contracts for dummies on top of current testing plan and JL documentation which oriented on developers mostly - handbook with information how to work with ready CCs  in CLI - what's the workflow logic, which calls for what, what are expected input and output, some real-world application ideas and etc. To help everybody see it in action and understand why it's cool 😃

i grouped them into 3 categories

linux portable https://drive.google.com/open?id=13Mx0csrZznVRLy0WSArCokNNIob_xXdb
i might add more changes while you're testing it
this release contains quite a lot of refactoring changes
which means that completely unexpected issues may arise


[07-Sep-18 02:25 AM] DG#6934
I don't see too  convenient for users to be asking  to compile Agama from source


[07-Sep-18 02:25 AM] DG#6934
if they do that they could be making Agama versions


[07-Sep-18 02:26 AM] DG#6934
by their own and confusing users


[07-Sep-18 02:40 AM] pbca26#5430
that was a question from CALL asset chain team member


[07-Sep-18 05:18 AM] DG#6934
@pbca26 Do we have like a document to compile Agama and the system specs that are needed.


[07-Sep-18 05:21 AM] pbca26#5430
no but it's good to have one
readme.md has most of the required instructions
i also added a few handy scripts to clone and build on linux


[07-Sep-18 07:50 AM] siu#3920
@ca333 @SHossain Please take a look at dev branch of agama. @pbca26 added the new COQUI parameter to that branch. It will fork in about 10 days. Please, push a release whenever you can. Thanks!


[07-Sep-18 08:03 AM] pbca26#5430
i can create a feature branch for coqui
dev branch changes are yet to be validated by qa


[07-Sep-18 08:26 AM] siu#3920
ok, thanks!

bumped into this flag in zcutil/build.sh
perhaps we can leverage it to avoid antivirus sw false positive detection?
most of the users don't need mining code anyway

Question - say I have a KMD wallet but I add a coin to it in mobile. Is it expected that that coin also be added to the desktop and web versions too? When I add manually in both the balance looks ok but was just wondering


[11-Sep-18 12:44 PM] DG#6934
Like if the app will add the coins automatically?


[11-Sep-18 12:45 PM] Jonathan#3687
Yep, I didn't think it would but the thought crossed my mind 😃


[11-Sep-18 12:55 PM] pbca26#5430
no, those are different apps you're talking about
do you know any specific examples of such ux @Jonathan ?


[11-Sep-18 01:00 PM] pbca26#5430
in theory it's possible to store an encrypted profile on kv
then fetch it from kv on login


[11-Sep-18 01:15 PM] Jonathan#3687
Nope @pbca26 - I was just curious

@pbca26 testing the portable Agama v42 in Linux. Native mode working fine. When I added a new coin `COQUI`, the screen went white (blank). using reload from menu brought it back.


[13-Sep-18 05:25 AM] SHossain#0007
on the top-left corner of hamburger or setting menu now shows a green dot and clicking on that, displays the `New version` option which takes to the KP website download page.

Maybe already reported but I had to use advanced features in order to launch KMD

i didnt' have to do that in Linux

I am using a Ubuntu 18.04 VPS but yeah I had to add experimental features and then KMD was available

Just now verified, KMD only can be launched from `shortcut menu` (without advanced features)
then, after i enabled advanced features, following with save settings, KMD Is not available
Then, i refreshed with `reload` button on top menu, after then only i can see all external coins 😃

@siu I reported the GLX server issue on the HDEX side a few days ago, lukechilds said it was something on their end


[13-Sep-18 09:45 AM] Jonathan#3687
told GLX about it as well


[13-Sep-18 09:58 AM] pbca26#5430
i guess i take glx spv out until situation is resolved


[13-Sep-18 10:02 AM] SHossain#0007
@pbca26 i was just wondering if there would be any way to check for the SPV server connectivity when a user select SPV mode for any coin. if there is no connection to any of the listed servers for a specific coin, Agama could display a (popup) message  that Lite mode is not available for the selected coin (temporarily), use Native mode instead.


[13-Sep-18 10:03 AM] pbca26#5430
doesn't it spit an error when you're trying to access glx?


[13-Sep-18 10:03 AM] SHossain#0007
it does, after you activate the coin


[13-Sep-18 10:03 AM] pbca26#5430
just checking if this edge case is covered
i'll extend the message as you suggested


[13-Sep-18 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
thank you very much 😃

we introduced encrypt seed, benefit of users who can  encrypt seed/private key instead ended up with typo errors/seed handling issues, Only few ppl are aware of this,
and we still see on our helpdesk every week users who are angry on us, because of their mistakes or unaware of crypto field,

I have one suggestion,  Why can't we generate Seed QR code for every user who are on Lite mode when he clicks on `generate wallet`,
If suppose, User forgets the seed and he turns up saying agama Issue, we can guide them `QR code` which was generated on their Local machine.

@SHossain  @pbca26


[13-Sep-18 10:21 AM] DG#6934
Issue still persists , after erasing all files and also rebooting the server the  Kmd only appears when enable advanced features option is selected, tried to select reset to default options and still issue persisted. Also @Nabob | $ARRR  same issue that you reported I have reproduced it.

[13-Sep-18 10:23 AM] DG#6934
That would be a great idea to make that part of the QR code but you are saying it as if the installation made the QR code being stored in the appdata files?


[13-Sep-18 10:25 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
yeah smthing like that,  am not sure where path should be, but, this is outline


[13-Sep-18 10:26 AM] pbca26#5430
storing any sensitive info out in the open, w/o any for of encryption is a ticking bomb
maybe we can reuse jl's image sorcery to store a passphrase/wif

strange thing is switching between only KMD and PIRATE doesn't reproduce this issue

@Nabob | $ARRR i've seen that multiple times
time to work on optimizing a few bits that i know might be a reason


[14-Sep-18 08:09 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
ok noted,
On Lite mode, when claiming rewards it shows as  `verifing transaction`  and struck there,  send function works ok.

it should help users to understand what section are they on

@ca333 More users reporting regards rewards claiming issues on 0.2.41d in Windows (same problem on verification stage as @Nabob | $ARRR reported on Friday in this channel)
Am I understand correct that this issue was catched and fixed in `0.2.42a`?
UPD: Oh Nabob screenshot is on 0.2.42 so problem should be still actual


[19-Sep-18 03:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Wasn't able to reproduce it on my side with `0.2.41d` so confused a little


[19-Sep-18 05:40 AM] ca333#0333
@TonyL whats the "issue" and error-report, debug-results, etc.?


[19-Sep-18 05:41 AM] ca333#0333
has anyone from the QA team been able to reproduce?


[19-Sep-18 05:56 AM] TonyL#3577
@ca333 Issue is that in Windows (Agama 0.2.41d)  rewards claiming not works for some users. (nothing happens when pressing claim button).
There are messages  of @Nabob | $ARRR above in this channel (attacked screenshot) with same problem as users reporting. So seems it's reproducible.
I'm trying to reproduce on my side but no luck yet.

2.41d Just now tested on Mac Machine , It works perfectly


[19-Sep-18 06:10 AM] TonyL#3577
@Nabob | $ARRR Issue reported for Windows platform, not Mac. Ok, since it's not reproduced yet will try to collect more information to reproduce.


[19-Sep-18 06:12 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
Ok, Preparing my windows test Machine, will let  you know


[19-Sep-18 06:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Thanks @Nabob | $ARRR ! I have Windows Server machine in cloud (no option to install win7/10 on it) so it would be great to check from different environment


[19-Sep-18 07:37 AM] Jonathan#3687
Were they on Windows 7? @TonyL - I claimed rewards day before yesterday on Windows 10


[19-Sep-18 08:09 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
On 2.42a,  I see blank page when accessing agama wallet, find error message for reference.  Ignore if this issue is already addressed

spv interest claim is also fixed, pushed the fix to dev branch

just fyi any issues related to spv are non os specific
if you can reliably reproduce it on one os that's enough to make a case
unlike native where issues in fact can be related to specific komodod builds

Tested on build 6, 
- SPV Interest claim works
- Haven't encountered blank page issue - Observed 2.42, In settings, tab `export keys` naming convention changed to `sweep keys`, not fixed in this build (minor)
- Create new wallet feature fails, Throws error every time when create wallet, If suppose,  we gave right naming convention `pin name` it fails (major)
    ---- When pin fails, It throws two pop’s  `Seed Is encrypted, Please try with password now` and `error writing pin file` 
    ——  In this  case, First message shouldn’t show up    
    —— when after app restart, with correct pin name it still fails

sweep and export are two different features


[19-Sep-18 10:26 AM] pbca26#5430
sweep allows you to spend all funds (sweep) for a priv key/passphrase into current spv pub address
have a look at something like coinomi to get a better understanding

@Jonathan Requested this information from users. At least one of the reports was about Windows 7.  I'm tested on Win10 as well and WinServer 2016 also but didn't reproduce. 
I get two screenshots from two different users: for both `createrawtx` hanged with `pending` status.
But they can get UTXOs list so connection with Electrum server should be ok.

don't spend time on it
unless there is a new bug found by someone

Yeah, just thought it's new issue because didn't find report about similar in this channel


[20-Sep-18 04:57 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, i guess it is better if we test 42 and get a release done on this


[20-Sep-18 05:03 AM] SHossain#0007
i could reproduce this on Windows like all the users


[20-Sep-18 05:04 AM] SHossain#0007
downloaded the protable 41d version from the website, unzipped it. started KMD lite mode.
logged in using my seed. balance showed up fine. no electrum server error notification.
when i wanted to change the server, i got issue with both.


[20-Sep-18 05:04 AM] pbca26#5430
>Yeah, just thought it's new issue because didn't find report about similar in this channel
we need to do a better job to make it easier to understand what's new and what's not
all issues/bugs must be logged on git or jira

The test pin is probably when you were testing Encrypt Seed option


[21-Sep-18 02:11 AM] SHossain#0007
Encrypt seed feature allows you to create custom named pin if you use it while creating a new address. it assigns BTC address as pin name if you use it from settings


[21-Sep-18 02:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes I understand what pin feature is but this location does not exists. Should it help me to find pin?

[21-Sep-18 02:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Is there 42 build for Windows already? (UPD oh, found it on github)
I just wonder that issue with feature claiming which is not reproducible yet appears on users side when they updated from some old version and some cache/files left.  @pbca26 Is deleting of ` %appdata%\Roaming\Agama` (beside of deletion from Program Files) enough to clean all from previous installation or there is some caching in browser also?

Just to make a quick note in the Linux version of Agama after you launch the installer with sudo , it will not launch the GUI set up like before but it will launch the set up  in the terminal. Maybe is a little strange that a Linux user doesn’t know how to at least install a program through the terminal but I can happen.

Just a quick Q, electrum servers for ETH are available in Hyperdex but in Barterdex?


[24-Sep-18 03:06 PM] SHossain#0007
ETH needs to be added as native mode in any case


[24-Sep-18 03:06 PM] SHossain#0007
try native mode in BarterDEX GUI


[24-Sep-18 03:06 PM] SHossain#0007
for ETH and ERC20 tokens


[24-Sep-18 03:07 PM] DG#6934
yeah I was seeing this...I thought that they shared the same servers


[24-Sep-18 03:07 PM] DG#6934
ok noted


[24-Sep-18 03:09 PM] DG#6934
I am seeing Hyperdex being functioning without adding native , will get some  eth from binance to test


[24-Sep-18 03:14 PM] SHossain#0007
HyperDEX does make it easy for end users


[24-Sep-18 03:16 PM] SHossain#0007
only difference is in the coin adding method in marketmaker. mm accepts ETH/ERC20 tokens in native mode as you would do for other native wallets. but, without having to run full ETH wallet.

@pbca26  I know you told us that saving a QR inside the users PC could be inconvenient . to help mitigate the seed issue...but can this be added as optional? Like it can request the user to save it once it creates the seed and having a backup...just as an optional feature.


[24-Sep-18 10:08 PM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
seed handling issue, we are facing already with users who unaware of how to use seeds and safeguard them. If we show them "N" of options they still end up blaming others


[24-Sep-18 10:41 PM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
Few suggestions/ideas :

1)  Enabling mandatory Encrypt seed feature for new wallet creation
2)  Create of hash of public address or store public address In PC itself when user clicking on new wallet,  two reasons
a) User can know which address generated on single machine
b) If people claiming agama generated faulty seed,  and lost fund claims we can make sure seed never generated on this machine of that address
3) storing QR code save option prompt  while creating new seed, Now we need to explicitly click and save
4) Storing QR code automatically  in PC, as said we have to consider security as well, (in this scenario I believe  option 3 is valid In this context)

Any thoughts ?

```Transaction which happened in July, Seems you have generated your seed and QR code correctly - as both generated same KMD address. we ask our users to be careful when handling seed, Like using secure ways

encrypt seed feature
saving private key
Before sending funds we ask to check seed generating same address for couple of times

@everyone We have new Agama test version featuring the first private chain, PIRATE. If you would like to test sending and receiving feature, please post your z address and I'll send you a little PIRATE for testing.
Get experience with a blockchain that does only z transaction (unless you are sending to Notary Node addresses). Available for all OS and in portable, easy to run zips.

am i wrong?


[25-Sep-18 12:14 PM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
It is still out of sync (SPV)


[25-Sep-18 12:23 PM] DG#6934
I tested a transaction from Agama to the mobile wallet just now on SPV and worked


[25-Sep-18 12:24 PM] benohanlon#7045
@SHossain will it implement sapling one day?


[25-Sep-18 12:25 PM] SHossain#0007
Not anytime soon.


[25-Sep-18 12:25 PM] SHossain#0007
KMD doesn't have sapling yet. VRSC will have it. Probably, after that some time. But, not in current plan.


[25-Sep-18 12:27 PM] DG#6934
@Nabob | $ARRR  you don't get EQL transactions ongoing?


[25-Sep-18 12:28 PM] SHossain#0007
We have everything in working condition, including dPoW for PIRATE. Z tx will be bit faster with sapling. But, currently it works fine (bit slow, but ok).

>While selecting Coin can we make  KMD as first coin in native or lite ( Now its in alphabetic order)
only in alphabetical now, kmd is selected by default anyway
ignore dice tab it needs to be hidden
qr code is generated from a string
it's highly unlikely to be broken
however it's VERY easy to make typos when entering a seed
this is where all troubled users are coming from
forcing pin login is definitely a good idea

42b is still blank screen on open, I see it in 42a


[26-Sep-18 10:59 AM] pbca26#5430
okay
you can also just alter version file in v42c /resources/app to something like version=0.2.42a and restart the app to verify
new update is a very simple feature that compares two versions local and on git
if they differ it will show the icon

@DG @Nabob | $ARRR @TonyL @Angelina and everyone else, we are seeing more users joining Discord for PIRATE. I'm sure you guys already know about PIRATE and it being world's first private chain which allows only z tx. We will be needing to support those users in #pirate and other channels. Most of the reqular questions will be how they can use the chain and how to generate a z address. Please make yourself familiar with all about PIRATE and you already know how to support Agama users. Let me know if you need any help.
Currently, there is a promotion going on where users send 15 KMD to `RYMCJfpUTyYuWHttvLD7VPv12wrFsAZQDt`, send the txid and z address to us and we give them 777 PIRTATE coins. I have already served total 44 userrs since yesterday.

@Nabob | $ARRR since it's a remote api there could be a plethora of things that can have a direct impact on spv performance/stability
if the issue persists for over 24h then it's a reason to raise questions

@pbca26 how "Save selection" option in Agama's activate coin should work?
I'm doing following:
1) Login with seed
2) Choose few coins 
3) Press save selection
4) Activate coins
5) Closing Agama
6) When open Agama again don't see an option for start with my 
saved selection
Expected: Have saved selection as option for start

Tested on Agama 0.2.42c MacOS

@TonyL you can also toggle "load coins list from file" option in settings
it will load spv coins automatically from your saved selection

http://195.201.101.229:9090/public/Agama-linux-x64-v0.2.42-beta-build10.zip
changes:
- address book allow z addresses
- interest claim warning icon -> indicates if utxos are not accruing interest for whatever reasons
- interest claim modal additional utxo details
- ac_private disable pub address support
- settings native z_receivedbyaddress option

interest claim warning icon is spv only for now
native requires a bit more work


[28-Sep-18 12:27 PM] pbca26#5430
for some reason i'm unable to see incoming z tx to my z pirate address
./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE listtransactions
only able to see them via z_receivedbyaddress
can anyone see if you can reproduce this behavior?


[28-Sep-18 12:30 PM] pbca26#5430
new interest claim features are a bit tricky to test
you'd need to have both types of utxos
- utxos that have locktime set over a month ago
- utxos that have locktime set less than a month ago
a possible workaround is to change your local time into the future

listtransactions doesn't have address param, unfortunately


[29-Sep-18 10:13 AM] pbca26#5430
i'm surprised that after so much time no one noticed missing z -> z transactions in agama's native history

ZCash GUI Wallet needs a way to list all transactions · Issue #14...
I am working on a ZCash GUI Wallet as a hobby-type project. It is here: https://github.com/vaklinov/zcash-swing-wallet-ui I have the problem that there seems to be no way to list ALL transactions, ...
https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/tHxlcfW1EuDTxmm2enfTZcIaZ9M0cthT5wdvqJUBCzQ/%3Fs%3D400%26v%3D4/https/avatars1.githubusercontent.com/u/22178263


[29-Sep-18 10:25 AM] DG#6934
That explains it


[29-Sep-18 10:25 AM] pbca26#5430
i added z_receivedbyaddress settings option to workaround z -> z transactions data
well it works only partially, doesn't show outgoing txs
z_receivedbyaddress is also return quite small amount of info, no timestamp, blockheight or address
that's the reason why you see N/A in those columns for pirate
to get these details an additional gettransaction call for each z -> z transaction is required
this can have a negative impact on overall performance
so the only way to see full detains is through magnify glass icon


[29-Sep-18 10:26 AM] DG#6934
so now the details are going to be in the GUi basically


[29-Sep-18 10:27 AM] pbca26#5430
partially, yes
plus extra actions are required to see full details


[29-Sep-18 10:28 AM] pbca26#5430
if you're not actively using z txs nothing changes
if you do then enabling z_receivedbyaddress option is a way to see z -> z txs in tx history


[29-Sep-18 10:29 AM] pbca26#5430
ac_private chains have z_receivedbyaddress enabled by default in gui


[29-Sep-18 10:29 AM] DG#6934
ok can I be missing some other test ?


[29-Sep-18 10:29 AM] DG#6934
Gonna try this new version let me check it out


[29-Sep-18 10:31 AM] pbca26#5430
i don't think so, these are all latest changes for now
the only thing i forgot to mention is tools merge/split supports spv mode now
but that was there since 42a


[29-Sep-18 10:33 AM] DG#6934
Nice

@DG do you still have t funds issue on pirate send coin?

Testing


[30-Sep-18 09:26 AM] DG#6934
Still can see the text saying ...send to T address or Z address ...the only issue is that I see with it is maybe users that don't know how pirate works might think they can send the ztransaction to a t address of maybe let's say komodo

[30-Sep-18 09:30 AM] pbca26#5430
i'm unable to reproduce it on my end
i see only z addresses


[30-Sep-18 09:34 AM] DG#6934
Send to  then it says "Enter Transparent or Private address"


[30-Sep-18 09:35 AM] DG#6934
ok well at the end they should know by the moment what a z address is and that pirate main focus is being on z address is the only permitted way


[30-Sep-18 09:36 AM] DG#6934
Also , I know you are busy and all but just wondering ...do you think there can be a way of tracking how many native users or lite users are currently using Agama?


[30-Sep-18 09:40 AM] pbca26#5430
not really, i'm not spying on anybody
oh man i just realized you were talking about placeholder this whole time🤦


[30-Sep-18 09:47 AM] pbca26#5430
just to confirm you're not seeing any t address references in "send from" dropdown in pirate? @DG


[30-Sep-18 09:48 AM] DG#6934
exactly not in the send from but in the "Send to"

changes:
- "Send to" placeholder change for ac_private 
- send coin z address validation
- change active coin after spv logout
- reset dashboard state after spv logout
the latter two are very specific fixes and only noticeable if you run native and spv coins concurrently

@SHossain Hi, it's hard to do something from dev side to fix false positive detection by AV software. I think the only way to stop it is direct report to AV developers:
Avast - https://www.avast.com/en-us/false-positive-file-form.php
AVG - https://www.avg.com/en-us/false-positive-file-form
ESET - https://support.eset.com/kb141/?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US

@ca333 we don't have latest `komodod.exe` binary release from master branch in KP/komodo repo. Only Linux and macOS available. Please have a look. The binary Agama is using,  works. I'll bundle a zip from Agama 42c win portable and put it in there for now.

@pbca26  user request

`can wallet notice the user is using z-addres for the first time and do some tooltips like bitfinex when you visit it (showing some tips step by step like where to export private keys and to generate new z addr)
might be good for first timers
bitfinex overdid it (showing each tiem you visit it) so good to detect it (at least per istallation ) and have permanent cancell button to quickly close it forever`

There are lot of changes (updates & upgrades) which changes the GUI guides. If we make a guide today, we need to update the screenshots and guides in line with the updates.

I try adding it after adding KMD and it just goes but the SPV server is not activated

i have started KMD in native mode. then, added VRSC in Lite mode. the coin activated and balance showed up fine.

@DG you may need to update your local coin database, VRSC electrums were added some time after the coin itself was added, so i suspect your local database is missing this info

yes, i use VNC server for all testing, no other option 
@DG  Can you check on your side how it looks


[04-Oct-18 11:49 AM] DG#6934
I am doing the same , what's exactly the issue? I am using the addressbook


[04-Oct-18 11:49 AM] DG#6934
let me confirm


[04-Oct-18 11:52 AM] DG#6934
Ok I had the same confusion but you need to change which is the address you are sending from , gonna try to reproduce to see if that gets selected automatically the same as the address book


[04-Oct-18 11:56 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
```Go to Send option
copy zaddress on sendto and
check to see you can view whole address
above screenshot you can see it is merging with `addressbook`  button```


[04-Oct-18 11:59 AM] pbca26#5430
you can scroll through it like in any text field
as i said z address is way too long to fit in such fields


[04-Oct-18 11:59 AM] pbca26#5430
95 chars to be precise


[04-Oct-18 12:00 PM] DG#6934
yeah same here...I will test it in a HD monitor just in case

In this doc: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/barterDEX/get-listed-barterDEX.html , do anyone know what the `coins-db-repo` is supposed to mean? It could be some other doc I was referencing or a github repository. I can't remember what it was now.

it happens only for lite mode, as far i know
white screen issue never came across

@DG if you see a blank screen check dev console
usually there must be an error that you can copy-paste here

@SHossain by default i subtract 0.0001 from z balance as a fee
perhaps in your case the fee must be higher?


[05-Oct-18 04:17 AM] SHossain#0007
that 3884 balance send still processing. can find out about the fee once it is completed

If mined coins or merged notes more than usual, It will fail with that message
more than 50 notes will be considered as oversized

if failed
show opstatus

try now

[05-Oct-18 05:29 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
Ok @pbca26  
Generally, how much time it takes to complete a Z transaction, timeout value  can we know ?
one opid still In processing state,  I ll test after that transaction, IF we stop opid process in between what happens ?


[05-Oct-18 05:38 AM] pbca26#5430
there are no tools available to approx z tx fee/time it's going to take
anywhere between 20s-90s, depends on hw resources


[05-Oct-18 06:15 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
I got this message, OP status failed with this message,  
`"message": "18: bad-txns-joinsplit-requirements-not-met"`
and checked op status never changed  it still says `processing`

[05-Oct-18 05:11 PM] DG#6934
This is the error that  pops up with the white screen .. this was on the github release but is more or less the same error that have already been reported.


[05-Oct-18 05:57 PM] DG#6934
Beer explorer down 
http://beer.komodochainz.info    And electrum 2 didn't worked to send transactions in at least 4 ocassions... electrum 1 working fine 



Desktopversion of Agama build23
Komodo and Pirate synching without any issues at the same time.
V2core machine collapsed while doing this maybe resources couldn’t handle it.
V4core machine had no issues and it’s working fine synching both chains.

The strange thing is that my Desktop PC is a similar core than the server but well it could have something to do of it being virtual and maybe ram collapsed.

what happens when you see socket timeout error @DG ?


[06-Oct-18 01:49 AM] pbca26#5430
does gui say connection error or not?

[06-Oct-18 06:50 AM] DG#6934
The transaction just didn’t went through  , @pbca26  will try again and see what I can take from it


[06-Oct-18 06:56 AM] DG#6934
This is what I got with electrum 1 but at the end transaction worked.

[06-Oct-18 11:33 AM] pbca26#5430
if there are network issues it's expected to see errors
from gui stand point i don't see anything weird
by the looks of your screens users are properly notified about issues
giving more verbose output is unlikely to help them


[06-Oct-18 11:36 AM] pbca26#5430
i'm trying to battle "missing remote object" error, so far unsuccessfully
as i understand the core issue lies within electron itself but it won't be fixed until v3.0 is out
i've added another possible fix


[07-Oct-18 01:59 AM] pbca26#5430
@SHossain what do i need to do on claim rewards ui? change text?
i can vaguely understand what the guy wants
the only thing i could catch that it's not as fancy as exodus wallet😄


[07-Oct-18 02:00 AM] SHossain#0007
He mentioned he has feedback about critical issues which turns out to be cosmetic changes


[07-Oct-18 02:00 AM] pbca26#5430
lol


[07-Oct-18 02:01 AM] SHossain#0007
He didn't understand the requirement of Accruing reward, he is still thinking that is the requirement of claiminig reward.
we can probably change the wording in there


[07-Oct-18 02:03 AM] pbca26#5430
spend is a more accurate term, technical
can we ask daniel or sidd to make a pretty text?


[07-Oct-18 02:05 AM] SHossain#0007
i guess it would be better, if they can have a look and prepare the specific wordings for this


[07-Oct-18 02:06 AM] SHossain#0007
```
its nerve wracking and ridiculous that i specify an amount and it sends all. It decreases trust. What if i want to send my pal 11 KMD?  Will it send all?  Not sure until i try...
```


[07-Oct-18 02:07 AM] pbca26#5430
well we can't fix that
as jl explained that's how btc is working


[07-Oct-18 02:07 AM] SHossain#0007
Agama never send all funds to other addresses when i use it everyday. this statement is based on false assumptions


[07-Oct-18 02:08 AM] pbca26#5430
people treat btc as conventional payment systems which it is not


[07-Oct-18 02:08 AM] SHossain#0007
if it would ever happen, i'd have already lost everything


[07-Oct-18 02:09 AM] pbca26#5430
it may do that temporarily if you send 10 kmd and have only 1 utxo size of 1000 kmd
1000 kmd is split into 2 outputs in this case 10 and remainder 9990 that goes back to the wallet


[07-Oct-18 02:11 AM] SHossain#0007
they can easily find out by checking explorer. given if the user know how to check with explorer.


[07-Oct-18 02:11 AM] pbca26#5430
i doubt they can figure this out


[07-Oct-18 02:11 AM] pbca26#5430
when they see 0 balance they go nuts


[07-Oct-18 02:11 AM] SHossain#0007
But, to be honest, Agama displays the tx in a way which is confusing to some users.


[07-Oct-18 02:12 AM] pbca26#5430
can you elaborate?


[07-Oct-18 02:12 AM] SHossain#0007

[07-Oct-18 02:14 AM] SHossain#0007
This was a reward claim. for 1 tx it show all funds out and all funds in + the green reward amount


[07-Oct-18 02:14 AM] SHossain#0007
i guess, metaspoon was probably referring to this


[07-Oct-18 02:15 AM] pbca26#5430
that's what actually happened
alright i'll see if i can condense such txs into just 1


[07-Oct-18 02:16 AM] SHossain#0007
from my understanding, yes that is what happened. but, end users with little knowledge get confused. even though they have been working in gaming industry for long time


[07-Oct-18 02:17 AM] pbca26#5430
i think i had it combine txs into 1 at some point but then i did a series of improvements that made it split into two txs

yes, good idea


[07-Oct-18 02:21 AM] SHossain#0007

[08-Oct-18 04:29 AM] pbca26#5430
we might want to include more details about how transaction is going to be created e.g. full balance is used and sent to a specific pub address (spv/native mode), interest is credited to a new address (native)


[08-Oct-18 04:30 AM] pbca26#5430
you are not limited by chars count @Bryan_Beus
the better it explained the less chances we have to face another angry customer


[08-Oct-18 04:55 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
When holding KMD in your wallet you will automatically receive a 5% APR reward.

There are requirements that must be met to receive this reward, and it is important to understand them. 

The balance must be held in a non-private address, and it must remain in your wallet for at least one hour before the reward initiates. 

Most importantly, the reward is only generated for transaction sizes that are greater than 10 KMD. If you have several KMD transactions in your wallet that are less than 10 KMD separately, but more than 10 KMD together, you can combine them by sending your full balance to a new address in your wallet.

The reward duration lasts for one month. Therefore, at least once a month you should send your entire balance to a new address in your wallet. We also recommend that you claim your rewards once per week.

Please note that whenever you send a KMD transaction, even if you are sending it to yourself, a large amount of your funds will be sent to the KMD network for processing. This can make it appear for a few minutes that your balance is less than it should be; it may even appear to be zero. Please be patient while your funds process. If your balance does not return to normal within a few minutes, please reach out to our support team.

Thank you for choosing KMD! Please reach out to our support team if you have additional questions.

@pbca26 Does this cover everything?


[08-Oct-18 04:57 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Let's see, I was re-reading your message and I see a few more things.


[08-Oct-18 04:57 AM] TonyL#3577
@pbca26 I've installed Agama from Playmarket and nothing happens when clicking on any coin on the first screen.
When creating new seed and login getting a blank screen.
 Using Xiaomi with MIUI 10


[08-Oct-18 04:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Will install adb now and collect logs


[08-Oct-18 04:58 AM] pbca26#5430
it doesn't say anything about how tx is crafted @Bryan_Beus 
that's also need to be addressed so that people don't scream if they see their full balance temporary zeroed


[08-Oct-18 04:58 AM] Bryan_Beus#6442
ok


[08-Oct-18 05:01 AM] pbca26#5430
@TonyL that would be useful
i tested apk on my device as far as login/tx history goes before handing it over to @SHossain 
we can expect a plethora of bug reports now, brace yourself

We will get a lot of bug reports now as we build for official play store. few different steps already added by @pbca26 over the initial building process. The Google Play Developer Console will also populate with crash reports from users. Just need some time to gather data and pbca26 to squash all the bugs 😃

Just wonder maybe temporary disable it for downloading from market?

Found a minor UX issue when re-checked these bugs:
There is no application "Back" arrow on this screen (after coin choosing on the first screen) and native "Back" arrow which on the bottom put me on the phone main screen so I have to kill the application and re-open if changed mind about coin choice.
But it looks not urgent in comparison with previous problems)

some old devices has hardware back button, if we have in-app software back button at the top-left corner, it would be a great idea even if the hw button is broken

also, @TonyL @SHossain can you create gh tickets for improvements that you listed above?
https://github.com/komodoplatform/agama-mobile
we're going to abandon jira in a favor of gh, at least for web/mobile version for sure
from now on please post anything you find on the above repo
either i or nam will take care of that

fyi AWS has a device farm testing.   first 1000 minutes/month is free.   Then it's $0.17 per minute per device.

If something like this may be useful in the future, maybe we could budget for it in partnership talks with @n2okpride

There seems to be an airdrop or some type of announcement that users have seen , some users are talking about receiving coins with Agama , as if they were to receive a coin just after installing it .


[10-Oct-18 05:41 AM] DG#6934
@pbca26 Thanks at the end to be honest I am not a EQL investor or anything but frankly it creates a shadow on us . So that’s a good idea for them to put themselves on track.


[10-Oct-18 06:05 PM] DG#6934
I have tested Barterdex in Ubuntu 18.04 1.1.2 and 1.1.1. and it doesn't launch not even the first window....the same with a Windows VPS both servers were of 4 Vcore ..very strange indeed...it launched in my Mac but it matches some of the reports by some users of Barterdex 1.1.2 not being able to launch as always


[10-Oct-18 06:06 PM] DG#6934
I cannot get error log because it doesn't even launch in the background...marketmaker doesn't start


[10-Oct-18 06:09 PM] cipi#4502
try starting marketmaker alone and see what error it shows... pretty sure it is some missing libs on the OS... you can also call `ldd fullpathtomarketmakerbinary` and see what libs are are missing, but starting it will also show it


[10-Oct-18 06:50 PM] DG#6934
I made it with 16.04 , will check in the other OS s

[11-Oct-18 04:36 PM] DG#6934
thanks Grewal he said that marketmaker was running in the background but still didn't launch. It could be another binary as you are saying ...maybe he can confirm this by shutting for a second the AV and see if the program launches...

btw to simplify running manual tests i've added a few neat functions for spv
./agama nogui=1 coins="kmd,chips" seed="myseed"
it will launch agama, add 2 coins and login with seed "myseed"
you can use wif instead of seed as well
maybe it will save you some time typing

We want to make sure there are no bugs for SPV reward claiming after the 1 million block hardfork update. few days ago i tested native mode and it worked. after 31 days it stops accruing reward. i have given it an extra day to see if there was any change. everything was ok.
Now, we need to make sure that SPV reward claim works fine. (some users been reporting issues with SPV mode)


[14-Oct-18 03:46 PM] SHossain#0007
please check if your utxo/address has stopped accruing reward or not using SPV/Lite mode


[14-Oct-18 03:47 PM] SHossain#0007
then, try to claim the reward and see if there is any error or not. use Agama v42c or Agama Mobile

@pbca26 @cipi 
i guess i found an issue with SPV mode reward claim.
https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/f7d831ec2b585eefb8dcb1ee937fac54c2288cd72edca1805ea0c1b5e6f14707
this is the tx that was confirmed last at September 10 (after 1 million block hardfork rule to limit reward to 1 month)
logged in to Komodo SPV mode using Agama v42c and it doesn't show reward. like it was never accrued. but, all requirements to accrue rewards met
importing the WIF into native mode, it shows `"interest": 0.04368938,`
Here is a screenshot from Agama

if you want, i can send you the WIF key to test. i haven't claimed reward in native mode. thanks to @jusoaresf for sending the WIF

@benohanlon can you please get a tweet with the following info (or modify as necessary)?
```
We have identified a SPV reward claim bug in Agama which doesn't allow claiming reward if the transaction was made after block 1 million and about 30 days old. We are working on a fix and will update you as soon as possible. Until then, please use native mode to claim Komodo Active User Reward.
```

No, and green claiming button (on which was `!` sign) on the main screen was still active until I go to Settings and back to Main screen


[15-Oct-18 10:10 AM] TonyL#3577
After I re-opened Agama this button changed to Check UTXOs with empty list inside and self sending transaction appeared in transactions list


[15-Oct-18 10:10 AM] pbca26#5430
that's not good, can you try again after your interest goes above 0.0002?


[15-Oct-18 10:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Have I try to send balance to myself again first to generate UTXO which Agama "will see"?

@TonyL the reason why you see a time difference for interest utxos is because 777 seconds are subtracted from time now during tx creation
i can fix that and display an actual locktime in seconds passed on hover

started to setup a monitoring solution... atm, only the 9 electrum-servers are defined, together with load, mem and simple tcp-test to electrum port (calling server.version method of electrumx)
will have to write my own scripts to be able to fetch daemon_height and db_height from them (opening rpc-port of electrum to all is not a good idea, i think)
http://173.249.12.67/icinga/ User: guest, PWD: guest, if someone wants to take a look
there are also graphs embedded directly in icinga, but they can also be fetched separately, eg: http://173.249.12.67/pnp4nagios/graph?host=electrumx-EU_3&srv=load&view=1
still a lot of work to do though... i want to also monitor some other servers with it, like marketmaker and notaries

http://173.249.12.67/cgi-bin/icinga/status.cgi?servicegroup=elec_rpc_KMD&style=detail
shows info from the electrum server rpc for all KMD electrum servers
daemon_height is blockheight of the komodod daemon
db_height is the height of the corresponding electrum database
sessions is number of active sessions (clients connected)
daemon_height and db_height should match (ok if off by one or maybe 2)
checks are called every 5 minutes, so it is normal that the height is not the same on all 9 servers

http://173.249.12.67/cgi-bin/icinga/status.cgi?servicegroup=elec_rpc_BTC&style=detail
same for BTC electrums... so just change the URL accordingly to get status for different coins... not all are defined yet, will do this in the coming days


[16-Oct-18 09:08 PM] cipi#4502
maybe another important info: the known DNS entry electrum1.cipig.net, points to either electrumx-AR_1, electrumx-EU_1 or electrumx-NA_1, depending on the location of the client doing the request and reachability of the server (simple tcp check on the port of the electrum)... electrum2 and electrum3 accordingly

Very good information CIPI thanks , I am sure the team will find it helpful ? maybe should be pinned if needed?


[16-Oct-18 09:35 PM] cipi#4502
yes, this would be good... there are many questions about electrums and q quick look at this pages would tell you if there is a problem with the servers (not reachable, wrong height) or if the poroblem is somewhere else... not sure though where to put the info, in which channel... make it public or just team internal?

The last details I saw were very small and mostly related to a lack of resources on CPU from my machine , later on tested in a fresh server and it had no issues from my stand view ... also just quick reminder of this typo found by Anton


[18-Oct-18 07:17 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
no issues to report, i ll go through on more to make sure

@SHossain the main issue I noticed was an error with the new KOIN sync

i'll test KOIN sync now


[18-Oct-18 08:19 AM] SHossain#0007
can you please test sending PIRATE z tx on your end?

Guys I made this little checklist for Agama testing , in this way we  can help @pbca26  on reporting important things  that sometimes need to be reconfirmed  when we test subsequent builds in one day @Nabob | $ARRR     @Jonathan  Maybe you can add more things that can help noting while testing https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kN_oQ1NyuT2dKN3sWIf7op8pNWoPIDjHkjSymS2YZpQ/edit?usp=sharing

both 10.13.x and 10.12.x built successfully - since i have all SDKs manaully linked in and installed i am pretty sure it will build fine on 10.14.x too. Probably have to unlink from 10.11.x SDK in order to reproduce. We will see.

@ca333 i could spend my funds before the next BTC notarization https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/e7e7c669ea056aa2581055afa444755a430965c7230e710fc8e016589a374615


[18-Oct-18 02:39 PM] SHossain#0007
but, isn't this the normal behaviour of a native wallet?


[18-Oct-18 02:40 PM] ca333#0333
it is - but it shouldnt allow it until a notarization takes place. provided the utxo you are trying to spend was confirmed AFTER the last notarization.


[18-Oct-18 02:40 PM] ca333#0333
cc: @jl777c ^


[18-Oct-18 02:41 PM] ca333#0333
the timeframe between the last notarization and the notarization that is going to take place can be exploited @SHossain - we are only secured against a double spend when a notarization takes place


[18-Oct-18 02:41 PM] SHossain#0007
yep.

i am not sure if we have implemented a utxo lock for this timeframe or if we are trusting/hoping for endusers and services/exchanges to check for the dpowconfs.


[18-Oct-18 02:42 PM] ca333#0333
just preventing the TX from going out (the utxo from being spent) would solve the problem and fully remove the risk


[18-Oct-18 02:42 PM] ca333#0333
it would be "dpow"-conformal


[18-Oct-18 02:43 PM] SHossain#0007
more security 😂


[18-Oct-18 02:44 PM] SHossain#0007
sometimes BTC notarization takes over an hour. users have to wait that long to spend their funds?


[18-Oct-18 02:44 PM] ca333#0333
it would be considered secure


[18-Oct-18 02:44 PM] ca333#0333
not convenient, i fully understand that


[18-Oct-18 02:44 PM] SHossain#0007
a BTC notarization just happened


[18-Oct-18 02:45 PM] ca333#0333
is it even using btc notarization count?


[18-Oct-18 02:46 PM] ca333#0333
dPoW chains do consider last kmd notarization as secure height


[18-Oct-18 02:46 PM] ca333#0333
at least that is what the lag api shows


[18-Oct-18 02:46 PM] ca333#0333
otherwise you d need to run a dual attack


[18-Oct-18 02:47 PM] ca333#0333
attacking dPoW token and KMD - would be interesting to see what forkwitch thinks about this


[18-Oct-18 02:48 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, in dpowconf implementation it has it


[18-Oct-18 02:52 PM] SHossain#0007
dpowconf: `0, 1, n` values in `gettxout`, `listunspent` call
first stage
```
  "confirmations": 0,
```
2nd stage 
```
  "confirmations": 1,
  "rawconfirmations": 1,
```
then after 5 KMD block confirm
```
  "confirmations": 1,
  "rawconfirmations": 5,
```
after 12 KMD block cnfirm when a BTC notarization happen
```
  "confirmations": 12,
  "rawconfirmations": 12,
```
hope this makes it easier.


[18-Oct-18 02:54 PM] SHossain#0007
Exchanges can wait until next notarizied block happens (when confirmation is not `0` or `1` but `n` to allow withdraw or credit deposited funds. that means those txs are dpowed and secure.


[18-Oct-18 02:55 PM] SHossain#0007
All they have to check is the value of `  "confirmations": 12,`


[18-Oct-18 03:06 PM] SHossain#0007
@Mylo @Daniel CP ^^ if you want to know how to verify our recent **dpowfconfix**. the source is avaialble in master branch. not a mandetory update. it is there for anyone who wants to use this (mostly for exchanges).

{Reactions}
👌 

[18-Oct-18 10:59 PM] jl777c#5810
my assumption is exchanges use "confirmations" field for approving deposits and none of them allow 1 conf deposit


[18-Oct-18 11:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Binance now waiting for 120 KMD confirmations Oo Looks like overkill


[19-Oct-18 05:10 AM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL it is secure for now that way, until they start following the dpowconf fix 😃

Yeah there was a small lag claiming rewards for me too


[19-Oct-18 02:01 PM] pbca26#5430
likely network related lag
there are more moving pieces than in desktop

[20-Oct-18 07:08 AM] cipi#4502
monitoring is now enabled for all electrum-servers that i manage and it now also compares blockheight for many coins (all ACs and the coins we do dPoW for)
http://173.249.12.67/cgi-bin/icinga/status.cgi?servicegroup=elec_rpc_BTC&style=detail (guest/guest)
simply replace "BTC" in the above URL with another coin symbol to view it
"daemon_height" = height of the coin wallet on server
"db_height" = height of the electrum database
"remote_height" = height from explorer
i get a critical/warning message when the heights differ too much (warning > 2, critical > 5)

Komodo (2) 👏🏽 🎉 

[20-Oct-18 07:35 AM] pbca26#5430
@Nabob | $ARRR yes i bumped the fee everywhere


[20-Oct-18 07:36 AM] pbca26#5430
on average it gives about several minutes to an hour margin to compensate for possible time difference
the exact window greatly depends on amounts

@SHossain It's positive now because I've transferred 0.1 KMD so 0.1 - 0.0091 = 0.0909 which are displaying atm

@pbca26 apart from the dpowconf fix there wasn't any core changes in master branch. we can dpowconf fix enabled binary perhaps in the next build. this is not mandetory. and, we don't have those latest binaries compiled yet for all OS. @ca333 is currently fixing compile bug in macOS mojave. so, we can wait for that.
@Jonathan please run some tests of this build. if this build is ready, we can request @ca333 to make the release builds in github and bintray.

Transaction at the end is not send


[22-Oct-18 09:54 AM] DG#6934
I thought it was on my end but restarted and still , will do it in the VPS just in case


[22-Oct-18 09:55 AM] DG#6934
Only happened when trying to send full balance ...other smaller transactions work


[22-Oct-18 09:55 AM] DG#6934
that's why I didn't catched it before


[22-Oct-18 09:57 AM] DG#6934
QUICK RECAP First I did a transaction full balance , threw the error, Second time it also threw the error, Third test was a tx of only 1 KMD and it passed but funny thing is that later on the Full balance tx went through without me doing it again


[22-Oct-18 09:57 AM] DG#6934
so most likely some type of connection issue not sure...


[22-Oct-18 10:00 AM] DG#6934
balance changed to 0.00 and apparently the transaction didn't went through so the balance got reflected again


[22-Oct-18 10:00 AM] DG#6934
will keep on testing on the VPS


[22-Oct-18 10:11 AM] DG#6934
Most likely has to do with utxo needed to be merged because it was possible to sent in smaller amounts ...the strange thing is that it showed multiple balances that later changed or missmatched

I didn't get it with native by itself


[22-Oct-18 02:25 PM] Jonathan#3687
Is that a common scenario to have native and spv open for the same coin?


[22-Oct-18 02:31 PM] DG#6934
no it was not allowed from a while back


[22-Oct-18 02:31 PM] DG#6934
but it happened for some reason while testing other coins


[22-Oct-18 02:32 PM] DG#6934
maybe is some type of lag and it get's passed by


[22-Oct-18 03:10 PM] Jonathan#3687
It lets me add both but native doesn't open after activating (activated spv first), didn't get any errors  though

i wouldn't actually mind to run same coin in native and lite mode

this could allow users to use multiple addresses at the same time


[23-Oct-18 07:07 AM] pbca26#5430
@Nabob | $ARRR these icons are a legacy thing
doesn't make sense to add it to spv


[23-Oct-18 07:09 AM] pbca26#5430
@SHossain is not technically possible
ui is coded to support one mode at a time
it's just too much work for something that only 0.1% of people will use

what's you suggestion?
remove it, shift it?

i suppose we need a custom fee field for ac_private?


[23-Oct-18 08:50 AM] SHossain#0007
i am using agama to send z tx regularly. didn't find issues on my end

Linux didnt noticed no issues for now


[23-Oct-18 08:56 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
Trying to explain him, send all in private transactions never work if he has pennys of UTXOS, If he has fewer utxos it possible (i assume he is miner)


[23-Oct-18 08:58 AM] pbca26#5430
i can add a custom z tx fee field
this should make it a bit easier


[23-Oct-18 08:58 AM] SHossain#0007
max 50 utxo usage is advisable. not more than that


[23-Oct-18 08:59 AM] SHossain#0007
mined funds creates this issue most of the time


[23-Oct-18 09:00 AM] SHossain#0007
they way i consolidate them is by creating a new z addr and send mined funds there periodically. that merges a lot small utxo into something meaningful, then i send them to another z address after few weeks to merge those meaningful utxos to something more meaningful


[23-Oct-18 09:31 AM] DG#6934
Bitdefender blocked Agama after running for a second time  on desktop


[23-Oct-18 09:32 AM] DG#6934
Windows....other windows machine didn't had this issue because it doesn't have that AV


[23-Oct-18 09:32 AM] DG#6934
so most likely users are going to be seeing Agama blocked if they have Bitdefender


[23-Oct-18 09:33 AM] DG#6934
should we contact them to let them know about this false positive?


[23-Oct-18 09:33 AM] DG#6934
I will try

and Avast for what I have seen users experiencing only blocks the komodo daemon not the execution of the program itself


[23-Oct-18 10:03 AM] DG#6934
Hi @Nabob | $ARRR 😃  just in case maybe we should do a guide about how to solve this issue and also explaining that for now ...this is the procedure in order to be able to merge their UTXOs and it will be better than them spamming with complaints...

{Reactions}
👍🏻 

[23-Oct-18 10:04 AM] DG#6934
We already have something similar explaining the UTXOs but still for these miners they don't think about it so much


[23-Oct-18 10:16 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
I agree , merge process is timetaking, User always never be satisfied however we can suggest N of ways,  Sapling Fix may able to fix this gap. I feel @pbca26 , How hard he works round the clock fixing agama on all crazy requests we ask him.

@pbca26 i used to see a scroll bar to scroll horizontally. i don't see that in @Jonathan 's screenshot


[23-Oct-18 12:16 PM] Jonathan#3687
I saw the scroll momentarily appear after I hit the refresh icon then it went away

Also just in case this is part of this same error discussed above about Lite mode being enabled while native is but in this particular case user can get confused because they could be seeing a lite / native mixture

@pbca26 @ca333 there was a bug in the komodo source, after sending tx using the CLI, while the tx is in mempool if you issue `gettxout` call the daemon will crash. @jl777c fixed it yesterday. could that be the issue?
@ca333 can you please make new builds of komodo binary by merging jl777 `master` branch to ship with Agama?

please check if the crash is fixed or not


[25-Oct-18 04:39 AM] SHossain#0007
i'm testing on Linux now


[25-Oct-18 04:51 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
lInux portable.zip has older build, I can add both modes to agama


[25-Oct-18 04:51 AM] SHossain#0007
The Linux installer version is working fine


[25-Oct-18 04:52 AM] SHossain#0007
@Nabob | $ARRR which version you are testing? the current release (link above) portable version shouldn't work at all as there is the installer file inside the poratble zip


[25-Oct-18 04:52 AM] SHossain#0007
43b is the new build


[25-Oct-18 04:53 AM] SHossain#0007
installer version  has this behaviour


[25-Oct-18 04:54 AM] SHossain#0007
that you reported.


[25-Oct-18 04:54 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
Yeah, I have used that zip, Inside i can see installer version, Can you help to check on your side as well once

For linux installer, can we add small task,  when ever it is launched for Installation, can we remove `/etc/SuperNETOrg-AgamaApp.ini` , 
This file restricts the reinstallation feature on Linux installer

@ca333 @pbca26 i have tested on all OS and didn't catch any critical issue. apart from the new virus flag on windows portable zip (may not be critical issue). this version seems ready for release. i have updated the virustotal detection links. will update the website shortly.
@ca333 are you uploading the zips to bintray as well?

Could you delay a bit until i push the pr?


[25-Oct-18 06:15 AM] SHossain#0007
@Nabob | $ARRR yes i can. already posted screenshot. this is not critical issue.


[25-Oct-18 06:15 AM] SHossain#0007
we need to wait for a fix in the next version


[25-Oct-18 06:17 AM] SHossain#0007
@siu it would be better to get PGT included in the next release.


[25-Oct-18 06:23 AM] SHossain#0007
i have added KMD in both native and lite mode. claimed reward using lite mode. then, native mode was having issue  displaying info (i.e.: z balance). it was only showing lite mode info. also, that created white screen of death while switching between different coins. after i removed lite mode, native mode working fine.


[25-Oct-18 06:35 AM] siu#3920
ok


[25-Oct-18 06:35 AM] siu#3920
next release is the same that will add dice?


[25-Oct-18 06:37 AM] SHossain#0007
we have KMDICE now


[25-Oct-18 06:37 AM] siu#3920
oh, the KMDICE release is out already?


[25-Oct-18 06:38 AM] SHossain#0007
almost. waiting for ca333 to investigate the virustotal result. 
i couldn't find much info on this virus using google search


[25-Oct-18 06:56 AM] siu#3920
damn :/


[25-Oct-18 06:59 AM] SHossain#0007
dPoW Conf activated automatically in this version with latest komodo daemon. This will work automatically for Native mode for KMD or any other assetchain. SPV mode does not have this.
This will be a visible change in Agama GUI. Users may ask what is happening this as this is new.

- 0 confirmations mean, tx is not confirmed yet
- 1 confirmation means this tx is confirmed on the network, but not dPoW'd yet (explorer may show different block confirmations until the next notarization happens on the respective chain, nothing to worry about)
- any other confirmation number means the tx is secure with dPoW

@Angelina @Nabob | $ARRR @DG just for your information 👆🏽 
it would be nice to put this info on the solutions page somewhere for Agama native mode.

@SHossain do you by any chance have the old Agama WIN portable archive around? Just to check if it also gets flagged if we rescan it (extract, add empty file, archive and upload). My bet is that virus.vbs.qexvmc.1065 flag is a wrong flag from the AV engine "Qihoo-360".
My search just showed a bunch of affected files which also had crypto-lockers (Locky) - so could probably be another wrong flag because of crypto related libs - also out of all AV engines Qihoo-360 is the only one thats flagging the new Agama version.

Lets see if we have an old version around to compare against - otherwise i d need to build on a different server and check again - the agama app dirs seem to be clean.

will let you know how it goes - for the future would be good to keep an local archive of last 2 - 3 releases

[25-Oct-18 07:17 AM] ca333#0333
so we have a chance to check against stuff and proof our software was clean when we pushed it (identical with the checksums of the virustotal checks)


[25-Oct-18 07:17 AM] SHossain#0007
can we publish this release with no windows portable for now. and, we add windows portable when you finish investigating?
in this way, users can start using the reward claim properly


[25-Oct-18 07:17 AM] SHossain#0007

@pbca26 we found a SPV related bug. please check this recording ^^


[25-Oct-18 10:57 AM] SHossain#0007
steps to reproduce:
1. Start KMD lite mode from the shortcut and login
2. Activate BTC, it doesn't activate
3. Use CTRL+R to reload, it shows BTC but address, balance or tx history doesn't load

Works, only if we only activate BTC directly.

The first one I mean


[25-Oct-18 11:26 AM] DG#6934
not sure why I get this error so often but users and most likely new users are going to get a little confused if they are not experienced.

maybe I just have bad luck...I will maybe have to do an exorcism to my computers


[25-Oct-18 11:28 AM] Jonathan#3687
What do you mean by default?


[25-Oct-18 11:28 AM] DG#6934
like the error was replicated without any type of previous use of the wallet


[25-Oct-18 11:29 AM] Jonathan#3687
Ah gotcha


[25-Oct-18 11:29 AM] DG#6934
I load native mode ...then a select lite mode and in both versions the lite mode version is available while you are in native mode


[25-Oct-18 11:30 AM] DG#6934

anyone else here having problems with a build of komodod on OSX 10.14 ?? gonna explain it ashwin via DM, but might make sense to post details here if more are (still) affected.


[25-Oct-18 02:52 PM] ca333#0333
@SHossain if i remember correctly it failed for you too?


[25-Oct-18 02:59 PM] ca333#0333
if anyone is having issues compiling it on osx 10.14 please advice them to **reinstall gcc@6 && command line tools** - the command line tools for 10.14 are diff to those from 10.13 and there is a conflict in the SDK that will result in a compiler error that you faced. However this is just a build env issue - so just a ordinary PEBCAK error.

either use test build13 or wait for 0.2.43d

I don't want to alarm you in anyway  but wallet crashed with the latest build ...the only thing that I am seeing is that there is a possibility that we get reports of users with their wallets crashing and experiencing something that I pointed before regarding this matter Quote  "I erased all of the files only left the wallet.dat ....then it crashed...I then did a reindex...did some part of it ....then it crashed...erased all blocks and all again from start didn't worked but still just to make sure I will import the wallet.dat to the other server after finishing some other part of the testing"


[26-Oct-18 02:14 PM] DG#6934
I am finishing the test of this scenario taking that wallet.dat file to another computer to take out my test funds


[26-Oct-18 02:15 PM] DG#6934
happened to me just now again


[26-Oct-18 02:19 PM] DG#6934
if not I will just use the CLI to get them out


[26-Oct-18 03:34 PM] DG#6934
Finally after crashing , reindexing , restarting PC  for a couple of times it worked 🙂


[26-Oct-18 03:41 PM] DG#6934

new release @everyone https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama/releases/tag/multios-0.2.43d
win-portable is not available until the AV engine Qihoo-360 confirms that there is no malware in the win portable version - in internal rechecks neither Bitdefender nor the Sophos AV engine flagged the win portable as infected

we are going the safe path with waiting for further validation from the AV engines side or it could potentially (worst case) result in a "kmd team is knowingly spreading malware" mess


[27-Oct-18 02:19 AM] SHossain#0007
Thanks @ca333. I will contact Qihoo-360 today.

[27-Oct-18 02:36 AM] 0x03#8822
thats because it probably is not infected. a bold statement on why people should trust snakeoil a little less would maybe be an alternative. especially if bitdefender and sophos agree, but some chinese snakeoil doesn't.

[29-Oct-18 02:00 PM] SHossain#0007
@DG the current address matches the BarterDEX addresses (except some parts are in CAPS).


[29-Oct-18 02:00 PM] SHossain#0007
the previous address you got, dont' use that.


[29-Oct-18 02:00 PM] SHossain#0007

0xc90F36E046A010a331d5d15Ae8ED8dBbdb073CCA this is my new eth address


[29-Oct-18 02:03 PM] Jonathan#3687
Is it suppose to change? I logged in with a PIN the second time and it is different


[29-Oct-18 02:04 PM] SHossain#0007
on ETH? on this new version versus old version @Jonathan ?

yeah it changed completely my test funds are not there...also used a pin


[29-Oct-18 02:05 PM] Jonathan#3687
Yep ETH, made a PIN when I created the wallet......used the same login and it's different


[29-Oct-18 02:05 PM] Jonathan#3687
Yep @DG


[29-Oct-18 02:05 PM] SHossain#0007
did it happen in the same version?


[29-Oct-18 02:05 PM] SHossain#0007
using build3 both times?

it wasn't much so no worries I know we are testing 😉

Build 2 was the one that we used but after updating to build 3

if you created with build1 and build2, then it was a different version of address. build3 matches the same address as barterDEX

It's not just advanced features - it's every toggle from "Debug" to "Require PIN to confirm transaction". The toggle options below that work

I think the DNR SPV servers are not updated ...it shows the transaction in the explorer but it doesn't reflect neither in Agama or Hyperdex ...

[30-Oct-18 02:15 PM] SHossain#0007
i suggest we remove DNR from Agama and remove DNR SPV feature from BarterDEX. there seems to be always issues with DNR and their electrum servers


[30-Oct-18 02:15 PM] DG#6934
even the market cap went south


[30-Oct-18 02:16 PM] DG#6934
so they are loosing support I guess


[30-Oct-18 02:16 PM] SHossain#0007
that is not an excuse not to run their SPV server reliably


[30-Oct-18 02:17 PM] SHossain#0007
this eats our support time


[30-Oct-18 02:18 PM] DG#6934
true even the explorer that we have in the wallet is no longer working...so yeah  very irresponsable from their end

i am at ElectrumX 1.8.7 with my servers, so the DNRs are pretty old... don't know their syncstatus, there is unfortunately no electrum-API-call like "showmeyourblockheight"

simply replace BTC with some other coin symbol and if there are checks for that coin, it will show up

[30-Oct-18 02:29 PM] SHossain#0007
@cipi what do you think about my suggestion? DNR spv servers are outdated and not maintained regularly.


[30-Oct-18 02:30 PM] cipi#4502
yes, you are right... maybe we should remove it... i would run them myself, but first i need a bit more RAM on the electrums and the wallet code is also pretty old


[30-Oct-18 02:31 PM] cipi#4502
i even stopped DNR on my mm nodes because there were problems with the wallet (don't remember what excatly though)


[30-Oct-18 02:32 PM] SHossain#0007
@pbca26 please remove DNR from Agama. we dropping this coin. this coin puts bad impression on Agama and BarterDEX
@cipi please submit a PR in the coins repo when you get some time.

@SHossain on a broader note do you think we should place disclaimers for users to contact the coins themselves first for these issues? Maybe in Agama itself (and definitely the support site)


[30-Oct-18 02:37 PM] SHossain#0007
@Jonathan that's a nice idea. but, if the issue relates to BarterDEX, we can do the initial help from here


[30-Oct-18 02:37 PM] SHossain#0007
for DNR, we can simply redirect from now on

Can someone explain to me how limiting your node to a single connection is a "slow sync fix"?


[01-Nov-18 09:32 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
@Alright  If you are referring to windows, Limiting to 1 connection is an  "bandwidth data fix", while running with multiple nodes headers download/upload count is very high and repetitive


[01-Nov-18 09:36 AM] DG#6934
I don’t use that option when using Windows sync time is normal without it.


[01-Nov-18 09:38 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
After fully in sync, headers count is not that much, agama also reverts the maxconn back to normal after some 90%

- dnr is disabled until further notice

starting from this version you can use btc compatible wif/eth privs interchangeably
there's one limitation though
settings export keys will only dump keys if you provide priv key that you used to login in the first place
e.g. if kmd wif used then you have to provide kmd wif
btc wif or eth priv won't allow to export keys

while Sending transaction on ETH Ropsten Getting this error - https://www.screencast.com/t/bC9PfOtgPmPu

When adding coin with seed on SPV, After a while when removed the coin from stack( or emptied agama Stack), again when Adding coin it should prompt for seed again, but, I can login without seed prompt (Is it expected) @pbca26

by the way @here KMDICE will do an emergency snapshot and airdrop to fork to another chain. The original one messed up and we need to change it. Snapshot will be on block 27k. Less than 500 blocks away. We will let you know the details of the new chain once its done.

hey @pbca26 awesome work.   linux test builds only for now, understood.  i have other quetions to gather information about this new feature:

a)  What will the next version number be?

b)  Is this an initial release of this feature?

c)  Where are the instructions for enabling ETH/ERC20?

d)  How much of barterdex wallet functions are re-used or is it all totally new?


[06-Nov-18 05:27 AM] pbca26#5430
a) v44
b) yes
c) advanced features toggle, same as btc/ltc etc
d) not sure i follow your question

[06-Nov-18 05:34 AM] Mylo#8306
@pbca26 (d) - has a lot of barterdex infrastructure to provide ETH support has been re-used.   artem's servers, coins.db from repo etc.   this is what i was told in riot - maybe just similar way of supporting eth balance etc. as barterdex?


[06-Nov-18 05:43 AM] pbca26#5430
i copy pasted token contract addresses that we have in coins db repo
it's a pure js implementation no bdex parts are involved
in theory any standard erc20 tokens should work


[06-Nov-18 06:12 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Hey all, I'm writing a blog post to announce that the next release of Agama will support ETH and ERC20 tokens


[06-Nov-18 06:12 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Just a couple of quick questions, forgive me if they're dumb


[06-Nov-18 06:14 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Will the next release support all ERC20 tokens? Or will individual projects need to submit a request on GitHub for their token to be integrated?

When can we expect the new version to be released?

Are there are other multi-coin wallets that support BTC-protocol coins and ERC20 coins or is this an industry first?


[06-Nov-18 06:25 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Just read through the chat a bit more and realized that the new release will support the same ERC20 tokens that BarterDEX does but not sure where to find that list... is there a link or a doc that has all that info in one place?


[06-Nov-18 06:34 AM] pbca26#5430
yes the next release is going to have erc20 support
there's no eta yet
according to wikipedia there are about 100k erc20 tokens out there
wild guess barterdex supports tokens that have any value/interest to users
individual projects can approach us to integrate their erc20 token(s)
no we're not discovering america, there are plenty of wallets that support btc and eth
however if you add "open source" to your sentence we might be among a few wallets that have both integrated
i can make a list of all erc20 tokens in a doc

I believe it could be a little premature for people to test it but if @pbca26  approves it should be ok...for what I have seen it works with no issues or bugs that could give a bad experience to the users.

@pbca26  Just out of curiosity in Agama native mode when I send a transaction between two addresses that I own in that same wallet,  it doesn't register them in the transactions list, but still well you can see them in the explorer...does this has something to do with it being in the same wallet and for that reason there is no need to show these transactions in the transactions list?

eth/erc20 fees are dynamic
it's 21000 wei gas per eth tx and ~37000 wei gas per erc20 tx
gas prices vary and fetched on each send coin trigger
the final tx price is amount of gas * gas price

Just updated MacOS on mojave:
At first git didn't work:
```git log -1

I've fixed it by xcode cli tools installation:
```xcode-select --install```
But komodo not building:

@Nabob | $ARRR that's correct isn't it?


[08-Nov-18 08:11 AM] TonyL#3577
If someone will face building problems on Mojave seems it solved an issue with C compiler on my side:
1) installed headers `open /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/Packages/macOS_SDK_headers_for_macOS_10.14.pkg`
2) installed package ` Command Line Tools package for XCode 10.1` from https://developer.apple.com/download/more/
3) `brew update && brew upgrade`
I did also `brew uninstall gcc --force` meanwhile but not sure was it necessary or not


[08-Nov-18 08:20 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
It shows correct, Not sure why it is not showing 
Take backup of  %appdata%\Agama and remove that folder and relaunch

I guess you have already restarted the wallet and it’s still remains the same

@DG exactly


[08-Nov-18 10:55 AM] benohanlon#7045
it's weird - doesn't actually claim only shows me a screen and it tells me locktimes for two amounts


[08-Nov-18 11:12 AM] DG#6934
Will try to reproduce , but it seems as a very particular case...for now you could also try doing it in native mode by importing the private key ...if you don't want to download the whole Komodo chain for hours you can try the bootstrap solution https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000025745-komodo-bootstrap , and just in case can you send us the consolte error here ....you can check this by selecting the View tab > sekect Toggle Developers Tools and press the Console Tab and you should see the error log while you are at the screen


[08-Nov-18 11:13 AM] DG#6934

[08-Nov-18 12:02 PM] DG#6934
@benohanlon I thought you were using lite mode...that's a little strange to be happening on native...but still you can try exporting the private key and using it on the lite mode version of the wallet. Haven't seen this error with the new version...** Just in case try reindexing the blockchain  https://support.komodoplatform.com/a/solutions/ and if not just try a resync and see if it helps ...just to discard these scenarios.


[08-Nov-18 12:15 PM] DG#6934

@benohanlon  Just to be completely sure in this case try erasing the Agama folder. I know you already did an uninstallation and installation. But let's try a fresh installation with no previous files from the beginning. Go to %appdata% and erase the Agama folder...and download the same file and try this again.

Please! Feedback on this is appreciated. @n2okpride above is the Securities token wallet prototype - I will add a potential KYC module to it as well - encryption and better UI coming the next days. once naezith is done with token-creation view we ll run a multi OS test an open it for semi-public testing.

Any ideas on why glxt has issues on the latest release?


[11-Nov-18 03:10 AM] siu#3920
Is this something osx specific? I have never had any issues with it on linux


[11-Nov-18 04:49 AM] siu#3920
@ca333 where can i test the token gui?

it builds fine - you need to reinstall gcc6 and command line tools @TonyL

afterwards all will be good - they messed up internal SDK linkage

Wrong error - it was before i reinstalled


[11-Nov-18 08:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Latest error was:

[11-Nov-18 08:40 AM] ca333#0333
weird - tried a make clean and rebulid?


[11-Nov-18 08:41 AM] ca333#0333
i added curl as a package dependency back in the day so its not needed anymore


[11-Nov-18 08:41 AM] ca333#0333
but worst case you should be able to rebuld libcurl.a


[11-Nov-18 08:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, in which branch you did it? Maybe problem is that I'm trying to build jl777/FSM


[11-Nov-18 08:45 AM] TonyL#3577
There was a strange behaviour - I was able to execute build - it's builded till the libcurl. But when I'm trying `make clean` there is a error regards no targets (but makefile is here and I'm able to execute build again)


[11-Nov-18 08:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Anyway will take a look on it again tomorrow as well as on GLXT native mode


[11-Nov-18 08:50 AM] DG#6934
A little bit strange GLXT launches with no issues now... yesterday tried multiple times and it crashed

Oh wow this is a surprise!!

So what is this wallet for, ICOs for Tokens etc and trading them or just buying and storing etc?

try master branch when you rebuild tomorrow @TonyL and let me know result plz


[12-Nov-18 12:48 AM] ca333#0333
do we have any results ref. Agama test with GLXT in native mode on OSX 10.14 ?? @everyone

there was a bug introduced, now fixed that affected GLXT in beta and earlier branches

sorry v.old osx here 10.12.x

@ca333 we may need new binaries for Komodo. Please release them when you have the time


[12-Nov-18 02:23 AM] ca333#0333
@jl777c fixed in your current master? we ran a fresh komodod build yesterday - might be able to use that one if so.


[12-Nov-18 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i havent updated master in a while, too much new code to do that


[12-Nov-18 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so i push up to beta branch and stop


[12-Nov-18 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810
master unchanged


[12-Nov-18 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810

@ca333 can you run v44 build again?
master wasn't synced with eth integration branch


[12-Nov-18 10:44 AM] ca333#0333
@TonyL how are you building it - which makefile you using?


[12-Nov-18 10:44 AM] ca333#0333
@pbca26 - will run v44 again

sometimes those lib providers have hosting issues - really interesting to check how hard it would be to infiltrate such a major cryptocurrency dependency

yes i know that cases - similiar happened to me in the past with lib proton and if i remember correctly with libsodium or libsnark too...


[12-Nov-18 03:01 PM] ca333#0333

[12-Nov-18 03:01 PM] ca333#0333
webpack doesnt have the cli included anymore and was separated into an own repo

fyi @pbca26 - probably needs a debug round

this is all based on master branches (agama, easydex-gui)


[12-Nov-18 03:05 PM] ca333#0333
seems google found the issue (incompatibility between webpack v and dev server version)

yeah that webpack version is outdated and flagged as highly vulnerable - only reason i updated it


[12-Nov-18 03:14 PM] ca333#0333
i only update severe vuln dep versions - always leave the others "outdated"


[12-Nov-18 03:17 PM] pbca26#5430
okay i'll try to look tomorrow
can you build using an old version?


[12-Nov-18 03:18 PM] ca333#0333
no worries - shouldnt be a biggie - i will try to get it fixed/tested till you re back


[12-Nov-18 03:20 PM] pbca26#5430
so many devs that want to break everything these days
no respect for backward compatibility
seems btc core style is common now


[12-Nov-18 04:45 PM] ca333#0333
yes sadly - i am seeing this happening with many projects now. 
it may sound conspiracy theory like but i kinda feel due to the overpriced zday (hyped) market such a dependency hell will put odds high that some mainstream app using such a lib becomes a lucrative zday target.


[12-Nov-18 04:47 PM] ca333#0333
i have fixed all webpack 4 migration issues but we still have a bunch of deps using the old webpack3 scheme (for example react-select , etc.) - will continue with those tomorrow.
I ll just quickly build a release based on 3 - that will be good enough until we push the next webpack 4 compatible version.

@Alright the daemon is not crashing nor down. but, the GUI thinks it is down


[13-Nov-18 06:16 AM] Alright#0419
if you started it with previous build and ZEX.conf was not deleted since it might be taking the rpc port from conf


[13-Nov-18 06:17 AM] Alright#0419
and the previous build didn't have ac_founders code, so it was trying to connect to wrong ports

fresh data dir

using Agama 0.2.44b on a fresh ubuntu 18.04 machine showed weird behaviour:

I launched ZEX in native mode, wallet didnt properly work:
a) get new address retruned "error" in blue modal at right bottom area 
b) blockinfo didnt update - stuck at activating best chain
(daemon was running - no crash)

After relaunching Agama it worked fine - can someone plz try to reproduce this potential "initial startup issue"

[13-Nov-18 10:33 PM] ca333#0333
this is based on GUI@wp4 and agama@master branch @pbca26


[14-Nov-18 01:01 AM] TonyL#3577
@ca333 Was it installer or portable version?


[14-Nov-18 01:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Installer not worked for me on Ubuntu 18.04 64-bit (seems installer is 32 bit):
```./AgamaApp-0.2.44b-beta-linux-installer.run 
bash: ./AgamaApp-0.2.44b-beta-linux-installer.run: No such file or directory
```


[14-Nov-18 01:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Portable not started as well:
```./Agama 


#
# Fatal error in , line 0
# Check failed: (isolate->snapshot_blob()) == nullptr.
#
#
#
#FailureMessage Object: 0x7ffd14304790Illegal instruction (core dumped)
```
Are there some additional dependencies needed?


[14-Nov-18 02:20 AM] pbca26#5430
>Check failed: (isolate->snapshot_blob()) == nullptr
google says it's related to v8 (nodejs) somehow


[14-Nov-18 02:40 AM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 i can confirm same behaviour in macOS and Linux portable version doesn't start


[14-Nov-18 02:55 AM] TonyL#3577
I guess issues with installer on my side caused by usage of amd64 architecture Ubuntu iso instead of i386


[14-Nov-18 02:57 AM] TonyL#3577
This one is not 32-bit code compatible


[14-Nov-18 02:58 AM] pbca26#5430
can someone post zex's conf?
the one that's generated after agama starts it

[14-Nov-18 03:26 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
i mean the dependeency i386


[14-Nov-18 03:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh right, thanks @Nabob | $ARRR 
Maybe it's worth to re-work installer into bash script which will install/check dependencies first and then execute ./Agama.run  ? Since there is no way that end user will know about this dependencies if just download release from website/github


[14-Nov-18 03:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Kinda run_install.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt-get install libc6-i386 libgconf-2-4 libcurl3
sudo ./AgamaApp-0.2.XX-beta-linux-installer.run```


[14-Nov-18 03:32 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
```[1] : Uninstall

@TonyL  I Agree, Thats good idea


[14-Nov-18 03:34 AM] TonyL#3577
For me it's hanged now on the same state as you described above even for fresh install 🤔


[14-Nov-18 03:35 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
check the file already present, Not with fresh install


[14-Nov-18 03:36 AM] TonyL#3577
There is no such file atm


[14-Nov-18 03:37 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
If there Is no file, setup start Installing, Just tried


[14-Nov-18 03:39 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
may have permission issue, not sure


[14-Nov-18 04:08 AM] TonyL#3577

updated there was a bug
you can use any pub address 
it will check and list which coins it may relate to

i couldn't reproduce any native related issues
also, what @Nabob | $ARRR and @DG posted reminds me of our previous issue where new code changes were not added to release
i will double check native on linux
so far i had an issue only with zex on mac and have a feeling it's because of unpatched komodod

Hi guys if you can try changing the komodo directory path in Agama 2.43d for some reason I cannot get to type in neither in windows , Mac or Linux....in the new version 2.44 I am able to type and try to change the directory


[14-Nov-18 10:11 PM] DG#6934
I tried in two fresh installations in windows and linux


[14-Nov-18 11:46 PM] ca333#0333
There seems to be a serious diff. between master branch and dev/FSM @jl777c which leads to inconsistent AC-params-generation. rpc/p2p and netmessage arent the same while using the same ac params for daemon launch. 

*Tested with master branch and FSM on OSX (10.14, 10.12) and linux (ubuntu 18.04) - you can reproduce by launching up ZEX in master branch and afterwards in FSM or dev branch - forkbehaviour will lead to HD wallet error.*

master branch has NOT been updated with the new -ac_founders parameter that was created this weekend

it seemed to work...but when I started the wallet it switched back to the old directory...will try it again to see if it's because of the path... but the strange thing is that it accepted it and was saved.

reproduced same, after saving data directory path, restarting agama , config.json is not affected.(Tested on  build 17)

Is this fully correct? I can only test for macOS right now ```js
// macOS
if(platform === 'darwin') {
    wallet_dat_path = '~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/' + chain_name + '/'  
}
// Windows
else if(platform === 'win32') {
    wallet_dat_path = '%APPDATA%\\Komodo\\' + chain_name + '\\'  
}
// Probably Linux
else {
    wallet_dat_path = '~/.komodo/' + chain_name + '/'  
}

wallet_dat_path += 'wallet.dat'

>2) creating new addresses doesnt show them in the GUI:
does it work if the daemon is fully synced?
by design during sync all other calls are not used such as listtransactions, getbalance etc to reduce load

yes, it works.


[16-Nov-18 12:10 PM] SHossain#0007
this is could be related to ZEX chain only. i have tested ZILLA and KMDICE with completely clean data dir, and i could use `getnewaddress` button after launching the chain. even before it synced a single block

🤔 I just erased the data directory and happened the same so it only happens when doing a fresh syncing


[16-Nov-18 12:44 PM] DG#6934
Also it could be the resources ...because I am also syncing Zilla and Pirate and maybe Zaddex won't sync because my machine cannot take it all three at the time

[18-Nov-18 10:10 PM] DG#6934
This issue  sometimes happens when you select the information of the first transaction made with the wallet in native. It's difficult to reproduce but I have seen it a couple of times.


[19-Nov-18 03:05 AM] ca333#0333
yes - there is some rendering issue. Not only when you selet infos - you can reproduce it with a low spec VM. I did with Ubuntu based machine with only 3 or 4 gb ram  - when launching up first token in native mode this "fade out" or "zoom out" effect or whatever its called will be laggy - like 1 - 2 seconds in the above stage where it doesnt finish the animation.


[19-Nov-18 03:05 AM] ca333#0333
do you mean this behaviour @DG ?


[19-Nov-18 03:06 AM] pbca26#5430
considering ibn is onboard we shouldn't bother with such issues


[19-Nov-18 03:09 AM] DG#6934
Yes exactly the animation won’t be fulfilled and also yes that’s happening in a low end server.


[19-Nov-18 03:11 AM] pbca26#5430
low specs are not welcomed here
electron is quite resource demanding
plus constant cpu utilization from komodod


[19-Nov-18 03:11 AM] pbca26#5430
what about lite, do you experience anything similar?


[19-Nov-18 03:29 AM] ca333#0333
havent tested in lite - but retested on proper computer and no issues at all - thats also why i didnt report this since i knew its spec-based and not a bug.


[19-Nov-18 03:32 AM] pbca26#5430
i will add a settings to turn off heavy animation


[19-Nov-18 03:32 AM] ca333#0333
however, there are tweaking options for node/electron - i remember when i ran the original versions of insight blockexplorer, etc. i wasnt able to get many of them running on the same machine with a low spec VPS. after tweaking v8 startup funcs i got 48 explorers running on the same machine that made problems with 5 explorers. maybe the testers in here could launch it up in various modes to see if there is a diff. keywords you d want to look for are fork mode, cluster mode, v8 thread-limiting, etc.


[19-Nov-18 03:33 AM] ca333#0333
jfyi - maybe this resolves those "issues"


[19-Nov-18 03:33 AM] pbca26#5430

yes, need to rebuild BCH electrum-DB... and that needs RAM... so i have to stop some other electrums, so the servers don't crash with OOM...
here are a lot of public BTC electrums to use:  https://1209k.com/bitcoin-eye/ele.php?chain=btc
i will have to remove some electrums soon... think MAC will be the first, only the wallet consumes up to 5GB RAM, which is totally crazy

yeah that was it, changed exec to spawn and now it works properly


[21-Nov-18 04:09 AM] pbca26#5430
@naezith it likely happened due to std out buffer overflow
komodod is quite chatty


[21-Nov-18 04:36 AM] naezith#9757
@pbca26 is there an elegant way to tell if `komodod` is ready for `komodo-cli` calls like `getinfo`

not that i know of
but what you posted above is a good enough hook to me


[21-Nov-18 04:38 AM] pbca26#5430
you can also tail debug.log for additional info such as if it's reindexing/rescanning

- Claim is working fine
- KMD and other eth/erc20 loading fine

If any one needs some ERC20 coins for testing, I can send

Thanks @Nabob | $ARRR - I have some LOOM and BNB too if anyone want, they still won't load the transaction history for me 🤔

`adb logcat` would be helpful to indentify these bugs

[21-Nov-18 11:55 PM] pbca26#5430
@Nabob | $ARRR you have to pay gas aka eth for every erc20 tx hence the fee and balance info in eth
@Jonathan perhaps it's switching to a different data provider that i haven't whitelisted
need logcat to debug
i've tried to preserve old data format for active coins but it doesn't seem to be working on your end
this is not optimal


[22-Nov-18 09:23 AM] pbca26#5430
@Jonathan are your eth/erc20 balances eq to 0?
if so i know why you had an issue yesterday


[22-Nov-18 11:51 AM] DG#6934
For github report also  , but I think is between Desktop and Mobile

@Jonathan  I think this is what you are experimenting

it happened after a couple of txs


[22-Nov-18 12:25 PM] pbca26#5430
@DG it's impossible to know the issue unless you do adb logcat and provide me with a log


[22-Nov-18 12:26 PM] DG#6934
ok let me check it out


[22-Nov-18 12:31 PM] pbca26#5430
you can get logs on ios but that requires macos and installed xcode
for android you need nothing but phone drivers and adb tools


[22-Nov-18 12:32 PM] pbca26#5430
also, ios logs are hard to understand
at least to me

[23-Nov-18 01:27 AM] pbca26#5430
@SHossain shossain asked me what to look for on build19
the change is specifically to transactions history
best to check it on any active address if you have one
if you don't see any changes then probably either the fix is not working or you just can't tell the difference


[23-Nov-18 01:43 AM] SHossain#0007
the build is working fine for me @pbca26


[23-Nov-18 02:45 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
@pbca26  On my side tx look like this,  https://www.screencast.com/t/wd9jOtAMjuW
I dont see any difference on mine, what am missing here

[23-Nov-18 07:23 AM] pbca26#5430
it doesn't affect self transactions
only those that were split into send + receive
usually that requires multi output


[23-Nov-18 09:28 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
Perfect, transaction algo changes looks good

@pbca26  Just to be in the same ...the requirements to be added to the mobile versions is to pass the vetting process first in the Desktop Wallet right?


[23-Nov-18 12:08 PM] pbca26#5430
as far as lite mode goes it doesn't matter which version is first
it all comes down to making changes to agama-wallet-lib which is used in all 3 agama versions

I'm running my test chain with two nodes, it takes a while before a new order appears for example

@TonyL when you have some time, can you please test the last Android version and get us logcat? that would be great help.


[24-Nov-18 10:53 AM] DG#6934
I tried getting the logcat from  Xcode logs for my iOs version still no result


[24-Nov-18 10:53 AM] DG#6934
could somebody recommend some programs to debug Android and iOS?

[24-Nov-18 10:57 AM] DG#6934
I will keep on trying to get it on iOs but the log is not being displayed with the name of the program it instead displays a general log as sent before not the full one


[24-Nov-18 10:58 AM] DG#6934
Alright I am going to root this later :abusedsmily:


[24-Nov-18 10:58 AM] Jonathan#3687
Yeah the same happened to me with the last one I tried because it wouldn't let me act as a super user


[24-Nov-18 11:11 AM] SHossain#0007
@DG logcat is only for Android


[24-Nov-18 11:48 AM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain Sure. Is there some issue which needs to be reproduced to get logs?

[24-Nov-18 11:54 AM] TonyL#3577
@naezith Orders appears as soon as order placing transaction is mined (usually just next block) so it's a limitation factor in spot of performance speed.
Maybe as a some "hint" solution - if order placed by user display it with some "pending" status to not get him confused


[24-Nov-18 11:56 AM] DG#6934
Yes over here it was the wallet not displaying the transaction history  and on iOS and basically wallet doesn’t load the balance and Nabob already reported a seed bug on Android that doesn’t gives you an error mentioning “i have alpha numeric random seed, when login it fails on agama mobile, 
it says incorrect pin, any one experience same ?
android”


[24-Nov-18 11:57 AM] DG#6934
I will do some testing again to see if I can reproduce it ...I will send my phones specs shortly ... driving right now

We will shut down Travis CI and delete all travis/jenkins related configs and artifacts the coming week. Currently testing Agama buildjob with automated testing. 

A general/basic test-scheme like startup wallet, activate coin/s, send/receive TX on Agama side and launch up daemon, check rpc interface/sync, initiate TX on komodod side is currently being tested on gitlab CI - this should hopefully safe valuable testers time which should not be wasted with this basic sort of user-tests.

BTCH gave me 5 confirmations after like 4 hours ...so it doesn't have the same amount of confirmations as other chains


[27-Nov-18 04:36 PM] Alright#0419
@DG if you need more confirmations, just send more transactions


[27-Nov-18 04:36 PM] Alright#0419
you can force on-demand block chain to mine blocks by sending transactions


[27-Nov-18 04:37 PM] DG#6934
I sent a couple of more but in the wallet they seem they didn't processed later they are all being reflected while using native mode


[27-Nov-18 04:37 PM] DG#6934
all went through but for what I understand of what you are telling ...this could be a normal behavior for BTCH

http://195.201.101.229:9090/public/Agama-linux-x64-v0.2.44-beta-build20.zip
changes:
- upcoming sapling fork support
- 2 new coins SUQA and Bitzec

i've refactored zcash params logic in a way that it will only download missing keys/params now
saving bandwidth and time
lite mode also received sapling fix

post me your suqa or bzc address to get test coins
the latter one looks like a sh*tcoin fork of the latest zcash code base
regardless a person who made a request to add it shared 1.3m coins with me
so there's plenty for testing purposes

Which one you selected, Tried with agama.komodoplatform.com, and its working ok


[28-Nov-18 11:52 AM] DG#6934
worked now...I did a fresh install in a server just to discard...I selected Agama from komodoplatform because in the beginning is directing to veruscoin download...

👍


[28-Nov-18 01:23 PM] pbca26#5430
either of the options should do
also, if you see an updated zcash params modal the 2 coins should be there as well

"@ca333 nabob found an issue with tx from the gitlab build binary ^^"

@SHossain @Nabob | $ARRR was this related to missing groth16 params?


[30-Nov-18 03:11 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
ya i remember earlier i have used verus script to download zcash params, in that groth16 not downloaded which am not aware off


[30-Nov-18 03:36 AM] ca333#0333
if you re using dev/FSM you can just do `./zcutil/fetch-params.sh` @Nabob | $ARRR


[30-Nov-18 03:43 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004

Just to summarise info from table

Gitlab binary crashing on Windows:
```"Daemon  crashed: Assertion failed!

excellent - thanks a lot. so this was a full rpc interface test - correct? @TonyL @SHossain

[02-Dec-18 10:53 AM] ca333#0333
yes i know but that are like aforementioned local env issues - once you reset your dev enviroment or change the target on xcode it will build it fine. that is just related to the xcode setup for ios SDK


[02-Dec-18 10:53 AM] SHossain#0007
notary nodes started updating. we will get reports of bugs from them soon enough if there is any. then, if the code is stable, @jl777c can merge them to master branch and we need to have a Agama build using that.


[02-Dec-18 10:54 AM] ca333#0333

perfect. once we have Agama test build, we will jump on it for testing.


[02-Dec-18 10:57 AM] SHossain#0007
@pbca26 there was a new added parameter for OOT chain the source `-ac_saplinig=5000000`. please update this on Agama for OOT chain when you have time.


[02-Dec-18 11:26 AM] pbca26#5430
does it have any specific activation rules like height or another timestamp @SHossain ?


[02-Dec-18 11:27 AM] SHossain#0007
-ac_sapling=5000000 means sapling will be activated at block height 5 million, which is far in the future. this keeps the chain running backward compatible with sprout.


[02-Dec-18 11:28 AM] SHossain#0007
this option is open for any chain. so far, OOT decided to take this path.


[02-Dec-18 11:29 AM] pbca26#5430
is that the only chain to use it for now?


[02-Dec-18 11:30 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[02-Dec-18 11:32 AM] pbca26#5430

Sent SPLTEST transaction to mobile Agama. With which conditions my balance will became non 0?


[05-Dec-18 05:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems just some amount of confirmations because in ~3 minutes it's reflected on balance


[05-Dec-18 05:10 AM] SHossain#0007
2-3 confirms before it would display


[05-Dec-18 05:10 AM] SHossain#0007
i also sent funds to my mobile. waiting for confs

@SHossain Oh you also have a black stripe on top. Is it a feature?


[05-Dec-18 05:11 AM] SHossain#0007
the blak strip is a bug. some phones has it, some don't

Sent back and forth without problems. 
Only confusing moment is when I've executed "Send" transaction - it was proceed to mempool but it not reflected on my balance and no any "pending" or "awaiting for confirmation" appeared and balance changed / Send transaction appeared only after this transaction confirmed

Scanned qr code from desktop and sent from mobile


[05-Dec-18 05:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah and now when you back on the main page you'll see same balance and only received transaction


[05-Dec-18 05:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Until it's confirmed once


[05-Dec-18 05:17 AM] SHossain#0007
Spv is slow


[05-Dec-18 05:17 AM] SHossain#0007

[05-Dec-18 05:18 AM] TonyL#3577
It's not on SPV side, just feature request actually 😃


[05-Dec-18 05:18 AM] TonyL#3577
So everything seems to  work fine with SPLTEST deposit/withdrawal


[05-Dec-18 05:20 AM] SHossain#0007
nice


[05-Dec-18 05:21 AM] SHossain#0007
actually, the balance is not updated automatically, until you switch coins and come back to SPLTEST chain


[05-Dec-18 05:22 AM] TonyL#3577
I guess it's actual for all coins

if electrum servers are online and working and user don't have network issue, Lite mode should work without issue

Also please if somebody can send me some Sapling test funds  RMsDjiKJW7N31BxaM17MyVx1AX2PnGZYRH I will swap them for some beer test coins 😁


[05-Dec-18 09:56 AM] DG#6934
or also I have some Verus...so it should work the same right? There is no difference between the sapling test coin protocol and the Verus coin as for right now they are both using Sapling .

ARG is going to be deprecated in agama until someone will setup new electrum servers
cipi had multiple issues building their wallet


[05-Dec-18 11:30 AM] SHossain#0007
probably comment out ARG for now until they come looking for it.


[05-Dec-18 11:34 AM] cipi#4502
Sorry, i stopped the ARG electrums because i can't build their wallet any more. Had difficulties in the past too. I think best is to remove ARG. It also consumes quite some RAM on the electrums, which is getting low, so better use the ressources for other coins.

I was syncing SEC and KMDICE at the same time. Both stopped printing stuff, SEC is synced but KMDICE is not. What would cause this? lack of nodes?

I started KMDICE with:
```./komodod -ac_name=KMDICE -ac_supply=10500000 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=144.76.217.232```

Info of both:
SEC: 
``` 
  "blocks": 108369,
  "longestchain": 108369
```

KMDICE:
```
  "blocks": 31699,
  "longestchain": 68626
```


[05-Dec-18 11:39 AM] naezith#9757

KMDICE will take some extra time. This chain has a lot of transactions

I'll tell again when it comes to hang again


[05-Dec-18 12:54 PM] SHossain#0007
my one without restart continuing sync (slowly)


[05-Dec-18 01:08 PM] DG#6934
Doing a syncing from scratch here on Linux will let you know how it goes latest KMD version.


[05-Dec-18 01:15 PM] naezith#9757
31699 again


[05-Dec-18 01:15 PM] naezith#9757
is it something like orphan block or something


[05-Dec-18 01:17 PM] naezith#9757
synced SEC, BEER, PIZZA without any issue


[05-Dec-18 01:25 PM] SHossain#0007
All chain syncs without issue. except for KMDICE which is syncing but slowly


[05-Dec-18 01:25 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe we are connected to a bad peer


[06-Dec-18 02:54 AM] SHossain#0007

This is a very important build and most likely the release candidate for our upcoming major update

[06-Dec-18 03:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Tried to run `SPLTEST` in native mode on MacOS
Daemon not started with error: ```Error: Cannot find the Zcash network parameters in the following directory:
"/Users/antonlysakov/Library/Application Support/ZcashParams"```
But I've downloaded all needed keys by Agama.
I guess there problem is that it's trying to access the Path `/Users/antonlysakov/Library/Application Support/ZcashParams/`
while correct one is `/Users/antonlysakov/Library/Application\ Support/ZcashParams/`

@Yassin It is a downloader for all needed in native mode ZcashParams keys

{Reactions}
👌 

[06-Dec-18 03:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Since Agama detected that some keys are missed for successful native mode start it's invite you to download it and automatically place in needed folder from which daemon started by Agama native mode can get it

@TonyL @Nabob | $ARRR Sapling activation adds extra Zcash params to download, please try to `fetch-params.sh` and then restart.


[06-Dec-18 04:49 AM] TonyL#3577
@artem.pikulin All extra Zcash params are downloaded already on my side


[06-Dec-18 04:50 AM] TonyL#3577
```sapling-output.params  sapling-spend.params  sprout-groth16.params  sprout-proving.key  sprout-verifying.key```


[06-Dec-18 04:51 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Hmm, I have no more idea then 🙂


[06-Dec-18 04:51 AM] TonyL#3577
@Nabob | $ARRR Do you have params in `/root/.zcash-params` ?


[06-Dec-18 04:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Will test on Ubuntu now too


[06-Dec-18 04:56 AM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL SPLTEST chain will not work with this version of Agama


[06-Dec-18 04:57 AM] SHossain#0007
This Agama has unmodified binary from master branch


[06-Dec-18 04:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I see, thanks @SHossain


[06-Dec-18 05:00 AM] SHossain#0007
SPLTEST from PirateNetwork repo helped us testing various aspects of Sapling. Behaviours before sapling activation, after sapling activation and after deadline.


[06-Dec-18 05:00 AM] SHossain#0007
This is a release candidate. So, built from source that would be used by end users 😃


[06-Dec-18 05:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, sapling is not activated in current Agama komodod binary because of default timestamps in `komodo_defs`


[06-Dec-18 05:01 AM] TonyL#3577
It have sense since officially it's activating on Dec 15 😃


[06-Dec-18 05:02 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, this is the official version which end users will use and wait till Dec 15. Sapling will be auto activated in this version.

MacOS agama v0.3.0 syncing remaining blocks fo KMD


[06-Dec-18 05:17 AM] SHossain#0007
will test DION, KMDICE & PIRATE native chain sync under macOS


[06-Dec-18 05:17 AM] SHossain#0007
have anyone tested on Windows?


[06-Dec-18 05:20 AM] TonyL#3577
But isn't sapling activated on PIRATE and KMDICE?


[06-Dec-18 05:21 AM] SHossain#0007
nope. just normal fresh sync test. recently we experienced bad peer issue with KMDICE and DION while fresh sync. yesterday @naezith also had issues with KMDICE sync.


[06-Dec-18 05:22 AM] SHossain#0007
none of these coins has sapling activated. all of them except OOT will get sapling activated automatically on 15th


[06-Dec-18 05:23 AM] SHossain#0007
then, send balance to other addresses, claim reward and other tests needs to be done


[06-Dec-18 05:23 AM] TonyL#3577
I see, thought PIRATE and KMDICE were forked already


[06-Dec-18 05:23 AM] SHossain#0007
nope. official date for everyone is 15th


[06-Dec-18 05:25 AM] SHossain#0007
we are hoping to get more updated komodod binary before the final realease in the next few days.
we  need to test them to see if there is anything broken with these builds

gen?


[06-Dec-18 05:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Just default one


[06-Dec-18 05:39 AM] TonyL#3577
-gen means mining activation - have not much sense for KMD chain


[06-Dec-18 05:39 AM] naezith#9757
what's your dl speed


[06-Dec-18 05:40 AM] TonyL#3577

I have quite bad internet here actually (Kazakhtelecom - Kazakhstan ISP)


[06-Dec-18 05:42 AM] TonyL#3577
I think params were downloaded in 15 minutes or so with speed around 300-400 kbps


[06-Dec-18 05:42 AM] jusoaresf#3291
So I gues mine still broken brcause of download failure


[06-Dec-18 05:42 AM] TonyL#3577
@naezith Synchronisation seems not started yet on your side yet and this red triangle usually means some daemon error


[06-Dec-18 05:43 AM] jusoaresf#3291
did you download from agama.komodo... or other?

I've downloaded from agama.komodo

popped up when I did cmd + shift + I, dunno if it's related


[06-Dec-18 05:45 AM] SHossain#0007
i had issues from agama.komodoplatform.com and zcash directly. didn't work. then used `./zcutil/fetch-params.sh` from source and it worked perfectly


[06-Dec-18 05:45 AM] naezith#9757
I also went with  agama.komodoplatform.com


[06-Dec-18 05:45 AM] TonyL#3577
So seems I get lucky 😃


[06-Dec-18 05:45 AM] naezith#9757
is there a way I can help with this


[06-Dec-18 05:45 AM] SHossain#0007
@naezith clone komodo source and use the command line to fetch params.


[06-Dec-18 05:46 AM] naezith#9757
I have it already actually @SHossain


[06-Dec-18 05:46 AM] naezith#9757
but it's couple weeks old


[06-Dec-18 05:46 AM] jusoaresf#3291
now i see... four little progress bars... apparently one for each parameter... they start and vanish befor completing


[06-Dec-18 05:46 AM] jusoaresf#3291
on windows?


[06-Dec-18 05:47 AM] SHossain#0007
@naezith your debug screenshot shows daemon is complaining about missing params


[06-Dec-18 05:47 AM] TonyL#3577
@jusoaresf Yes, you have to wait till these progress bars completed


[06-Dec-18 05:47 AM] naezith#9757
yeah will run ./zcutil/fetch-params.sh now


[06-Dec-18 05:47 AM] TonyL#3577
And you'll see the message that params succesfully fetched and you can close modal window


[06-Dec-18 05:47 AM] jusoaresf#3291
yes... they just vanish and the modal says all done and verified but next attempt bring same error


[06-Dec-18 05:48 AM] naezith#9757
@SHossain ```
MacBook-Air:komodo naezith$ ./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
Zcash - fetch-params.sh

This script will fetch the Zcash zkSNARK parameters and verify their
integrity with sha256sum.

If they already exist locally, it will exit now and do nothing else.
MacBook-Air:komodo naezith$ 
```


[06-Dec-18 05:48 AM] SHossain#0007
then, if your daemon is not starting, best is to restart your computer and try again


[06-Dec-18 05:49 AM] jusoaresf#3291
ok


[06-Dec-18 05:49 AM] SHossain#0007

don't run agama on VPS if you don't have good enough spec

@ca333 please get us a new version of Agama when you are ready


[06-Dec-18 06:47 AM] jusoaresf#3291
ok... trying to download sprout-groth16 it says 692 mb but download ends on about 5 mb...
I am getting corrupted files
Can it be a server config issue?
or something droping it on my router?


[06-Dec-18 06:48 AM] jusoaresf#3291
probably same is happening on Agama or on https directly


[06-Dec-18 06:49 AM] DG#6934
KMD synced completely on Linux with this new version..


[06-Dec-18 06:50 AM] pbca26#5430
@SHossain give me a few min to verify the fix


[06-Dec-18 06:50 AM] SHossain#0007
Sure. Thanks 😃


[06-Dec-18 06:52 AM] jusoaresf#3291
is there another place I could download from?


[06-Dec-18 06:52 AM] jusoaresf#3291
sprout-groth16.params ?


[06-Dec-18 06:54 AM] jusoaresf#3291
oh... sprout-proving.key is way smaller than yours too... there is something dropping my download requests


[06-Dec-18 06:57 AM] DG#6934
just in case I had the download of the zcash params directly from the CLI installation if I am not mistaken...maybe that's why I didn't faced this issue


[06-Dec-18 06:59 AM] SHossain#0007
@jusoaresf until the next  version with fix, you can use the Verus version of Agama and that will download the params. i have done that few weeks back


[06-Dec-18 07:00 AM] SHossain#0007
temp solution 😃


[06-Dec-18 07:01 AM] jusoaresf#3291
it seems some network thing... I was trying to donwload through the browser and it also aborts the download saying it had completed


[06-Dec-18 07:02 AM] jusoaresf#3291
I will wait... was just testing for you. don't actually need it to run right now


[06-Dec-18 07:02 AM] SHossain#0007
Thanks very much. In that case, please wait until we have a new release.

was wondering - plz ping me when master is in "final" sync @SHossain 
i ll then trigger a rebuild


[06-Dec-18 07:12 AM] naezith#9757
I had them before testing agama for first time. opening agama started fetching params but it broke those. then neither agama nor komodod worked

@ca333 do you remember the Agama CLI responses displaying same message again and again? it is still happening


[06-Dec-18 10:50 AM] SHossain#0007
just tested with `listtransactions` and it kept producing the same output


[06-Dec-18 10:51 AM] SHossain#0007
happens with any other call as well

shall i default to veruscoin just to be on a safe side?

we have 4 confirmations that our one is working. i guess we can keep our one as default. if there is any issue with end-user, support team can suggest to change repo

yes, i had issues too from same source


[07-Dec-18 01:46 PM] ca333#0333
(i am using a good ISP with netconn directly at the cities backbone)


[07-Dec-18 01:47 PM] ca333#0333
so its most likely our file-hosting provider - zcash src worked fine 2 times.


[07-Dec-18 01:47 PM] ca333#0333
agama failed 3 times


[07-Dec-18 01:48 PM] ca333#0333
if users complain we just recommend them to use zcash src


[07-Dec-18 01:48 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, i guess we need to tell users to change link


[07-Dec-18 01:48 PM] ca333#0333
and would be good to find out the cause of this problemn


[07-Dec-18 01:48 PM] SHossain#0007
if they run into issue


[07-Dec-18 01:49 PM] ca333#0333
like contacting the data hosting service and telling them our problem


[07-Dec-18 01:49 PM] ca333#0333
i get a EOF when downloading from our own sources


[07-Dec-18 01:49 PM] ca333#0333
that means the servers tells my download-client that the file is finished/downloaded completely


[07-Dec-18 01:50 PM] ca333#0333
btw - other than this "issue" everything worked fine on my end

[08-Dec-18 04:31 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. thanks for confirming


[08-Dec-18 04:32 AM] SHossain#0007
Please if you can, compile from jl777/komodo master branch and test


[08-Dec-18 04:32 AM] SHossain#0007
not with Agama


[08-Dec-18 04:32 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004

@Nabob | $ARRR a fix just been pushed. please pull new source again


[08-Dec-18 04:49 AM] SHossain#0007
@everyone Any future KMD test, we always need to make sure that we check timestamp of the tx we did. `locktime` is very important for KMD and we need to make sure that it is correct at all times. Thanks for testing.


[08-Dec-18 04:59 AM] SHossain#0007
This bug is confirmed fixed now.

Hi @TonyL  so if understand it correctly you can test each call in a separate line automatically that’s very cool 😄


[08-Dec-18 07:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @DG ! Yes, I'll just ask script to call `komodo-cli` with needed args and save output

T to Z address to worked - CLI error not present - Kmdice still loading and waiting some minutes for reward  claiming in native .


[08-Dec-18 11:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Is it some komodod version rollback? Before was 0.3.1, 0.3.2 and now 0.3.0
Confused a little bit - is it cli calls tested komodod version now or not 😃


[08-Dec-18 11:41 AM] DG#6934

 nope - komodo
I guess third number in 0.3.1 and 0.3.2 was some pre-release mark and 0.3.0 is RC or it's a version which was before 0.3.1 and 0.3.2 🤔

hmmm yes is 3.0


[08-Dec-18 12:10 PM] ca333#0333
yes we rolled it back to 0.3.0 - we never did any public release with 0.3.x and Agama was baptized with 0.3.0 for this major upgrade release. so we figured it might make sense to do the same with komodod

i think that the `set publickey` is not actually starting the daemon with `-pubkey=` parameter next time you start the wallet.

Unable to copy Pub Key will resync again on Linux to see if it persists. Has only happened in this OS.

The windows file is launching the wallet directly, it isn't deleting previous versions like before. Was that intended?

I don't think so...this versions for Windows seems to be an application...portable.

I guess is better than Ubuntu


[10-Dec-18 01:42 PM] TonyL#3577
@DG RHEL distros (CentOS based on RHEL) are positioning "like more enterprise and stable", while Ubuntu (based on Debian) more user friendly, community oriented 
So it's hard to say actually that one is better or not - they are just players in a little bit different niches
You'll find first demonstration of "user frendliness" even when installing both distros on your let say VirtualBox:
Ubuntu will configure interface automatically, in CentOS you need to declare DNS servers manually in interface config before internet start work


[10-Dec-18 01:43 PM] TonyL#3577
In some large corporation you'll most probably find some RHEL distro over the Debian one


[10-Dec-18 01:47 PM] DG#6934

I think there is a possible bug ...in Native version of Agama...but an edge case maybe...a user was trying to send his funds to one address that was also inside of his wallet.


[10-Dec-18 04:36 PM] DG#6934
He was trying to send his balance from


[10-Dec-18 04:37 PM] DG#6934

[10-Dec-18 04:38 PM] DG#6934
His last transaction that went through was made in the Lite mode version...native didn't worked


[10-Dec-18 04:39 PM] DG#6934
he tried sending his whole 542 balance to the RSt address and it didn't went through and then a later transaction for 11 kmd...and i didn't went through either because they seem to appear but the balance was never changed in the RGF49ZQi9ubm4BUckJzCpH2CLnQhcuFezq  address


[10-Dec-18 04:39 PM] DG#6934
the last transaction of that went through of 542 was the one done in lite mode


[10-Dec-18 04:41 PM] DG#6934
Apparently the explorer is showing the destination address sending the amount from the  senders address RGF49ZQi9ubm4BUckJzCpH2CLnQhcuFezq  and the balance didn't changed in the senders address as well.


[10-Dec-18 04:44 PM] Jonathan#3687
He had KMD native and lite active at the same time?


[10-Dec-18 04:45 PM] DG#6934
no he was in native...I recommended him to export the wif and to send in lite mode and it worked.


[10-Dec-18 04:45 PM] Jonathan#3687
Ah ok


[10-Dec-18 04:46 PM] DG#6934
yeah very strange indeed...is like if the other address didn't existed while on native mode


[10-Dec-18 04:47 PM] DG#6934
the receiving address reflected a transaction as if it was sending your whole balance to yourself but still the balance in the actual sender address wasn't updated

Z transactions working on all versions.../ CLI is working fine as well / ETH logout issue is not there double checked just in case / made tx between addresses inside the wallet and outside of the wallet had no issue as reported in the previous bug/  for nothing in particular everything else seems to be working fine..advanced features...no wallet freezing or blank screen ...just a little lateness in the Windows version updating balances...but a rescan helped with that.

Centos used a lot.  Redhat certification is popular.  If you can find geographic data, I think you’ll find centos v.popular in USA.  Redhat has a full suite of software products and consulting.  They created a lot of database software used in enterprise java, object relational mappers (ORM).
yum is easier to use than apt-get imo.  The system is laid out much simpler.  It’s popularity in certification world of MCSEs wanting to get Linux training .  Start up (init scripts) much easier.  SELinux was a defence project, some military grade certification, redhat has, therefore centos too although unofficial.  And a looooooong support cycle of 7 years.

The Linux portable komodod is a winner of a package put out by this dev team.  I’d like to use it more 

End rant.  Get off my lawn 😄

Only tricky thing is similar to Windows - icon adding to Launchpad but because it's unsigned (I guess) this Launchpad icon will not work until user go to Applications -> two fingers click on Agama and then confirm that he want to run application from unknown source

not optimal as it's better to merge into one output

@ca333 the Linux .deb 3.1 version doesn't say komodod but different when running a coin

[12-Dec-18 04:55 AM] ca333#0333
yes it does run out of a precombiled binary @SHossain for efficiency reasons


[12-Dec-18 04:55 AM] ca333#0333
so even the execs like komodod and the libs arent visible as such in the package


[12-Dec-18 04:55 AM] ca333#0333
its an asar archive that runs in the chromium sandbox (=electron)


[12-Dec-18 04:56 AM] ca333#0333
not a normal directory, etc.


[12-Dec-18 04:56 AM] ca333#0333
this is often done for obfuscation and to prevent easy code-reviews

@TonyL @Nabob | $ARRR 
can you give it a try?
bcbc should automatically be removed from coins list when you load new version
btg balance on overview should display as 0 instead of NaN
i and cipi checked btg electrums all of them are dead
lets a wait a bit if they won't wake up btg is going to be temp disabled in the next version


[12-Dec-18 07:18 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
Now i can see balance displayed,  if we still have faulty spv coins like btg, but observed, coins which has zero balance shown as n/a instead 0
overview error fixed

For a fresh wallet have n/a balance now for all coins, but total balance is 0 now, not NaN

should be 0 for alive coins and n/a for any coins with dead servers

Just noticed that Chainzilla default electrum is down (second one is working if switch manually)

So it might be a useful feature in future - connect other electrum from list if 1st is down

and, if you have a Ledger and want to claim reward, also follow this guide along with the above https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000026855-how-to-retrieve-kmd-private-key-from-a-ledger-nano-s-using-agama

[12-Dec-18 03:35 PM] DG#6934
interesting will try the ledger guide... I just signed the transaction with my full balance...I will have to wait an hour to push it...and try again with Ledger


[12-Dec-18 03:36 PM] SHossain#0007
you even don't need a Ledger device


[12-Dec-18 03:37 PM] SHossain#0007
these guides doesn't use the actual device at all. it only uses the 24 words passphrase and the address where the funds are

HEX is the raw transction value

If I do a rawtransaction claiming my own reward the HEX can take all the decimals of my balance...or only till certain amount?


[13-Dec-18 01:45 AM] naezith#9757
here is a typo, 750000000 value has to be 75000000 instead to be 75% https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/assetchain-params.html#ac-decay


[13-Dec-18 02:49 AM] naezith#9757
CC  in  -ac_cc  is short for  Crypto-Conditions Network or Cross-Chain Network?
`This is the network cluster on which the chain can interact with other chains via cross chain smart contracts. `


[13-Dec-18 03:17 AM] pbca26#5430
wow much bugs!
time to look into a different type of a fix for this long term issue


[13-Dec-18 03:40 AM] gcharang#6833
@naezith `-ac-cc` parameter controls 1)enabling of crypto-conditions based smart contracts and also 2)enables cross chain smart contracts
for different ranges of values of the parameter.


[13-Dec-18 03:41 AM] naezith#9757
yes, the reason I'm asking is that I need to put a nice name for that like here

[13-Dec-18 03:52 AM] gcharang#6833
@naezith my suggestion would be to name the parameter as sth like `Network Cluster`  and add a hyperlink to: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-cc in the description

Also this is the info that is relevant to that parameter
```
* A chain with -ac_cc=N with N > 0, will have CC active
* If N is 1, then it just enables CC
* if N is >= 2 and <= 100, it allows for non-fungible cross chain contracts within all the chains with the same N value
* if N >= 101, then it forms a cluster of all the chains with the same N value where the base tokens in all the chains in that cluster are fungible via the burn protocol
``` 
Names of things are ultimately marketiing's ballgame. So just before the app needs to go out there will be a feedback session that involves the whole team  I think

@pbca26 by default, Agama for Pirate chain doesn't show sapling address, even it has funds in there until i use the slider button to **Show all addresses**


[15-Dec-18 06:14 AM] SHossain#0007
it does show sprout zc addresses


[15-Dec-18 07:38 AM] SHossain#0007
@Nabob | $ARRR @DG @Angelina @Jonathan If any user report that Komodo native mode is stuck sync, please advise them to backup wallet.dat and privkeys first, then delete current data dir except only `wallet.dat and komodo.conf` and start sync from scratch. This seems to solve the issue of stuck nodes that are not syncing.

no worries!


[17-Dec-18 07:28 AM] ca333#0333
i figured that when using XZ utils i was able to reduce the archive size by a few MB...


[17-Dec-18 07:29 AM] siu#3920
yes, noticed that, also my file manager was not recognizing the format so i had to manually select the app. Thanks.

i use xubuntu


[17-Dec-18 07:38 AM] siu#3920
anyway, all is ok now. Also i fixed EQL spv servers. Their lite wallet should be running now.


[17-Dec-18 07:41 AM] ca333#0333
on a sidenote (ref ubuntu based distros) - i have used Lubuntu just a day ago for a quick monitoring/debugging setup and was looking for something really lightweight/quick - i really recommend it. Its running VERY smooth compared to a full "original" Ubuntu installation on the same machine.

linux is ok, i can confirm.

pirate synced fine completely from 0 block in my ubuntu 18.04


[17-Dec-18 09:28 AM] siu#3920
restart worked... seems i just lost connection.


[17-Dec-18 09:29 AM] siu#3920
so, just generating a new address in agama and moving pirate there should be all i need to not lose them?

There may be a simple GUI in the coming days


[17-Dec-18 09:45 AM] siu#3920
the guide is missing the sapling address generation step


[17-Dec-18 09:45 AM] siu#3920
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_getnewaddress sapling
```


[17-Dec-18 09:55 AM] SHossain#0007
you dont' need to use `sapling` to generate a sapling z addr. it is automatic by using only `./komodo-cli -ac_name=PIRATE z_getnewaddress` . i'll report to them


[17-Dec-18 09:57 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, the guide is missing sapling addr gen command there

@phideas were you trying to send from t to old z address (zc) ?

Still the process of migrating your Z funds to a T address and then to a Sapling address can't be done in the GUI right?

Yeah there is a difference in the amounts in my address between the electrum server and the node


[19-Dec-18 08:16 PM] DG#6934
so that could be the reason of the error


[19-Dec-18 09:33 PM] DG#6934
Update...Linux / Windows and Mac all synced from scratch...haven't seen any major issue with this release 👌

```satinders-MacBook-Pro:Komodo satinder$ komodod -daemon
call komodo_args.(komodod) NOTARY_PUBKEY.()
initialized  at 1545640533
Before starting komodod, you need to create a configuration file:
/Users/satinder/Library/Application Support/Komodo/Komodo.conf
It can be completely empty! That indicates you are happy with the default
configuration of komodod. But requiring a configuration file to start ensures
that komodod won't accidentally compromise your privacy if there was a default
option you needed to change.

You can look at the example configuration file for suggestions of default
options that you may want to change. It should be in one of these locations,
depending on how you installed Komodo:
- Source code:  contrib/debian/examples/komodo.conf
- .deb package: /usr/share/doc/komodo/examples/komodo.conf

[27-Dec-18 04:16 AM] pbca26#5430
the issue is still the same
@ca333 can you double check that postinstall script runs after npm install?
lets try one more time
if it doesn't work the only way is to fallback to electron v3


[27-Dec-18 04:17 AM] ca333#0333
sure - i will do a rebuild with manual postinstall proc call


[27-Dec-18 04:17 AM] ca333#0333
@SHossain no perms shouldnt be messed - plz compare to past builds and let me know if permissions changed from back there - for example 0.3.2a


[27-Dec-18 04:18 AM] ca333#0333
but i am pretty sure nothing changed ref. permissions


[27-Dec-18 04:19 AM] ca333#0333
how comes OSX version works fine while linux/win are broken?


[27-Dec-18 04:19 AM] ca333#0333
@SHossain  did last build work on OSX? (before we added postinstall)


[27-Dec-18 04:19 AM] ca333#0333
0.3.2a


[27-Dec-18 04:20 AM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 the permissions matches with the old portable. what i wanted to mean is all files shows `-rwxrwxrwx`, even the txt file and html


[27-Dec-18 04:22 AM] ca333#0333
change the permissions to 755 (if thats enough) - rearchive it - upload it to your github and check the permissions again after downloading it

👍🏽 

[27-Dec-18 04:23 AM] ca333#0333
does by any chance the user you are extracting Agama have root permission @SHossain


[27-Dec-18 04:23 AM] ca333#0333
i could bet this is the case....


[27-Dec-18 04:23 AM] SHossain#0007
nope. just my normal user


[27-Dec-18 04:24 AM] ca333#0333
i see - let me know what the result is


[27-Dec-18 04:24 AM] ca333#0333
i ll check my umask on the build server


[27-Dec-18 04:25 AM] ca333#0333
it should be using --no-same-permission for the archive routine


[27-Dec-18 04:25 AM] SHossain#0007
this is a test build by pbca26. file perms seems good

can anybody confirm - 0.3.2a & -b OSX was working fine in SPV? only WIN/Linux is screwed?


[27-Dec-18 04:42 AM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 0.3.2a SPV mode works on macOS and Linux


[27-Dec-18 04:43 AM] SHossain#0007
the latest Win build doesn't fix the SPV issue


[27-Dec-18 04:43 AM] ca333#0333
ok seems we ll have to rollback to electrum v3


[27-Dec-18 04:44 AM] ca333#0333
@SHossain do we have additional debug info?


[27-Dec-18 04:44 AM] ca333#0333
ref. windows issue - i ve seen the 500 error code response


[27-Dec-18 04:44 AM] ca333#0333
do we have any further infos?


[27-Dec-18 04:46 AM] SHossain#0007
nope


[27-Dec-18 04:46 AM] SHossain#0007
i  see that 500 error in my dev console


[27-Dec-18 04:49 AM] ca333#0333
ok i see - well 500 err code can mean like 10000 diff. things


[27-Dec-18 04:51 AM] ca333#0333
do you have a windows machine with nodejs/npm installed @SHossain ?


[27-Dec-18 04:51 AM] ca333#0333
or anybody else?


[27-Dec-18 04:51 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, i have


[27-Dec-18 04:51 AM] ca333#0333
nice - can you run Agama in dev mode there plz


[27-Dec-18 04:51 AM] ca333#0333
in will spit out the precise errors


[27-Dec-18 04:51 AM] ca333#0333
explicit err defs will hopefully help us resolve this quickly


[27-Dec-18 05:01 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
linux and windows used portable versions, will get you details enabling dev mode


[27-Dec-18 05:07 AM] pbca26#5430
i don't get how other devs don't see missing hash functions
it's quite a bug


[27-Dec-18 05:08 AM] pbca26#5430
btw nam reproduced exactly the same results

you can dump a log by visiting this url http://localhost:17777/api/log/runtime/dump
i'm going to add a GUIfied option

@pbca26 its because other devs just do "npm install CIPHER_or_crypto_package"... no one cares or questions such steps.

👋  Nobody here has experienced any issue while loading Pirate with Mac OSX 10.14 right?


[27-Dec-18 09:45 AM] DG#6934
Loads till 100 % here in 10.12


[27-Dec-18 10:05 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
@DG Loaded chain on 10.14, so far no issues


[27-Dec-18 10:06 AM] DG#6934
thanks yeah wanted to confirm


[27-Dec-18 01:10 PM] DG#6934
I was mining some ZEX and when I switched to the new version of the wallet 0.3.2a on my Linux mining machine ...it generated another address...I then switched...to the old version of the wallet and I am waiting to sync it...I already validated that the address "ismine" and have the private key so no issue, but the strange thing is that it generated a new main address and the other one didn't appeared


[27-Dec-18 01:43 PM] ca333#0333
plz retest and try to reproduce the above case @everyone


[27-Dec-18 01:44 PM] ca333#0333
@DG so you ran ZEX in native mode once in 0.3.x (old version) when you had address X and then you ran ZEX in native mode in 0.3.2a and it did show you a different main addr?


[27-Dec-18 01:44 PM] ca333#0333
is this correct?


[27-Dec-18 01:46 PM] DG#6934
yes I had the past version previous one from 0.3.2a the strange thing was the it showed ismine true...I reviewed the logs in my terminal to see if I had erased the wallet.dat or something but not only the blocks and chainstate when I tried to do a resync some days before


[27-Dec-18 01:47 PM] DG#6934
I am trying to reproduce it again


[27-Dec-18 01:49 PM] Jonathan#3687
I'll try on windows


[27-Dec-18 01:50 PM] Alright#0419
@DG can you explain a bit further? I don't quite understand the issue


[27-Dec-18 01:50 PM] Alright#0419
The wallet doesn't own an address that it should?


[27-Dec-18 01:51 PM] DG#6934
yes exactly


[27-Dec-18 01:52 PM] DG#6934
I was seeing my address with no issues since like 3 days ago in the weekend...


[27-Dec-18 01:52 PM] DG#6934
I launched 3.2a yesterday and it generated a new address...and now it says "ismine" false


[27-Dec-18 01:53 PM] DG#6934
address nowhere to be seen...I checked in the logs of my terminal...the wallet.dat was never touched...and I confirmed it was the same address because I saw my balance in the previous version....


[27-Dec-18 01:54 PM] DG#6934
it's the previous Linux version that said 2.44 in the top ...but it had to the 3.2 update already running


[27-Dec-18 01:55 PM] Alright#0419
@ca333 do you know which commit I could build from to match each of those builds?


[27-Dec-18 01:55 PM] Alright#0419
seems more of a daemon issue than GUI


[27-Dec-18 01:56 PM] DG#6934
could a wallet.dat be altered in that way with a change of the daemon?


[27-Dec-18 01:57 PM] DG#6934
I am going to run some other nodes just in case


[27-Dec-18 01:57 PM] Alright#0419
not likely


[27-Dec-18 01:57 PM] Alright#0419
but less likely that it has anything to do with GUI. There's no real way to even delete an address from a wallet.dat


[27-Dec-18 01:58 PM] DG#6934
I am trying to see if I can see more logs about that folder...but the last thing I have in the terminal is rm -r of blocks and chainstate nothing more


[27-Dec-18 02:01 PM] Alright#0419
sure you didn't do something like `rm -r blocks *` or something along those lines?


[27-Dec-18 02:06 PM] DG#6934
no only rm -r blocks and rm -r chainstate...but even after that this weekend I saw the balance.


[27-Dec-18 02:07 PM] DG#6934
so everything was cool until I updated...the one thing I forgot mentioning is that the syncing after updating was of the wallet displaying a fully 100% synced but at 2000 blocks loaded


[27-Dec-18 02:07 PM] DG#6934
and it progressed like this without verifying the blocks...


[27-Dec-18 02:08 PM] DG#6934
it just showed the synced chain and the blocks were still being loaded


[27-Dec-18 02:09 PM] ca333#0333
exactly - like @Alright stated, this has normaly nothing to do with GUI at all - but since it showed you your real address after launching the old version it could be GUI related? can you confirm this please: when you downgrade from 0.3.2b back to the old version you again see your old address?


[27-Dec-18 02:11 PM] Alright#0419
@DG did you happen to have z addresses in the wallet? With or without funds?


[27-Dec-18 02:11 PM] Alright#0419
that's the only change I see done to ZEX, ac_public after deadline, but it shouldn't have had any effect yet


[27-Dec-18 02:13 PM] DG#6934
for Zaddex no...that wallet was just used for Zaddex...and to CA333s question ...no after I switched back the address was not displayed..., I couldn't believe it also so I went to the CLI and used the command validateaddress and it said ismine true....and now I checked again and it says...false heheh ...I am switching back and forth to see if I can reproduce at least the address validation


[27-Dec-18 02:15 PM] DG#6934
the last time I saw my balance was on Christmas...and that wallet was not really used for anything else until yesterdays update ... I was just trying to update to the latest release... but for now no issue because I had this private key saved...


[27-Dec-18 02:17 PM] DG#6934
....it said ismine true but it didn't had finished syncing...


[27-Dec-18 02:18 PM] ca333#0333
well if the above case is what happened to you then we have a serious issue


[27-Dec-18 02:18 PM] DG#6934
then I restarted the wallet is false...and it keeps giving the  the different address


[27-Dec-18 02:18 PM] ca333#0333
we had a similar case in the past - tracked it down to a gui specific issue


[27-Dec-18 02:18 PM] DG#6934
If you like I can give access to the machine for the logs to be checked just in case not sure it can help


[27-Dec-18 02:19 PM] ca333#0333
i wasnt able to reproduce unfortunately


[27-Dec-18 02:20 PM] DG#6934
I am going to launch Beer and Pizza to see if this happens again , update: I am doing a final test with Pirate...I know i had some imported addresses in this linux machine...they should at least show the transaction history.


[28-Dec-18 10:46 AM] cipi#4502
do we still need the SPLTEST electrums or can i shut them down to save some RAM?


[28-Dec-18 11:36 AM] DG#6934
Well just to give an update...Pirate addresses also didn't appeared I have never touched Pirate...this machine is my guinea pig machine...so no worries it's just for testing...my guess is that because of maybe some type of bug in my machine something happened...it could be that  the wallet.dat files are new...or got overwritten...I am taking all the wallet.dats of my test coins and copying them in a second machine and will sync both machines to verify if the addresses are the same...because after I launch the daemon...it starts everything as it was the first time launching the coin...and shows this type of synced 100% view

Interesting problem w address.  Funnily with an address I used for a tech Tuesday 2 months ago, it comes up different now and I can’t access funds.  It might be pebkac error because the privkey might not be correct length, and agama exports a different one.

I will dbl check my issue again in case it is not pebkac


[28-Dec-18 04:53 PM] DG#6934

For now everything seems ok, Claimed rewards in Lite mode no issue. Waiting a few for native mode. I used the Offline Signing and Push of TX tool with a ledger generated address  worked fine but in one ocassion it gave me a rejection by the network rules...but I think it can be my end maybe my PC clock was not configured right....

@pbca26 Suggestion :  while reinstalling Agama wallet it is defaultly select uninstall option, where as all users usually no way using that option. Can you make reinstall as default option ? this will help grandmas alot.

I have seen some users on Agama who selected all check boxes and lose there funds with their own ignorance.

>I have seen some users on Agama who selected all check boxes and lose there funds with their own ignorance.
perhaps it's better to remove the first checkbox then
there's not much garbage that's going to be left in agama data folder


[30-Dec-18 08:55 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
ah, that helps even better, grandma is happy


[30-Dec-18 09:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Or if more possible make a list of files, folder and recursive delete only those from komodo data folder and subfolders, leaving wallet.dat there in all cases.


[30-Dec-18 09:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Okay, more on this 
Maybe also add recursive backup of wallet.dat files option in that uninstall options


[30-Dec-18 09:17 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
I agree with @grewalsatinder  i have seen on some other bitcoin based wallets, where they use feature  "periodic wallet backups". It will generate wallet.dat files with date time stamp.

This helps users to take benefit instead of having only one original file

I think we have a donation address but nobody knows about it


[31-Dec-18 03:30 AM] ca333#0333
i ve removed the "Delete user data" field for sake of clarity - but for your info everyone - the "Delete user data" field never touched the komodo data dir - it was only deleting `$appdata/Agama`


[31-Dec-18 03:31 AM] ca333#0333
so if users claimed that they lost their wallet.dat due to this option i can confirm that its not possible.

@DG thanks for taking care of user jasonabis query.

There were two important steps there.  User said “I just don’t want to lose funds” (so there’s a wallet.dat backup scenario, for dev portal faq/help I can add)

Also, the git workflow.   User git clone the repo, but repo was already there.  Usually fixed by a git pull to get the updates, but depends on the users level of git confidence sometimes it is confusing (especially when user previously states “they just don’t want to lose funds”).  User seems to be unaware the src dir and wallet.dat are two different things, no need to panic or be confused.

If existing repo is there, can rename the directory, eg mv ~/komodo ~/komodo-old then do a fresh git clone.

Was good to read the enthusiasm of user and to see where they get confused or lack of awareness what they are doing.

Handy for faq for devs.  Devs don’t like admitting when they are wrong or don’t know and like “flying blind”, which I’m trying to avoid in the structure of dealing with this type of user 😄

@here just an announcement. 
A new QT wallet for KMD that uses existing running daemon. It can also connect to remote daemon. Thanks to @Decker and ZCASH team. It was released in November 2018 by ZCash team and now ported for KMD by Decker. I've done some testing on it. Very solid and fast wallet. Basic things are easy enough to perform. No release build available yet. Need to compile locally (qt5 needed) if you want to run now. Not mandetory to test and please don't announce it to public until it is fully tested and we have release build available.
Source (`komodo` branch) : https://github.com/DeckerSU/zec-qt-wallet/tree/komodo

P.S.: It doesn't show KMD reward amount yet.

@Decker one nice thing about this QT wallet is, that you can run both Agama KMD native mode and this QT wallet at the same time. both uses the same daemon :)
also, sending funds from z addr to t addr operation status picked up by Agama

Hey guys, passcombo has a list of about 7 or 8 enhancements for Agama. Most look like simple enough features (sorting and filtering). @pbca26 I can split this up in GH if you want or can make one issue with the doc link. Thoughts? https://docs.google.com/document/d/14W6ecRr8PsSjpMDEToRCjzBO12MR0YnmN5WxiMdkB4U/edit

@Jonathan the first one is normal and not a bug. when an user have 1000 in 1 utxo and send 500 from there, the full balance will be unconfirmed state until it is confirmed.

The only thing is that on Mac for some reason they don't activate the best chain...will reboot the machine to discard the issue

On Macos:  KMD and it chains not even starting as already highligted by @DG 
also observed, debug.log not even creating while launching kmd -- https://www.screencast.com/t/jphscDDBlW

On Linux, Pirate when launched from shortcuts, wallet gets crashed. normally if we add pirate chain, works

Hi @cipi when you have a little time please check the electrum servers for KMD I have been receiving mixed responses sometimes it works while others it doesn't both servers tested.


[08-Jan-19 03:18 PM] DG#6934
other users experiencing the same as well.


[08-Jan-19 03:21 PM] cipi#4502
i monitor the electrums with nagios and they look good: http://olebr6e22lght5m4.onion/cgi-bin/icinga/status.cgi?servicegroup=KMD&style=detail (guest/guest)
connectivity checks from AWS also look good
i updated the komodod recently and there was a lot of load on the servers for one hour or so, maybe it was that

hehe ok ok yeah it makes sense...

I would like to do a throwback...when was encryption of the seed made mandatory?


[09-Jan-19 10:49 AM] DG#6934
in which version of the wallet 2.43d?


[09-Jan-19 10:52 AM] SHossain#0007
v0.2.32

it was improved on v0.2.36


[09-Jan-19 10:53 AM] DG#6934
thanks @SHossain  this will come in hand when dealing with users with seed errors

{Reactions}
👍🏽 

[09-Jan-19 11:02 AM] Angelina#6231
@pbca26 we've got loads of users who at first login after generating the seed   enter their password in the Seed field. 
So then, when they enter actual seed in the seed field, they, of course, see a completely different address. 

Any chance we could visually split two login options?


[09-Jan-19 11:04 AM] DG#6934
I can see that happening people not knowing that a password is not a seed


[09-Jan-19 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, this mistake happened to a lot of users


[09-Jan-19 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
if we visually separate them, it will be reduced


[09-Jan-19 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
nice idea @Angelina


[09-Jan-19 11:07 AM] pbca26#5430
how about temp disabling wif/seed access at all if create wallet was used with seed encryption?
this should limit options to just one for newbies
temporary is until logout/app quit triggered


[09-Jan-19 11:08 AM] SHossain#0007
probably, separate the sections for seed and PIN using a box or lines?


[09-Jan-19 11:09 AM] SHossain#0007
and put a notice to the user when they encrypt the seed where to use it


[09-Jan-19 11:09 AM] pbca26#5430
okay


[09-Jan-19 11:10 AM] SHossain#0007
one guy encrypted seed and used in the password on login box to receive 17,000 KMD. he couldn't access them and said we have bug in our app 😄


[09-Jan-19 11:10 AM] SHossain#0007
i got him access in the end.


[09-Jan-19 11:12 AM] DG#6934
oh wow


[09-Jan-19 11:13 AM] DG#6934
either way good feedback all...thanks @Angelina  for the thowback idea  knowing exact which version had this implemented helps a bit in knowing which exact scenario the user has.


[09-Jan-19 08:31 PM] DG#6934
Has anybody experimented constant daemon crashing in Windows or Linux builds?


[09-Jan-19 08:56 PM] Alright#0419
@DG do you have any prints from it


[09-Jan-19 08:56 PM] Alright#0419
is it on-demand chains crashing?


[09-Jan-19 08:57 PM] DG#6934
for now it was just komodo...I have been able to keep it going but it crashes eventually still works and is loading blocks...but seems strange to be crashing so much in v4core vps


[09-Jan-19 08:58 PM] Alright#0419
do you know how to get a backtrace?


[09-Jan-19 08:58 PM] DG#6934
a backtrace from terminal?


[09-Jan-19 08:59 PM] DG#6934
no ...I will try to get the error log is if crashes again


[09-Jan-19 09:00 PM] Alright#0419
install gdb then start the daemon with `gdb --args ./komodod -ac_name=... ... ...`


[09-Jan-19 09:00 PM] Alright#0419
then type `run` into the gdb terminal


[09-Jan-19 09:00 PM] Alright#0419
wait for it to crash then type `backtrace` into the terminal


[09-Jan-19 09:00 PM] Alright#0419
and post that output please


[09-Jan-19 09:01 PM] Alright#0419
are you using a packaged build or building from sourrce?


[09-Jan-19 09:04 PM] DG#6934
Ok will do ...it was happening in Agama ...not sure if it could be komodod or the GUI but I will keep this in mind for the binaries....so far as now ...I just wanted to discard if anybody been experimenting the wallet crashing randomly ...


[09-Jan-19 09:06 PM] DG#6934
thanks @Alright


[09-Jan-19 09:07 PM] DG#6934

@jusoaresf that happens - not scary. could be that a node isnt aware of a new block and that those sort of outputs occure.

Hi @Nabob | $ARRR  when you have time for some testing...can you let me know if you are able to run CLI in CentOS? I have tried installaing the development tools depdendencies GCC6 and still I am not able to compile the binary


[10-Jan-19 07:12 AM] DG#6934
is not an emergency but just to make sure.

Everything looks ok for now....syncing the chains on Native ....but


[11-Jan-19 12:20 PM] DG#6934
When I tried entering my seed the Program crashes in Lite mode


[11-Jan-19 12:22 PM] pbca26#5430
can you elaborate?


[11-Jan-19 12:23 PM] SHossain#0007
when you enter passphrase in lite mode login box and click on sign in, the app exits/closes instantly


[11-Jan-19 12:23 PM] SHossain#0007
no warning that the app is closing down. it just closes


[11-Jan-19 12:24 PM] SHossain#0007
i had some native daemon running, they are still running


[11-Jan-19 12:25 PM] DG#6934
Also just in case for portable version , I had to use the command line to open the file ...it said that shared library file could not be opened on Ubuntu 16.04 maybe 18.04 already has this fixed

okay i'll check @DG


[12-Jan-19 09:56 AM] cipi#4502
@artem.pikulin @pbca26  the new version of electrumx server needs `minimum protocol version is now 1.4`
this are the changes that would come into effect when i update
```Version 1.3
Changes
        blockchain.headers.subscribe() argument raw switches default to True
New methods
        blockchain.block.header()
Removed methods
        blockchain.address.get_balance()
        blockchain.address.get_history()
        blockchain.address.get_mempool()
        blockchain.address.listunspent()
        blockchain.address.subscribe()
Deprecated methods
        blockchain.block.get_header(). Switch to blockchain.block.header().

Version 1.4
This version removes all support for deserialized headers.
Changes
        Deserialized headers are no longer available, so removed argument raw from blockchain.headers.subscribe().
        Only the first server.version() message is accepted.
        Optional cp_height argument added to blockchain.block.header() and blockchain.block.headers() to return merkle proofs of the header to a given checkpoint.
New methods
        blockchain.transaction.id_from_pos() to return a transaction hash, and optionally a merkle proof, given a block height and position in the block.
Removed methods
        blockchain.block.get_header()
        blockchain.block.get_chunk()```
and i will need to update sooner or later, so the question is if our apps (Agama, BarterDEX) are using some of the removed methods


[12-Jan-19 10:00 AM] pbca26#5430
blockchain.address.get_balance()
blockchain.address.get_history()
blockchain.address.listunspent()
i'm using these 3
so this update is going to break all available clients
not only agama main but any forks as well
quite a drastic move imo


[12-Jan-19 10:00 AM] pbca26#5430
@cipi


[12-Jan-19 10:02 AM] cipi#4502
yes, was also a bit surprised... but i am sure this methods were marked deprecated for some time
question is what to do? would be nice to start making the necessary changes to our apps, so i can update the servers some time


[12-Jan-19 10:03 AM] pbca26#5430
i can't seem to find what those were replaced with
only new scripthash methods


[12-Jan-19 10:04 AM] pbca26#5430
i don't understand the latest changes to be honest


[12-Jan-19 10:04 AM] cipi#4502
i think the scripthash methods can also be used with normal addresses


[12-Jan-19 10:04 AM] cipi#4502
but i haven't tried, so not sure


[12-Jan-19 10:05 AM] SHossain#0007
i big change


[12-Jan-19 10:07 AM] cipi#4502
this are all the protocol changes: https://electrumx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-changes.html
there is also 1.5 in the making, so if we start changing our apps, it could be a good idea to take 1.5 into consideration


[12-Jan-19 10:07 AM] pbca26#5430

[12-Jan-19 02:14 PM] Mylo#8306
Does switching to scripthash mean CC support in lite mode a possibility?


[12-Jan-19 02:29 PM] DG#6934
Why deprecating a method in JavaScript they just decided and that’s it ?


[12-Jan-19 04:05 PM] Alright#0419
@Mylo CC isn't scripthash, doubt it'll make it any easier


[12-Jan-19 04:05 PM] Mylo#8306
ok thanks.  @Alright


[14-Jan-19 01:48 AM] pbca26#5430
i think i figured out most of the changes required to support electrum protocol 1.4
we should be fine @cipi


[14-Jan-19 01:49 AM] pbca26#5430
although i'm not sure about mm 1.0 and amount of work it will require to make a fix


[14-Jan-19 02:05 AM] cipi#4502
wow, that sounds great... i told @artem.pikulin and he will look into mm1


[14-Jan-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
dont bother with mm1, just put improvements into mm2


[14-Jan-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
mm1 is being deprecated

i'm thinking to make some radical logic changes to agama desktop based on user complaints/requests
this includes what you guys asked me recently about separating pin/seed access, keeping added coins stored in a file etc
desktop version is urgently needs a fix so it's about time

Ok. Everything seems to be fine
the only cosmetic thing I noticed is the new version green «alert» apparently only checks whether the running version differs from official (not which is actually newer/greater). 
Not really a bug at least until we have both production and beta to download at once.


[15-Jan-19 04:23 AM] SHossain#0007
@jusoaresf thanks. the green light will be gone once we release it for public


[15-Jan-19 04:24 AM] jusoaresf#3291
I know... i meant one day when we have an official stable and a beta at the same time I would prefer the beta not saying there is a new version...

this is not a big issue as CTRL + R brings back things


[15-Jan-19 05:53 AM] ca333#0333
just wondering - is LUMBER still active/alive @SHossain - just an idea. how about having some sort of "Agama listing requirements" (since our ecosys is really growing fast) like a maintenance fee (SPV servers, upgrades, etc.) if a min. number of transactions on the chain or some other sort of "activity measurement" isnt met?? just thinking out loud.


[15-Jan-19 05:56 AM] SHossain#0007
Yes, we should think about Agama listing requirements. But, on the other side, how a new project will provide wallet to their users if they don't meet the requirements?


[15-Jan-19 05:57 AM] SHossain#0007
probably a listing fee for low volume usage or low value coin could be good.


[15-Jan-19 06:02 AM] SHossain#0007
Actually, using KomodoOceanQT wallet would be a better choice for them as it doesn't require integration

@siu what exactly is the redeem script? All that info you say that is important to save, I've never saved while using multisig. You can just use `signrawtransaction` and pass along the output of that to each signer


[15-Jan-19 12:13 PM] siu#3920
Yes, but this is the method for later using sign raw transaction in agama.


[15-Jan-19 12:13 PM] siu#3920
The redeem script is the way used to construct the raw transaction in a simple way in agama


[15-Jan-19 12:13 PM] siu#3920
"Simple"


[15-Jan-19 12:16 PM] siu#3920
@pbca26 surely can explain this better since he is who made the agama adaptation.

https://www.soroushjp.com/2014/12/20/bitcoin-multisig-the-hard-way-understanding-raw-multisignature-bitcoin-transactions/
here's a good explanation @Alright 
redeem script is required to spend funds and generate a pub address
so it must be shared across all co-owners
current multisig ui is version 0
it's subject to change in future
have a look at coinb.in wallet's multisig section for example
i never ever used it before today but it looks similar to what i came up with

@pbca26  Suggestion: When logging in with  different combination of key, Agama throwing error as incorrect Wif key format.

Shows this message -- https://www.screencast.com/t/4MuydrferpFN
Can we handle logins in such a way, on first login screen itself it shows error Instead showing blank address

i've added electrum protocol 1.4 support
can you guys test it?
run new build via the following command
./Agama devmode nogui=1 coins="beer" servers="{\\"beer\\":[\\"46.4.87.18:10022:tcp\\"]}"
provide a seed, no need to add a coin
make sure under 'I' button it says 46.4.87.18 as a server
try normal lite mode functions, checking balance, sending a tx
since it's just 1 electrum server seeing a warning message is expected
46.4.87.18 is a test server run by cipi that has min electrum protocol 1.4 requirement

@SHossain the portable linux compressed folder of agama is named **Agama_linux_portable_0.3.2a_tar.xz** . it should be named **Agama_linux_portable_0.3.2a.tar.xz** with `.` before `tar` instead of `_` .the current name is causing extract to not work properly.

Hi team, I'm facing the issue with this BEER address: http://beer.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RJTYiYeJ8eVvJ53n2YbrVmxWNNMVZjDGLh, there are a lot of unconfirmed transactions since yesterday, they were actually sent in a row spending not yet confirmed UTXO. It looks like valid case but doesn't work for some reason. New blocks are mined pretty often but these transactions are not included still. May someone help me to troubleshoot it please? We got a lot of stuck testing swaps because of it.


[17-Jan-19 11:49 PM] Mylo#8306

i will quickly check build output. its based on the prev. build jobs - so should git pull both codebases. since its creating fresh node_modules no idea what could have caused it to use old agama-lib.


[18-Jan-19 02:13 AM] ca333#0333
will provide fresh builds afterwards

One Q I would like to know...after a user uninstalls Agama mobile from their phone...it will also erase any record of the Pin they enter right? There is no userdata saved in the Android OS....so after uninstallation if the user copied their seed or forgot to do it....he won't be able to enter the wallet again..


[18-Jan-19 10:58 AM] SHossain#0007
uninstall deletes data. if there is no backup of seed, no way to recover


[18-Jan-19 10:58 AM] SHossain#0007
test it in your phone


[18-Jan-19 11:08 AM] DG#6934
Yes  I already knew  but users might not be aware and my second question would be...there is no possible way for the userdata to be kept in the phone right? I was reading more about the accessibility of applications to that possible userdata folder.


[18-Jan-19 11:11 AM] pbca26#5430
in future i can add such feature
please make a ticket

now can you plz try a full build of komodod via cclib branch

just call ordinary zcutil/build.sh - it will build cclib.so as part of the build

Check `cclibinfo` output after?

to make sure it works - plz do `make clean` in src/cc before zcutil/build.sh

normally run lite tho with Agama, and native on CLI on VPS


[22-Jan-19 04:56 AM] SHossain#0007
did you use any sapling enabled coin on this machine before? sapling has new params


[22-Jan-19 04:57 AM] smkhound#7640
I dont think so. Been using CLI mostly recently


[22-Jan-19 04:57 AM] SHossain#0007
if you only had sprout params, you will need sapling params

Can you try `brew upgrade boost` ?


[23-Jan-19 04:45 AM] SHossain#0007
boost wasn't installed manually. it was supposed to be downloaded and compiled during the installation


[23-Jan-19 04:45 AM] SHossain#0007
i'm installing  boost now


[23-Jan-19 04:46 AM] SHossain#0007
with boost installed now, i get same error


[23-Jan-19 04:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Will try on my side now

👍🏽 

[23-Jan-19 04:55 AM] SHossain#0007
master branch doesn't have this issue though as it doesn't have cclib


[23-Jan-19 05:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Have the same error on MacOS @SHossain


[23-Jan-19 05:09 AM] SHossain#0007
we need @ca333 to get that fixed


[23-Jan-19 05:11 AM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL did you use `build.sh` or `build-mac.sh` ?


[23-Jan-19 05:11 AM] SHossain#0007
actually, it seems i used build.sh and it was failed. so, issue on my end


[23-Jan-19 05:11 AM] SHossain#0007
user error


[23-Jan-19 05:11 AM] SHossain#0007
:p


[23-Jan-19 05:13 AM] TonyL#3577
I've used `make` in `src/cc`


[23-Jan-19 05:14 AM] SHossain#0007
i see


[23-Jan-19 05:14 AM] SHossain#0007
i was trying to compile komodo from source


[23-Jan-19 05:14 AM] SHossain#0007
and, the error was at the start of compilation process


[23-Jan-19 05:15 AM] SHossain#0007
when i tried with `build-mac.sh` it seems to be working fine


[23-Jan-19 05:15 AM] SHossain#0007
can only confirm once it is done


[23-Jan-19 05:15 AM] TonyL#3577
As I can see when you run `build-mac.sh` it's fetching needed boost first


[23-Jan-19 05:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Thats why direct `make` in `src/cc` not works with the same boost error I guess


[23-Jan-19 05:20 AM] SHossain#0007
and, i have cclib.so built fine 😃


[23-Jan-19 05:21 AM] SHossain#0007
same for `komodod` & `komodo-cli`


[23-Jan-19 05:21 AM] SHossain#0007
so, compile from source is fine in macOS


[23-Jan-19 05:25 AM] smkhound#7640
Finally got Agama native on win10 sync'd, claim now button is present and working.

@TonyL did you see the claim button on this screen?


[23-Jan-19 06:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes I did @SHossain


[23-Jan-19 06:55 AM] SHossain#0007
very strange


[23-Jan-19 06:56 AM] TonyL#3577
I've used fresh machine without any previous Agama installations


[23-Jan-19 06:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it is affects somehow


[23-Jan-19 06:56 AM] TonyL#3577
In 30 minutes my rewards matures and I'll able to check again


[23-Jan-19 06:58 AM] SHossain#0007
just tested on my computer. still dont' see the button in there


[23-Jan-19 07:01 AM] smkhound#7640
my agama on ubuntu 16 is showing reward claim button, and worked when pressed


[23-Jan-19 07:01 AM] smkhound#7640
button disappeared while rewards being confirmed


[23-Jan-19 07:01 AM] smkhound#7640
when reappeared, button became " check UTXO"


[23-Jan-19 07:02 AM] smkhound#7640
same address on both win and linux, both had the same button state chages


[23-Jan-19 07:09 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. it seems it is working on other computers


[23-Jan-19 07:09 AM] SHossain#0007
we only have windows install error message to fix


[23-Jan-19 07:13 AM] smkhound#7640
yeah, I had it again when reinstalling after blackout. ignoring it had no ill effects, wallet worked afterwards regardless,


[23-Jan-19 07:13 AM] SHossain#0007
this is not a critical issue. but, if an user don't see the button, they will most likely panic


[23-Jan-19 08:25 AM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL for the libcurl issue, you can try removing `libcurl` from `komodo/depends/packages/packages.mk` file. you will find that at the end of the file

- a fix for "linux when creating new Lite wallet, encrypt seed toggle is inactive, but encrypt key fields active."
- dpow confs icon in transactions history

dpow confs is also supported in spv mode now
spv dpow confs is only verified if the following two requirements are met: electrum server is supporting electrum protocol >= 1.2 and dpow confirmations/rawconfirmations implemented
so we now have an extra use case and a new unique feature
it will also be possible to add dpow confs to web and mobile versions a well
probably marketing guys will be interested to get the word out

@TonyL @SHossain  - have you guys done:

`./zcutil/build-mac.sh`


[23-Jan-19 10:52 AM] SHossain#0007
no


[23-Jan-19 10:52 AM] ca333#0333
there you go


[23-Jan-19 10:52 AM] ca333#0333
plz do that


[23-Jan-19 10:52 AM] SHossain#0007
just wanted to build `cclib.so` without building 😛


[23-Jan-19 10:53 AM] ca333#0333
otherwise you will need the external dependecies


[23-Jan-19 10:53 AM] ca333#0333
i have changed the setup - so it s gonna use the headers and libs from the komodo dependencies


[23-Jan-19 10:53 AM] SHossain#0007
build-mac.sh will work


[23-Jan-19 10:53 AM] SHossain#0007
started


[23-Jan-19 10:53 AM] ca333#0333
this way we reuse the already built deps packages without having to utiliize external libs


[23-Jan-19 10:53 AM] ca333#0333
we bascially "recycle" them


[23-Jan-19 10:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, in future might be useful` build-cclibs-mac.sh ` to not build the whole komodod


[23-Jan-19 10:54 AM] TonyL#3577
But anyway nobody used cclibs so far


[23-Jan-19 10:54 AM] ca333#0333
@TonyL once you have built komodod (the first time) you will be able to always rebuild libcc without rebuilding komodod...


[23-Jan-19 10:54 AM] ca333#0333
but it had to be built at least once - otherwise theres no .deps available


[23-Jan-19 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I see. Btw your workaround with libcurl deletion from `komodo/depends/packages/packages.mk ` helped me  @SHossain Thanks a lot, I've built komodod on MacOS first time since updated to Mojave!

thanks @SHossain - yes, the jl777 branch has been updated so the build wont fail anymore.

this version has coinswitch integration
please give it a try
double check everything before making a deposit
to make an exchange you need to have a spare alt coins equivalent to $18 (min amount)
neither btc nor eth are supported yet

you shall not pass until i fix the bug

also i'd suggest to use a smaller amount to test
the chances of you loosing $445 are low but still

@SHossain @siu 
please try to exchange completely different amounts
even better if different pair, kmd -> alt coin
coinswitch has a weird matching for orders that are similar in size

i think btc -> alt coin should also work as long as you use btc amount slightly lower than full balance

@pbca26 i would suggest the option to input an external address as receiving address. Just in case you want to.


[28-Jan-19 10:00 AM] siu#3920
i didnt see an option to use any other address than the one from the wallet.


[28-Jan-19 10:03 AM] pbca26#5430
give users more chances to mess it up?

hm


[28-Jan-19 10:06 AM] siu#3920
maybe it depends on the approach


[28-Jan-19 10:09 AM] pbca26#5430
lets keep less freedom for now
past experiences have shown that more freedom = more trouble

oh well...

👍


[28-Jan-19 10:20 AM] siu#3920
its just that if its going to be used to make a payment in another coin to a merchant or a fiat gatway, then it will require a swap and then another transaction


[28-Jan-19 10:21 AM] pbca26#5430
you have a valid point however it's not meant for such use cases
in wallet exchange was the primary goal


[28-Jan-19 10:22 AM] siu#3920
true.

are you sure that the btc you received were for this particular order @SHossain ?

apart from testing


[28-Jan-19 12:02 PM] pbca26#5430
well i can only wild guess that there are many moving parts
who knows what can go wrong
agama is reporting what coinswitch api provides
we're going to need to have a big disclaimer in red for instant exchange feature


[28-Jan-19 12:04 PM] siu#3920
I have not receivee the btc in my order yet


[28-Jan-19 12:05 PM] siu#3920
My conclusion is that the fee got discounted from the transaction and  not from the remaining balance


[28-Jan-19 12:06 PM] SHossain#0007
i bought BTC using KMD


[28-Jan-19 12:06 PM] SHossain#0007
i mean my order was for that


[28-Jan-19 12:08 PM] siu#3920
Yes, i bought btc with kmd too


[28-Jan-19 12:08 PM] SHossain#0007
then, it is very strange indeed. not sure who sent me BTC


[28-Jan-19 12:08 PM] siu#3920
Still no btc though


[28-Jan-19 12:08 PM] SHossain#0007

[28-Jan-19 12:10 PM] SHossain#0007
these are my last BTC txs. and, the new one kind of matches the swap amount

[28-Jan-19 12:11 PM] SHossain#0007
@pbca26 i guess their API is broken. the API page shows they are waiting for 25 KMD in that address, but they already received and used the funds


[28-Jan-19 12:34 PM] pbca26#5430
yes probably that's the case


[28-Jan-19 12:35 PM] pbca26#5430
i wouldn't use any instant exchange for substantial amounts anyway
all of them look kinda sketchy


[29-Jan-19 03:26 AM] siu#3920
My order eventually went through


[29-Jan-19 03:26 AM] siu#3920
Seems like a glitch in their API indeed.

[29-Jan-19 03:52 AM] pbca26#5430
siu's order is still in awaiting state
this is what support replied to me
>You have created multiple orders with us and for this deposit, your order is already completed.
i wouldn't worry about it much as long as coins are exchanged
users will have to take it up with coinswitch in such cases


[29-Jan-19 04:14 AM] siu#3920
What i did noticed is that the same address was used for both of my orders


[29-Jan-19 04:14 AM] siu#3920
the second order using that same address then got "stuck"


[29-Jan-19 05:01 AM] pbca26#5430
coinswitch might be generating exchange address based on IP


[29-Jan-19 05:02 AM] SHossain#0007
really?


[29-Jan-19 05:03 AM] pbca26#5430
i don't know how else to explain why 3 of us have different addresses
but at the same time each order we place has exactly the same recurring exchange pub


[29-Jan-19 05:08 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll try with a different IP later on 😛


[29-Jan-19 05:10 AM] siu#3920
yeah. I got the same address now again


[29-Jan-19 05:11 AM] pbca26#5430
maybe there's something else to it because currently all orders are proxied through atomicexplorer.com


[29-Jan-19 05:21 AM] siu#3920
imo every order should have a new address

we re back in business - literally. lets do some BEER/PIZZA business:
1) **This is INTERNAL and TOP SECRET - please do NOT share this documentation to the public untill we have properly tested MM2-net since its still in development!** - thanks to @artem.pikulin we ve reached a solid state to internally start testing. Please orientate towards the documentation and let us know if anything doesnt work so we can adapt/modify the DOC. Artem is preparing a public ANN with the Marketing team and they will publish a beautified version of this "dev API ref" - @SHossain has tested the new MM2 API with multiple swaps and is able to support you in case of any questions. HAVE FUN (& ignore typos):

@ca333 Hi, the link to MM2 repo is invalid: `f) ​Clone the mm2 sources:
git clone ​https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/KomodoPlatform ​ --branch
spvdex --single-branch && cd KomodoPlatform`


[29-Jan-19 09:42 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Please correct it to  `https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET --branch mm2`


[29-Jan-19 10:18 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Also MM2 is automatically built and uploaded to `Nightly` server: http://195.201.0.6/mm2/. Please test these binaries too, end users mostly won't build it from source, they will just get binaries along with GUI app, we need to understand what preparation steps are required to launch MM2 on `non-development` environments.


[29-Jan-19 10:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Doesnt work in Arch Linux.. compile version. But Thats expected... MM1 never realy worked either.


[29-Jan-19 10:38 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Deleted User Hi, yes, I remember that there is unsolved issue even for MM1. MM1 releases and MM2 nightlies are built on Ubuntu, so I think it might not work on CentOS and many other distros too.


[29-Jan-19 10:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah.. its linking to the wrong boost... Maybe later on I can try to add it to AUR... Doesnt seem important while stiull in dev tho as things might change


[29-Jan-19 10:57 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
I've created `MM2 test plan` table: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18R2oqFU0eAjbm3_p2_VH1QobkMVPeNlpuo7ZMocnkf8/edit?usp=sharing, there is a list of OSes that we should test on, @Deleted User, could you please comment the error details and OS version at `Arch Linux` column?

@Deleted User The current solution is to build MM2 on Arch from source, please try it when you have time. It should be possible to link Boost statically, but we will work on it a bit later: https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/issues/265. The task is added to `beta` milestone and will be done until April 1st.

@artem.pikulin - the repository specicied in the documentation is in sync with your mm2 branch. I have not pushed it to master/mm2 to not leak info ahead of internal pre-tests.


[30-Jan-19 01:31 AM] ca333#0333
i have synced the spvdex yesterday before publishing the test-documentation.


[30-Jan-19 01:34 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@ca333 We push new commits to MM2 almost every day, we might end up with someone using outdated version if he's using the fork.

buy and sell


[30-Jan-19 04:30 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@SHossain Some scripts are already there in `etomic_build` folder, like `buy_ONE_ANOTHER`, usage `buy_ONE_ANOTHER BEER PIZZA`.


[30-Jan-19 04:30 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
I will update folder name and scripts too, e.g to allow set price and amount from command line.


[30-Jan-19 04:30 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. thanks

I have added balance checks before trade, but these can sometimes fail still if many concurrent trades are happening.

But you got just `time expired for request`, maybe you experienced short network outage?

this happened last night when i tried 3 one after another


[30-Jan-19 05:43 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
I wonder if Electrum has a kind of rate limiter.


[30-Jan-19 05:44 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
MM2 should reconnect to Electrums in case of errors, but error detection takes long time in some cases.


[30-Jan-19 05:44 AM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 @cipi does electrum bans nodes for lot of requests?


[30-Jan-19 05:50 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@SHossain it's more likely it was short network outage because you also couldn't connect to maker's node. The issue is MM2 realized there is a connection error only after ~10 minutes after it really happened `30 13:38:28, rpc_clients:685] V4(195.201.83.86:10022) failed to write to socket Os { code: 32, kind: BrokenPipe, message: "Broken pipe" }`.

I suspect there was short network outage, and we experience 2 issues after it:
1. Electrum client detects error only after `10 minutes` and only then it reconnects.
2. MM2 is about to lose and not restore the connection with seed node.

Hmm, maybe the issue are other testing nodes that are connected from CI.


[30-Jan-19 06:13 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, your node tries to ordermatch with unreachable local node, our CI tests are also running on netid 9999 🙂


[30-Jan-19 06:14 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Should be not related to Electrum issue, we will change default netid for automatic testing.


[30-Jan-19 06:14 AM] SHossain#0007
this is my client script
```css
#!/bin/bash

```


[30-Jan-19 06:21 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
It's fine, I mean that there are nodes automatically started by CI on every commit, these nodes are also using netid 9999 and can interfere the manual testing.

i can't imagine you will ever hit the limits

first swap done after restart, 2nd one started


[30-Jan-19 06:37 AM] cipi#4502
i think the problem is not the number of sessions, nor the latency (ping times), it is likely the bandwith... if mm fetches hundreds of transactions from electrum, it will take some time to fetch all this transactions... i saw this problem with mm1, but haven't had the time to look how mm2 hanndles it

[30-Jan-19 06:39 AM] SHossain#0007
if i start a new swap after the first one completed, it seems to go fine. if i start multiple swap after seeign receive or connected message, they run into issues


[30-Jan-19 06:40 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
MM2 doesn't fetch hundreds of transactions, it might do `listunspent`/`transaction.broadcast` calls frequently if many concurrent swaps are running.


[30-Jan-19 06:41 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
`if i start a new swap after the first one completed, it seems to go fine. if i start multiple swap after seeign receive or connected message, they run into issues` it's strange, afaik `ca` could do up to 10 successful concurrent swaps.

if you issue more swaps after one is finished, this seems good

otherwise, electrum mess up things if you have multiple swaps at the same time

@Angelina generally installing the .deb version requires `root` access. did the user use something like `sudo dpkg -i Agama_linux_installer_0.3.3a-1.deb` ?

@ca333 when you issued 10 swaps simultaneously, did you use local computer or server?


[30-Jan-19 11:05 AM] SHossain#0007
Single swap time
Start: `19:01:27`
Finish: `19:03:43`


[30-Jan-19 11:06 AM] SHossain#0007
under 2.5 minutes average per swap


[30-Jan-19 11:13 AM] SHossain#0007
@Angelina just realised one thing. please advice the user to remove/uninstall currently installed Agama if they have it installed and install the new version

steps used: start native BEER and PIZZA daemon, start `client`, use `enable` script (saw my balance and address fine), issue `buy`


[30-Jan-19 12:10 PM] SHossain#0007
strange! restarted to eletrum mode and mm2 daemon also crashed


[30-Jan-19 12:11 PM] SHossain#0007
i had native wallet running but used `electrum` script


[30-Jan-19 12:15 PM] ca333#0333
Artem might be still working on that layer @SHossain since we found issues there last test-round - he is also implementing a client:client full trade capability (maker or taker) for sake of standalone principe.


[30-Jan-19 12:16 PM] ca333#0333
yes - that seems the issue. All funcs from backtrace are nanomsg related - which is currently being modified... so that is most likely the reason. just keep testing with client:1 - but diff. OS and diff. usecases. crazy prices, crazy volumes, negative values, etc.


[30-Jan-19 12:16 PM] SHossain#0007
here you go. another error. this time only using electrum

@SHossain @ca333 Hi, thanks a lot for testing and reports! Comments:
1. As @ca333 already said crashes are not caused by electrum or native mode. It's from `nanomsg`. MM2 still relies on nanomsg in many cases, direct TCP connection is initiated even `for swap` but is not used. @artemciy_dice is currently working on NAT traversal which includes removing nanomsg from ordermatching and swap process at all and replacing with Libtorrent (direct connection or DHT). It might take some time.
2. https://gist.github.com/himu007/e89a659dabc55cfddd6cde27c12c0755, got `the transaction was rejected by network rules.\\n\\n16: bad-txns-inputs-duplicate` from Electrum, looks like Electrum can return duplicated UTXOs in rare cases, I will check for duplicates on transaction creation and remove them, related issue: https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/issues/269
3. I keep expecting that Shossain have connection issues at least with my seednode, nanomsg crashes can be caused by it too. It's currently hard to investigate it as nanomsg has poor error handling capabilities, we have to wait until nanomsg will be removed completely.
4. "client:1" option was removed by @artemciy_dice in latest MM2 PR. Our goal is to make nodes `equal` so everyone is possible to be liquidity provider/maker. The goal will be reached when NAT traversal task is finished.
P.S. Let's move the MM2 discussion to `mm_2_0` channel. I'm going to add few community members there to help us with testing.

yeah - probably some FW rules, etc. network issue.


[31-Jan-19 04:16 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
It might be caused by recent update.


[31-Jan-19 04:16 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
MM2 actually tries to bind the IP that is not available.


[31-Jan-19 04:17 AM] ca333#0333

There is public IP available as I can see but MM2 still gets different one `206.248.64.23`. Are you connected to different providers?


[31-Jan-19 04:19 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Or maybe using VPN?

rebuild - it should help. just temporary fix. whole automake/libtools setup is being rewritten for separation of static and dynamic libs...


[31-Jan-19 08:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not sure its relevent, but I moved the CCLIB compliation to AFTER the deps in LABS... and that enables it to build every time from a fresh clone without installing system BDB.

@ca333 Pointing cclib in makefile on actual gcc I have not helped to build cclib on MacOS with same error as before.
So I guess it's better to wait till this build separation process finishing. I've swiped MacOS and Windows portable releases of Komodoku from github for now. Ubuntu portable seems works fine and we have daemon for it so I left this one.


[02-Feb-19 03:47 PM] ca333#0333
i can build you a fresh komodod/cli OSX for the time being. give me a little bit time. i am encountering some problems on my sec chain. investigating.

http://195.201.101.229:9090/public/Agama-linux-x64-v0.3.4-beta-exchanges-build6.zip

changes:
- fix for "coin selection list form "remove" icon misaligned. Seem in both Win and linux"
- fix for "also, from #deleted-channel  - unable to get BTC keys from pin password in Settings > Export keys."
- fix for "A user reports that the right menu does not disappear in German language. If he switches to English, the menu disappears and does not remain there permanently."
- spv dpow "stuck" confs fix
- btc fee slider fix, several users reported having this issue in the past
- native tx history csv export fix
- seed hide (eye icon) change from textarea to div block
- exchanges terms of service modal
- exchanges manual refresh button
- exchanges supported coins list modal
- exchanges sync history (recovery)

i replaced multiline textarea with a non-editable element to guard users from adding extra chars like new line
exchanges sync history allows you to recover your order history on another device or in case you lost agama data folder due to any reason
to recover your exchange history add spv coins first then press on "sync history" button
to preserve privacy only priv keys owner can fetch their history hence the need to add coins first
atomicexplorer does signature(s) verification
if any of sigs won't match a pub address is discarded

also added terms of service modal to exchanges ui
took "inspiration" from coinomi

important change, to use exchanges feature you'd need to run agama with exchanges param
./Agama exchanges

perhaps starting from the next release we can ask a handful of community members to give exchanges a try?

@Jonathan the other builds worked fine?


[09-Feb-19 12:35 AM] ca333#0333
komodod in this builds is based on the current beta branch. WIN has gotten a separate branch for the time being (automake upgrade still in work) - `beta_win`

osx and linux are based on the usual beta branch building fine without hackarounds. @Jonathan did you test OSX in native mode already?


[09-Feb-19 02:16 AM] pbca26#5430
@smkhound that's a very old version, no longer supported


[09-Feb-19 02:17 AM] smkhound#7640

Windows has been the most thorough (Linux and OSX are on VMs so it's slower) but they are stable for me 👍

rebooted a few ties inbetween the above.

since mobile is all remote API it can take longer than expected to process any requests
atomicexplorer is a bit overloaded and slow at the moment
but will do for now
in future we need to break it down into several micro services

create a new order and finish it. when you are in order history page, click the back button.
that makes the full screen blank without any option to use anything. only way to use the app is by relaunching it.

yes, once the deposit confirms


[16-Feb-19 09:48 AM] SHossain#0007
if you go back to order history page from there


[16-Feb-19 09:48 AM] SHossain#0007
and press the back button that page

gcc6 and 7 (OSX - from brew stream) have the bug. seems we have to downgrade OSX makefile fo libsodium in order to build komodod with that particular upgraded dep. 

@SHossain @TonyL plz `clang --version` - i am overriding the cc/cxx flag for libsodium and want to see if we re all in sync. Plz post your osx version to. (maj./min., ver. is enough - e.g. 10.14.X)

ps.  have checked the actual bug which seems resolved on LLVM side and will try to inform the brew gcc/g++ package maintainers.

oh you did.  forget i said that.

[20-Feb-19 03:16 AM] SHossain#0007
@Kiruel this error is basically because you already have a different version of libcurl installed in your system. delete `libcurl` from the bottom of `komodo/depends/packages/packages.mk` and it will work

It's possible to create a https://electrumx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-basics.html#script-hashes with komodod ? I have not see the `validateaddress` option


[20-Feb-19 03:51 AM] Kiruel#2091
(need it for call RPC)


[20-Feb-19 06:51 AM] Mylo#8306
@cipi is an electrum expert


[20-Feb-19 06:59 AM] cipi#4502
don't know about that specific aspect, but i think @pbca26 has done that in Agama, because of the changes to the electrumx protocol


[20-Feb-19 07:03 AM] pbca26#5430
that depends on a lang @Kiruel is using
i have a handy function for js to convert from pub to scripthash


[20-Feb-19 07:04 AM] pbca26#5430
it doesn't make any sense to code it in komodod imo


[20-Feb-19 07:12 AM] Kiruel#2091
Yeah it's ok, mm2 do RPC call already. So I don;t need to implement in another way.


[22-Feb-19 11:29 PM] pbca26#5430
@siu i hear we still have issues with SUQA
have you talked to them about disappearing transactions fix?
i recall you explained it's due to time locked funds
i suggest you discuss it with their team again and if the issue won't be resolved we have to remove SUQA from agama


[23-Feb-19 01:03 AM] siu#3920
Lets see if their new codebase fixes this. Although i think they have to work on their electrum servers


[25-Feb-19 02:48 AM] Mylo#8306
@pbca26 
agama desktop adds tx fee to sending amount
agama mobile takes tx fee off sending amount

can we have same default behaviour?

I think mobile should adopt desktop behaviour (add tx fee)

I'm testing the WooCommerce plugin and if you happen to have a store, and someone sends from Agama mobile, the store doesn't receive the amount they are expecting.


[25-Feb-19 03:29 AM] pbca26#5430
okay, that seems reasonable to add a fee on top of an amount

@smkhound i've added debug toggle in settings
if you still have issues with btc send please do the following

turn debug toggle on
restart the app
run adb logcat
send me output

app could crash during debug session
phonegap doesn't seem to handle well a lot of console.log messages

@Mylo i couldn't reproduce the issue you talked about with send
however i changed a few things that might be the cause
if you'll still have the issue please post me exact values and txid


[27-Feb-19 01:41 AM] Mylo#8306
Ok but I have iOS sadly


[27-Feb-19 01:41 AM] Mylo#8306
Thx


[27-Feb-19 01:42 AM] Mylo#8306
But it’s reproducible I’ll get latest tx.  It subtracts tx fee from amount sending


[27-Feb-19 01:43 AM] pbca26#5430
perhaps you can find someone with android device


[27-Feb-19 01:43 AM] pbca26#5430

[27-Feb-19 01:45 AM] Mylo#8306
I sent 0.777 and tx fee is taken off.

From desktop, tx fee does not get deducted from sent amount.  So the receiver would have received 0.777

[27-Feb-19 01:46 AM] Mylo#8306
So for a shop using woocommerce, the QR code is for amount they have on invoice.

If I use desktop, no probs.
From mobile, .... yeah.

Ok cheers will do if I can get android tomorrow

@pbca26 I tried to install v 0.1.5d but it just says "app not installed".  tried a few times and after a reboot.
Installed v 0.1.5c  tho without issue. awaiting btc to arrive in address, then will try to send. should have result before I need to sleep

[27-Feb-19 10:24 AM] pbca26#5430
changes:
- better transaction history categorization
- send transaction fee subtract fix

please compare agama desktop vs mobile in terms of transaction history
it should be more human readable on mobile now

@Mylo i've ran several tests it should match amount entered with output in tx now
@smkhound please run adb logcat again


[27-Feb-19 02:02 PM] Jonathan#3687
@pbca26 if the "Switch amount currency" toggle is left alone (default) on a new order the Next button stays grayed out no matter what I put in the amount text box


[27-Feb-19 11:49 PM] pbca26#5430
which pair are you trying to exchange @Jonathan ?


[28-Feb-19 03:28 AM] TonyL#3577
@pbca26 @Jonathan Started to test Agama Mobile from Login/Logout functions. Broke it to state that even reboot not helps (can use only after deleting/installing)

What I did:
1) Login with pin
2) Go to add coin page
3) Logout from sandwich menu

After it I never saw login option anymore. If I close application/reboot phone - Agama opening on "Add coin" page and "Login" not persists in Sandwich menu anymore.

Could please someone try on his device?


[28-Feb-19 03:33 AM] pbca26#5430
have you tried to add a coin @TonyL ?


[28-Feb-19 03:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Nope, just opened "add coin page" and then did logout


[28-Feb-19 03:33 AM] pbca26#5430
current flow is add coin -> login


[28-Feb-19 03:35 AM] pbca26#5430
logout removes all coins but retains seed data


[28-Feb-19 03:36 AM] pbca26#5430
perhaps i should remove logout option since we have coin remove section in settings now
thoughts?


[28-Feb-19 03:43 AM] TonyL#3577
I had to delete app after logout so if there other alternative to this option - it's better to remove logout I think 😃

Or maybe add option "Login" in sandwich - so user will able to login back by pin after logout. It's quite confusing when you logout without option to login back and can login back only after application re-installation.


[28-Feb-19 04:28 AM] pbca26#5430
sure i'll rename lock into logout

there were a few dozen more fixes which i haven't listed, not important/rare
@TonyL thanks for the feedback, it was very useful
however i won't be able add/fix copy to clipboard and qr scan issues
this version is the best we can squeeze out of meteorjs
i plan to put aside working on mobile for a while since we have two more mobile wallets in the game: chameleon and verus
the only thing i'd like to add in coming months is ability to in-wallet exchange eth/erc20
any other inquiries/enhancements will go into react native based agama mobile

I've tested the Verus wallet for little time and it felt good. They still need to add few more features to make the wallet better.


[05-Mar-19 06:01 AM] pbca26#5430
agama mobile is feature complete now
there's nothing else i see fit in there
the only thing we can keep doing is to add more coins/tokens/assets
perhaps multisig would be nice to have in long term

currently, an user must use the slider on this screen and then go back to previous screen to click save. otherwise, removal of coin does not work


[05-Mar-19 06:16 AM] SHossain#0007
alternatively, you can just use the slider disable value and make it saved automagically


[05-Mar-19 06:16 AM] SHossain#0007

This with KMD a mismatched tx data and visual.

When sending DGB, the visual and the tx data is correct.

please try new version @Mylo

there's one edge case when you should expect less amount in outgoing tx
when you use the whole amount fee is subtracted

@pbca26 @SHossain just a quick question mate, does this read the .conf file to get rpc user/pass ?


[07-Mar-19 09:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm thinking to use a ssh tunneled port forwarding of remote server on my local machine and use local GUI.


[07-Mar-19 09:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but if I do ssh tunneling, RPC port will be open to localhost, but if the Agama code is looking for RPC user/pass info on it's usual expected directory, it won't find it.


[07-Mar-19 09:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
how is this handled in Agama?


[07-Mar-19 11:29 PM] pbca26#5430
@grewalsatinder the path is constructed based on whether or not datadir is specified
it's expected to work in both cases

Sorry @pbca26 
I was importing my seed from iphone to android.

So i tried to import on android using the camera.
Took a photo of the iphone screen.
But android could not read the photo.

As workaround solution - you may decode it by phone scanner first and then copy-paste seed


[08-Mar-19 07:54 AM] Mylo#8306
ok - i'll test from iphone import from android tomorrow.
is it only the import that doesn't work?
i've used iphone for qr code sending no probs.

But fair enough, it's a known issue.


[08-Mar-19 07:56 AM] TonyL#3577

changes:
- add coin erc20 badge
- display fiat balance
- settings user agreement
- settings about/change log
- settings support
- settings main view option
- cache transactions history, wallet overview
- always display settings item in menu
- create wallet refactor
- ZCL fix


[11-Mar-19 12:01 PM] pbca26#5430
i refactored create wallet UI to see it in action either uninstall/install or use settings -> purge data toggle
also, tx history/overview is cached so wallet should load faster now
settings about has change log toggle
try settings main view option, it allows to switch between overview/tx history views

forgot to mention recovery/change pin is only accessible from settings page from now on
also, there was an issue with pin related security settings that now is patched
it allowed anyone with physical access to a phone to toggle off pin confirmation options
now such a change requires pin entry in settings

but, i was thinking like a user who would look to create a new wallet first before selecting a new coin


[11-Mar-19 01:12 PM] pbca26#5430
i think i can try to reverse it
present add coin after wallet is created/restored

i'm sure certain community members are going to ask over and over "when new release"

it was tagged for later release, but later turn out to be later than expected. Wallet download page says `Windows portable release is being prepared/uploaded. Thanks for your patience.` since mid Feb.

I'm sure he's had some higher priority tasks lately, 📆  easy enough to tell them to wait for next release if thats the way.

[14-Mar-19 04:59 AM] pbca26#5430
changes:
- mandatory one time user agreement acceptance during wallet create/restore
- exchanges tab is hidden under debug settings option
the latter change is to evade any future fud that certain community members have tried to create
so it's to be considered a bleeding edge feature with all implying consequences

let me know if you find any serious bugs
if all tests are good lets make a final push to make it available as apk first (androind only) and when shossain is back we publish new version on stores

@TonyL i have zipped them on OSX - thats why you see those artefacts .DS_* and _MAC.. - but anyway, they dont affect the bundle and there wont be a re-release as its as relevant as if a bag of rice fell on the floor in china. If you want one go ahead and rebuild. Otherwise you have to live with the .DS_Store files 🙂 - i am sure the size of them is managable...

@pbca26 I have proof read all the files and found some edits that need to be done:

In  https: //github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama/wiki/Add-ERC20-token-to-Agama-Desktop-App

    Under UI section, second bullet, "Add asset chain name" should be "Add ERC20 token name"  

In https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/agama-mobile/wiki/Add-ERC20-token-to-Agama-Mobile-App
    Under MeteorJS app section, third bullet,  "Add asset chain name" should be "Add ERC20 token name"

Last paragraph: change "asset chain" to "ERC20 token/bitcoin compatible"; needs to be done in the files for bitcoin compatible, ERC 20 token for both mobile and desktop

In all the three filse for agama desktop, 
   Under UI section, 2nd bullet: link is not formatted properly

changes: nn elections ui
voting ui is using a separate paths for seed store and tx sign which means users can use it along with their main account
it's a trimmed down copy of main wallet with minor text changes
to test it set your phone's clock past april 13th
i think this time we're going to use timestamp activated voting so we don't have to make additional wallet releases
i've used BEER as a coin for voting tests

[18-Mar-19 05:33 AM] pbca26#5430
yes since we're using beer as a test coin and not an actual vote2019 coin


[18-Mar-19 05:33 AM] TonyL#3577
VOTE users will get when voting will be possible, yes


[18-Mar-19 05:33 AM] TonyL#3577
And it's only usage


[18-Mar-19 05:34 AM] pbca26#5430
it's nothing but a fancy way to display the usual tx history/send coin data/ui
correct as i said ui is going to activate after a certain date
allowing users to see and spent their vote coins

Sent one testing transaction - it displaying in "Dashboard" but not displaying in "Notary Node Elections"


[18-Mar-19 05:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Transaction appeared in history on this tab after Agama killing/re-opening only so I wonder maybe transactions list on "Notary Node Elections" tab refreshing only on login. Balance not refreshing as well on this tab because of it - so I wonder it's an issue.


[18-Mar-19 05:57 AM] pbca26#5430

Works fine now @pbca26 
I wonder if no new features planning for adding atm - consider this version as RC and make functionality regression testing on it (page 2 in excel)

@smkhound Could you please make regression manual testing on 0.1.5m on this week? (page 2 in google doc)
I'll test on my phone also - so if there is no any scary bugs we'll be ready to release it when SHossain back

changes:
- added LUMBER asset chain
- dashboard fiat balance display price change icon
- pricing fix
someone reported that a few kmd assets like BET, DEX were displaying wrong prices and a few others
full list is here https://github.com/pbca26/komodo-omni-explorer/blob/dev/routes/cmcCoinDetailsList.js#L2
it was due to ticker name collision, coimarketcap has other coins registered under those tickers
now the issue should be resolved
also, coins that are listed on both digitalprice and coinmarketcap now are using average prices
try comparing OOT/KMD on mobile vs desktop to see if there's a difference
same aplies to BET/DEX pricing, mobile shouldn't display fiat price while desktop will

Would be great if someone can check on his device.
What I'm doing:
- Opening app
- Login with pin (App opening on Dashboard)
- Navigating to overview via sandwitch menu - loading endless on my side (tried to wait 10 minutes)

@pbca26 `Add coin` works fine on my side with 0.1.5o.

Still have problem with overivew page - will try to isolate now as much as possible and provide required information.


[21-Mar-19 11:46 AM] pbca26#5430
that would help
it's working fine on my end


[21-Mar-19 11:51 AM] TonyL#3577
With KMD only it's loading fine. When I'm adding BEER as second coin - I'm getting endless loading.
If I'm adding BTC as second coin - it's loading fine. So I'm thinking that BEER might be a problem (with KMD, BTC and KMDICE Overview loading fine as well).


[21-Mar-19 11:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Btw `Overview` page not updating dynamically so after coin adding/removing application restart is needed to see the changes

try to purge data and restore wallet
see if it will help @TonyL


[22-Mar-19 04:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Just tried - not helped


[22-Mar-19 04:13 AM] TonyL#3577
So maybe it's device/connection specific


[22-Mar-19 04:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Quite strange that:
I have ~15 coins in my list, after `Purge data` and`Wallet restore` I see only one coin which I added from list. 
But then if I'm reinstalling application (deleting 0.1.5p, installing 0.1.5p) - I can login by my old pin again and see my old (~15) coins list. 
So I wonder data not really purging on my side


[22-Mar-19 04:17 AM] pbca26#5430
can you see if it happens when you add a specific coin?


[22-Mar-19 04:18 AM] pbca26#5430
wallet restore only restores a seed/priv key


[22-Mar-19 04:18 AM] TonyL#3577
I've tried a few: BEER, BTC, BOTS

reinstall overwrites app files but doesn't change localstorage data


[22-Mar-19 04:19 AM] pbca26#5430
it's what meteorjs calls a persistent storage


[22-Mar-19 04:24 AM] TonyL#3577
But at first I've used "Purge data" function


[22-Mar-19 04:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me record the video


[22-Mar-19 04:26 AM] pbca26#5430
uninstall/install should do the same trick as purge toggle
i meant install doesn't clear localstorage data


[22-Mar-19 04:32 AM] TonyL#3577
At the very beginning I had same coins list at the end but used "Purge data" option in settings and restored wallet by seed with clicking on KMD in add coins list (not recorded it because of the seed revealing)

i see
my phone asks to clear all app data when i'm trying to delete an app
i guess it depends on a manufacturer
what happens when you use purge? does it clear all data as intended?


[22-Mar-19 04:49 AM] TonyL#3577
It clearing all data yes (at least visually in wallet after relogining with seed), but after re-install I can see data which was there before purge usage (even no need to use seed again - only pin)


[22-Mar-19 04:50 AM] pbca26#5430
that's weird

it does sound like your phone is not flushing cache
perhaps agama apk installed is also an old version?
anyhow if anyone else will experience overview screen issues please let me know
i don't see any issues on my end at this point

@smkhound Have you tried KMD/Pirate syncing from zero with daemon which bundled?


[23-Mar-19 02:09 AM] smkhound#7640
not from zero. KMD was already mostly up to date. PIrate was at about 80%


[23-Mar-19 02:10 AM] smkhound#7640
resync or delete blocks and redownload?


[23-Mar-19 02:13 AM] TonyL#3577
It's a good basic test, yep


[23-Mar-19 02:14 AM] smkhound#7640
so use reindex launch param?

confirmed on my install of 0.3.5


[27-Mar-19 02:49 AM] smkhound#7640
will test multisig and offline sign tonight.


[27-Mar-19 02:50 AM] smkhound#7640
confirm KMD zadrr disabled


[27-Mar-19 02:50 AM] smkhound#7640
confirm Rick and Morty on list 🥒


[27-Mar-19 02:51 AM] smkhound#7640
is there a faucet?


[27-Mar-19 03:03 AM] pbca26#5430
@smkhound that's komodod version
both don't necessarily need to match
there's a cc faucet for rick/morty
if @cipi can setup electrum servers i will add rick/morty on atomicexplorer


[27-Mar-19 03:03 AM] smkhound#7640
cool, thought that might be the case but similar enough to make sure.


[27-Mar-19 03:08 AM] cipi#4502
there are electrums for RICk and MORTY, but not on the main electrum servers
they will move there as soon as i can update them to the new electrum version (if i do it now, hyperdex will not work any more)
atm, there are these 3 IPs
116.203.111.225 116.203.120.175 116.203.40.22
RICK ist port 10004
MORTY is port 10005
on ElectrumX 1.9.5


[27-Mar-19 03:10 AM] smkhound#7640
what are launch params?


[27-Mar-19 03:13 AM] cipi#4502
```komodod -ac_name=RICK -ac_supply=90000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=3 -addnode=148.251.9.12 -daemon
komodod -ac_name=MORTY -ac_supply=90000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=3 -addnode=148.251.9.12 -daemon```

can someone fund RNTv4xTLLm26p3SvsQCBy9qNK7s1RgGYSB (atomicexplorer's faucet address) with a few thousands or more RICK/MORTY? @ca333 ?


[27-Mar-19 05:12 AM] smkhound#7640
offline signing create working in 0.3.5, but link to block explorer after pushing doesn't (confirmed tx with copy paste of txid tho).


[27-Mar-19 05:22 AM] pbca26#5430
specific coin(s) or all?


[27-Mar-19 05:59 AM] smkhound#7640
only tested kmd


[27-Mar-19 06:00 AM] smkhound#7640
will mvoe some other coins over and check again


[28-Mar-19 03:52 AM] pbca26#5430
it's working on my end @smkhound 
perhaps it was due to kmdexplorer.io maintenance that took place yesterday?


[28-Mar-19 04:34 AM] smkhound#7640
Could be my browser? Did another kmd tx in Native mode on linux, button didnt work, but transaction sent ok.


[28-Mar-19 04:36 AM] smkhound#7640
buttons for tranaction history deatils still working


[28-Mar-19 04:45 AM] smkhound#7640
worked in Lite mode (kmd)


[28-Mar-19 04:50 AM] smkhound#7640
I see the `*` on `push transaction` now, guess this is expected behavior? 😶


[28-Mar-19 05:07 AM] pbca26#5430
yes could be since it's trying to open an external app (default os browser)
i experienced this issue on linux a few times
* means electrum only


[28-Mar-19 06:12 AM] smkhound#7640

@TonyL @smkhound How far we are testing Agama latest version? @pbca26 is working on adding VOTE2019 chain now on both Desktop and Mobile. we need to set an ETA of releaseing this version with voting UI enabled. VOTE2019 is set to be airdropped on 14th April, ideally release needs to be done before the airdrop. we have exactly about 2 weeks to 14th.


[01-Apr-19 03:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Testing reports can be found in this channel - it seems that no critical bugs at the moment we have


[01-Apr-19 03:54 AM] smkhound#7640
yep, all bugs I found have been repaired


[01-Apr-19 03:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Beer vote interface worked fine for me in latest mobile Agama


[01-Apr-19 03:55 AM] smkhound#7640
some things with exchange failed, but was advised they were not a priority

[01-Apr-19 03:57 AM] smkhound#7640

[01-Apr-19 06:08 AM] pbca26#5430
changes:
- new asset chains VOTE2019, ILN
- new coin GRS
- qr code help modal

the latter change is to aid newcomers since qr code scan is not working in real time
a lot of users complained about this so now we have a short guidance on how to work with qr codes
please give GRS a try, it's already supported in bdex but wasn't supported in agama before
post me your grs address i have a few spare coins
vote2019 asset can be activated if date is set past april 12th

can't seem to send RICK or MORTY using mobile. the utxo is 1 Billion, wanted to send 100
they both stays forever in  the processing transaction...

was suspecting that. will use native


[01-Apr-19 12:28 PM] pbca26#5430
if i remember correctly it has to be lower than 100 mil

it might be possible to use with bignum library to handle such large numbers in future

@pbca26 i don't see VOTE2019 coin there. is it time activated as well like the UI?

correct


[01-Apr-19 12:34 PM] SHossain#0007
please make a separate test version for the guide. preety please!

[01-Apr-19 12:43 PM] pbca26#5430
no you got lucky this time :D
i haven't set a proper timestamp yet, it's already coded in though


[01-Apr-19 12:44 PM] SHossain#0007
better to leave it visible. users can play if they like until the airdrop and prepare themselves to use it


[01-Apr-19 12:44 PM] SHossain#0007
curious eyes already saw your commits and the mention of VOTE2019 chain

okay i can leave it with deactivation date only, set for may 20th
don't want to do any extra commits or releases to hide it


[01-Apr-19 12:47 PM] SHossain#0007
that's ok i guess.


[01-Apr-19 12:47 PM] SHossain#0007
not that users can mine the chain


[01-Apr-19 12:47 PM] SHossain#0007
it's on-demand block


[01-Apr-19 12:47 PM] pbca26#5430
that's the whole reason why i chose famous timestamp activation


[01-Apr-19 12:47 PM] SHossain#0007
nothing harmful

Unfortunately this hoster don't think same because only availiable option was 14.04  😅


[03-Apr-19 04:33 AM] smkhound#7640
it was on `Fill send form`. Clicked `All`, and it filled in without subtracting fee. Clicking sent popped up notification at top of screen. Tried to replicate, but each subsequent attempt is has subtracted fee.


[03-Apr-19 04:33 AM] smkhound#7640
tbh, could be due to utxos in transit


[03-Apr-19 04:58 AM] pbca26#5430

not good, let me know if you come across this issue again @smkhound 
>Can compile on Ubuntu 14.04 if needed (or at least try to lol)
only if you have nothing to do else @TonyL 
otherwise lets wait until ca333 will compile new binds
we still need them for release

pretty sure its due to attempting to send second transaction too quickly after first i.e utxo change hasnt had time to return

@smkhound maybe for the guide use a fraction amount to send to the origin address using Lite mode, a bit using native mode and keep a bit for the Mobile 😃

but nice find. some users would love to send full balance to single address and may run into issue

yeah, I scanned QR to fill, wif, then made pin. it took me to this screen, but not beyond.


[05-Apr-19 06:17 AM] smkhound#7640
used same pin as regular wallet, not sure if thats the issue. will purge data and try again.


[05-Apr-19 06:27 AM] smkhound#7640
strangely, it accepted pin after opening wallet again, before I got to purging.
also worked fine when testing yesterday, so assume isolated case


[05-Apr-19 06:32 AM] smkhound#7640
nope. just replicated issue, and used differnt pin and wif this time. Here are steps if anyone else want to check.


[05-Apr-19 06:32 AM] smkhound#7640
- open existing wallet


[05-Apr-19 06:33 AM] smkhound#7640
- go to menu


[05-Apr-19 06:33 AM] smkhound#7640
- select Notary Node Elections


[05-Apr-19 06:34 AM] smkhound#7640
- click scan QR code, procceed to take photo of QR image


[05-Apr-19 06:35 AM] smkhound#7640
- add and confirm pin


[05-Apr-19 06:35 AM] smkhound#7640
- attempt to sign in to Notray Node Elections with PIN


[05-Apr-19 06:36 AM] smkhound#7640
- click next, pin field empties without going to next screen.


[05-Apr-19 06:37 AM] smkhound#7640
- repeat until battery dies, thumbs lose coordination or claimed by sleep.


[05-Apr-19 06:40 AM] smkhound#7640
rebooted phone, and was able to log in to NN Election with pin set before booting.


[05-Apr-19 06:45 AM] smkhound#7640
after that, able to complete vote process - https://vote2019.world/address/RLj9h7zfnx4X9hvquR3sEwzHvcvF61W2Rc


[05-Apr-19 06:48 AM] smkhound#7640
- just purged and tried again using copy/paste for wif instead of QR code, same problem.


[05-Apr-19 06:49 AM] smkhound#7640
input field detects if PIN is wrong, just doesnt progress if pin is right.


[05-Apr-19 06:50 AM] smkhound#7640
unless exit / reboot first. Simply logging out and then back in doesnt work, needs to completely exit


[05-Apr-19 08:28 AM] pbca26#5430
going to check in a bit

pin issue reported on old phone didnt happen on this one. will try agai a few times over the course of today and see if I can replicate


[06-Apr-19 01:28 AM] pbca26#5430
you don't really need sdk
adb is enough


[06-Apr-19 02:01 AM] smkhound#7640
yeah, adb wasnt detecting phone,  so tried sdk in case driver issue. turns out it was a plug issue 🔌

we have an agreement with GRS to make a release tomorrow, preferably

is there a way after slecting addres in send screen to unselect so can send all funds, not just those from a selected address?
cant seem to cancel, and if I go to other screens and come back, address still selected. Native mode, so not ideal to stop daemon, exit and get back in.

[11-Apr-19 02:09 AM] pbca26#5430
okay, if the issue persists suggest to purge and restore wallet


[11-Apr-19 02:11 AM] smkhound#7640
Pirate is same, once selected cant deselect, can only slect other address.. TBH, not really an issue, more of a feature request for convenience. Was going to test rewards claim by sending all, but after using dropdown that just means all for selected address, not all for all addresses in wallet. Extra option in dropdown for "send from all addresses in wallet"  would be cool, but its not critical


[11-Apr-19 02:41 AM] pbca26#5430
try something other than pirate
dropdown has a bit different application
it's mostly required when you need to send a t/z -> z transaction
in t -> t case any funded address(es) are used to build a tx


[11-Apr-19 04:01 AM] pbca26#5430
http://195.201.101.229:9090/public/Agama-linux-x64-v0.3.5-beta-build8.zip
@smkhound dropdown should be fixed now
address dropdown won't be visible for any ac_public chains from now on
pirate is a special case, z_sendmany requires a specific source address
i will add a ui bit to handle z_mergetoaddress some day 
also, there's a new asset chain added K64

on 2nd thought, let's leave it for now. next Agama version for macOS will not have latest komodo bins from beta branch. i'll sync up VOTE2019 in native mode with old bins and send the funds back. just for a test.

RICK, MORTY & OUR will not be usable in native mode on macOS for now. SPV will work fine for those chains on macOS.
anyone can help to fix the komodo builds for macOS would be great

[11-Apr-19 07:23 AM] pbca26#5430
this is rather a minor update
changes:
- New asset chain K64
- KMD send coin clock out of sync check
- Transaction confirmations counter fix
- Low resolution screen scaling fixes
- Updated LTC servers list


[11-Apr-19 07:25 AM] pbca26#5430
not sure how you can verify scaling fix though
it will require something like a size of an iphone 4


[11-Apr-19 07:25 AM] SHossain#0007
no iphone 4 here

LTC seems ok on this apk


[11-Apr-19 07:27 AM] SHossain#0007
could we use emulator?


[11-Apr-19 07:27 AM] pbca26#5430
it's fine, i don't think we have a large user base on small screen phones


[11-Apr-19 07:27 AM] pbca26#5430
yes you can


[11-Apr-19 07:27 AM] pbca26#5430
probably xcode will be useful too


[11-Apr-19 07:28 AM] SHossain#0007
will try xcode when you send the source


[11-Apr-19 07:28 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, now-a-days not a lot of users use small screen phones.


[11-Apr-19 07:28 AM] SHossain#0007
large screens phones are pretty cheap

@everyone Please help test these version for release on your own OS. Please report critical issues if you find any. they also have NN Election 2019 UI. new chains VOTE2019, RICK, MORTY, K64 & OUR. On macOS use Lite mode for `RICK, MORTY, & OUR` as native will not work. Election starts in 2 days time and we need to get this released either today or latest by tomorrow. Most of the critical issues has already been ironed out (there can be more). Please help and please don't report minor cosmetic issues anymore as we can't fix them for this release version due to time limitations.

fixed @SHossain 
btw if anyone needs some HUSH ac for testing post your kmd pub
also, you can enable old school wif/seed login if you run agama with "hardcore" param e.g. /Agama hardcore
average joe must use wallet based access from now on
forgot to mention native params can be changed if you click on "params" badge on add coin form
my next step is to extend pin access to store various data such as cache, settings, coins selection etc

bit of feedback on new coin activation - can be a little confusing if
eg. select a bunch of coins by clciking on them, then click on "native mode", then activate.... 
it loads  them in lite mode instead (because didnt click native first). Maybe a small note like "select mode __before__ coin" at the top?

Noticed you can select a few in lite, then select a few in  native and activate, which is 🆒 
And by seleting in one, it is no longer displayed on the selection set for the other (even if not yet activated), which is also 🆒 

Have a 🍪

@TonyL With this new version when you create a new wallet or restore existing, you get to give them custom file name. i guess that way is better. no?

yes, wallet creation steps are better and users now must write down their seed in a piece of paper


[21-Apr-19 09:11 AM] SHossain#0007
@pbca26 this is my suggestion to put as warning text on the new wallet create page.
```
This is your new seed which will always generate same address for you and give you access to your funds. Please write down all 24 words in order of their appearance and store in a safe place.

Pushing offline signed tx works, but the `copy` button to copy the txid adds `undefined` to clipboard

>Had 3 reports of Error.  Unable to fetch data (code: getDashboardUpdate) in Win portable over the last few days. Advised reboot.
getDashboardUpdate is a heavy function, requires a good piece of hw to work smooth
i plan to optimize it a bit

>got this on import key -
could be a rare edge case due to daemon spitting something unusual/acting unusual

>bit of feedback on new coin activation - can be a little confusing if
i'm going to split native and lite modes, it proved to be too hard to maintain and create confusion among users

>Restored from seed wallet added to this list as "wallet file name", so maybe it's just old wallets detecting this way
correct, one of the first releases with pin feature didn't have manual wallet name requirement hence btc pub as a default name

>Encrypt seed tool - no option to set custom pin name?
we don't need this tab any longer, restore wallet does exactly the same
will remove it

>using CLI tool working, but seems some commands recursing the json
will debug it some day, not a priority right now

changes:
- Removed settings encrypt seed tab
- Tools create/sign multisig button fix
- Tools push tx copy button fix
- Create wallet title change @SHossain 
- Possible fix for https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/469204855773331476/569472143369437184/unknown.png
- Native regtest support @Mylo 
i've added a button to tx history to generate 1 block on each click, makes it easier to cycle new changes like send funds
haven't tested regtest extensively, something may not work well

also, komodod doesn't allow to run multiple chains in regtest mode for some reason
getting this error when i'm trying to run a 2nd ac in regtest
Error: Unable to bind to 0.0.0.0:17779 on this computer. Zcash is probably already running.
Error: Failed to listen on any port. Use -listen=0 if you want this.

regtest only works for 1 chain in regtest mode.  reason is the rpc port number is the same for any regtest chain.  i can only guess it has been hardcoded.   only tested with .conf file trying to set rpcport, not tested command line.
thanks this is handy, for testing against agama i guess!

Is it feature that in latest builds on wallet creation not possible to select generated seed to copypaste?


[22-Apr-19 12:06 PM] SHossain#0007
yep, this is a new feature. user is forced to write down the seed in a piece of paper or by other means.


[22-Apr-19 12:06 PM] SHossain#0007
this would reduce cat deleted their seed before they could save

almost similar to hw wallets which also forces you to write down


[22-Apr-19 12:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Would be great if on seed manual re-input screen will be possible to delete single word from selected (now if you missclick on 10th word you have to clear it totally and start again)


[22-Apr-19 12:10 PM] SHossain#0007

there must be no repeating words
might be a bug in bip39 module as i have no code of my own for seed gen

maybe you have to do it your way of manually clearing cache

testing mobile now. I couldnt install without uninstalling last version and allowing `install apps from...`
old wallet was purged on the way, had to create new. 
Recommend warning users about this on download page in case they didnt backup old seed. In big red letters. Have had support ticket about this in the past, might avoid some upset.
Created new wallet ok, same comment as Tony on desktop about  trash getting rid of all words and start again. Inconvenient for my fat fingers, but not critical issue.

@smkhound
let me guess, the first tx was lower than whole balance and the second tx?
>Then amount in confiremed tab was different
both screens at the bottom show the same amount value 3.3298 beer
i don't see what's the issue


[24-Apr-19 08:43 AM] smkhound#7640
first tx, I sent and recieved 1 beer to mobile wallet, then sent all to self. Thats on first screen. Forgot to screenshot confirmed screen for that tx.
second tx was after recieving more beer, again sending all out. Thats 2nd and 3rd screens.


[24-Apr-19 08:44 AM] smkhound#7640
first screen got my attention cos I had 1 beer, but confirm screen worked saying sending out > 1
maybe because selfsend?


[24-Apr-19 08:44 AM] smkhound#7640
second tx was just for comparison and as I'd expected.


[24-Apr-19 08:46 AM] smkhound#7640
will try and replicate with pizza 2moro


[24-Apr-19 08:52 AM] pbca26#5430

@pbca26 Komodo macOS version now builds fine. the fix is in `jl777` branch. hopefully it will be propagated to `beta` before we release next Agama


[25-Apr-19 07:13 AM] pbca26#5430
that would be nice
we almost have a RC material by now

http://195.201.101.229:9090/public/Agama-linux-x64-v0.3.6-beta-build5.zip
changes:
- pin access coin storage support
- create wallet wallet type selector

starting from this build lite and native mode coins cannot be run concurrently
one mode at any given time only

native coins can be used w/o pin access as it was before
pin access allows to store native coins if desired
plus pin access will have extended feature list supported compared to no pin access

i've added detailed description for lite/native mode during wallet creation
this should be useful for newcomers
suggestions how to word it better are welcomed

most use cases are already covered however i haven't worked all quirks possible
bugs are expected

[28-Apr-19 05:32 AM] SHossain#0007
does any of you have an KMD wallet.dat backed up which contains z addr and z tx along with R address and balance?
if yes, can you please test Komodo native mode using that wallet.dat? (backup existing wallet.dat first)
once the wallet started up, please check if `getbalance` is providing correct balance that cossesponds to the R address(es).


[28-Apr-19 05:37 AM] SHossain#0007
please test with latest `komodod` from `beta`, `dev` or `jl777` branch


[28-Apr-19 09:17 AM] SHossain#0007
you can also use `getinfo` call and verify the balance


[28-Apr-19 09:17 AM] SHossain#0007
make sure to use an address on KMD or ZEX chain that has history of z tx in or out


[28-Apr-19 09:17 AM] SHossain#0007
no need to have z address in the wallet.dat


[28-Apr-19 09:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Is backup of wallet.dat from specific commit komodod needed?  (not sure if understood what needs to be tested)
Is it fine test If I transfer wallet.dat from one node to another and check if balance is same as before and on same address?


[28-Apr-19 09:25 AM] SHossain#0007
any wallet.dat that has R address and that R address has history of ztx


[28-Apr-19 09:26 AM] SHossain#0007
or even if your current wallet.dat has multiple addresses which contains z tx in their history would do


[28-Apr-19 09:27 AM] SHossain#0007
if you start KMD via latest CLI or using Agama 0.3.5 or 0.3.6 should display incorrect balance.


[28-Apr-19 09:28 AM] SHossain#0007
but, if you have R address without any history or z tx, you wouldn't see incorrect balance


[28-Apr-19 09:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I don't have any addresses with ztx atm


[28-Apr-19 09:28 AM] SHossain#0007
i reproduced this in Linux and Windows


[28-Apr-19 09:29 AM] SHossain#0007
did you have any ZEX address with ztx from the past?


[28-Apr-19 09:29 AM] TonyL#3577
`z_gettotalbalance` printing not correct balance?


[28-Apr-19 09:29 AM] TonyL#3577
No, I never used ZEX


[28-Apr-19 09:29 AM] SHossain#0007
`getinfo`, `getbalance` will display incorrect


[28-Apr-19 09:29 AM] SHossain#0007
let me check with `z_gettotalbalance`


[28-Apr-19 09:32 AM] SHossain#0007
the common thing between KMD & ZEX is, both of them were converted to `-ac_public` chain and both of them are affected by this bug. i have checked other chains, those are fine


[28-Apr-19 09:34 AM] TonyL#3577
`If ac_public is set to 1, zk-SNARKs are disabled, and all z address functionality is disabled.`


[28-Apr-19 09:35 AM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL import this privkey into ZEX damon `sending via DM`. check balance after the rescan is done. then, stop ZEX wallet and start it again.


[28-Apr-19 09:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, let me try 👍


[28-Apr-19 09:35 AM] SHossain#0007
see if you can see what i see 😛


[28-Apr-19 09:36 AM] SHossain#0007

just installed this on a PC that was dormant since 2.09. Forgot I was using a network path at the time for komodo data dir.
After activating native mode, it just sat at loading data.... no errors. Went to stdout and it gave me nothing, went to debug log, it said "debug.log is empty"
Spotted network path in app config json. 
`reset to default` didnt clear/reset the path. Save app config did warn about bad path tho.


[30-Apr-19 03:50 AM] smkhound#7640

on windows, while the daemon is syncing KMD remaining blocks, `getinfo` call still shows me 
```
error code: -28

nice find @smkhound


[01-May-19 04:00 AM] smkhound#7640
third time lucky, got a seed with no duplicates 😃

https://github.com/tonymorony/kmd_windows_tests btw long time ago I adopted to powershell assetchains massive syncing script. It worked fine before - just have to left it at night and need powerful PC. If somebody have Windows PC with enough resources - you can try to check assetchains syncing in autopilot mode

@smkhound use `CTRL +R`


[01-May-19 04:58 AM] SHossain#0007
is the progress bar still there after reload?


[01-May-19 04:58 AM] pbca26#5430
>not sure why, but lite mode has sync bar visible
need exact steps to reproduce


[01-May-19 04:59 AM] smkhound#7640
I'd already exited, went back in and it was gone.


[01-May-19 05:00 AM] smkhound#7640
Was in native earlier, stopped daemon but did not exit Agama. Created new lite wallet, confirmed seed etc, then logged in, loading KMD, Dash, BTC and Doge.


[01-May-19 05:01 AM] pbca26#5430
can you reproduce it reliably?


[01-May-19 05:02 AM] smkhound#7640
I'll give it a shot


[01-May-19 05:03 AM] SHossain#0007
when you are using native, you stop native wallet and start same coin in lite, it can display you part of the native mode UI. doens't reload 100% automatically. manual reload fixes that.


[01-May-19 05:04 AM] smkhound#7640
yeah I figured that ui component was still cached from before


[01-May-19 05:04 AM] pbca26#5430
seems like a bug


[01-May-19 05:06 AM] pbca26#5430
i ran 1 mil seed gen iterations backend side and none were with duplicates
also, ran 10k seed gen iterations frontend side, no duplicates either
anyhow i've added another fix to check if words are repeating, lets see if it's working


[01-May-19 05:38 AM] smkhound#7640
unable to replicate loading bar issue so far, will keep an eye out.


[01-May-19 05:39 AM] smkhound#7640
I was surprised to get two double words in seed in a row. Double checked, running build 9 confirmed.


[01-May-19 05:39 AM] smkhound#7640
normally I can even get two reds in a row on roulette 😄


[01-May-19 05:50 AM] SHossain#0007
it is not only the progress bar, happens with tx history as well


[01-May-19 05:52 AM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL can you please update your scripts for Windows with latest chains? i'll setup a fresh windows machine with 16GB RAM within few hours to perform full sync test.

@ca333 we have an issue with the windows version. we can't fully paste the full 24 words seed


[05-May-19 01:09 PM] SHossain#0007
even if we try to type the full seed, we can't type fully


[05-May-19 01:12 PM] ca333#0333
@SHossain - only in windows?


[05-May-19 01:12 PM] SHossain#0007
testing macOS soon. found a workaround and advising the user to use that


[05-May-19 01:13 PM] SHossain#0007
Click on the **Quick access** and select **Tools**
then, select **Seed to key pair**
select **COIN**
enter your seed
click on **Get WIF**
and use the WIF to login


[05-May-19 01:14 PM] ca333#0333
thank you - if its absolute high priority i can debug and fix this bug - otherwise would prefer if pbca fixes Agama/EasyDEX-GUI bugs.


[05-May-19 01:14 PM] SHossain#0007
WIF or 12 words seed are working


[05-May-19 01:15 PM] SHossain#0007
user reported he has 153 char seed, he can type or paste only 152. i have 163 char seed, i can only type/paste 162


[05-May-19 01:15 PM] SHossain#0007
always 1 less.


[05-May-19 01:15 PM] SHossain#0007

[05-May-19 01:16 PM] ca333#0333
this sounds like a GUI/frontend bug - pbca would know details


[05-May-19 01:16 PM] SHossain#0007
same with macOS


[05-May-19 01:19 PM] ca333#0333
ok - launching up debug mode


[05-May-19 01:23 PM] SHossain#0007
windows portable version doesn't have this issue though


[05-May-19 01:23 PM] SHossain#0007
the portable version accepts full 24 words seed


[05-May-19 01:44 PM] ca333#0333
as aforementioned - a likely botched master branch. Checking shortly.


[05-May-19 02:22 PM] SHossain#0007
i've removed the win installer version and replacing with the old .dmg version for macOS users


[05-May-19 02:24 PM] ca333#0333
ok good - for your info @SHossain : the seed gets trimmed by 1 char - this is why its always length -1. this is 'just' a messed up seed-trimmer code - fyi @pbca26


[05-May-19 02:25 PM] ca333#0333
let me know once fixed and ping me for rebuild @SHossain

[05-May-19 04:22 PM] ca333#0333
fsot - this 'fix' is a dirty hackaround - removed the seed "checker" trimmer - now seed will be treated as a custom seed in every case which means it can have any length/format:

just an FYI - on a node that has just been doing syncing, i got a surprise alert from vultr about 80% of bandwidth used.


[05-May-19 11:56 PM] Mylo#8306
i don't have any extra monitoring information.   but is there anything i should be looking at to see why so much traffic?

build10 and other versions doesn't have this seed issue


[06-May-19 05:42 AM] pbca26#5430
okay, so it must be due to cross version code mixup

@TonyL @smkhound @here Please test our next Agama release version 0.3.6 with totally new UI to start with as we hve been testing recently. Versions for all OS available here. https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/Agama/releases/tag/multios-0.3.6
I've tested all of them for DOA, wallet creation and restore, native sync and few other things.
@smkhound we need to update our guides for Agama from this version as a lot of changes how we start it. please prepare the guides with updates for launch.
Any issue with testing or critical bugs, please let us know.

@pbca26 i have an address which has about 4,700 txs of mined coin on RICK & MORTY chain. SPV mode displays 0 balance using build12
this is the address https://rick.kmd.dev/address/RJ3mSc1ovM3mXAa32o7ejyztqBhu8NKizr


[07-May-19 10:32 AM] SHossain#0007

`Deprecated since version 1.2: removed in version 1.3`


[07-May-19 11:34 AM] cipi#4502
you need to use https://electrumx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-methods.html#blockchain-scripthash-listunspent


[07-May-19 11:37 AM] pbca26#5430
if it replies it's still supported, otherwise we'd see an error bla-bla-bla unknown error
rick servers are at ["ElectrumX 1.9.5","1.2"]


[07-May-19 11:39 AM] cipi#4502
i recommend to update to protcol versionb 1.4... after the elections i will update all electrum servers to the new version, now only rick and morty are using the new verrsion


[07-May-19 11:40 AM] pbca26#5430
i already added protocol 1.4 support


[07-May-19 11:41 AM] cipi#4502
https://electrumx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-changes.html
tells that blockchain.address.listunspent() was removed


[07-May-19 11:43 AM] cipi#4502
maybe you have to do the "version negotiation" before sending calls to the electrum-server
https://electrumx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-basics.html#version-negotiation


[07-May-19 11:45 AM] pbca26#5430
as i understand it's optional


[07-May-19 11:46 AM] cipi#4502
hmmm, don't know for sure


[07-May-19 11:49 AM] cipi#4502
i can also update the rick and morty servers to `Version 1.11.0 (18 Apr 2019)`, atm they are at `Version 1.9.5 (08 Feb 2019)`
https://electrumx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html

i wonder if the entire balance of `RJ3mSc1ovM3mXAa32o7ejyztqBhu8NKizr` is made aout of coinbase tx... and if it makes any difference


[07-May-19 01:25 PM] cipi#4502
looks like that is the case, since the balance is 4783 and the number of transactions is also 4783
@pbca26 can you try with another address with normal transactions?


[07-May-19 01:25 PM] pbca26#5430

This is NOT a bug I added btw... its cauused by ac_public... and a weird check on walelt load that checks ALL tx are valid on load... 
Once acpublic has been set at a height, then allz- tx before that are now invalid and ti removes them fromt eh wallet


[09-May-19 04:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
Seems constantly adding exeptions to this check is a bad idea to me


[09-May-19 04:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
so maybe some other solution needs to be found...


[09-May-19 04:28 AM] smkhound#7640
I think all guides also updated and ready to go. Will test raw tx and mutisig now.

@Deleted User i am not sure where the actual bug is and how this is happening :abused_smiley:


[09-May-19 04:32 AM] SHossain#0007
i have just identified that it resides in komodo bin. need help to identify more. i'll DM you the wallet.dat

yep, no error data there


[09-May-19 04:40 AM] SHossain#0007
i woldn't personally use LUMBER for anything. but, for testing a bit is ok. 😄


[09-May-19 04:41 AM] SHossain#0007
not sure which other chains are affected. i'll test few possible chains which i may have/had z balance


[09-May-19 04:52 AM] SHossain#0007
syncing up 2 different chains from scratch i think i may have done z tx on those chains


[09-May-19 04:59 AM] SHossain#0007
@Deleted User from little that i can understand, it seems all incoming z balance including change everytime after i sent any funds our of z addr is being counted.


[09-May-19 05:14 AM] Deleted User#0000

@SHossain  need more info on how to reporduce. synced chain with twallet.dat you gave me and it ahve only 5000sat balance., after restart there is no diffrence


[09-May-19 05:22 AM] SHossain#0007
use `z_gettotalbalance`


[09-May-19 05:22 AM] SHossain#0007
t address balance is correct


[09-May-19 05:23 AM] SHossain#0007
with fresh sync or reindex `z_gettotalbalance` should show about 800+ coins in z addr. 
then, stop wallet, and start again, `z_gettotalbalance` will show about 25k coins in zaddr


[09-May-19 05:24 AM] Deleted User#0000

Definatly does not appear to be issue related to previous fixed for ac_public chains

yes, may not be related to previous fix.

definatly seems to not be related, and that is not good... hopefully this only affects LUMBER 😄

weird -reindex is triggering a resync here aswell... Ive noticed this before... but thaught it was due to database cahnges on LABS...


[09-May-19 06:15 AM] SHossain#0007
yep, i thought that was normal


[09-May-19 06:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
no definatly not... reindex should only index... not sync aswell

[09-May-19 06:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
not sure its a bug as such.... maybe its a feature taht I dont know about. 😄


[09-May-19 06:42 AM] SHossain#0007
Tested with REVS and DEX. the z balance issue is not present there


[09-May-19 06:42 AM] SHossain#0007
what other chain we have similar to LUMBER?


[09-May-19 06:42 AM] SHossain#0007
they are using verus hash and POS


[09-May-19 07:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
This "bug" is stupid... But the -reindex bug is pretty bad, sidetracked on fixing this instead for now.


[09-May-19 07:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
I could not get your buiug to reproduce from -rescan... so must be related to syncing the chain isntead of reinxeding


[09-May-19 07:10 AM] SHossain#0007
z addr balance bug doesn't go away with `rescan`


[09-May-19 07:10 AM] SHossain#0007
i tried


[09-May-19 07:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
I -rescanned like 10 times, then restarted no bug


[09-May-19 07:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
fresh sync then restart, it did it


[09-May-19 07:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
-rescan did not make it appear


[09-May-19 07:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
the only thing I can think of is that -reindex is resyncing and not reindexing


[09-May-19 07:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
but -rescan is rescanning... not resyncing... if that makes any sense lol


[09-May-19 07:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
issue appears to be due to MAX_BLOCK_SIZE being changed


[09-May-19 07:15 AM] SHossain#0007
`fresh sync then restart, it did it`
that's it


[09-May-19 07:16 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks for pin-pointing this bug


[09-May-19 07:20 AM] SHossain#0007
it would also be nice to know why only LUMBER?


[09-May-19 07:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
its not only LUMBER... reindex is broken for every chain


[09-May-19 07:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is hardcoded


[09-May-19 07:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
and it cannot be.... as it changes bsed on height or something


[09-May-19 07:23 AM] Deleted User#0000

i couldn't reproduce it on REVS or DEX. both wallet.dat has z tx in history


[09-May-19 07:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
its due to reindex being broken... or at least until that is fixed.... I cant even attempt to track it down

The user `Gor` in #deleted-channel channel saying when he was voting, instead of sending VOTE2019 the wallet set out his KMD. has anyone experience this?


[10-May-19 09:10 AM] SHossain#0007
we know about the cache issue which can show tx history from other coin along with other data.


[10-May-19 09:10 AM] TonyL#3577
I voted by VOTE2019 sending as usual transaction


[10-May-19 09:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Did he use interface with map?


[10-May-19 09:10 AM] SHossain#0007
my guess is it was user error. but, he wouldn't accept that


[10-May-19 09:10 AM] SHossain#0007
no. he used the actual VOTE2019 chain in lite mode


[10-May-19 09:11 AM] SHossain#0007
and i guess he had KMD Lite wallet open too


[10-May-19 09:11 AM] TonyL#3577
I voted exactly same way and with same conditions (KMD and VOTE2019 were opened in Lite mode and I sent VOTE in transactions)


[10-May-19 09:11 AM] SHossain#0007
anyway, funds went to MadMaX and i believe he will refund all funds


[10-May-19 10:18 AM] pbca26#5430
let me know if you can reproduce this error again @TonyL 
usually such errors are very rare edge cases
@SHossain it's highly unlikely if it was due to a bug
at worst it will error but switching coins w/o a user action is close to impossible
i've seen enough claims where it was due to user error even though users always deny it


[10-May-19 10:19 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, i suspect user error. but mostly due to shame a lot of users don't want to agree with that 😄


[10-May-19 10:25 AM] TonyL#3577
`let me know if you can reproduce this error again` - it working this way every time on re-opening atm. Maybe have to reboot to resolve it, will try tomorrow


[10-May-19 10:26 AM] pbca26#5430
perhaps you can find exact steps to reproduce it
this will help to identify the issue

{Reactions}
👍 

[10-May-19 11:44 AM] pbca26#5430
please try switching between different pins and coins
see if you can reproduce any weird cached data behavior
i patched a few things already
hopefully the issue is resolved now
we don't need another case that happened today on support-wallet channel


[10-May-19 11:45 AM] SHossain#0007
didn't notice cachaing issue on 0.3.6 yet


[10-May-19 11:46 AM] pbca26#5430
try running lite mode after native and vice versa
this is the case where we had the cache issue


[10-May-19 11:46 AM] pbca26#5430
this is for the same coin e.g. kmd in lite mode and kmd in native mode


[10-May-19 11:47 AM] SHossain#0007
the user already sent 4009 (all) votes on 28th april and balance was 0. why did he want to send again? VOTE2019 was airdropped only once


[10-May-19 11:50 AM] pbca26#5430
we don't need to play a detective
if there's a bug we should be able to replicate it somehow
perhaps it was a coincidence of several factors that led to the issue


[10-May-19 11:51 AM] pbca26#5430
in any case just give it a few rounds of switching between coins to be sure that cache issue is fixed

@Deleted User found the z addr balance bug in ZEX. z balance shoud be 0. but it's showing balance from past and i can't spend them obviously. i have tried fresh sync from scratch with wallet.dat inside. tried the borked `reindex` as well. same result.
```
./fiat/zex z_gettotalbalance
{
  "transparent": "0.00005",
  "interest": "0.00",
  "private": "17290.01038467",

@ca333 i can't spend this balance 😂


[10-May-19 02:21 PM] SHossain#0007
the z balance should be close to 0


[10-May-19 02:21 PM] ca333#0333
if it is absolute high priority i could try to debug the indexer and see if thats messed up - my bet is that it is.


[10-May-19 02:21 PM] SHossain#0007
i can't assess the actual severity of this bug


[10-May-19 02:21 PM] SHossain#0007
no user or team member experienced this issue


[10-May-19 02:22 PM] ca333#0333
if its just about the severity than it can wait - its LOW


[10-May-19 02:22 PM] SHossain#0007
blackjok3r said it was being hard to track down the actuall issue and fix it


[10-May-19 02:22 PM] ca333#0333
is ZEX listed on any CEX with z_tx capability or any service using this token through shielded tx?


[10-May-19 02:23 PM] SHossain#0007
ZEX is now an converted `-ac_public` chain like KMD


[10-May-19 02:23 PM] SHossain#0007
they are listed in DP


[10-May-19 02:23 PM] SHossain#0007
z addr and z tx is disabled on this chain since our last hard network upgrade


[10-May-19 02:24 PM] ca333#0333
ok i see, in this case it shouldnt be any problem - and if blackjok3r is on it then best is to just wait until its fixed.


[10-May-19 02:24 PM] ca333#0333
as for z_functions - why are they still active?


[10-May-19 02:25 PM] ca333#0333
would probably be worth considering to deactivate all z_calls if ac_public>0


[10-May-19 02:25 PM] SHossain#0007
this was my wallet.dat from the early days.


[10-May-19 02:25 PM] ca333#0333
i see - so whats the problem then?


[10-May-19 02:25 PM] SHossain#0007
but, there is another chain with this issue, LUMBER, which is also a low value chain


[10-May-19 02:25 PM] ca333#0333
this is just a "visual" problem due to messed up indexer


[10-May-19 02:26 PM] SHossain#0007
i'm worried that more chains may have this issue.


[10-May-19 02:26 PM] ca333#0333
the proof for that z_funds was spent and the chain rules wont allow issuing z_tx anymore - so there is nothing to worry about


[10-May-19 02:26 PM] SHossain#0007
that is correct.


[10-May-19 02:27 PM] SHossain#0007
but, what happens when this balance is messed up on a chain that has z addr and z tx enabled


[10-May-19 02:27 PM] SHossain#0007
btw, Agama macOS is starting fine. will test more after some food.

[10-May-19 02:30 PM] ca333#0333
if its a messed up indexer then you would just be shown a wrong z_balance that you actually don't have - but you wouldn't be able to spend it - so there is no real risk or damage. The only thing is that it is irritating. Could make a user happy and give him a good adrenalin and endorphin dose - followed by disappointment and frustration. 🙂

windows instaaller version seems working fine with the above cases


[11-May-19 06:02 AM] SHossain#0007
@Deleted User that commit you shared with me fixed the reindex bug. i'll test ZEX with that one


[11-May-19 06:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes seems to mostly work... Still not perfect, need to test it on BEER with its full 4MB blocks. LUMBER seems to only reindex the firs .blk file for me. KMD did seem to work though.

what it says, Im testing this righrt now... it seems to load a lot of out of order then cant find the blocks in the following file. Its half fixed... but its not


[11-May-19 06:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think when a larger block is seen, it needs to increment the block size higher and the  retry it or something

It just means it read block in wrong order, dont think its anything important...

maybe it's fixing my wallet.dat

these z addr balance issue is not critical. but, if a less tech savvy user experiences this and starts complaining, that will eat our time

@smkhound will be helpful to know in what state komodod was at that moment
as i mentioned already you can skip multisig for now, offline sign as well


[13-May-19 02:39 AM] smkhound#7640
both worked in the end, was running native ubuntu 16, and komodo was synced, though I was low on mem because running win10 in virtualbx to test also. Win10 taking forever to sync.

Where can I find the latest release of the Komodo CLI?
I have a script that was installing from: https://api.github.com/repos/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/latest  but looks like that is no longer working
I'm guessing due to all the releases being tagged prerelease now?
```


[13-May-19 03:59 PM] smkhound#7640
the forced seed is well worth the effort, and should save some newbs from losing funds using aa short username


[14-May-19 08:04 AM] SHossain#0007
@pbca26 just experienced the caching bug on 0.3.6. i was using MORTY native mode. while it was syncing, i stopped it and started lite mode, restored seed and activated MORTY coin. It's showing downloading block and balance 0 instead of 9k. The tx history however is ok and belongs to this lite mode address.

we need to dig deep with user issues. maybe edge case or they messed up somehow their daemon

I think that more information collecting from user side can help with digging direction

[16-May-19 05:11 AM] SHossain#0007
and iirc, issues with PIRATE chain. let's push PIRATE users to use KomodoOceanQT or PirateOceanQT wallet, since the chain only works on native mode


[16-May-19 05:18 AM] TonyL#3577
screenshot showed that Agama printed that komodod is down


[16-May-19 05:18 AM] TonyL#3577
There might be various reasons why - maybe firewall block it let say, or local database corruption because of not soft stops (what is very probably)

KomodoOceanQT using komodod as well

So if komodod is down on user side not sure what can change switch to other GUI


[16-May-19 06:02 AM] SHossain#0007
no. the QT wallets don't use our `komodod`. it's coded directly.


[16-May-19 06:03 AM] SHossain#0007
it's not a GUI wrapper but actual komodod service built-in

Isn't it using same consensus code and same wallet database?
I just mean that first it might be good to clarify where problem on user side is - on GUI side or daemon side

[16-May-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the signature?


[16-May-19 11:22 AM] pbca26#5430
i figured it out
what kind of signature is that? redeemscript?
is there a way to verify if a correct redeemscript was used in a specific incomplete multisig tx? or is it not necessary?


[16-May-19 12:03 PM] pbca26#5430
a few more questions
1) is it more or less a reliable method to get number of signatures by counting pubkeys in input script and comparing with redeem pubkeys?
2) is it possible to tamper with an incomplete multisig tx?
3) if i have 2 of 3 or 3 of 3 multisig address for example does it matter in which order a tx is signed?


[16-May-19 12:03 PM] pbca26#5430
@jl777c


[16-May-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the redeem script determines the M and N for the msig


[16-May-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
2) yes, but it wont be valid


[16-May-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
3) order matters


[17-May-19 01:43 AM] pbca26#5430
thanks, i think i got it
had to go a few levels deeper to find all pieces


[17-May-19 06:30 AM] SHossain#0007
@pbca26 i guess i tracked down the issue with `Unable to push transaction data (code:apiElectrumCodePreflight)`

when you send a tx and the tx is unconfirmed, and you try to send again, the `Verifying transaction data` stays there for long and the `Confirm` button stays inactive. within a minute this red error pops up.


[17-May-19 08:17 AM] pbca26#5430
did you send the whole balance @SHossain ?

yes

asked which version of OSX used


[18-May-19 01:36 PM] SHossain#0007
@everyone If any of you have a Mac computer please help me by running PIRATE chain using Agama 0.3.6. We need to track down a crash that is mostly happening with PIRATE. My macbook pro is working fine with PIRATE using Agama 0.3.6. I can't reproduce this crash. I'm trying to get some more data from the users regarding the crash. It would be helpful, if we can reproduce it.


[18-May-19 01:41 PM] TonyL#3577
On my side it running smooth, I have 10.14.3 OSX
Maybe user have OSX version less than version on which komodod was compiled / Agama was bundled?
Had similar issues when bundled stuff - users with OSX older than mine expected problems

[18-May-19 02:48 PM] ca333#0333
we tested the previous komodod versions and the build was signed off - i tested it on a clean 10.12.x and 10.13.x - 10.11.x is not supported anymore. 

It should def. work with 10.14.x - has anyone from our testers tested it on 10.14.x ?

Just checked with user: KMD starting fine, Pirate crashing with error above


[18-May-19 02:48 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm on 10.14.3


[18-May-19 02:48 PM] ca333#0333
so it is just a pirate related issue..


[18-May-19 02:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Working fine on my side, yes looks like pirate only is affected

[18-May-19 02:50 PM] TonyL#3577
But on this user PC pirate actually never worked before


[18-May-19 02:50 PM] TonyL#3577
He said that it's wroked fine on his some old PC, and working fine on 0.3.6 too


[18-May-19 02:51 PM] TonyL#3577
But its some new PC and he installing Agama for a first time


[18-May-19 02:51 PM] TonyL#3577
So since it's not reproducible so far on our side - it looks very not clear where issue is because configuration on user side looks similar to ours. I'll try to flush my Mac next week to check


[18-May-19 02:52 PM] ca333#0333
i see - so either a PEBKAC or PIRATE error. thanks for infos @TonyL

the other user is also having issue as the daemon is crashing. i've posted the stdout earlier


[18-May-19 03:06 PM] SHossain#0007
it's the same error as @TonyL's screenshot from a 2nd user


[18-May-19 03:07 PM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 i guess, our mac already has all the required deps installed and user might not have them.

This lib `libgomp.1.dylib` bundling (not linking), so maybe it's a clue. But still not clear why it's crashing pirate only


[18-May-19 03:08 PM] SHossain#0007
for one user, 0.3.2 version is working with PIRATE but 0.3.6 is crashing


[18-May-19 03:08 PM] SHossain#0007
older version works means, they had different bin


[18-May-19 03:11 PM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain I think you can try to compile komodod on your macbook and ask user to replace in `/Applications/Agama.app/Contents/Resources/app/assets/bin/osx/`


[18-May-19 03:12 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe its some bundle build daemon specific and such binary replacement can help, not sure tbh - just guessing (specific building env may have specific bugs)


[18-May-19 03:14 PM] SHossain#0007
yeah. will do


[18-May-19 03:37 PM] ca333#0333
@SHossain - as mentioned above, i tested on a **clean** 10.12.x - and you confirmed that the user was able to run KMD with the new bins.


[18-May-19 03:38 PM] ca333#0333
the old 0.3.2 was still using the old 10.11.x built komodod


[18-May-19 03:38 PM] SHossain#0007
`you confirmed that the user was able to run KMD with the new bins.`
no, old bin that is included 0.3.2 works for him


[18-May-19 03:38 PM] SHossain#0007
he is also running OSX 10.14.4


[18-May-19 03:39 PM] ca333#0333
it was posted above that he was able to run KMD on 10.14.4


[18-May-19 03:39 PM] ca333#0333
so this is not true?


[18-May-19 03:39 PM] SHossain#0007
oh...ok. yes, yes


[18-May-19 03:39 PM] SHossain#0007
they can run KMD


[18-May-19 03:39 PM] SHossain#0007
no issue with KMD. only with PIRATE


[18-May-19 03:40 PM] SHossain#0007
funny thing is, mine and Tony's mac has no issue at all with PIRATE or any other chain using native mode


[18-May-19 03:41 PM] ca333#0333
i havent tested Pirate so i cant tell ref. Pirate - i only speak for KMD which works fine on a **clean** 10.12.x (= no preinstalled deps or SDK)


[18-May-19 03:42 PM] SHossain#0007
you are right.


[18-May-19 03:42 PM] ca333#0333
so likely a PEBKAC or PIRATE related issue - hopefully pirate crew can help debugging this. ~~otherwise feel free to ping me again mid june ref. this topic if its not sorted until then.~~ checking on monday on virgin mac


[18-May-19 03:44 PM] ca333#0333
i will get a new mac monday morning - i will run Pirate on the virgin machine so i can just reset it without worrying about opsec afterwards...


[18-May-19 03:44 PM] ca333#0333
got curious on what the diff is


[18-May-19 03:45 PM] SHossain#0007
i was telling Tony the same that i might want to get a fresh mac only for testing komodo bins. current macbook pro is being used for Agama Mobile iOS production. can't reset it.

I have a user who is trying to add coins in Lite mode, and everything works well, except for RFOX. 
When he clicks on Activate, wallet doesn't  react. Same happens when he tries to add coin after logging in with the seed

He has updated to the latest release, issue is still there. Any ideas?

my problem is with gmp dependency.   seems to be local.
jl777/jl777 installed, kp/dev didn't.   error is with gmp libs not found. 
seeing as it's in the src depends directory, i don't want to rely on the system libgmp-dev library and am not installing it thru apt-get.

@Angelina 
>Log out button disappears in Agama when I use Restore wallet  option with already encrypted seed
>Lite mode, Mac
is it an old pin pre-0.3.6 or new format?

>I have a user who is trying to add coins in Lite mode, and everything works well, except for RFOX. 
is the issue specifically with rfox or other chains as well?

So as I wondered before it looks like linking issue

Thats why it's working on machinces which have all needed dependencies for komodod compilation

` any other chain has this crash?` - not sure

@pbca26 it doesn't have electrum servers. I told them I'd do the snapshot/airdrop for a LABS listing on Zaddex. Not sure if they will have SPV servers or not. I won't be running them though. Is it a requirement or can they just have native only?

but, when the tx had 1 conf, it showed 0 until it got 2 confs in explorer

on the good side, when a tx is unconfirmed, the UI is showing nice message that it can't send the next tx until funds are confirmed

electrum servers are required only for lite mode
@SHossain  it's not updated in real time
explorer on average 1 conf ahead of electrum
at least in my experience

{Reactions}
💯 

[20-May-19 11:12 AM] SHossain#0007
no worries. at least the first conf after sending tx immediately shows 0


[20-May-19 11:12 AM] SHossain#0007
instead of 1


[20-May-19 11:12 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, lite mode is slower to show exact conf due to electrum servers


[20-May-19 11:13 AM] SHossain#0007
but, i thought, you were fetching tx confs from explorer directly


[20-May-19 11:14 AM] pbca26#5430
cool, i've tried it on beer
if you click on refresh icon after sending a tx it should change to 1 (depending on block speed of course)
i'll see if i can make it update faster in future
no i'm not using explorer api in any way


[20-May-19 11:15 AM] SHossain#0007

did you hit enter key after you typed in a seed?

ask the user to try v0.3.5 to see whether or not they can access rfox there

can't create same wallet name any more. the check prevents that

```
also, restore/create wallet now should throw an error if pin file name is already taken
this is to prevent accidental override

Only on ZEXO, after I press "Confirm" button, I think Fee 0 is a reason


[22-May-19 02:49 PM] TonyL#3577
It not depends of platform and for other coins valid transactions generating , so can assume that it's actual for ZEXO only

needed only for Lite mode


[22-May-19 02:54 PM] SHossain#0007
Native needs `Stop` button to stop wallet daemons


[22-May-19 02:56 PM] TonyL#3577
If logout button (can put `Stop all` text on it for example) will execute Stop for all daemons and quit to login screen I think UX will be better

@SHossain maybe you know in which repo/branch Decker implemented this fix? (we have to ensure that it'll be in needed branch on next komodod release)

Decker didn't send any fix yet. There were 2 ways to fix. He went for one and working on it

i'm working on it ... probably need few days on fix ... if will have less offile matters - will finish earlier.

https://github.com/pbca26/agama-wallet-lib/blob/dev/src/fees.js is missing ZEXO entry - the fee-setter() loop in the electrum severs config does check fee based on the coin key - in this case it was set to ZEXO which is not existent resulting in the condition setting the fee to 0.

is there a new stop all button? or just test old one is working ok?


[23-May-19 06:05 AM] pbca26#5430
there's when you're not using a pin
it does exactly the same as logout option, just a name switch


[23-May-19 06:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, idea was to add "Stop all" in pin usage case because in this case possible to switch mode from native to light by Agama closing only (if you dont know about trick with all daemon stoppage)


[23-May-19 06:11 AM] pbca26#5430
there's a logout option for pin login
you don't have it?


[23-May-19 06:17 AM] TonyL#3577
No, in Lite mode I have logout button and it's not possible to use Native mode with pin so it was a confusion

not yet

One user reported about problem with mobile, one with desktop so it should be electrum connectivity problem


[23-May-19 10:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Are you expecting it as well?


[23-May-19 10:43 PM] gcharang#6833
may be only some geo-locations are affected?
I just checked again in my own wallet. Error is still there, no balance

On mobile Agama I have "Connection error", will collect logs now

Can't reproduce on desktop so far


[23-May-19 11:22 PM] TonyL#3577
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/hsXHYnf8Nb/ it looks like logcat not printing anything helpful about connection attempts to electrums


[23-May-19 11:33 PM] smkhound#7640
just checked my mobile agama not working either


[23-May-19 11:34 PM] cipi#4502
if the app is using a method that was removed, it will not work, sure


[23-May-19 11:37 PM] cipi#4502
but i see request to `blockchain.scripthash.get_balance`, so maybe you need to update to latest version


[23-May-19 11:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Are you about screenshot which @gcharang shared?


[23-May-19 11:38 PM] cipi#4502
yes, `blockchain.address.get_balance` was removed, the new method is `blockchain.scripthash.get_balance`

In 0.3.6b presists protocol version check and `blockchain.scripthash.get_balance` using in case of `1.4`


[23-May-19 11:54 PM] TonyL#3577
So I wonder that maybe on screenshot is not 0.3.6 version, because on my and @smkhound side Lite mode desktop KMD Agama working fine, and `getbalance` call is using I think to retrieve balance.


[23-May-19 11:54 PM] TonyL#3577

Not sure why mobile Agama not connecting to electrums (logcat not printing connection attempts)


[24-May-19 12:06 AM] Mylo#8306
i have old mobile version and new desktop version, do you want me to confirm anything?


[24-May-19 12:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Just open both and check if you can see KMD balance


[24-May-19 12:07 AM] cipi#4502
hmmm, maybe just a unlucky situation for couple of minutes... if the version request gone to an old server and the next request to a new one, it can happen... in the meantime there are no more old servers online, so it should not happen again


[24-May-19 12:07 AM] Mylo#8306

oh...not so old then


[24-May-19 12:09 AM] cipi#4502
the last one... but it should not matter, since the IP is not in DNS as long as the server is not online

so this install is fresh install


[24-May-19 07:06 AM] SHossain#0007
use restore wallet or create new wallet option from the main screen

login into Lite mode, and will be able to see BTC

Maybe let's say in bad connection case Agama not receiving electrum protocol version fast enough and thats why old version method using 🤔 

Is it possible to make same request as Agama making on start to electrum manually (with curl for example)?


[24-May-19 10:23 AM] TonyL#3577
To see if response is different for gcharang

[24-May-19 10:29 AM] TonyL#3577
On my side:
```(echo '{ "id": 1, "method": "server.version", "params": [] }'; sleep 0.5) | ncat electrum1.cipig.net 10001
{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "result": ["ElectrumX 1.12", "1.4"], "id": 1}
```

[24-May-19 10:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, that was expected that same server will return same param hmm 🤔 
Only some caching / overwriting on update is my guess since this method should execute if version of protocol is 1.4


[24-May-19 10:33 AM] pbca26#5430
^ this need to be performed on the exact server that's causing the error
you can get server info if you click on "i" button


[24-May-19 10:34 AM] gcharang#6833
```
electrum2.cipig.net
```


[24-May-19 10:34 AM] SHossain#0007
`electrum2.cipig.net 10001` and `electrum3.cipig.net 10001` showing same results as well


[24-May-19 10:35 AM] gcharang#6833
yeah same result


[24-May-19 10:37 AM] TonyL#3577
Do you same error message on login with other seed? Do you have only KMD in your coins list for seed with which you login at the moment?


[24-May-19 10:40 AM] gcharang#6833
I have tried empty seeds (0 txns) too
Yes I only have KMD in 2 of the seeds I tried no other assets


[24-May-19 11:02 AM] pbca26#5430
@gcharang 's issue is found
it happens if you turn on proxy settings option
i'll try to patch it next week


[24-May-19 11:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Is it this setting? I enabled and seems still fine on my side. Tried to reopen and Use proxy is still active but no error messages and can see my balance.

@pbca26 can I suggest this fix to users who have this problem in Agama desktop?

@gcharang did this setting disabling help you?


[24-May-19 11:07 AM] gcharang#6833
yes. Just checked after pbca told me to
disabled that setting and restarted agama after logout
After login, it's working as normal


[24-May-19 11:07 AM] TonyL#3577
In such case I wonder that you can recommend such fix to users who getting such error message: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/469204855773331476/581436389783240704/Screenshot_from_2019-05-24_11-00-52.png

fixed a bug when non-kmd spv coins are not visible on add coin modal
grewal and a few other users reported this issue before
it's a bit tricky to test, you need to use v0.3.6b then build11 to check
drop this config.json into ./agama prior launching each version

RICK and MORTY electrums looks down in general


[25-May-19 08:50 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, all of them


[25-May-19 08:51 AM] TonyL#3577
@cipi are RICK and MORTY electrums running on your servers?


[25-May-19 08:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Anyway this issue not related to Agama so we can publish it to make users happy


[25-May-19 08:55 AM] SHossain#0007
yes. but, those electrum servers will be needed for MM2 testing though 😅


[25-May-19 08:55 AM] TonyL#3577

I think that problem was only in this `blockchain.address.get_balance` deprecated method


[25-May-19 09:05 AM] cipi#4502
RICK and MORTY are now on the main electrum servers
https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/electrums/RICK
https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/electrums/MORTY
i would also recommend to remove BEER and PIZZA, we now have RICK and MORTY, no need for 4 test coins

i would suggest to continue testing this until we have new komodo bins and we make a release with less amount of bugs which would be hardfork ready 😃

We'll need to release version with OSX PIRATE fix anyway

I can see similar issue: 
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/agama-mobile/issues/62

Also there are few reports  in Google Play.

Cant reproduce on my physical devices, also tried emulators (for example exactly same Pixel 2, Android 9 as user reported)

If somebody expecting this problem - please write me and I'll assist with adb logs collection

I think clue might be in update from some specific version

@SHossain so is there some way to reproduce it?

no reliable way to reproduce it every time.


[27-May-19 04:21 AM] pbca26#5430
it must be related to local storage data
in other words inter version compatibility issues
unless i know which bits are causing issues there's no other way to fix it

[27-May-19 10:43 AM] SHossain#0007
is that due to different code in KMDlabs repo?


[27-May-19 10:45 AM] Alright#0419
Yes, it needs to use the code that was merged into beta and dev a couple days ago


[27-May-19 10:45 AM] Alright#0419
I'll find the commits, just a sec


[27-May-19 10:46 AM] Alright#0419
what branch is komodod based on for the build?


[27-May-19 10:47 AM] Alright#0419
latest dev and latest beta should be fine


[27-May-19 10:47 AM] Alright#0419
it was yesterday


[27-May-19 10:47 AM] SHossain#0007
don't worry. if it was merged on `beta` branch, ca333 will get new bins to use. we have pirate for OSX fix as well


[27-May-19 10:47 AM] SHossain#0007
Agama uses komodo `beta` branch bins


[27-May-19 10:48 AM] SHossain#0007
until we have new komodod, native mode test is paused


[27-May-19 10:48 AM] SHossain#0007
Lite mode should work


[27-May-19 10:49 AM] SHossain#0007
@Alright can you send a bit of LABS to test at this address? `RPigNZvL5C17F7B8CpkBQQU4jozVWyRxxK`
will send back to origin address


[27-May-19 10:49 AM] Alright#0419
Yea can do, there is 100 LABS in that RANy address you use to use btw


[27-May-19 10:50 AM] SHossain#0007
oh...ok

something trying to connect via rpc with wrong creds?


[27-May-19 10:59 AM] Alright#0419
OH


[27-May-19 10:59 AM] Alright#0419
delete the conf?


[27-May-19 10:59 AM] SHossain#0007
it was fresh conf


[27-May-19 10:59 AM] Alright#0419
if you launched it with wrong build first, the conf is probably messed up

@SHossain could you see if it's LABS specific?

there was quite a bit of new stuff merged into beta recently

it'll happen on all chains

it's happening because there is a tx that has no outputs other than OP_RETURN

@ca333 I think it's better to wait first for @Decker PR with OSX Pirate fix

As I know it will be very soon and we can kill a few rabbits in same release build testing/publishing

- K64 enable dPoW icon display
- Phone back button default action settings option
- Updated RICK, MORTY electrum servers

by default back button (phone) acts as arrow back

RICK & MORTY to `RMuLVvWhcUj3jgJFWpi7awiC8M6Et7EN8q` would be appreciated if youv'e mined a bunch.
i can start a thread to mine if required, but looks like there's plenty.   can send tx between my two test nodes if required..

RICK and MORTY don't need tx generators to create blocks btw

they aren't on-demand chains


[29-May-19 09:34 AM] Alright#0419
just mining threads will do it


[29-May-19 09:35 AM] Mylo#8306
maybe it's to load test chain before atomic swap test, full blocks, dust in wallets etc ??

i'm just setting up, in case it's a full block test.  splitting funds with iguana

Electrums for RICK and MORTY were updated in 0.1.8. 
But have issues which looks like connectivity problems with RICK/MORTY chains


[29-May-19 06:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Other coins ( etc KMD, HUSH, K64, BET) works fine on my side

If click many times on RICK/MORTY in sandwitch menu coins list - on some point I can see coin info page (where displaying balance, send/recieve buttons) without error


[29-May-19 06:55 PM] TonyL#3577

Interesting why electrum devs decided just to print `{ code: 1, message: 'history too large' }` instead of printing last X entries (where X "not too large" history) from such "too large" history

What if only one daemon started?


[31-May-19 02:01 AM] smkhound#7640
I think due to config.json having no seeting from old install for "hardcore" mode


[31-May-19 02:02 AM] smkhound#7640
just reset config to default and closed app, will try again with one daemon

`deleting config.json manually, will try again` - you can try portable also (btw if you delete something - it's better to mv it instead to some backup place to remain issue reproducible by moving this file back)

@TonyL with the current public agama release is there some problem with RFOX in litemode?


[31-May-19 02:59 AM] TonyL#3577
I saw this ticket - but nobody was able to reproduce this issue


[31-May-19 03:00 AM] TonyL#3577
I think it's better to collect some additional information from user


[31-May-19 03:00 AM] TonyL#3577
E.g. can he activate RFOX with fresh seed


[31-May-19 03:00 AM] gcharang#6833
Ok, will do


[31-May-19 03:04 AM] gcharang#6833
he sent this image, along with RFOX,
PatentTX, Pungo, RICK are also missing
could he be using a very old version?

this is about the getbalance error in litemode of 0.3.6b @TonyL


[31-May-19 03:29 AM] TonyL#3577
When you enabling proxy and getting same error as user - can you add RFOX? @gcharang


[31-May-19 03:30 AM] TonyL#3577
I have suspicion that in such case you should be able to add only coins with non-1.4v Electrums


[31-May-19 03:31 AM] TonyL#3577
`noramlly above sync bar, shows balance.` @smkhound but there is `Transparent balance 0` on your screenshot under syncbar


[31-May-19 03:32 AM] smkhound#7640
yep. was expecting the other bit, but maybe only there if rewards pending

I just enabled proxy - KMD lite mode getting that get balace error
But I can find and enable RFOX


[31-May-19 03:35 AM] TonyL#3577
On 0.3.7 this problem with enabled proxy actual as well (Agama trying to use deprecated method)

[31-May-19 03:37 AM] TonyL#3577
So two known bugs we have now:
1) In native mode attempt to open "3 dots" coin menu causing white screen (it looks quite major)
2) In lite mode with enabled proxy Agama calling deprecated  get_balance method (not sure how much users using proxy, but if much it's very major because for them lite mode will not work)


[31-May-19 03:39 AM] TonyL#3577
These issues are reliably reproducable, issue with RFOX looks not reproducable so far so all we can do for now is to collect more information from user side I think @gcharang


[31-May-19 03:40 AM] smkhound#7640
I'll check RFOX once incoming KMD tx confirmed to see if reward balance section appears.
LABS synced in Native mode ok tho 😃 :labs:

[31-May-19 03:41 AM] smkhound#7640
still no reward section after funds in wallet, will check again in hour after acrue starts


[31-May-19 03:42 AM] TonyL#3577
If with other seed its not work as well (and if he is really on 0.3.6b) - I think only way is to delete all Agamas folders/files (previously ensure that he have access to seed) and then install it again from website.

[31-May-19 03:45 AM] smkhound#7640
no problem with RFOX for me, proxy on or off. I have no RFOX funds tho, so not sure if that makes difference


[31-May-19 03:45 AM] TonyL#3577
User can't add not only RFOX but K64 also lets say (https://support.komodoplatform.com/a/tickets/12814) He also tried to use "Clean cache" feature


[31-May-19 03:46 AM] TonyL#3577

[31-May-19 07:15 AM] pbca26#5430
wif login has nothing to do with native


[31-May-19 07:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe change 
"Create new wallet" to "Create Lite mode seed" (with no option of seed creation for native mode)
"Restore wallet" to "Import wif / seed"
"Add native coin" to "Start native mode"


[31-May-19 07:16 AM] TonyL#3577
And "Sign in" to "Start Lite mode for selected pin"


[31-May-19 07:17 AM] TonyL#3577
And above of pins some indication that it is pre-saved pins for lite mode


[31-May-19 07:17 AM] SHossain#0007
i can confirm if you enable wif login from settings, save and restart agama and start a native coin, you will see Remove button under native mode coin

[31-May-19 07:17 AM] SHossain#0007
seems a bug


[31-May-19 07:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Now UX is really hard quest - you should know a lot of things before you start use it


[31-May-19 07:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Idea is just to point users where is what


[31-May-19 07:18 AM] SHossain#0007
and, if you disable that, save and restart, Agama shows correct behaviour for native coins


[31-May-19 07:19 AM] pbca26#5430
restore wallet is going to be used for multisig as well


[31-May-19 07:20 AM] pbca26#5430
i fear whatever different names we choose some people will still complain


[31-May-19 07:26 AM] pbca26#5430
i can add an option to use native mode pin w/o a password


[31-May-19 07:26 AM] TonyL#3577
It is "Add native coin" actually


[31-May-19 07:29 AM] TonyL#3577
And it have "add/load selection" feature

remove coin should only be visible in lite mode now


[31-May-19 07:36 AM] pbca26#5430
>And it have Save/Load selection feature
this feature was there long before pin access got added and it still works
people can use it instead of pin if preferred

ok, how do I export seed? @TonyL


[31-May-19 10:26 PM] TonyL#3577
There is no such functionality atm


[31-May-19 10:26 PM] gcharang#6833
got it


[01-Jun-19 06:13 AM] TonyL#3577
@gcharang actually I've missinformed you - you able to view seed if created it by current installation of AtomicDEX, but not able if you using "restore wallet" functionality


[01-Jun-19 07:00 AM] gcharang#6833
yeah, I've found it, there is the normal seed verification done when creating the wallet


[01-Jun-19 11:32 PM] gcharang#6833
for this screen when restoring a seed
One user's feedback was
```
that it wasn't clear it was asking to create a new wallet name and so he was confused
```
He thought it would be better if it said "Enter a new wallet file name" or something similar

Is there a assetchain which is not dPoWed but is being mined ?
If so, I need its launch params


[03-Jun-19 12:19 AM] Mylo#8306
hard to track that one down.  maybe LUMBI


[03-Jun-19 07:51 AM] smkhound#7640
Just noticed that in native mode, after selecting coin by clicking on, then clicking `params`, if setting or leaving launch params to `none (default)`, after clicking confirm it deselects the coin when returning to coin selection screen.

i need at least one more person to verify it's working
after that we can publish a version with limited asset chains support for people to poke

if anyone wants to test trezor web wallet integration
it supports any ac that forked to sapling
oot and zilla require special handling and i can't seem to find what data am i missing to sign them as well
normal login is disabled as a precaution
it's using one address for change since there's no clear way to derive addresses for assets
it does break pseudo anonymity but allows to store all assets in a secure way in turn
i think magnum wallet is doing something similar with trezor for kmd ac


[08-Jun-19 02:33 AM] pbca26#5430
don't use any valuable assets or any large amounts


[09-Jun-19 03:43 AM] pbca26#5430
i've spent a bit more time to debug trezor signing for tx v1 asset chains, oot and zilla specifically
they won't budge, not sure where the problem is trezor or missing bits in my code
tx version 4 work w/o any issues
i submitted a ticket to trezor https://github.com/trezor/connect/issues/409 perhaps they can help

Going to try and check it, hopefully its not OS specific


[11-Jun-19 04:11 AM] ca333#0333
so it gets stuck stuck if the chain was presynced - and it gets stuck on 1387063 = when the banned utxo reached the hackers key.


[11-Jun-19 04:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
my guess was it was related to the txid ban. So hopefully I can repooduce it and see exactly where it fails

prob not, in other room but was syncing from scratch so expected it to run all night

`need to reindex?` - to reindex bootstrap?

on fully synced non-fresh node


[13-Jun-19 05:38 AM] TonyL#3577
you can change executable and make `Started fully synced KMD/assetchains daemon` on it

[13-Jun-19 05:38 AM] TonyL#3577
and then you'll have full node to send transactions and etc

can someone give it a try?
you'll need to install all perquisites including python hhttps://github.com/KomodoPlatform/electrum-komodo/tree/rick#development-version
synchronization is broken atm i'm waiting on cipi to come online
need to generate required data for sync

try to test it with kmd wif, bip32 and bip39
if you have time try multisig too

i think trezor and ledger support will require extra work
trezor's code is for sure too old

early next week i should have a fully functional kmd version with interest claiming

KMD wif works fine ("Import Zcash addresses or private keys" feature on wallet creation)
bip39 seed seems to work fine as well
For bip32 complication is that wallet itself not generating keypair but after you using pre-generated one it seems to work correct too

how do you mean "not generating keypair" ? @TonyL

well i guess that's default functionality
you can also recover from bip32 seed
what's the issue you're having exactly? @TonyL


[24-Jun-19 09:58 AM] TonyL#3577
there is no issue


[24-Jun-19 10:01 AM] pbca26#5430
but you said that something is not user friendly
i'm just trying to understand what exactly?
it would be nice to make legacy seeds work as well such as agama/bdex
shouldn't be too difficult


[24-Jun-19 10:03 AM] TonyL#3577
I just meant that when you creating new wallet - it's possible to generate only "standart" seed which is working as an Agama lite mode, there is no way to generate master key, only import existing one


[24-Jun-19 10:05 AM] pbca26#5430
i don't think it's compatible since it's bip32
okay, now it's clear 😃

let me build an AppImage and continue testing on Ubuntu


[25-Jun-19 09:31 AM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL  on step 0 dont' we need cloned repo already?


[25-Jun-19 09:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Which one? At first you need to follow main read me to install dependencies and stuff


[25-Jun-19 09:32 AM] SHossain#0007
before we use `cd contrib/deterministic-build`

At first this one needs to be followed


[25-Jun-19 09:34 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[25-Jun-19 09:34 AM] SHossain#0007
which dir we use the step2 commands from?


[25-Jun-19 09:35 AM] SHossain#0007
i guess, if you mention those steps and make it a bit clear, n00bs will be able to follow 😃


[25-Jun-19 09:36 AM] SHossain#0007
i'm running from main `electrum-komodo` dir now


[25-Jun-19 09:37 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok will add such info, I just took README from other repo :)
step2 commands should be executed from repo root folder


[25-Jun-19 09:38 AM] SHossain#0007
i figured 😛


[25-Jun-19 09:39 AM] SHossain#0007

it will do everything in docker container so your local deps issues will not matter

mind you that i got the error from `pip3 install .[full]` command


[25-Jun-19 09:56 AM] SHossain#0007
on macOS it worked fine


[25-Jun-19 09:57 AM] SHossain#0007
i wonder, if there is issue on my current Ubuntu 18.04


[25-Jun-19 09:57 AM] SHossain#0007
it's not a clean OS

yep, I'm not sure why you got this error, need to investigate - atm on mm2


[25-Jun-19 09:57 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[25-Jun-19 09:57 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe it's related to gcc version lets say

[25-Jun-19 10:04 AM] TonyL#3577

@pbca26 how can we auto detect the derivation path for Ledger?


[25-Jun-19 10:06 AM] SHossain#0007
i used my Ledger, it added the first address


[25-Jun-19 10:45 AM] SHossain#0007
using magnum i know this is the address where i have funds on my Ledger `44'/141'/0'/0/14` (had to find manually too)

electrum-komodo shows `m/44'/133'/0'` as default


[25-Jun-19 10:46 AM] SHossain#0007
tried to change that to match magnum, that creates new address


[25-Jun-19 10:51 AM] pbca26#5430
what happens if you use m/44'/141' at wallet initialization step? @SHossain


[25-Jun-19 10:51 AM] SHossain#0007
let me try


[25-Jun-19 10:51 AM] pbca26#5430
a33 looks wrong


[25-Jun-19 10:52 AM] SHossain#0007
sorry, that would be `133`


[25-Jun-19 10:52 AM] pbca26#5430
just change it to 141


[25-Jun-19 10:52 AM] SHossain#0007
my typo


[25-Jun-19 10:52 AM] pbca26#5430
i will check how to default it to 141


[25-Jun-19 10:53 AM] SHossain#0007
i tried this `m/44'/141'/0'/0/14`


[25-Jun-19 10:53 AM] pbca26#5430
133 is zcash
i haven't had time to change all zcash references yet


[25-Jun-19 10:55 AM] SHossain#0007
the address i get using the above doesn't match my actuall address at that derivation path


[25-Jun-19 10:58 AM] SHossain#0007
and, seems the app doesn't detect Trezor yet


[25-Jun-19 11:15 AM] SHossain#0007
@pbca26 case 1 passed
```
case 1
  - kmd wif import (import zcash address)
  - deposit < 10 kmd
  - send to self
  - send to external address
```

i pushed new changes to electrum wallet:
- default hw path to m/44'/141'
- change most of text zcash references to komodo
- display negative fee as interest
- send to self button
- updated fiat rates list, removed btc rates
@SHossain can you test please?

next week i'm going to focus on fixing sync and agama/bdex seed import option
after that trezor fix and it will be pretty much RC ready


[28-Jun-19 06:11 AM] pbca26#5430
forgot to mention i changed data dir name
make sure to mv .electrum-zcash .electrum-komodo
otherwise you'll need to import wallets again


[28-Jun-19 12:59 PM] SHossain#0007
@pbca26 will test. just need some time 😃

same error: `"error" : "lp_swap:819] !check_i_have_enough_to_trade utxo:1194] VRSC balance 0.3741035000000000 is too low, required 0.37411348"`
seems to be some sort of rounding error... maybe txfee is somehow involved in the calculation too


[17-Jul-19 10:13 AM] cipi#4502
so my balance was `0.3741035` and you tried to swap `0.3741`VRSC...


[17-Jul-19 10:14 AM] SHossain#0007
indeed strange


[17-Jul-19 10:18 AM] cipi#4502
pretty sure it would work with 0.3740 VRSC


[17-Jul-19 10:19 AM] cipi#4502
where did you get this amount from?


[17-Jul-19 10:52 AM] SHossain#0007
i wanted to swap 0.1 KMD for any amount of VRC based on maker's price. but, the app automatically changed amount and i just confirmed it


[17-Jul-19 11:56 AM] cipi#4502
aha, i guess it changed the amount to what is shown in orderbook under `maxvolume`... but looks like it doesn't work, because of some wrong calculations, so the amount should be a bit lower then what is shown in`maxvolume`


[17-Jul-19 11:57 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, that might be the issue

@smkhound The number of concurrent swaps is not limited to number of utxos in wallet. MM2 was designed to works with 1 output available only.


[31-Oct-19 05:34 AM] smkhound#7640
really? it doesnt have to wait for unspent to return to spend next?


[31-Oct-19 05:37 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
In Electrum mode MM2 waits until Electrum stops returning the previously spent utxo in unspents list, typically it takes few seconds so new change UTXO can be used even if it's unconfirmed.


[31-Oct-19 05:39 AM] smkhound#7640
very impressive. so maybe electrums are taking a beating and that is slowing it down a bit? and with early spend of change utxo, that can be broadcast, but can it be confirmed before previous confirmed? or at same time?


[31-Oct-19 05:46 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
The new UTXO spend can't be confirmed before previous is confirmed, yes. Depending on miners these spends can be included in same block or not I guess.
`so maybe electrums are taking a beating and that is slowing it down a bit?` - is this question related to current stress test?


[31-Oct-19 05:56 AM] smkhound#7640
yeah, something is definately stressed.


[31-Oct-19 06:06 AM] SHossain#0007
maybe the electrum servers?


[31-Oct-19 06:07 AM] SHossain#0007
i started few swaps on mobile. they didn't get any ordermatch after over 30 mins


[31-Oct-19 06:07 AM] SHossain#0007
so, cancelled them


[31-Oct-19 06:07 AM] SHossain#0007
this didn't happen in the past with normal conditions


[31-Oct-19 06:14 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
The problem is not caused by electrums, the issue is network throuput on seednodes, every connection is getting dropped possibly due to TCP send buffer overflow causing the `Resource temporarily unavailable (os error 11)` error.

[31-Oct-19 08:21 AM] Slyris#2880
@artem.pikulin We don't have a kind of a circular buffer for avoid the TCP buffer overflow ?


[31-Oct-19 08:50 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
As of now seednodes acts as "dummy" rebroadcaster for all messages which is very inefficient and using circular buffer won't help since the entire implementation is a bottleneck now. We will do a general refactoring of this before launching new stress tests.


[31-Oct-19 08:50 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
We can see that it's not scalable to even few hundreds of clients and active orders.


[31-Oct-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
do you have ideas on how to massively improve this?


[31-Oct-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
mm1 was able to handle a lot more load


[31-Oct-19 08:56 AM] Slyris#2880
We need to think about an efficient algorithm, something with channels


[31-Oct-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
one optimization is to only relay the best available prices


[31-Oct-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
that will reduce the traffic a lot and most people would only want the best prices anyway. if there is bandwidth available, more can be propagated. also, just including some offers with each packet is another way to help propagate


[31-Oct-19 08:59 AM] Slyris#2880
We can also build something lightweight on top of TCP


[31-Oct-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
and of course, a node connecting to a specific orderbook will work to isolate traffic from different orderbooks, but that only helps after a single orderbook can handle a large number


[31-Oct-19 09:00 AM] Slyris#2880
AFK 30 min when i comeback i will try to do some research


[31-Oct-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
any N*N traffic pattern will overload, so if each node is broadcasting to all other nodes, that will quickly saturate


[31-Oct-19 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
with mm1, i used a pub/sub connection from the seed nodes, so all the client nodes are pub/sub subscribers and each seed node broadcast only when it saw a new quote


[31-Oct-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i got it to where it was pretty efficient, so the total traffic within the relay nodes to sync all the relay nodes was very efficient, and each client node connected to just a few relay nodes and got the pub/sub broadcasts


[31-Oct-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
instead of N*N, we end up with 3*N packets


[31-Oct-19 10:03 AM] Slyris#2880
re


[31-Oct-19 10:04 AM] Slyris#2880
@jl777c It's actually a good idea, i didn't think about this way


[31-Oct-19 11:05 AM] SHossain#0007
the netid 9999 might have been congested due to all the traffic. i did a setup with a different netid and every swap completed there today from another node.


[31-Oct-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, hashing trading pairs to a different netid would allow things to scale to the limits that a single orderbook can handle, but that optimization is for after a single orderbook can be made scalable. handling multiple netid might be not so easy to achieve


[31-Oct-19 11:54 AM] SHossain#0007
i also did a test:
```
maker node - with `i_am_seed:true` on netid 9999
client node - used this ^^ seednode ip on 9999
```
swaps completed without issue. 
maybe if there is an option for end users to select better performing / capable / underloaded seed nodes might yield better results? (just an idea)


[31-Oct-19 11:55 AM] SHossain#0007
but, on my testnode i was the only person doing swaps. so, load wasn't that high. that might be the reason for me to not experience any issues


[31-Oct-19 12:40 PM] TonyL#3577
The code needs to be refactored as Artem said

{Reactions}
👍 

[31-Oct-19 11:27 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
The goal at the moment of implementation was to remove the nanomsg and replace it with pure Rust, the dummy broadcaster was the easiest way to implement and it worked well for small network, however it wasn't considered as long-term solution. The only question was how many concurrently working clients would bring the communication down.
```
with mm1, i used a pub/sub connection from the seed nodes, so all the client nodes are pub/sub subscribers and each seed node broadcast only when it saw a new quote
```
It's planned to refactor to something similar and make the nodes receive only the information they really require using a price range and maybe other filters. There's a tracking issue for this with possible implementation options: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/373

@pbca26 I saw this error while using <https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-reward-claim/#ledger-webusb> 
it happened when I clicked "check rewards" right after claiming rewards
the transaction might have been unconfirmed at that time

this was for a Ledger btw, even though the screen says Trezor


[03-Jan-20 07:29 AM] pbca26#5430
@gcharang it's exactly the same issue as acura posted yesterday on rewards channel
atomiclabs' explorer is broken, the fix is to use a different api endpoint via the cog icon


[03-Jan-20 07:31 AM] pbca26#5430
or it could be due to one or several failed requests


[03-Jan-20 07:32 AM] gcharang#6833
reward claim worked without any errors (I didn't change the api endpoint )
I am seeing this error when I click "check rewards" when there is an unconfirmed transaction

i've tried both https://github.com/SirSevenG/libnspv/releases/tag/5 and https://github.com/SirSevenG/libnspv/releases/tag/6
both crash with the same error
any idea what's wrong?
i'm using macos sierra 0.12.6

Hm, never've seen one.
They are build on macOS Catalina 10.15, so might be not compartible with older versions.
Do you have similair issues building libnspv?


[07-Feb-20 07:41 AM] SHossain#0007
it worked in Linux


[07-Feb-20 07:41 AM] pbca26#5430
no i don't have issues building locally, only with prebuilt binaries
is it possible to built it on an older macos version?
it will be nice if we can support a few versions back
not every user is up to date


[07-Feb-20 07:45 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Build is automated on GitHub Actions and they only provide latest macOS version.
To provide builds for older ones we will need actual sierra and other real machines to use as build runners... quite troublesome tbh.


[07-Feb-20 07:47 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Don't have mac at a hand to check for myself, yet friendly Google tells me that errors above are due to Xcode libraries versions, so I can't work around it on GHA.


[07-Feb-20 07:48 AM] gcharang#6833
haven't tried github actions yet, but travis ci seems to provide older OSX versions too
<https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/reference/osx/#macos-version>


[07-Feb-20 07:53 AM] Sir Seven#7158
It's not impossible to use travis for more macOS builds, we had issues running libnspv tests on travis before and choose Actions over it.
Guess, it's up for a discussion. @TonyL


[07-Feb-20 07:55 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Well, at least I'll update README regarding releases, so people will be aware.


[07-Feb-20 08:37 AM] pbca26#5430
got it to work on macos mojave but still a crash after a while
that's what i get after running via lldb

I'm not sure why we should consider building system changing because of crashes described above. For better compatibility own workers with older OSX needed. If last crash trace not related to building system additional investigation/isolation is needed


[07-Feb-20 08:54 AM] TonyL#3577
I'll prepare own OSX machine next week


[07-Feb-20 08:56 AM] Sir Seven#7158
`own workers with older OSX needed`
By traces, it should be fixed with different(older) OSX versions, well, Xcode versions. As far as I can judge.


[07-Feb-20 08:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Deterministic compatible OSX builds is open question for electrum-komodo as well, so we have to find some solution yep


[07-Feb-20 09:01 AM] Sir Seven#7158
A bit later electrum-komodo.dmg build artifacts will be available. We can check 'em on different macOS versions.


[07-Feb-20 09:01 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Working on it atm.


[07-Feb-20 09:02 AM] TonyL#3577
It'll be compatible only with Catalina most probable


[07-Feb-20 09:02 AM] Sir Seven#7158
electrum-komodo is python-based, think it should not have issues with Xcode libs.


[07-Feb-20 01:18 PM] TonyL#3577
@Sir Seven @smkhound when you have time could you please try following: 
on Android AtomicDEX (0.2.12) scan QR code of recipient address with a) enabled pin b) enabled biometric and say if it requesting auth on scan on your devices


[07-Feb-20 05:42 PM] smkhound#7640
Unfortunately my android has gone missing :(
Confirm both cases working as expected on iphone 7 though 👍🏻 
installed version on new phone this morning and it is 0.2.13


[07-Feb-20 08:47 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Android 10, works as expected.


[08-Feb-20 12:06 AM] TonyL#3577
@Sir Seven works as expected = it’s requesting protection? It’s a bug actually 😁


[08-Feb-20 12:07 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Oh. Lol


[08-Feb-20 12:08 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Yeah, asks both.
