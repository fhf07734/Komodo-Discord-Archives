If I want to make some web GUI have I use an Electrum?  
I've read that JSON-RPC isn't safe to use for a web-apps


[08-Oct-18 03:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for CC GUI? I think the good start would be with native


[08-Oct-18 03:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the current apps like Agama and BarterDEX and HyperDEX are made using combination of Electron + Node.js + HTML/CSS/Js/ReactJs


[08-Oct-18 03:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Electron bundles these as a desktop app to be cross os compatible


[08-Oct-18 03:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
right now I think Anything which is making some new users/testers let use CC is worth it


[08-Oct-18 03:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
even TUI of yours is great @TonyL

I have not done it but I believe if you sign the trx localy you can post it to an explorer or node that accepts such signed transactions.

keep extending and expanding it


[08-Oct-18 03:50 AM] TonyL#3577
@grewalsatinder yes, for CC - wanted to roll some dices


[08-Oct-18 03:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@CHMEX yes, possible to make SPV based CC GUI apps since that's the logic basically, sending signed tx

[08-Oct-18 04:02 AM] Mylo#8306
@TonyL lmk which API calls you want to make, i'll show you one solution.  i'll need to write them into the komodo-rpc-lib and then you proxy the request from browser to a node with CORS anywhere project running in front of.


[08-Oct-18 04:05 AM] TonyL#3577
@Mylo Ok, great! Atm I think it'll be just all dice CC calls such as a `dicelist` `diceinfo` `dicefund` `diceaddfunds` `dicebet` `dicefinish` `dicestatus`


[08-Oct-18 04:05 AM] Mylo#8306
ok dice, https://github.com/imylomylo/komodo-rpc-lib/blob/master/src/dice/index.js just needs params passed in.  not too much work.

[08-Oct-18 04:07 AM] Mylo#8306
but it is JS.  if you want to make equivalent py thing, we can test out how to do it in py.  using electrum has many advantages that the wallet devs will be able to tell you about, which i'm ignorant of because i like full node power üòÉ

Will be nice kickoff to enlarge the knowledge


[08-Oct-18 04:10 AM] Mylo#8306
ok - i'll prep some docs for setting up the env.
1.  docker net on local host to run two nodes to mine ACs on single machine
2. install CORS-anywhere
3. basic js in browser
@Bryan_Beus will be interested in this too.

haha ok.

```
You'll be dropped into a container.
That repo üëÜ  has two directories.
 1.  src/  has the Makefile to simplify repetitive commands it's just docker commands.
 2. node/ directory.  this gets mounted at ~/.komodo inside the container.

Your username in the container is `user` and the password is `pass`.  You have sudo access so you can `sudo su -` and then look at network stuff like `ifconfig` or `netstat  -ptan` etc.


[08-Oct-18 07:42 AM] Mylo#8306
You can `screen -S kmd` and type `komodod &` and it will start in `regtest` mode because that is the setting in `~/.komodo/komodo.conf`.
`^a d` will detach from that session.   alternatively you can ssh to your container.
in `regtest` mode you can do stuff like `komodo-cli generate 5` and will mine 5 blocks.

Enough about regtest mode.

Kill the container by `exit` and you get dropped back to your shell.

To create your own AC (network), comment out `regtest=1` in node/komodo.conf  (if you start a KMD daemon now it will connect to mainnet).

What you want is your own network in docker.  The `Makefile` has a `make` target called `acnet`.  So now you can:  `make acnet` then `make runacnet` for 1 container.  Then do it again for another container on the same docker network `make acnet` <-- probably in another terminal window.

If you `sudo ifconfig` in each, you get their ip address.
SSH server is not started by default atm.  so in each you will need to `/etc/init.d/ssh start` and then you can ssh to their docker network addresses, something like `172.19.0.2` and `172.19.0.3` from memory will be the first addresses on DHCP range.

Create your AC in each of those.

Is it because I ran it under `root` ?


[09-Oct-18 08:43 AM] Mylo#8306

Oh I see, thank you! @Mylo 
 `./zcutil/fetch-params.sh`which is in all guides for Komodo compiling seems to use $HOME env variable instead of $USER for ./zcash-params downloading.
Maybe will be useful for some super compatibility (if user set some exotic homedir for example or lamer like I which to lazy to use not root in test environments)

#!/bin/bash

set -eu

@Mylo ```So now you can:  make acnet then make runacnet for 1 container.  Then do it again for another container on the same docker network make acnet <-- probably in another terminal window.```

For me for second one worked ` make runacnet` but not `make acnet` 

For second `make acnet` get an error:
```~/docker-komodo-smartcontracts/src$ make acnet

[09-Oct-18 11:21 PM] Mylo#8306
ok you know what this error is?
kmd is trying to get a lock on a directory that already has a lock on it.
so to get around this, you specify at komodod startup -datadir=~/.komodo/node2_ac (and maybe with -conf=~/.komodo/node2_ac/thefile.conf)
First mkdir ~/.komodo/node2_ac
Some things the daemon isn't ready for automatically fixing itself, so you need to know how to help it @TonyL  üòÉ

tl;dr; daemon  hasn't been written to run same AC twice (or more) on one shared volume.  so you need to pass in datadir

Didn't know it's possible to set datadir on daemon startup. Thanks!

[09-Oct-18 11:24 PM] Mylo#8306
other option are in komodod -help or --help


[09-Oct-18 11:27 PM] Mylo#8306
you might need to cp config file manually into the datadir, can't remember.


[09-Oct-18 11:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, was able to start daemon this way (created directory and config file). Btw it's not worked with non obsolete path. :

OK i better make clearer instructions :D
this was the easy part!
The rest, is an npm install something, start it <--- no probs
The last bit before GUI/browser talking i need to make clear instructions to not waste your time.  I might make a coffee if that's ok and then spend it writing instructions/testing.  Maybe another hour, say 2 hours because you know - errors.

I usually rape check_output() by decode() and rstrip() and then do json.loads() to work as with dictionary


[12-Oct-18 02:35 AM] TonyL#3577
@Mylo So if I'll implement this my TUI will make RPC calls to komodod and remote servers will able to make RPC calls to my TUI? Like a interlayer


[12-Oct-18 02:52 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes.  Like TUI will be useful from host -> docker as well.
Further, in the case of @Deleted User TROLL chat chain, if you were to have a config TUI section (e.g. press 1 to configure, enter host, enter port, enter user, enter pass) he could run XX TUI processes in his tmux fantasy land and chat to himself to his hearts content across nodes üòõ

By removing the need to be ‚Äúon localhost‚Äù calling sub-process stuff and making it all within your py process and json network comms, you can then also think about making stuff with https://kivy.org/#home

I would create a small test.py script, use a json-rpc library with `getinfo` to make sure you can do it to localhost.   Then try from localhost -> docker.   Then convert TUI to that method, maybe in a new branch.  `git checkout -b networkcomms` whilst in dev

Cool, all new functions for my "library" I wrote to be not demand on from where input coming (TUI actually just implementation of this "library" with keyboard args input). So it should be scalable and easy to change for needed args receiving by RPC, or somewhere else). Can go ahead with RPC integration as soon as finish with gatewaysCC multisig testing process


[12-Oct-18 03:15 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes best way to make stuff you probably know MVC pattern (model view controller).  As a GUI, one of the kivy featured projects looks like this.   I would guess they have a good separation-of-concerns making GUI separate from any logic being an academic application for researchers - it looks good from the menu, it may give you an easy head start to making TUI a GUI - even with sub-process if you didn‚Äôt want to do the network comms part.  https://trifusion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/limitations.html

Hehe yes.  But it‚Äôs a very necessary part in the development cycle, quick iterations.
MVC,
Model = database
View = GUI
Controller = your library

Blockchain, View, Tony‚Äôs Library.   Same application architecture, your library is what komodo-rpc-lib is in JavaScript when done with json-rpc.

At the moment python in the browser is not popular but it looks like steps in making python->WASM (web assembly) is already happening.

The more generalized rpc-libs in different languages the more availability to developers to make applications.  Js, python.   Splitting python workload across a few community members and the 200+ komodo RPC methods will be done.

[12-Oct-18 03:38 AM] Mylo#8306
Also the beauty is with a komodo-rpc-lib-js & komodo-rpc-lib-py they are compatible with VRSC.  Taking to the next step, because kmd rpc has more than other coins, the libraries can be used for other coins (with some configuration modification).  And re-using james‚Äô bitmask calculations, where:
KMD = 1
VRSC = 2
ZEC= 4
HUSH = 8
EMC2 = 16

A method in the rpc library with a compatibility value of ‚Äú3‚Äù could be called for a KMD/VRSC application.   If a different method (say MoMoM) has a value of 27, then all but ZEC supports this method call for a GUI application to use.
```
0001 1011 <‚Äî from R to L (right to left), KMD, VRSC, ZEC, HUSH, EMC2 
```


[12-Oct-18 03:39 AM] Mylo#8306
Use the bits as switches (on/off) for support.  Assign each bit to a coin.  Whether it can be used with the method.

@Bryan_Beus read up a bit and that's the gist of what we are doing in both js and python.  fill in the gaps where you want/can - the js code has stubbed out methods waiting for implementation.  the python stuff needs porting from sub-process (spawning an external command) to network commands.   and we're off to the races!

Hi @Mylo ! Your gist worked for me with some additional dependencies before execute ` pip3 install "jsonrpcclient[requests]"`
 ```sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools 
pip3 install wheel```

Have same error with schema validation. Looks like it's not python problem but validation when matching with this schema http://json-schema.org/draft-04/schema

As I understand Komodo RPC uses JSON-RPC 1.0 interface while this lib works only with JSON-RPC 2.0 and matching with this schema 

Tried to disable schema verification:
`response = client.send('{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "method": "getinfo", "id": 1, "params": []}', verify=False,  headers={"content-type": "application/json-rpc"})` but same error

Gonna search for another rpc lib

@Deleted User @patchkez 
I want to make Python RPC library similar to this https://github.com/imylomylo/komodo-rpc-lib on top of this one https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc
And thinking now regards code organisation to make it really usable.
What is the best practice to include this  https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc library to mine and how better place my modules for different stuff?
I wonder maybe there is some PEP recommendations for such stuff.
Thank you in advance!

[17-Oct-18 03:35 PM] Mylo#8306
check what you're doing - looks like it's getting a lot more complex than just talking to RPC which just uses strings and numbers.

for instance, dumpprivkey using RPC returns a string. 

WIth pter todd's python library, wants to return a bitcoin.base58.CBase58Data or something i don't even want to know is compatible with some library i don't really want to maintain as a dApp developer.  https://github.com/petertodd/python-bitcoinlib/blob/master/bitcoin/wallet.py#L237

I just want to talk RPC to komodo interface over network.   simple auth, function(params) returns simple data of strings and numbers.

remove the need to read a file, you just want to configure RPC "on the fly" because the different ACs that will want to use oracles etc.

Other projects don't have this "on the fly" talk to ACs, which you identified as a problem configuring for each AC.

That's my 2c.

Fork it and just put in your oractelist method.  it should work no dramas

You can use komodo-cli to fetch the rpcport... Or you can read the .conf file to extract all needed data... I'm not so sure how easy it in in python but I have bash scripts where all I need to give it is the name of the ac... And everything works out of the boz


[17-Oct-18 06:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
For a lot ofy stuff ATM, I'm using bash scripts to pass python scripts data or vice versa...

There seems to be no other simple wat to do it, and using already working code saves endless time.


[17-Oct-18 09:52 PM] Mylo#8306
yes simple wrapper to RPC in every language is preferable without reading a .conf file, just passing in user, pass, host:port.   it has less baggage than everything else for a 1st step of developer tools.


[17-Oct-18 10:10 PM] Mylo#8306
nothing.  just don't hard code the path to remain flexible.


[17-Oct-18 10:11 PM] Mylo#8306
is my request.  it will add unnecessary support questions


[17-Oct-18 10:12 PM] Mylo#8306
time wasted for developers if it needs to be in ~/.komodo/ACNAME/ACNAME.conf or equiv in other OSes


[17-Oct-18 10:12 PM] Mylo#8306
But for remote TUI, all is needed is pass in user/pass.


[17-Oct-18 10:15 PM] Mylo#8306
the dApp devs can store their credentials. dictating where to store a config file by hard-coding the location limits the flexibility.  a web developer does not have access to the file system, has to pass in config params.

If your using a devoplemt chain, why not have the RPC/USER pass passed to the daemon on start, and have it write those to the file intead of random ones ?

In gateways TUI I've only used tokencreate and tokenlist to printout list on screen

Not sure how it'll be on JS but in python to save tokenlist to file is like a 
```
tokenlist = rpc.tokenlist()
with open(newfile, 'a') as file:
    for token in tokenlist
    file.writelines(token + "\n")

Maybe store this file on server side with some updatable "tokens_amount" param?


[26-Oct-18 09:39 AM] TonyL#3577
And from client side you'll check every X minutes if tokens_amount on client side < than tokens_amount on server side
If it's differ server give to client needed amount of lines and you append it to cache - should work since tokenids ordered in tokenlist (new ones append to the end)

One quick suggestion I need is if I store and keep updated value of tokenlist in a  separate key, and each tokeninfo in a separate tokenhash as key


[26-Oct-18 09:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm jusing key/value db


[26-Oct-18 09:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can do two ways:
- query tokenlist > update key `tokenlist` with it's array.
 - loop query this tokenlist array and store the info as a object under each hash array in this existing key.
 like
```{
  "tokenlist": [
    {"hash1": "tokeninfo_as_value_to_it"},
    {"hash2": "tokeninfo_as_value_to_it"},
    {"hash3": "tokeninfo_as_value_to_it"},
  ]
}```


[26-Oct-18 09:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or just save each separately.


[26-Oct-18 09:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```{
  "tokenlist": [
    "hash1",
    "hash2",
    "hash3"
  ]
}

{"hash1": "token_info_here"}

{"hash2": "token_info_here"}

{"hash3": "token_info_here"}```

@grewalsatinder I guess more effective will be get tokeinfo for needed tokenid by demand. Hmm but depends of displaying logic for sure üòÉ


[26-Oct-18 12:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
üßê for that I have to rethink the UI display part


[26-Oct-18 12:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess a token subscription part will do  it


[26-Oct-18 12:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
User will search and subscribe to that token list


[26-Oct-18 12:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Just like the old NXT days


[26-Oct-18 12:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The ideal way I wanted to see it was to display the list with name, supply etc in a pages table views


[26-Oct-18 12:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Click on the token and open further orders etc

maybe a faucet app is a good place to start?


[02-Nov-18 05:13 AM] siu#3920
i was thinking that rewards cc would be the simplest to integrate in a GUI (but im no coder)


[02-Nov-18 05:14 AM] siu#3920
since the function is to lock coins and later unlock them, doenst seem like it needs a lot of interfaces developed.


[02-Nov-18 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
faucet is easier

it would be useful to cache the kvsearch responses instead of making the calls every loop


[02-Nov-18 08:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Not yet - that's why it's loading 10 seconds on start (getting list of rooms)

[02-Nov-18 09:07 AM] Alright#0419
global batonid?

Yeah, when I switch room in rooms list changing param `active_room_id =`
And app every 0.5 seconds grabbing oraclesdata with depth 1 for the current batontxid
If batontxid is the same as previous it's not displaying message (not adding to array with messages actually)

There is nothing specific for CC in deals with Electrums I think since just RPC calls using


[02-Jan-19 07:38 AM] TonyL#3577

@TonyL @siu I'm not very familiar with electrum. Does it support just sending raw hex?

or will it flip out if we try to use a cryptocondition vin/vout

there is a sendrawtransaction ability


[02-Jan-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
but the problem is to be able to properly sign CC vout

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, built a cool (or not so cool) GUI or even a TUI using  CCs, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and maybe inspire some people.

Here's my current PR for the 3rd party resource Docs page, feel free to check it out and let me know if I missed anything, or if you want to add something you've been working on, or even just threw together. Ideally I'd like to have a GUI or TUI for every CC, and if possible a proof of concept using the CC for something.
