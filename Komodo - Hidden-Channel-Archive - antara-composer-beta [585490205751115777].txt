is there a way to revive a pending order? It's in order history as `awaiting payment`, but cant see how to get back to the cart with it loaded up

[20-Jun-19 04:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Have you made payment? @smkhound  Actually this status "Awaiting payment" is when you initiated payment with coinpayments but chainlizard not received it yet


[20-Jun-19 04:08 AM] smkhound#7640
I made one a couple days ago, went into coinpayments, then used "back" in browser.


[20-Jun-19 04:08 AM] smkhound#7640
it returned to an empty cart, so I made another


[20-Jun-19 04:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so maybe some timeout is needed


[20-Jun-19 04:08 AM] smkhound#7640
paid for the second one


[20-Jun-19 04:09 AM] smkhound#7640

There are two channels so if we write different things in two channels it quite confusing

[20-Jun-19 06:39 AM] TonyL#3577
I see


[20-Jun-19 06:39 AM] naezith#9757
though you put the link `You can view the status of this payment or leave feedback for the seller for the next 30 days at https://gocps.net/4xb6nk5aotkd2zy7t2y1xrn0l/ `


[20-Jun-19 06:39 AM] naezith#9757
I don't have that ID neither


[20-Jun-19 06:39 AM] naezith#9757
they only exist in email I think


[20-Jun-19 06:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Btw payment window is 2 hours


[20-Jun-19 06:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's too long to store chain in "awaiting payment" status for 3 days. After 2 hours we can give user possiblity to re-initiate payment for same chain params


[20-Jun-19 06:43 AM] naezith#9757
that 2 hours is not same for all currencies I think


[20-Jun-19 06:43 AM] naezith#9757
there is even paypal option for example

[20-Jun-19 06:43 AM] naezith#9757
is this good?


[20-Jun-19 06:43 AM] naezith#9757
basically


[20-Jun-19 06:44 AM] naezith#9757
if you opened that coinpayments page but did not continue, then it is stuck in `Awaiting payment` state


[20-Jun-19 06:44 AM] naezith#9757
which you can open again from here


[20-Jun-19 06:44 AM] naezith#9757
and initiated ones, `check your inbox for coinpayments email`


[20-Jun-19 06:45 AM] naezith#9757
that email has the `continue paying` link


[20-Jun-19 06:45 AM] naezith#9757
or status whatever


[20-Jun-19 06:45 AM] naezith#9757
and if it times out at coinpayments side, then user needs to go through chain creation again


[20-Jun-19 06:46 AM] TonyL#3577
imo it looks good - since there is possiblity to initiate payment if user accidently closed coinpayments tab but haven't sent funds (Pay with coinpayments button on picture) and also instruction where to find information where to get information if funds were sent


[20-Jun-19 06:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Sad that its not possible to generate same link for payment status page as coinpayments sending in email


[20-Jun-19 06:51 AM] naezith#9757
@ca333 coinpayments support requires login, can you ask them if this is possible?


[20-Jun-19 06:52 AM] naezith#9757
they send an email with `view transaction status & continue`


[20-Jun-19 06:52 AM] naezith#9757
url


[20-Jun-19 06:52 AM] naezith#9757
and I need to construct the same url


[20-Jun-19 06:52 AM] naezith#9757
I have transaction ID but not the viewing key


[20-Jun-19 07:00 AM] naezith#9757
I checked again @TonyL some transactions don't send that 'failed/timed out' notification


[20-Jun-19 07:33 AM] naezith#9757
update
```
- Did some minor changes which might have fixed "ERROR: No 'merchant' set in the button!" error.
- All status icons in Create Chain page are grey by default now.
- Added Pay with CoinPayments button to Orders page, allows user to initiate payment for orders with "Awaiting Payment" state.
- Cart redirects to orders page if it's empty.
```


[20-Jun-19 07:34 AM] naezith#9757
can someone test that pay button in orders page


[20-Jun-19 07:50 AM] TonyL#3577
working fine on my side @naezith


[20-Jun-19 08:45 AM] ca333#0333
yes will check with coinpayments @naezith - plz DM me the exact request

that's not good


[21-Jun-19 03:52 AM] naezith#9757
that's before the name patch I guess, lemme check


[21-Jun-19 03:52 AM] jl777c#5810
what if we get 100+ chains started at the same time? or lifetime? we cant have such small limits


[21-Jun-19 03:52 AM] naezith#9757
you mean 20 instances limit?


[21-Jun-19 03:53 AM] ca333#0333
@jl777c i set that limit.


[21-Jun-19 03:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so how many customers can be handled?


[21-Jun-19 03:54 AM] ca333#0333
we are currently using a virtual prices for chain-creation so that our team can test - a chain with full setup costs 0.1 USD for full integration. This is just to ensure that for the case that someone gets the URL wont be able to spam us and cause high costs on our AWS infra. 

Once the internal tests are considered finished i will update the prices to the real ones and remove that limit. So even if someone wants to spam us it will result in good revenue for us.


[21-Jun-19 03:55 AM] ca333#0333
tl;dr - the 20 instance limit is a spam prevention due to the low-price we set for the test-phase (0.1 USD per chain).


[21-Jun-19 03:56 AM] ca333#0333
@naezith i just saw a redundant chain-name above - did you check that?


[21-Jun-19 03:56 AM] naezith#9757
which one


[21-Jun-19 03:57 AM] ca333#0333
`PUBKEY1`


[21-Jun-19 03:58 AM] naezith#9757
tony launched that, though as I said it is not supposed to be doubled


[21-Jun-19 03:58 AM] naezith#9757
I was checking it atm


[21-Jun-19 04:00 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so when in production, we can scale arbitrarily high

üëçüèº ‚úÖ 

[21-Jun-19 04:08 AM] naezith#9757
one thing is still in to do list:  cleaning of tools when the chain is deleted


[21-Jun-19 04:09 AM] naezith#9757
like the name is being inserted to all those repos, pull requests etc.


[21-Jun-19 04:22 AM] naezith#9757
okay I figured out the chain being launched twice


[21-Jun-19 04:23 AM] naezith#9757
not a bug. I was running the server on my local computer too at that time, so that order got processed on my pc too before it was marked as `launched`


[21-Jun-19 04:25 AM] naezith#9757

- Changed AWS Instance AMI
- Moved CoinPayments merchant_id to .env

that's why nodes could not connect

when I launch AWS instance, I wait 30 seconds, then ask for `public_ip`. that was enough for all the chains so far. seems like it wasn't ready for GirlPower. I'll make it ask over and over again until `public_ip` is there

In Development and Testing

Proof of Stake (PoS) chains are available from the command line of Komodo's software but are still in the process of being integrated to the Antara Blockchain Composer. For now, your Smart Chain will be 100% Proof of Work (PoW).

Make sure verushash11 or assetchains n and k works so they have some kind of asic resistance or their chain is prone to stalling attacks


[27-Jun-19 02:12 AM] Alright#0419
100% POW on normal equihash is very insecure unless the chain expects a decent amount of hashrate


[27-Jun-19 02:12 AM] Alright#0419
I'd say don't allow it at all or slap massive warnings on it


[27-Jun-19 02:16 AM] Alright#0419
I can censor all transactions on a low diff equihash chain.  Could probably do about 20 chains at once with a single z9 mini. Also you can stall one indefinitely with about $10 of nicehash or a GPU. It takes manually fixing or days(possibly longer) for it to unstall


[28-Jun-19 11:06 AM] naezith#9757
alright, I'm done with the tool cleanup at chain deletion


[28-Jun-19 11:06 AM] naezith#9757
I did couple tests, it was fine


[28-Jun-19 11:09 AM] naezith#9757
changes: 

```
- Chain creation asks AWS for public_ip over and over again to make sure it gets one.
- Fixed ac_supply=0 was not allowed server-side.
- Miner Node reports balance after block 129.
- Sending email about atomicDEX Listing and atomicDEX Mobile Wallet Listing when a chain is killed.
- Disabling SPV Server when chain is killed.
- Renamed "The server is down" to "Connection Failure" because it also happens when client connection drops.
- Disallowed Proof of Stake chain creation.
- Disabling Wallet and dPoW when chain is killed, tool clean-up is done.

@naezith what do you mean it must wait until block 129?


[29-Jun-19 11:32 PM] naezith#9757
lets say we entered ac_supply 250000,


[29-Jun-19 11:32 PM] naezith#9757
gen node gets them all at 128


[29-Jun-19 11:32 PM] naezith#9757
then sends them to the provided KMD wallet address


[29-Jun-19 11:32 PM] naezith#9757
then mines one more block for that transaction


[29-Jun-19 11:33 PM] naezith#9757
at 129, I make "withdraw coins" button show up in the chain page


[29-Jun-19 11:33 PM] naezith#9757
which sends whole balance on demand


[29-Jun-19 11:35 PM] jl777c#5810
for chains with big supply (over 10 billion) the coins are generated 1 billion per block. also you cant send more than 10 billion in a single tx

I don't remember jl or ca told me about it for a long time but I think that's when premining of initial supply completes, no?

ondemand chains stop mining at 128


[30-Jun-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
anything less than 100 is very easy to fork, so best to do at least 100.

128 seems fine

- CoinPayments button won't react more than once when spammed.
- Delete warning modal for DEX Articles.
- Using CSS em for everything, setting font-size to anything makes it look correct.
- Did a full test, chain creation and deletion works without any flaw. Definitely needs more testing though
- Fixed some img sizes.
- Safari: Fixed Generator Top Bar was breaking after making the window big and then small again.
- Safari: Fixed @media max-width values were not matching with Javascript window width, breaking the layout.
- Safari: Fixed ( - 2 + ) node count button was broken.
- Using - and + characters instead of collapse and expand imgs for node count incremental input.
- Fixed price was too small in order page for extra small screens.
- Added page loading icon to Chain Details page.
- Email field in Password Reset page is being filled automatically.
- Added Recovery code for 2FA.
- Fixed 'Require Fresh Auth' was not working properly if 2FA was enabled.

Btw all params summary review before launch and message like a "Are you sure that you want to start chain with the following params" might be helpful


[03-Jul-19 06:02 PM] TonyL#3577
But from code above it's obv that private only chain will not start, yep


[03-Jul-19 06:06 PM] Alright#0419
it is an arbitrary limitation, could ask jl to remove it


[03-Jul-19 06:07 PM] Alright#0419
doubt anyone will use it, but I don't see why it should be limited for the sake of promoting pirate


[03-Jul-19 11:54 PM] naezith#9757
okay so I am removing `-ac_private` option, right? @ca333


[03-Jul-19 11:59 PM] naezith#9757
@TonyL those TONY1 chain issues are not about CL right? one of them is about komodod, and other one is Explorer.  `komodod -ac_name=TONYL1 -ac_supply=250000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_end=0 -ac_halving=1000000 -ac_decay=50000000 -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_pubkey=02f76e2d7122dd3c731d15b845337826ce636a43d016e0eaf427fa53894ffdd957 -addnode=34.253.224.167 &`


[04-Jul-19 12:04 AM] TonyL#3577
CL as a product combines webinterface, SPV, explorer and komodod so it's global product issues, but not web-interface ones, yep
Not understand why blocks generating so not consistent, would be great to check nodes logs/state

connected my node and generated few blocks without problems -  so probably something is not ok with mining  (-gen) node

when you have time - could you please connect to it and check:

`./komodo-cli -ac_name=TONYL1 getpeerinfo`

keep private param @naezith - no params modification unless it leads to critical states.


[04-Jul-19 12:59 AM] TonyL#3577
so it seems daemon on mining node hanged. it generated 321 blocks, then stopped and as I understand daemon not response now on mining node (it's not related to -ac_private issue - usual chain)


[04-Jul-19 12:59 AM] naezith#9757
@ca333 chain does not launch at all

ouch - @jl777c why -we had private chain feature from the beginning and as a feature requirement.


[04-Jul-19 01:01 AM] naezith#9757
am I removing it or not


[04-Jul-19 01:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it creates a chain that will have a LOT of support issues, also technically its anon set cant be that big and wont have the effect people want


[04-Jul-19 01:03 AM] jl777c#5810
also none of the other features will work. exchange integrations are a nightmare, etc.


[04-Jul-19 01:03 AM] naezith#9757
if I remove it, we will have two options: "Public and Private" which does not put any params to komodod. and "Public only" which adds `-ac_public=1`


[04-Jul-19 01:04 AM] ca333#0333
@naezith in this case remove the mess

{Reactions}
üëç 

[04-Jul-19 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe public only vs private available? just a bit of language to denote taddr only vs taddr/zaddr


[04-Jul-19 01:07 AM] jl777c#5810
the GUI could always restrict to zaddr only, but as it is i dont think the wallets will fully support zaddr?

@ca333 Artem asking you to check DM asap


[04-Jul-19 01:08 AM] ca333#0333
it would have been a good feature to have, specially for R&D or test chains - AS discussed before we developed CL. anyway - we can orientate towards ‚Äòtechnically non indicated‚Äô deprecation - not a biggie for us.


[04-Jul-19 01:08 AM] jl777c#5810

[04-Jul-19 02:11 AM] TonyL#3577
@naezith could you please check `htop` on mining node (loading on CPU and RAM)? Seems it started to generate blocks again - maybe it have not enough resources because of mining thats why daemon not react on RPC calls

I see, thank you üëç I propose to use multithread CPU instance for mining node


[04-Jul-19 02:22 AM] TonyL#3577
100% loading on CPU explains temporary mining issues


[04-Jul-19 02:23 AM] TonyL#3577
t2.small have only 1 vCPU so even if you mine on 1 thread it's loaded fully


[04-Jul-19 02:23 AM] TonyL#3577
At least t2.medium with 2 vCPU is better - possible to generate blocks on 1 core and second core will do other stuff

okay

maybe show it by default on form opening until user enter valid address? it's just a little bit confusing imo that message about valid address input appears when I'm starting to input ticker

can't

[12-Jul-19 02:53 AM] TonyL#3577

is your firefox updated


[12-Jul-19 07:32 AM] TonyL#3577
yes `68.0 (64-bit) ` it's latest release (released just July 9)


[12-Jul-19 07:33 AM] TonyL#3577
but it worked before update same way - there are deps interconnected with firefox (gnome partially lets say as I understand) - maybe it's really deps issue


[12-Jul-19 08:48 AM] Mylo#8306
if.... you're using `display: flexbox;` in css, firefox doesn't play well with flexbox.   `display: block` will work better, but this will make something small change in chrome - which can be fixed by another minor edit, then it all works fine. 
else....ignore if you're not using flexbox


[12-Jul-19 11:14 PM] naezith#9757
no flexbox but this. 

```
display: flex !important; 
justify-content: center !important; 
align-items: center !important;
``` @Mylo


[12-Jul-19 11:15 PM] Mylo#8306
yes that's the one, let me search discord for previous suggestion to flex problem with firefox.


[12-Jul-19 11:18 PM] Mylo#8306
`display: block;` and it will break 2 very small things in chrome which are easy to fix with chrome dev tools for that section.

Public dashboard is the page with infomration about blockchain (same blockchain info page as user can see inside of composer but detached and without chain deletion feature)


[15-Jul-19 04:52 AM] TonyL#3577
`2. What is the difference between AtomicDEX listing and AtomicDEX mobile wallet listing? I guess nothing at this point so we should just keep AtomicDEX listing for now` 
I wonder just AtomicDEX listing supposes steps to make coin compatible with mm2 protocol (coin params/electrums pr to coins repo for example), but it's better to confirm with @ca333 
On this stage this option is a stub I think.


[15-Jul-19 04:53 AM] TonyL#3577
As a hot fix maybe make options which do nothing atm grey/inactive with "coming soon" in text?


[15-Jul-19 04:54 AM] ca333#0333
atomicdex mobile listing is the listing into the mobile dex app

atomicdex listing is adding the coin and logo to coins list of supported coins on atomicdex repo and running a swap test


[15-Jul-19 05:00 AM] TS#7923
@TonyL is this public dashboard live / ready? Can you show me an example?


[15-Jul-19 05:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it's ready. Unfortunately I can't show example right now because a) website migrating b) all my blockchains were deleted


[15-Jul-19 05:00 AM] TonyL#3577
let me try to find some screenshot


[15-Jul-19 05:01 AM] TS#7923
@ca333 I think we should join the two options for now while we are still in beta, what do you think? I can mention both in the copy.


[15-Jul-19 05:17 AM] TonyL#3577
So dashboard in general is the page like this: https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/585490205751115777/596129777241554945/unknown.png?width=1391&height=597

@SHossain Could you please contact coinpayments? It looks like KMD payments not working from their side at the moment (most probably it's hardfork related because just 2 days ago I paid fine).

Example of problem payment (I paid full sum to provided adress but payment status never changed, with DOGE payment was smooth):

‚úÖ 

[17-Jul-19 02:04 AM] jl777c#5810
most of the CC are built in and that would work, for the ones like dilithium that are in a libcc, you need to link in that libcc, or maybe there are just a few prebuilt komodod with each libcc


[17-Jul-19 03:53 AM] ca333#0333
yes - we will add CC (Antara modules) next together with dynamic timeframes (3 - N months) for the chain-subscriptions.


[17-Jul-19 06:58 AM] naezith#9757
composer does not use `ac_ccenable` for now


[17-Jul-19 06:58 AM] naezith#9757
only `ac_cc`


[17-Jul-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
that would enable them all, which is ok too, if that is what the customer wants

I am not sure if it is intentional, but the clusters section doesn't indicate that it enables Antara modules.

Is it possible to change the section name to "Antara Modules"
and add the options N=0 and N=1 too ? (for the cases: disable antara modules and enable antara modules but disable crosschain stuff)

Also the description of "Non-fungible" case should have: "less than 100"
and "fungible" case should have: "greater than 99"

anything else?


[20-Jul-19 06:57 AM] Alright#0419
if the chain is meant to be fungible with others, it requires dpow and the number must be reserved


[20-Jul-19 06:58 AM] Alright#0419
so like if one customer makes ac_cc=312 chain, no other chains can use 312 unless that customer allows it

{Reactions}
‚òù 

[20-Jul-19 07:13 AM] Alright#0419
0 should not be a valid value btw, that is the equivalent of not setting ac_cc at all


[22-Jul-19 09:05 AM] gcharang#6833
@naezith 

my suggestion is:

```
Section name: Antara modules

Show 3 options
- Antara modules disabled ---> don't include  "-ac_cc" in the chain params at all
- Antara modules enabled but no crosschain validation ---> "-ac_cc=1" (a chain that doesn't want to scale at all)
- Antara modules enabled and crosschain validation is also enabled.
  |   If this case is selected, then show these two sub options
  | - non-fungible case ---> "-ac_cc=N" N >= 2 and <= 99 (chains that can interact with other chains to create some complex logic like fitbit tokens transfering to a insurance chain to activate an Antara module)
  | - fungible case ---> "-ac_cc=N" N >= 100 (chains that can scale and increase their txn/sec)
```
@Alright can you confirm the above description is correct?


[22-Jul-19 09:07 AM] Alright#0419
it's correct


[22-Jul-19 09:07 AM] Alright#0419
nothing really uses momom over than burn protocol right now, so 2-99 is just future proofing


[22-Jul-19 09:12 AM] naezith#9757
okay I can do the changes, do you approve @ca333 ?

```
@gcharang @naezith maybe mention this requires dpow


[22-Jul-19 09:16 AM] naezith#9757
current system does not check if dpow is in same cart


[22-Jul-19 09:16 AM] naezith#9757
since dpow is added after all these stuff are selected


[22-Jul-19 09:20 AM] gcharang#6833
@naezith if the third option 
```
Antara modules enabled and crosschain validation is also enabled.
```
is selected, mention there that subscribing to dPoW is mandatory in the selection screen

Later in the cart, if the user tries to go to the Payment screen without adding dPoW, throw an error saying "either select dPoW or go back to change the Antara module to the `-ac_cc=1` case"?


[22-Jul-19 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
it's a weird situation because nothing actually uses momom right now other than burn protocol


[22-Jul-19 09:32 AM] Alright#0419
a default value of ac_cc=2 would work for 99% of people


[22-Jul-19 09:33 AM] Alright#0419
practically, there is no difference between ac_cc=1 and ac_cc=2 right now


[22-Jul-19 09:34 AM] Alright#0419
the reserving any ac_cc value >99 is vitally important btw


[22-Jul-19 09:34 AM] Alright#0419
so if you can't do that right now, wouldn't support >99 for now


[22-Jul-19 09:36 AM] Alright#0419
Let's say Alice makes new coin with ac_cc=101, if Bob can create another ac_cc=101 chain and have it added to the same dpow network, Bob can make millions of coins on his chain and import them to Alice's

now I need to definition or implementation of `smaller amounts`


[03-Aug-19 07:30 AM] naezith#9757
what is the highest safe amount


[03-Aug-19 07:56 AM] naezith#9757
and will it be same for all chains
this value I'll find


[03-Aug-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
you can use about 500 inputs

so if it is mining and has a lot of block rewards 500x blockreward would be the cap


[03-Aug-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
all depends on actual utxos


[03-Aug-19 08:32 AM] naezith#9757
`1000` works


[03-Aug-19 08:32 AM] naezith#9757
I'll set it 500 then


[03-Aug-19 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no one size fits all


[03-Aug-19 08:36 AM] naezith#9757
what should I do then


[03-Aug-19 08:37 AM] naezith#9757
something smaller like 100?


[03-Aug-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
for 250,000?


[03-Aug-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
i would try to send all, if it fails, send half


[03-Aug-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if that fails send quarter


[03-Aug-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
until it works


[03-Aug-19 09:34 AM] naezith#9757
okay so there is no pure math we can get from supply or something


[03-Aug-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
depends on exact state of wallet


[03-Aug-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the limit is that each tx cant be larger than 200kb


[03-Aug-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
each input needs to be signed, so that is 120 bytes or so, but depending on the type of input, can be a lot bigger


[03-Aug-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
its like trying to figure out exactly how many drops of rain a specific area on earth will get, and not knowing where or when


[05-Aug-19 12:45 AM] gcharang#6833
I am not sure if it is clear, the problem is not the "amount of coins"; atleast not directly
the actual problem is the number of inputs the total value is in

Ex: 250000 coins available in 1 input vs 1000 inputs that each have 250 coins
the transaction to send 250000 in the first case will be very small (in terms of data size)
the transaction to send 250000 in the second case is very large(in terms of data size) as it needs to include details about 1000 different inputs and sign all of them

as there is a limit on the maximum size a transaction can be, the above difference matters


[05-Aug-19 02:30 AM] gcharang#6833
you could run this script or similar: https://github.com/TheComputerGenie/Misc_Stuff/blob/master/Wallet%20stuff/Consolidate.sh
on a crontab to consolidate the coins from a large number of utxos on mining nodes

@naezith 
that looks correct

for the first option, 
```
don't include -ac_cc in the chain parameters at all
```
that would disable Antara modules

Regarding the texts, the content is accurate. @Daniel CP would be of more help making the copy better


[06-Aug-19 01:43 AM] naezith#9757
yeah it does `don't include -ac_cc in the chain parameters at all`

@TonyL 
here is an update which might create issues:

```
- Reimplemented "Antara Modules" UI.
- Improved ticker input box, space and letters like ≈û √á √ñ are not being typed.
- Tiny UI tweaks.
- Fixed and tested the withdraw issue fully.
- Added Subscription Month Selectors to Cart Page, Cart Sidebar and Tools Page.
- Changed prices.
- Website is served built/statically instead of in development mode.
```


[07-Aug-19 10:52 AM] naezith#9757
so now we have subscription length option


[07-Aug-19 10:52 AM] naezith#9757
1-3-6-12 months


[07-Aug-19 10:53 AM] naezith#9757
though subscription is not implemented on server-side yet


[07-Aug-19 10:54 AM] naezith#9757
like they don't cancel after 1 month atm, that's the next thing I'll be working on now


[07-Aug-19 10:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Thank you for updates @naezith ! For now we're fine with video I shown you yesterday. I can help to fully test subscription logic when it's ready and make another one with different scenario - lets say another business case with some tricky rewards scheme and monthly payments

I reset password, and after a couple min got reset link. Entered/confirmed new password, screen says to check email for verification link. 30 min later, still no email. 
Clicked resend... waiting.


[08-Aug-19 02:17 AM] smkhound#7640
Is email verification after password reset neccessary? Seems duplicate action after already using the password reset link which was emailed to same address.


[08-Aug-19 02:25 AM] smkhound#7640
verification link arrived after manual resent button clicked.
email link text != href makes spam detection unhappy

- confirm space and special chars not being input for ticker.
- suggest dynamic $ value next to subscription item values, and column each for monthly / total for item
 - cancel and return from coinpayments page clears pending chain order (not sue if intended, just mentioning). Assuming payment works, did not test.


[09-Aug-19 02:31 AM] naezith#9757
I thought about this but there is no space in the row `- suggest dynamic $ value next to subscription item values, and column each for monthly / total for item`

email verification should occur only if you didn't do email verification before

I recall having some problem recieving the verification link testing early on, I think I used gmail on the second attempt to get in so that makes sense. The address used last night probably wasnt verified until yesterday

that "You need at least two nodes to run a Smart Chain" is now the "Base Nodes"


[06-Sep-19 07:02 AM] naezith#9757
though I think we should hide that "two" so quantity will be a mystery

btw the site is updated, now we have Subscription working fully.  also it's possible now to add new tools and nodes, or extend the tool subscription of existing chains

Sorry, forgot to get this done over the weekend


[09-Sep-19 02:56 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I still need a bit more context. What is the difference between Base Nodes and Nodes?


[09-Sep-19 02:57 AM] Daniel CP#2020
If we are requiring two base nodes for every Smart Chain, would it make sense to remove that from the UI completely? And just encourage people to add more nodes?


[09-Sep-19 03:05 AM] naezith#9757
since we have subscription system, nodes get terminated when subscription expires. but we need two base nodes to stay alive because the tools depend on them. so we have a fixed price for the base nodes which will live as long as chain is alive, and extra nodes can be created and expire/die separately @Daniel CP

@wolfgang what type of competition is it going to be? Also are the participants developer heavy or not really? This is to give me an idea of what is the best fit for you. Generally Antara is the simplest route and the best looking as you can get the wallet, explorers, etc with Antara. 

If your community is heavy developers they may be more interested in the nitty gritty parts of it, and you may want to explore the documentation for command line interface. However this wouldn't be a great route if you prefer everyone to be able to have their coins on mobile wallets.


[24-Oct-19 06:06 AM] Regnar#6164
If the coins are rewards for a competition, and it isn't something like a blockchain developer competition, I would suggest Antara. That will give you the coins, the wallets, the explorers, basically everything you need to provide coins as rewards and for your community to interact with them, hodl, send them, trade, check them out on explorers, the user friendly crypto experience.

@ca333 is definitely the go to here for walking you through Antara and making sure it is the right fit for you and your goals if you would prefer to discuss your plans in a less public channel.


[24-Oct-19 06:16 AM] ca333#0333
Feel free to contact me if you have any more questions @wolfgang - @Regnar just explained it perfectly. 
Antara lets you set up your blockchain/token, the entire minimal infrastructure to form a p2p network, blockchain explorer, SPV infrastructure, mining nodes, and much more just with a few clicks - however, it is not a pre-requirement to use Antara in order to build your chain on KMD and to get the mobile DEX wallet. Everything is pretty much very independent of each other on our platform.

commod have no adaptive pow ?!


[09-Nov-19 01:39 AM] Mark81#4505
No just normal difficulty adjustment. I think aPow would be necessary especially for atomicdex to operate flawlessly with DEX swaps for assetchains.


[09-Nov-19 05:59 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
can't make swaps if blockchain is stuck !


[09-Nov-19 06:38 AM] Oszy#5734
well that's up to the Commod team to think about inmplementing


[09-Nov-19 08:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
They should rent a mining node in antara tbh


[09-Nov-19 08:57 AM] Oszy#5734
he has a few asic constantly running, but if someone comes and deliberately raises the diff with nicehash and leave, you cant do much with a couple asics

Atomic swaps won't happen with these conditions.

it seems the pools for commod are not configured right


[09-Nov-19 11:15 PM] jl777c#5810
adaptivepow is recommended for coins without a large number of miners and pools


[10-Nov-19 12:45 AM] Mark81#4505
Can they switch to adaptive pow without hardforking chain?


[10-Nov-19 12:49 AM] Mark81#4505
If i am right commod chain bought through antara framework and is in that sence boot uped by komodo devs.

> Can they switch to adaptive pow without hardforking chain?
no, it is a hardforking change


[10-Nov-19 12:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
antara framework is the initializer. and yes komodo team indeed has built it and made it easy, for SMEs to get started with komodo tech to start their own independent blockchain with much less efforts than being a developer, it does not mean it is booted by or started by the komodo devs.
it's the system.
system is created and setup by the komodo devs.
now it's the system who takes care of all things automatically.
and since the system also gives the params to all people who wants to connect to this independent blockchain to make transactions over a fully synchronised network client, it becomes distributed, being spread over multiple nodes than just the initial nodes which started this independent blockchain at the first place.


[10-Nov-19 12:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess since it's all the core basics of Network Topologies, could be confusing to non-IT people, but in a Decentralised/Distributed Network there is no central point of failure.


[10-Nov-19 12:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Neither any central point of control.

[10-Nov-19 08:57 AM] Mark81#4505
i am thinking reason for this difficulty spikes to commod. what if this reason is to get network diff to high and after that stall rest of network. And then mine secretly blocks and not publish it? If done succesfully even one day it could cause huge mining rewards?


[10-Nov-19 08:59 AM] Mark81#4505
is there limit to how many blocks can be mined before added to last notarization?

interesting on commod pool are some miners !!! they receive the rewards ?!


[10-Nov-19 09:09 AM] Mark81#4505
if there is happening background mining and blocks are not published then even pool miners are screwed. hostile mining is so far by now that every reward will be vanishing.


[10-Nov-19 09:09 AM] Mark81#4505
there has been some reason why network was attacked in first place.


[10-Nov-19 09:10 AM] Mark81#4505
i guess its time to get  some mining power to pool since if it gets moving and is published then notary nodes will permanently write it to kmd and hostile mining cant erase that.


[10-Nov-19 09:11 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
how it was attacked ?! have no dpow and apow features enabled ?!


[10-Nov-19 09:11 AM] Mark81#4505
dpow is enabled


[10-Nov-19 09:11 AM] Mark81#4505
its such my speculation that something is mined in background


[10-Nov-19 09:11 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
interesting...


[10-Nov-19 09:12 AM] Mark81#4505
but once it has few block mined it will be notarized and possible mining without publishing blocks will be useless.


[10-Nov-19 09:15 AM] LuckyShadow#3212

as I think that you have the whole network, maybe you can reduce hashrate used to lower difficulty and lower the cost of mining

Antara provides a toolkit. It also offers the services to run everything such as mining nodes etc. If you dont pay for mining nodes should you still get them because they are offered as an option?

@Cryptoon I think that they paid for the official pool. But I have no clues what are root causes of problems that occured


[20-Nov-19 03:44 AM] ca333#0333
@Mark81 what exactly are you trying to say?

i) the explorer is NOT down - https://composer.kmd.io/c/COMMOD clearly lists http://34.247.161.246/ as the explorer. Please do NOT spread false informations/FUD ref. Antara Composer.

ii) the pool for commod is a service i am running personally for runpaint for FREE and not being paid for it. it was meant as a favor. In addition we provided him pool sources/repos so he can set up an official pool.

No problem. Rest all assured that Antara Composer is a great and reliable service. It is fully automated and there is 0 downtime. The underlying infrastructure shows 100% uptime for all servers/p2p-nodes related to  https://composer.kmd.io/c/COMMOD - Composer uses the AWS API for the key operations. For the dpow'd chain networks itself we ensure there are at least 60 additional & independent p2p nodes available to form a truly decentralized network.

@naezith ^ why did explorer IP change?


[20-Nov-19 05:41 AM] ca333#0333
ok i guess i know it just by logic - client bought explorer on monthly subscription - then did not pay/upgrade next month and had to buy the service again after expiration. In this case you get a new explorer server. Pretty sure this happened.

no - the SPV didn't "expire" as we re using it for multiple chains so even if its being removed its just temporary and until the service is paid again which triggers the deployment

as a matter of fact, the question would be how to


[02-Dec-19 01:12 AM] Markus#5464
@zenosama you can create a smart chain with antara composer and get it listed on atomicdex, afterwards u just put up your "ico" coins for trade on the atomicdex. That would be the easiest way to make a decentralized ico.


[02-Dec-19 01:15 AM] zenosama#5371
@Markus yeah but considered that soft cap needs more coins as people purchase, that would not be the case, also there is very little liquidity on atomicdex, so unless people would be willing to use it only for the ico, hmm


[02-Dec-19 01:17 AM] Markus#5464
@zenosama I believe liquidity is low due to it being in beta stage, when beta is over there will even be liquidity providers running market makers


[02-Dec-19 01:19 AM] zenosama#5371
@Markus yeah, and also it is only an app, so it would be pretty hard to get people use it atm

atomicdex will be available on all devices not just mobile phones

don't think it's integrated into antara composer, but I could walk you through how to use it. Not really sure how VRSC solution works, might be better


[02-Dec-19 01:49 AM] Alright#0419
could also just premine way more coins than you could possibly sell


[02-Dec-19 01:49 AM] Alright#0419
burn the rest when you're done


[02-Dec-19 01:50 AM] Alright#0419
have you used the app? Seems perfect for an ICO `yeah, and also it is only an app, so it would be pretty hard to get people use it atm` don't understand what you mean by this

I think this post might also be relevant here so I'm copy and pasting from #komodo-team. It's a tweet by Internet Wayback machine about letting family and friends save deceased people's tweets from being deleted by Twitter based on the new terms of service. I'm wondering if this would be possible using Antara Composer.

`Hey team, it might be a cool idea marketing wise and also to showcase what can be done with Antara, to build an Antara smartchain to put these tweets on a blockchain. We could throw an explorer up that lets people view their deceased friend's and family's twitters and give it over to the Internet Wayback Machine. Make the nodes public so others can contribute to maintaining it, and make the blocks mined on demand (when new people are added)`

There's no better reason to support the #WaybackMachine than this. https://t.co/rtxuDav228 https://t.co/jftBn1wxwO

Or it could run hand in hand with Wayback Machine where they save the tweets like they would normally, and they add a link to their page that shows the tweet on an block explorer. Plenty of ways to cut this, but might be a cool marketing/proof of concept idea.

Hello everyone,
I don't know to whom i should address this question so i posted here.
A friend of mine is working on a project and requires an asset chain. We are considering building one with antara modules but we are missing a crucial calculation, tx fee.
So to cut it short, the smart contract is sending a token to, lets say, 1 mil users per day.
Is there a way to calculate daily tx fee?
I would very much appreciate if someone could point me to the correct document. 
Thank you.


[14-Apr-20 01:36 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The tx fee could be whatever you set it as in your transaction. So if you set 0.0001 as the tx fee, multiply that by a million and there is your answer. Alternatively, you could set it to 0, and wait for a miner to mine tx's with 0 fee.


[14-Apr-20 01:38 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm not sure If you're using KMD tokens (not the assetchain coins, there is a difference). I'm not sure how token transactions occur.


[14-Apr-20 01:39 AM] gcharang#6833
when you perform a txn on a Assetchain named `COIN`, the default txfee is `0.0001 COIN`

Sweet, thank you.

Scaling BTC in three easy steps:

1. Scale ethereum
2. Trustlessy tokenize your BTC
3. Transact using the wrapped tokens on the eth2 chain

Can we create a side chain to transact btc for cheaper than the main chain and not use GAS on eth while securing  it using DPOW?


[12-Jun-20 05:01 PM] MorganJekyll#8355
Like basically Lightning network that runs on a KMD side chain.


[13-Jun-20 01:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
you can create a btc peg, sure


[13-Jun-20 06:27 AM] phm87#7395
Decentralized peg by consensus? Peg by multisig "decentralized" by several NN? Or centralized peg?


[13-Jun-20 06:28 AM] phm87#7395
It already exists some ethereum smart contracts to be able to move ICO tokens without gas. The ICO tokens are converted to gas thanks to the smart contract.


[13-Jun-20 06:30 AM] phm87#7395
Right now, thanks to cc-peg on kmd, we can create a peg (search KEURTEST if you want to play with it). I don t remember if the peg is a multisig or not yet


[13-Jun-20 06:31 AM] phm87#7395
But some coding is still require to do what you want but we have some parts


[13-Jun-20 06:32 AM] gcharang#6833
> It already exists some ethereum smart contracts to be able to move ICO tokens without gas
they are just arbitraging low demand time for high demand time. the chain still has a tps limit and it is a single chain. if 3 -4 cryptokitty type dapps are launched and **used**, these arbitraging contracts won't work anymore


[13-Jun-20 06:34 AM] jorian#4555
that's what i tell the handful of prospects of chainmakers, until they see there is no support at all for CC yet, even within the komodo platform. so, do you really want to get MorganJekyll his smart chain?


[13-Jun-20 06:35 AM] jorian#4555
and with support, i mean gui and the fact that it's all heavily in test phase, or even being recoded


[13-Jun-20 06:35 AM] jorian#4555
also the reason we decided to take down the chainmakers website and cease operations


[13-Jun-20 06:43 AM] phm87#7395
@gcharang I agree, all of this is onchain of ethereum so these smart contracts are not helping to refuce fees but you can move erc-xx without having eth. Maybe a cc variant of it could be added into mm2 I was thinking


[13-Jun-20 07:55 AM] MorganJekyll#8355
It‚Äôs seems as if there is a high demand for being able to transact BTC ‚Äúoff chain‚Äù in the form of lightning network or on a second layer like eth. Most these solutions have to sacrifice security for scalability. With KMD being able to do 1 mil + tps why don‚Äôt we run a Lightning channel like multi chain where we can transact btc with btc level security?


[13-Jun-20 09:03 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lightning is not compatible with KMD, no Segwit.  However someone can if they want to set a BTC gateway  still layer 1,  but can reduce blocktimes down low with higher blocksize


[13-Jun-20 10:59 AM] MorganJekyll#8355
And then settle or back up every 60 min with DPOW?


[13-Jun-20 12:18 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes the chain that the pseudo BTC would be on would need to be secured with DPoW .   The issue is more who wants to run it?  It‚Äôs an area of crypto that deals with custody.


[13-Jun-20 12:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Which is a minefield , it‚Äôs a business in itself for the entrepreneurial

I was going to check out the composer, but I never get sent a verification email. I've used two different email providers and nothing yet.

Hello, I'm trying to use the tokentransfer method - how do I find the pubkey for the transparent address I'm sending tokens to (the destpubkey in the developer docs)?  Using the validateaddress command on the destination address only gives a scriptPubKey value.  Thanks for the help!


[18-Aug-20 08:02 PM] Mountain720#7683
Well, I found a conversation on here from last Oct., and looks like you have to get the person's pubkey from them, which is not easy for a common user to give.  No worries., okay.


[18-Aug-20 08:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
A transaction should do
