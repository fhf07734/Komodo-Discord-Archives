Since with the other I did not receive opinions... Do you like it? Would you change anything?

[29-May-18 05:08 AM] toycrane#0000
by the time blockchain become mainstream, what people love most is not bitcoin. bitcoin is neither fast nor and it is also less efficient. However, the optimized systems are likely to be connected to the bit coin in some way. bitcoin is strong and special.

Would it be a good idea or bad to approach every coin in the top 100 and join their telegram or slacks, and invite them and inform them about dPoW and notarizing to komodo? Like a little "Hey, just wanted to let you know that _______ and ____. By notarizing to Komodo, itll ensure you have btc hashrate this that, cheaper than notarizing to btc. We already have your coin on our decentralized exchange and can do atomic swap to any other coin"

Some copy paste message to all the coins main communication channels? Not in a shill way but genuinly informing them of the benefits, and giving them a contact link if theyd be interested?


[29-May-18 07:29 PM] chinzoob#0000

Maybe a stupid question, but is it actually possible an entire continent would be possibly disconnected from the internet, but it’s not like there is only one connection from the US-EUR for example


[30-May-18 01:02 AM] polycryptoblog#0000
Reminds me of the arguments I get from my prepper friends,  " if an emp happens,  how's crypto going to survive that ".   If some major event like that happens that affects everything worldwide we got bigger problems

In the event that Bitcoin itself is bifurcated through a disconnect in our global Internet connection, once we reunite, Bitcoin's longest chain rule will automatically consume the smaller chains.

China's version of Bitcoin will most likely win.

The notary nodes that are based in Asia will have the correct version of the Komodo history, and the entire ecosystem will realign to their most recent states.

Everyone who was disconnected from the largest Bitcoin network will have been vulnerable during the period that they did not have access to the dominant blockchain sector.

If any particular area of the world is concerned about that, they should build out their Internet infrastructure.

(So, in a rare event, and assuming the infrastructure stays as it is, an emp could cause an independent KMD-based chain in the Southern Hemisphere to lose a day or two of their financial history. This is far different than losing their entire chain from constant 51% attacks like GAME was experiencing, or losing everything from a Genesis Attack.)

<@U8QKXKKBM> mid-east/africa got cut off from europe for a few days by an undersea cable cut about 6 years ago.  it happens.  the southern cross cable that links east coast australia to west coast usa links nz, papua new guinea, fiji, vanuatu etc.  not in one long cable but some octopus-like configuration.  if a ship drags anchor (or the intelligence community wants to splice a cable) one of those island nations can easily be disconnected.
same thing with rip/ospf/bgp routing protocols getting poisoned - cities and countries can go off air.

```Hello to the Komodo Team, 
My name is Omri Erez I am a developer, entrepreneur, and a Blockchain enthusiast. In addition, I am co-organizing a meetup series in Hamburg, Germany. We are currently running the biggest Blockchain meetup in Hamburg and would like to invite Komodo to present. Our meetup is held once a month. 

Here are some links: 
1. Meetup Group: https://goo.gl/wgmQPo 
2. Our next event: https://goo.gl/NgG3jy 
3. Our past events: https://goo.gl/nQ8yYb 

Some notes: 
1. All presentations are done in English as our community is international. 2. Our crowd is very mixed. Some with deep technical background but mostly people who are interested in the technology or want to learn more about it 
3. The main goals of the event is to exchange knowledge, grow your Blockchain network and to feel free to ask anything. 
4. We are organizing this meetup voluntarily, without any financial benefits and any costs are going from our own pocket. It will be great to have you! 

Please feel free to contact me on LinkedIn (https://goo.gl/SGaCD4) for any questions, commented, ideas and pretty much anything else :) I wish you a great day, Long Live our Distributed Future :) Omri```

[03-Jun-18 01:35 PM] regnar#0000
Komodo scaling development likely to reach finish line first for actual secured crypto transactions scaling.

no reason to shard one big chain if everything is automatically segregated into their own chain, anti-sharding.

KMD creates one giant meta chain out of cluster of chains so we just secure all independent chains via dPoW and use KMD to generate proofs for cross chain smart contracts.

Scaling is easy if you skip security and decentralization, but is nonsensical to do so, Komodo solution truly will remain decentralized and secure while scaling.

KMD scaling is built on BTC codebase and is proven tech, not white paper theory.

scaling chains are independent chains using the same cluster ID and mining nodes and we have scripts to automatically spawn chains including explorers. Each chain is secured through Bitcoin hashrate through dPoW.

We can recycle Bitcoin's electricity, one coin using 0.5% of all electricity is a bit extreme, but we can use that same electricity to secure an entire ecosystem of thousands or eventually millions of chains, then it's not so wasteful at all.

Marketing this new tech isn't as easy as some facebook and twitter ads. Triply nested cryptographic proofs are more difficult to understand than atomic swaps. Yes Atomic Swaps, those UTXO based cross chain trustless swaps powering the BarterDEX and HyperDEX.

"unlimited scaling secured by BTC" in a nutshell

I think that the recent 51% attacks (most recent one was today on $zen) + $GAME new can be a very powerful marketing narrative for Komodo if invested right. What do you guys think?


[04-Jun-18 06:05 PM] maegus#0000
It definitely should be.


[04-Jun-18 07:10 PM] regnar#0000
I wonder if it would be worthwhile to go to these chains that have been 51% attacked and offer the first year free (privately of course) so that they would be even more inclined to try the notary services.


[04-Jun-18 07:13 PM] regnar#0000
Though I'm normally in the camp of "if you're good at something, don't do it for free"


[04-Jun-18 07:13 PM] regnar#0000
Maybe do it for payment in some of their coins, if they have a big supply of them for dev funds, which could increase in value when their investors know their coin is better protected, further increasing Komodo teams holdings?


[04-Jun-18 07:14 PM] regnar#0000
just brainstorming


[04-Jun-18 07:14 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Before you all go wanting a heaps of third party coins installed on our servers, we need to make sure we can secure our KMD from their coin deamons. LOL... whats to stop another coin, puting a "sendtoaddress" RPC call in their code somwhere and stealing all our funds.


[04-Jun-18 07:15 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I am sure its able to be sorted out, and I hope we can do lots of coins in the future 🙂


[04-Jun-18 07:16 PM] regnar#0000
lol honestly man, that seems more your specialty, which is why we're glad you step in here to straighten out some of these marketing dreams lol


[04-Jun-18 07:16 PM] regnar#0000
because, I'm not a dev, so yea, that would be a bad situation


[04-Jun-18 07:19 PM] blackjok3r#0000
haha. Not sure sometimes if I should say these things, but I believe its better to be honest about things. There are already people looking to solve this, but its seems a convoluted way so far. But as long as it is solved, we can add a LOT f coins. We have testnet notarizing 64 chains on a single server, easily. We will look to see how far that can be pushed in coming days/weeks.


[04-Jun-18 07:22 PM] regnar#0000
yea I think this sort of stuff is the important things that need to be said between marketing and devs. a lot of these types of things I and I'm sure plenty of other Marketing focused people here aren't aware of, so it's nice to have some insight in what is possible, and what isn't just yet


[04-Jun-18 07:23 PM] imylomylo#0000
also we don't want to over burden ourselves that we run out of resources (devs, operations hands) and mismanage komodo's tasks.


[04-Jun-18 07:25 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Got enough to do already lol.


[04-Jun-18 07:25 PM] imylomylo#0000
yeah.  game is first cab off the rank, we learn from this integration to improve for others.


[04-Jun-18 07:27 PM] imylomylo#0000
making sure GAME is reasonably secured is first goal.  once we know (which won't be for another 4+ weeks, but more likely 10 weeks)


[04-Jun-18 07:28 PM] regnar#0000
okay sounds good.


[04-Jun-18 07:29 PM] regnar#0000
but is this something that will become quicker to implement or is it always a tedious process


[04-Jun-18 07:34 PM] regnar#0000
Oh I understand that, I'm saying the idea of 3rd party coins seeking dPoW with Komodo, I imagine it takes a significant amount of time not just to implement but to check and make sure they aren't going to do anything shady


[04-Jun-18 07:34 PM] imylomylo#0000
GAME shares similar codebase to CHIPS.  they were forked from same version of bitcoin at the time.   if other coins share similar codebases, then it is likely to be less work in the future to integrate than a coin that has forked from a different codebase (e.g. 0.16v of bitcoin) which has had more changes.


[04-Jun-18 07:35 PM] regnar#0000
because as Marketing channel, we should have an Idea if we should be focusing on migrating newer erc20 coins to assetchains, or if more established coins using dPoW would be a better focus of our time.


[04-Jun-18 07:35 PM] regnar#0000
okay that makes sense, so it's really dependent on the coin


[04-Jun-18 07:35 PM] imylomylo#0000
oh the erc20 -> assetchain definitely wins that focus imo


[04-Jun-18 07:35 PM] regnar#0000
could be weeks, could be months?


[04-Jun-18 07:38 PM] imylomylo#0000
we know assetchain tech better than integration of other coins into dpow tech.  there are 500 erc20 projects out there (i don't know the number, just saying there's heaps) - if 1% of those erc20 projects comes over by the end of the year - that's plenty to build on for 2019.


[04-Jun-18 07:39 PM] regnar#0000
I worry that marketing focused on the erc20 tokens (which could really be done at any time, or even better when Ethereum gas prices rise) and we right now the market is more prime for us to focus on 51% susceptible coins, since we can play the recent attacks.


[04-Jun-18 07:42 PM] regnar#0000
basically the recent events have made dPoW of 51% susceptible chains to be likely the most successful marketing efforts, just as when ETH gas prices soar it would make ERC20 project migration the best focus of our attention.


[04-Jun-18 07:43 PM] regnar#0000
but all of this is moot anyway, if we aren't there yet to handle these dPoW implementing just yet, mind as well focus on erc20 lol


[04-Jun-18 07:46 PM] imylomylo#0000
yeah the erc20 token -> assetchain takes advantage of more tech, agama wallet, barterdex trading, dico fundraising, dpow security services, privacy - all within the ecosystem.


[04-Jun-18 07:46 PM] imylomylo#0000
many more avenues to market


[04-Jun-18 07:47 PM] regnar#0000
yea, I'm only talking about timing in the market with the news and focus of recent articles being 51% related


[04-Jun-18 07:48 PM] regnar#0000
but got it, erc20 focus


[04-Jun-18 08:19 PM] n2okpride#0000
<@U4X7GDWT0> There is a plan for the 51% attack campaign, but it isn't fully ready to go mainstream yet. We'd be willing to take one additional project as another case study and proof of concept but it is being treated in a very targeted approach.


[04-Jun-18 08:19 PM] n2okpride#0000
FYI - <@U33CGLNNR> found this interesting website: https://www.crypto51.app/


[04-Jun-18 09:21 PM] ryan797#0000
Question, anyone here working with CMM to practice this 51% resistance?   Seems like a partnership made in heaven.  
DPoW on a resistant attack chain.


[04-Jun-18 09:23 PM] ryan797#0000
<@U4X7GDWT0> did you see that CMM link claiming 51% resistance?


[04-Jun-18 09:23 PM] ryan797#0000
I posted on twitter


[04-Jun-18 09:23 PM] emmanux#0000
<@U9LUDEM8T> first we need to know if it is really resistant. It sounds like bs to me.


[04-Jun-18 09:23 PM] ryan797#0000
Supposedly nodes are banning double spenders and block times are so fast the attackers couldn’t make the longest chain.


[04-Jun-18 09:24 PM] emmanux#0000
bs


[04-Jun-18 09:24 PM] ryan797#0000
Without engineering it, even a 75% hashrate attack didn’t take over.


[04-Jun-18 09:24 PM] ryan797#0000
I asked <@U02LQ1WHQ> about the feasibility for their tech/code to achieve this.   Haven’t heard back, but the man has more important things to do that to investigate the veracity of some brand new coins claims.


[04-Jun-18 09:24 PM] emmanux#0000
I think that they need to learn the hard way, that their chain isn't invulnerable.


[04-Jun-18 09:25 PM] ryan797#0000
I am highly skeptical and openly skeptical in their discord.


[04-Jun-18 09:25 PM] ryan797#0000
Now not when they’re big.


[04-Jun-18 09:25 PM] ryan797#0000
I’m sure it could be done in a more engineered fashion.  



That’s part of the plan too Emm... they want to know and work on it.


[04-Jun-18 09:26 PM] ryan797#0000
You cant just say shit like that and not expect an attack.


[04-Jun-18 09:26 PM] ryan797#0000
But I think that’s their goal.


[04-Jun-18 09:45 PM] maegus#0000
Komodo was on that list in the first iteration until someone told him it would be impossible without you somehow convincing a super majority 2/3 of the notaries to conspire which is basically 0% chance of happening because they are mostly devs...


[04-Jun-18 10:04 PM] jon#0000
Hey all. I'd like to humbly suggest we "sell" dPoW as "Komodo Consensus". Waaay better for branding.


[04-Jun-18 10:23 PM] ryan797#0000
Consensus feels like agreement.


[04-Jun-18 11:54 PM] jon#0000
It is agreement in a sense. It's using Komodo to help agree on the state of your chain.

[05-Jun-18 04:30 AM] regnar#0000
yea that is a tricky part, "64 nodes?! that's not decentralized" says the bitcoin and XRP bag holder


[05-Jun-18 04:31 AM] regnar#0000
but there are still miners in KMD


[05-Jun-18 04:32 AM] regnar#0000
well see what Steve thinks about it, I know Hansen, Fishy, Mylo and a few others were discussing it earlier today


[05-Jun-18 04:33 AM] jl777#0000
64 nodes running the same notarization dapp


[05-Jun-18 04:34 AM] jl777#0000
and the notaries will be the first to admit it is quite random which 13 notaries are selected for each round


[05-Jun-18 04:34 AM] jl777#0000
and 64 might be small compared to BTC but for a lot of the small coins that is almost as many as their entire mining set of mining nodes


[05-Jun-18 04:34 AM] jl777#0000
also BTC mining pools are much less than 64 to get majority hashrate


[05-Jun-18 04:35 AM] jl777#0000
before complaining about the centralization of another project, maybe best to make sure 6 mining pools dont control the majority of your hashrate


[05-Jun-18 04:35 AM] jusoaresf#0000
yes indeed!


[05-Jun-18 04:36 AM] jl777#0000
and before the maximalist retorts that each pool represents potentially thousands of different miners, I ask them, which of those thousands of miners controls the blocktemplate that is being mined?


[05-Jun-18 04:36 AM] jl777#0000
any of the thousand miners or the pool operator?


[05-Jun-18 04:36 AM] regnar#0000
yep, this similar problem came up earlier. the comparison may not be fair, but it will be made. so we just best prepare ourselves for an answer


[05-Jun-18 04:36 AM] jl777#0000
if it is the pool operator, then doesnt that mean that 6 people control the BTC majority hashrate?


[05-Jun-18 04:37 AM] jl777#0000
and they would complain about our 64 notaries?


[05-Jun-18 04:37 AM] regnar#0000
like atomic swap DEX vs CEX for trade times...


[05-Jun-18 04:37 AM] jl777#0000
I chose 64 for a reason


[05-Jun-18 04:37 AM] regnar#0000
which is?


[05-Jun-18 04:37 AM] regnar#0000
I don't think I know this one haha


[05-Jun-18 04:37 AM] jl777#0000
it is a big enough number to be impractical to easily dominate


[05-Jun-18 04:37 AM] jl777#0000
yet it isnt so large that a N*N fully connected network wont explode with traffic


[05-Jun-18 04:38 AM] jl777#0000
64*64 is 4096


[05-Jun-18 04:38 AM] jl777#0000
128*128 is 16384


[05-Jun-18 04:38 AM] jl777#0000
256*256 is 65536


[05-Jun-18 04:39 AM] jl777#0000
so having 256 notaries is not only impractical from an elections standpoint as I doubt three are even 256 people who have the skills to be notaries, it dilutes notary rewards 8fold and increases network traffic 16 fold


[05-Jun-18 04:39 AM] jl777#0000
and still the maximalists would say that "only 256 notaries" is centralized


[05-Jun-18 04:41 AM] regnar#0000
It sounds like you recently got into a debate with a maximalist haha


[05-Jun-18 04:41 AM] regnar#0000
I don't often hear "Notary nodes are centralized"


[05-Jun-18 04:42 AM] jl777#0000
maximalists used to be a real annoyance back when BTC dominance was 90%, nowadays most are much more realistic, even if their rhetoric doesnt reflect it


[05-Jun-18 04:43 AM] jl777#0000
and dont get me wrong, BTC's network effect will ensure it will be here long term and KMD notarizes to BTC for a good reason. I am not against BTC in any way


[05-Jun-18 04:43 AM] jl777#0000
its just that some maximalists sound like fiat officials saying BTC is backed by nothing, as if all the fiat paper is


[05-Jun-18 04:52 AM] regnar#0000
value is subjective anyway, being backed by something doesn't matter if that something is worthless to me. *coughCough Toxic Mortgage backed Securities Cough*cough


[05-Jun-18 04:54 AM] regnar#0000
okay any marketing people, do we have a focus for the types of ERC20 tokens we want first? we looking for social media coins, industry/utility coins, altruism projects ?


[05-Jun-18 04:54 AM] imylomylo#0000
hmmmm there goes exponential maths...4000+ connections between nodes is impressive


[05-Jun-18 05:03 AM] regnar#0000
I'm kinda targeting Mithril MITH (decentralized social media platform), LIFElabs LIFE (1/3rd total supply is ringfenced for philanthropic causes, worldwide), Republic Protocol REN (decentralized dark pool for trustless cross-chain atomic trading of Ether, ERC20 tokens and Bitcoin pairs.) and DENT (Tokenizing the Mobile Data Industry to sell and buy Mobile Data with DENT Tokens)


[05-Jun-18 05:11 AM] regnar#0000
Obviously all long term and assuming we were to convert them, that's my thoughts


[05-Jun-18 05:11 AM] regnar#0000
I figured this gives us a pretty rounded erc20 conversion, if we can get them interested. They aren't each the Biggest chains, but more like SME. Mithril social media platform could help KMD and the asset chains by giving them better exposure, LIFE is philanthropic and from their twitter actually gives back money, REN is basically trying to make a "dark pool" version of BarterDEX which they could likely use the BarterDEX engine with tweaks if they are with Komodo, and DENT is just a cool project that is probably going to be seriously hurt by ETH gas prices in the future and could bring some more uniqueness.

Also up for discussion, does "Asset chain" convey the same feeling as "independent chain" or some other variant?


[05-Jun-18 05:11 AM] regnar#0000
If you were an ETH token, it might sound more appealing to migrate if you weren't an asset chain, or something like that, it might come off as you are dependent on KMD. There might be a better way to describe Asset chains that is unique in crypto but still conveys independence, security, and freedom... I'll think on it today.


[05-Jun-18 05:23 AM] jl777#0000
parallel chain


[05-Jun-18 05:23 AM] jl777#0000
or just independent chain


[05-Jun-18 05:24 AM] jl777#0000
assetchain was named for the SuperNET assets that got their own chains, so it is a legacy naming


[05-Jun-18 05:24 AM] jl777#0000
maybe there will be some fancy marketing name for them

[05-Jun-18 09:54 AM] n2okpride#0000
<@U4X7GDWT0> in the past we've labeled dpow as Komodo Security Services as an alternate to just dPoW. We can position it as an additional security layer to provide protection. We can also reference the analogy James used with 2FA, as it is an additional layer of security, but not 100% guaranteed protection.


[05-Jun-18 09:55 AM] n2okpride#0000
i think parallel chain still works from a technical standpoint, and as a means to differentiate from side chains.


[05-Jun-18 09:56 AM] n2okpride#0000
question is if we want to classify it as a technical marketing term - parallel chain vs side vs child


[05-Jun-18 09:56 AM] n2okpride#0000
or go further to brand it something like Scale Chain, Cluster Chain, Link Chain, etc, etc

<@U6ZES59AA> I do like "Komodo Security Services" because it is just that. Chainmail, Cluster Chain, Scale Chain, or the sort. I like to think of the dPoW function as connected different blockchains in some way, and they form a type of chainmail for protection.

This could happen tomorrow... it could happen next week... or it might not happen for a couple more months. But rest assured... Amazon Coin is coming out before the end of 2018.

And to tell you the truth, when a major player like Amazon enters the crypto market... it's going to blow Bitcoin, Ethereum... and any other coin... out of the water.

But here's the thing: The way to play this opportunity is not by buying shares in Amazon's stock, although I think it's a great investment. And you shouldn't stock up on their crypto coins either.."

Bruce Fenton has a bunch of followers, is the CEO of a blockchain investment fund, was a host of the Satoshi Roundtable, helped start Ravencoin (which is supported on BarterDEX) Is a board member of Medici Ventures (the crypto investment group set up by http://Overstock.com) is recently added to the board of directors of Tzero investment fund, and was executive director of The Bitcoin Foundation. He's a hard core libertarian and has said multiple times in public that Atomic Swaps are going to change crypto forever.  A bit about this strategy, he LOVES superman and comic book characters and is often seen in a superman shirt even at formal events with a blazer so Senda put his head on Superman's body, changed the logos to KMD and used a Superman quote that we tweaked to bring light to the importance of Atomic Swaps. "You are much stronger than you think you are, trust me" is the superman quote.

The pillar of the Komodo blockchain is their bitcoin level security. The network uses delayed Proof-of-Work algorithm to secure your data. This is because Komodo began as a fork of Zcash, the famous security coin. Businesses that are in the ecosystem enjoy this security benefit that is even affordable to small businesses and startups.

just a thought, what if we started a Komodo "like bomb" telegram channel? the rules are no chatting, only posting Komodo related Twitter and reddit posts that we want everyone in the channel to like and retweet/share?


[06-Jun-18 04:26 PM] regnar#0000
right now we have 8500 people in telegram, many of which aren't active and many different conversations going on. so if we post a link to a tweet or reddit we want everyone to like, it gets pushed up and buried with all the other conversations and support requests etc.


[06-Jun-18 04:28 PM] regnar#0000
so if we make a channel and have only our most active members join (those who are active enough to like tweets and posts etc when they are there) we can try and concentrate efforts to specific posts that we want attention to be raised to. for instance mentioning Komodo to a erc20 token on their twitter when they talk about an issue their having. it would be much more beneficial to have 50-100 or more likes and retweets on THAT post, for both spreading awareness, as well as blowing up that erc20 coins notifications

[06-Jun-18 07:27 PM] regnar#0000

One designer's opinion: All in on Komodo tech, jl777 & code team is absolutely incredible. Is Komodo open to design and marketing proposals? What is the actual marketing budget? Is Ben underfunded/staffed? I cannot wrap my head around these marketing desicions; retweeting one of the biggest con artists McAfee, derpy animated gifs, the pandered chinese coin listing where xvg is rated higher than bitcoin. A twitter profile that points to a newsletter form (that doesn't show up if you have ad blocking on or forward to Komodo's website after form completion) instead of the Komodo website with newsletter signup. in10tion pumped out a generic poorly laid out website that looks exactly like all the other poor generic templates they do, voiced an opinion to avoid using in10tion before the revamp, hard red flag. Use of a depressive color palette. These are not professional standards, please invest in marketing as seriously as you take coding. Proper communication and user experience is key.


[08-Jun-18 04:51 PM] benohanlon#0000
<@U8JQ1UV8A> proposals to <@U6ZES59AA> please 🙏🏻


[08-Jun-18 06:18 PM] tolken#0000
<@U8JQ1UV8A> what we have right now is the Komodo v1.5 interim design website. It’s reasonably clean and was definitely an improvement over the last, but not a huge fan of the palette either. I’m hoping the 2.0 is a significant departure from the current green template aesthetic.


[08-Jun-18 06:19 PM] tolken#0000
would be cool if there was some aesthetic cohesion between HyperDex and Komodos new site.


[08-Jun-18 06:20 PM] tolken#0000
Agama as well. Agama/HyperDex/website color/style unification. I think HyperDex is its own thing, but the unification of style is on their agenda afaik.


[08-Jun-18 06:22 PM] tolken#0000
Marketing team has really been accelerating lately which has been fantastic. Love the Friday newsletter, the immediate engagement with Blockfolio signal.


[08-Jun-18 06:28 PM] tolken#0000
Couldn’t hurt to send them any constructive feedback.


[08-Jun-18 07:42 PM] ryan797#0000
<@U8JQ1UV8A> ALl of your points, are why Komodo isn't a top ten $100 token right now.


[08-Jun-18 07:43 PM] ryan797#0000
From someone who has been in marketing 20 years... it's as simple as that.


[09-Jun-18 12:46 AM] pondsea#0000
HyperDEX is its own brand so the look and feel may be different to Komodo’s reference designs.

<@U8JQ1UV8A>, <@U9LUDEM8T>, I hope you can have a conversation with <@U6ZES59AA> and the team and collaborate on the best approach. 

I looked at many of the top coins and other lower ones that move up quick, and the common thread is they have partnerships/collaboration with the corporate world. 
Litecoin doesn’t have a big marketing team. Charlie spends his time finding a real use-case for his coin. He teams up with businesses that will use LTC.

When that happens with Komodo I think many of these marketing issues will seem trivial. In the meantime though it is good to keep tweaking the marketing efforts.


[09-Jun-18 01:26 PM] webalginet#0000
I apologize if the mcafee meme has not had good feedback for Komodo. I did it with good intention.


[09-Jun-18 01:26 PM] webalginet#0000
I also think that people who make negative comments do not understand too much of what they are talking about, and they are toxic people to my knowledge. But in this world there are people of all kinds.


[09-Jun-18 02:52 PM] westcoastsurf#0000
toxicity is allowing the repetition of mistakes

You obviously do not think promoting one of the biggest conmen in crypto is a mistake as well as tying it to komodo.

[09-Jun-18 04:08 PM] ptytrader#0000
Unfortunately I've read many negative responses because the people who see this think it's the Komodo team pushing the memes.

The guys following mcaffee are a different crowd than the ones already invested in kmd


[10-Jun-18 12:26 AM] cryptoon#0000
So could be a way to get their attention


[10-Jun-18 12:26 AM] cryptoon#0000
But it’s up to the team I guess


[10-Jun-18 02:29 AM] westcoastsurf#0000
The only thing mcafee is doing here is repeatedly getting free work and publicity from naive people. Crypto twitter gobbles him up which is telling about their bias abilities. He knows it, he takes advantage of it. People blindly think these contests (which many many deluded companies do) are ok. People will never get paid for their time which could be have been used constructively instead. Mcafee gets marketing free or at very little cost.  "There is no such thing as bad publicity" is a trope though and untrue. No one can expect to be taken seriously by promoting themselves alongside the literal shitfest mcafee is. Aligning yourself and supporting negative things never turns out positive, at least I cannot think of any, can you?


[10-Jun-18 02:39 AM] cryptoon#0000
Just making a pic for a meme contest doesnt mean you are alligning with him


[10-Jun-18 08:21 AM] emmanux#0000
Echo chamber is not good either.


[10-Jun-18 08:21 AM] emmanux#0000
The community did it? let it be, it might have unexpected positive results.


[10-Jun-18 08:22 AM] emmanux#0000
Maybe just issue an official statement saying "we are so angry about this thing that the community did it..."


[10-Jun-18 08:23 AM] emmanux#0000
And just go on.


[10-Jun-18 08:24 AM] emmanux#0000

[10-Jun-18 06:23 PM] regnar#0000
I'm going to modify this format a bit so it doesn't cut off the bottom when I tweet to coins. but considering it took me all of 10 minutes to swap out the logos and name for 6 coins, and then another 5 minutes to tweet them out. It might be worth doing in the future for supporting new coins on BarterDEX.


[10-Jun-18 06:25 PM] regnar#0000
So on new releases of BarterDEX where can I get the coins being listed before we release them? That way I can have them pre-made and post them here for other people to tweet out if I'm not around when it gets released. <@U6ZES59AA>


[10-Jun-18 06:51 PM] pondsea#0000
<@U4X7GDWT0> we need to contact the communities twitter handle


[10-Jun-18 06:51 PM] pondsea#0000
And get them to tweet


[10-Jun-18 06:52 PM] pondsea#0000
That is the best wait to reach their community


[10-Jun-18 08:13 PM] regnar#0000
agreed <@U02PH4RHZ>. A lot of them don't allow you to message them, only tweet to them. So we need to find their actual CMO or social media custodian to contact them. all of which requires more prep time


[10-Jun-18 08:42 PM] pondsea#0000
I think we just need to find their op on bitcoin talk and dm them


[10-Jun-18 08:48 PM] regnar#0000
Yea that might work best, depends where they are most active I'd say. They may just have team members/emails listed on their websites (if they have one)


[10-Jun-18 08:49 PM] regnar#0000

TLDR: (I'm thinking...) Proper scaling requires maintaining Scaling, Security, and Privacy. Ditching one at the benefit of the other is easy but unacceptable.
Platforms that lock people into using a single coin may work short term, but no one wants to spend $5 to send a $1 transaction just because some game app is popular at the time.


[11-Jun-18 04:51 AM] regnar#0000
Sharding takes one large blockchain and breaks it into smaller shards, but KMD scales not by breaking one blockchain into smaller shards, but creating smaller independent chains that form a larger meta chain.


[11-Jun-18 04:53 AM] regnar#0000
Komodo is scaling by using actual time tested techniques and not overly reliant on bleeding edge tech that may or may not stand the test of time, and risk taking everyone's investments down with it.


[11-Jun-18 04:53 AM] stephenyork#0000
could you also make a reddit post about this? <@U4X7GDWT0>


[11-Jun-18 04:53 AM] regnar#0000
I'm about to post it now

Notary Nodes do not create new blocks, they just agree upon a blockhash to be notarized, failure of the notary system would require +75% compromised nodes and would only disrupt the notarization process, not the blockchain itself.


[11-Jun-18 04:59 AM] blackjok3r#0000
They dont HAVE to create new blocks. But they do mine most of them.


[11-Jun-18 05:01 AM] jl777#0000
of course, but that is independent process and there are GPU miners that are more than happy to mine all the blocks


[11-Jun-18 05:01 AM] stephenyork#0000
btw, all this awesome jl777 wisdom aggretation by <@U4X7GDWT0> should also be on komodo's own official homepage. right now it's all scattered on dozens or so channels. I seriously thing we should have a section on http://komodoplatform.com for specifically this kind of content with a "tag cloud" to make it somewhat searchable/browsable by subject of interest

probably it should be a continuous effort, with one subject per post

it's mostly informal Q&A


[11-Jun-18 05:08 AM] stephenyork#0000
one-time megaposts are not so effective


[11-Jun-18 05:08 AM] regnar#0000
some people ask a question in telegram directed at anyone, and jl jumps in


[11-Jun-18 05:08 AM] benohanlon#0000
<@U4X7GDWT0> if you can research, verify, pull it all together and categorize it... that would be great. I also have listed the need for an 'origins story' for JL777 that explains where he's come from and what he's worked on... this could dovetail nicely.


[11-Jun-18 05:09 AM] regnar#0000
I've just been taking these informal Q&A and organizing them to make them look more formalized


[11-Jun-18 05:09 AM] stephenyork#0000
and on current homepage the readability is not so good, so (very) long posts are probably best avoided


[11-Jun-18 05:09 AM] benohanlon#0000
<@U9K42AHQW> the model is to use pillar / clusters. So one main posts that then links to ongoing content - which links back to the main.


[11-Jun-18 05:09 AM] regnar#0000
edit out excess comments unrelated, edit grammar, and group shorter texts into larger bodies

<@U4X7GDWT0> if you could work on this and produce something excellent - we can reward excellence.

We need a bot developer to connect to http://riot.im, Discord and Slack that will auto curate all messages from jl777 and a human editor to keep them clean and assign tag.
apart from that, i see only manual way.

[11-Jun-18 05:27 AM] shossain#0000
jl777 doesn't use twitter. if we have all the public channels cross-connected to discord and @discord-bot filter out all the posts from all public channels and put them into a dedicated channel, an admin user can filter out the informative one, we can perhaps link that channel to the http://komodoplatform.com site using a page

[17-Jun-18 04:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Regnar> just a thought, we should have a page on dexstats that shows a list of all coins that are built on Komodo and/or using dPoW. Many of the dICO coins would be on it but GameCredits, Verus, and Kreds too. This page could be linked to from the main http://Komodoplatform.com. or could even be a page on http://Komodoplatform.com that shows the coins using dPoW for 51% protection, as well as a link to whatever announcement page they have explaining their reasons for selecting KMD.


[17-Jun-18 04:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Regnar> and on the dPoW/Komodo Security Services/51% protection page we could have some options for how other projects could get these features, either by integrating dPoW like Gamecredits (slower) or by migrating to Komodo (preferred)

for Dex the initial holdings need to be subtracted. There is a meeting this week in neuchatel I hope we have some fruitful conversations there

@KomodoWorld  i don't think DSEC is launched by the KMD platform


[19-Jun-18 04:53 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
my impression is that it's a closely related thing


[19-Jun-18 04:57 AM] PTYX#6840
Dsec is launched by ca333


[19-Jun-18 05:01 AM] KomodoWorld#8282

[19-Jun-18 05:05 AM] jorian#4555
it's independent but i guess dSEC will be close to KMD platform


[19-Jun-18 05:27 AM] PTYX#6840
Yes it will.

How about making a push to get people over from slack to discord

we have aroudn 500 users

that is 💩 compared to iota who has 18K discord users.

Start bij putting the discord link in general and komodo channels in slack

And announcing that the transfer will be made in the coming months

@PTYX  let's ann that slack push msg to discord but discor does not push to slack - good step to encourage people


[20-Jun-18 06:19 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
+ ANN in the official slack channel


[20-Jun-18 06:19 AM] PTYX#6840
i see


[20-Jun-18 06:19 AM] PTYX#6840
ok, sounds good


[20-Jun-18 06:20 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it's actually the most important ANN for those who want to stay up to date, should use @channel for that


[20-Jun-18 06:32 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
or even better - do ANN in every channel in slack that slack won't have most interesting valid and up to date informations since no on any more -> all information possibly impacting trading aka "trading secrets" only on discord 😃

Last page of the position paper has it there


[22-Jun-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont think the komodo team should be vouching officially for any specific external project. All of these projects are out of the control of komodo team, so they can change at any time. then again, it could be the best new crypto project around. Please research and make your own decisions. Being a tech provider, we can provide the tech, but we cant be put in the position where we are expected to identify all the possible problems with a project. Many projects are run by former (or even existing) team members. Such projects can certainly mention these things. Also, if we find anybody making false claims, we will call them out.


[22-Jun-18 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
in other words we are taking a step back from making formal partnerships, especially since in a decentralized project it doesnt really make sense. that being said, i expect projects will do partnerships, contract work, etc. with the various ecosystem companies

I know this doesnt make it as easy as possible to find the investment values, but at least the number isnt so large, it is still possible to research each of them as they arrive


[22-Jun-18 10:17 AM] Mister.G#3159
I completely understand and I don't expect you to vouch for anyone that uses the Komodo name. The thing is, if a project claims to have a partnership I assume the best way to identify the validity of this is to a) ask the project making the assertion or b) ask the Komodo team.


[22-Jun-18 10:18 AM] Mister.G#3159
I am simply asking whether the paper they have claiming that Komodo is a partner is true or false?


[22-Jun-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
I am not aware of any partnership


[22-Jun-18 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
however I am not aware of all things, so that isnt a definitive thing.


[22-Jun-18 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
best to ask them what exact partnership they claim to have with komodo


[22-Jun-18 10:20 AM] Mister.G#3159
I can't get any straight answers


[22-Jun-18 10:20 AM] Mister.G#3159
That's why I came here


[22-Jun-18 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, i know of them


[22-Jun-18 10:20 AM] Mister.G#3159
Sorry to put you on the spot like this btw


[22-Jun-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
there isnt a formal partnership contract, but there is an understanding to work together


[22-Jun-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if all the external factors are solved, then there very well could be. they havent been solved yet and it is not up to me to solve them, so I cant say anything on that


[22-Jun-18 10:26 AM] Mister.G#3159
Thanks for the detailed explanation. Of course, I won't invest in their project based on the Komodo name and I will do my due diligence. I just had concerns about their project and wondered if they had been vetted (so to speak) by the team. I am invested in KMD and having your name attached to a project definitely eases these concerns. But I will wait until something concrete is established. Thanks again.

I'm pretty happy with the timeline from today. Informal unplanned chat, you crushed it with that article, we got the informal chat on reddit within minutes of it happening, and all the references links needed for your article were ready in no time, and official Komodo twitter (and many Komodo unofficial twitters) are sharing links and retweeting it shortly after. This is what well oiled machines do, not bad for a decentralized group of people. 👍

As per the discussion earlier with jl and john westbrook there was a mention of "jl777: It is much simpler and simpler is much better, yes. It also costs much less per tx, a lot less, it ends up being as secure as BTC. Sort of a magic trick."


[24-Jun-18 12:25 PM] Regnar#6164
How do we come to this conclusion, that it costs much less per tx? and do we have any way of quantifying this?


[24-Jun-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the cost for ETH tx?


[24-Jun-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
the scaling chains pay txfee in themselves


[24-Jun-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
0.0001 of $1 vs $5 ETH txfee


[24-Jun-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
seems a factor of 100x to 10000x less expensive

It sounds like they were just talking about it and wanting to make it happen, but I'm not sure they have anyone approaching them to help set this up, especially anyone to the caliber of Komodo. Which is why I think a Premier Partnership would be a solid plan


[24-Jun-18 12:45 PM] Regnar#6164
Here’s my thoughts:

We approach either the head of ministry of finance directly (I provided Steve his contact information already) we will either get him or one of the gatekeepers to him (intern, secretary, etc) in order to try and get a meeting with him to present the Komodo capabilities and our proposal of how we can help build their coin.

some of the key points we should touch on:
Being a nation of islands, roughly 400,000 people. With 255,000 living in Nassau and 50,000 living in Freeport, while the rest are spread out farther, they could start with a pilot program as their own independent chain (built on Komodo) and utilizing dPoW (to give it Bitcoin level security) so they don’t have the restrictions of Ethereum transaction costs and congestions. They can set their own transaction fees (which can be thought of as sales tax or something) in which a small percent of transaction fee transfers to the governments wallet (I believe this is called Override Commission.) They currently have a 7.5% sales tax but they could offer discounts if people use the coin. This will encourage people to use crypto there (as its cheaper than paying the higher tax, assuming they are honest merchants and report). This lower tax if using crypto will actually help their program be more successful (looks good politically) and allows them to account for tax collections much more efficiently (override commission).


[24-Jun-18 12:45 PM] Regnar#6164
The government could simply do the accounting for all the wallet transaction fees and use those funds to sell on the open market and pay for other things if they choose, or they can pay for redistribute it back to the wallet address via airdrop for whatever reason they deem necessary.
And if they are ready to scale, hopefully our scaling solutions will be ready, and show the burn protocol to combat inflation when people move island to island. There also exists the ability for them to provide a measure of QE if they deem its needed in the future (not a huge fan of it, but the option exists).

They could even offer a period of greater tax benefits or discounts to tourists who use the currency.

[24-Jun-18 01:03 PM] Regnar#6164
If a politician makes no new changes, the people generally think they are doing nothing (even if nothing is the right answer) and their political careers will be short lived. So proposing a solution to something you (finance minister of Bahamas) mentioned, and a partnership to implement it, also with political consulting included, such as the use of override commission for tax purposes, favorable exchange rates with the USD and other top tourist countries etc. would be beneficial


[24-Jun-18 01:05 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
seriously, first thing I would enquire who is the leading tech guy researching this stuff for the Bahamas gov, then approach him via Linkedin or other channels, ask how it's going, what bottlenecks have been found and pitch the advantages of using kmd if it suits their purpose


[24-Jun-18 01:05 PM] Regnar#6164
It's basically saying "hey you promised something that might have been over your head to do yourself, pay for the R&D, implement, etc. but we at Komodo have done all this for you, and would love to help you set it up so that you can deliver on your promise to your people"

[24-Jun-18 01:08 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

@jl777c I believe kind of "banking app" is a must in that case to make it smooth. By banking app I mean sth like in online banking where you can schedule payments / outgoing transfers with 2FA + you can set up 3rd party (not necessary a bank - might be your friend)  as someone who double secures your actions or settings changes / by smart contracts?).  I was thinking to go mainstream people need some kind of "passphrase/settings reset" which might be achieved maybe thanks to smart contracts and setting up some dependiecies 3rd parties who secures your money? BAnking then will switch to creating this security/backing up clients and even obtaining insurance maybe ... I'm thinking from user perspective, people not ready / not really aware security here is even more important, as you all your money are digital - if lost you have no money. Currently it's easier - if uou have these papers with numbers (and you live in US) in your wallet a hacker from Brazil will not take those papers from you.


[24-Jun-18 11:26 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
So actually any gov will abandon this project after realising people not ready / loosing money. At least national bank must be able to easy back it up somehow... To reset/restore keys (or other possibility of transfering account balance) when someone will come with ID to prove identity or sth like that.

How to prevent hacking may be most tricky. Separate token device might be useful. I personally do not use banking on cellphone. So my cellphone is a separate token. But most people use cellphones as primary + token, 2 in 1 which I consider not safe.

Think of the blockchain as a word processor that can write any document you want. Not having any specific document just means you need to write it, doesnt mean that the word processor cant create it. [replace "word processor" with "blockchain" and "document" with "transaction"] I (we) cant possibly write all the possible documents that might ever be desired by anyone. For now, we create the general purpose word processor and write custom documents when there is a big customer

what kind of number should we aim for for the next test? as we are debugging we need to test more chains, I was thinking of x4 the clusters so we use 256 chains.

this will give us a good result to work with and not cost too much. I dont have exact numbers but these 64 chain tests that run for about 3h-4h cost us about $20 in AWS credit

plus they aren't the only wallet provider that does that, holds proxy tokens to allow people to trade values, but not withdraw or deposit coins. Pretty sure Abra is like this as well. But it has a particular market that they are catering too, and it's not up to us to decide its good or bad, if it works and people like it, then cool.

I'm confused as to why community members and assetchains are doing more marketing and publishing more content than the Komodo marketing team. You are the marketing manager - we look to you for answers.


[27-Jun-18 03:22 PM] n2okpride#1967
JL didn't want to directly market the dpow solution directly. so we have been retweeting and sharing what GC posts.


[27-Jun-18 03:28 PM] PTYX#6840
The delayed proof of work is only one thing. After reading multiple comments in the cryptocurrency channel when one of our ambassadors published that we were added to Bitpanda I realized it is a general consensus that Komodo is lacking presence and marketing. I'm speaking in general, I see more marketing from third party members, assetchains, and ambassadors than our own accounts. People are missing informational videos, weekly video updates like PIVX, and other things that promote community.

You totally right @PTYX  is time to wake up in marketing action. 
Komodo has amazing blockchain technology and one of the best in the world but nothing to make it visible. A mediocre website that works very badly on some browsers, only one good video (atomic swap explanation) made by an assetchain, BarterDEX has now over than 150 coins and I was one of the only ones to share information, contact the creators of the various tokens to be able to gain a minimum of visibility, only two posts about Komodo's scalability on linkedIn had more than 30k views in 4d... 
Komodo need marketing to keep pace with the development of this ecosystem. And right now it's not.

there needs to be at least some kind of org structure, otherwise some part of work is wasted... I remember there were bounties for preparing some content improvement about KMD, but I didn't see any summary of it

@Alecandro we've been waiting on marketing for the last 8 months. I can't wait any longer.


[28-Jun-18 03:33 AM] PTYX#6840
We need results and follow through. We can't blame the marketing situation on lack of planning. I sat through countless meetings to listen to the plans so I know they exist.


[28-Jun-18 03:45 AM] sφldat#8733
and on top of that marketing is really not the most difficult point when technology is present.

Education & Enterprise & Gamers.  We had a booth at a government and startups convention in the netherlands yesterday.

What dApps do you think are going to be built on a blockchain?
Who is going to build them?
Who is going to train the people to build on a blockchain?

People are still learning about the tech and what they can potentially do with it.
A majority of software developers still think the crypto space is full of scams.

The komodo solutions are great, and there is room for improvement.  We want to welcome people external to the crypto scene into the komodo ecosystem.

In the last 6 months, the DEX has seen 100k atomic swaps and a few dICOs.  This has been marketed.   These are historical notes of Komodo's achievements.  This technology is available to anyone.

A new baseline is being set by Komodo from it's history and tech innovation - one that needs to be delivered professionally, succinctly and at the right time.

This tech has the potential to co-exist with large cloud vendors and integrate with many other projects and solutions.

forgot to add marketing should have some budget min 3k $ monthly; also marketing should do some wise testing of channels usage for specific targets (when targets set) so optimize money spending


[28-Jun-18 06:34 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
possibly there could be few marketing groups having few small budgets, and you could narrow down those groups with time - selecting those which bring better results, and finally increase the marketing budget for the best marketing leaders/groups which should be no more then 2-3 or maybe just 1 if proven really amazing 😃


[28-Jun-18 06:35 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so in 6 month a marketing budget like 20-50k $ could be reached, which should be sufficienty for longer period afterwards?


[28-Jun-18 06:37 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
obviously all spent money should be proven + results shown , someone must review that and manage, maybe a small commitee who discuss results and progress of marketing actions


[28-Jun-18 06:38 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also I think I have mentioned couple of months before - there should be a review of top 30 cmc coins marketing strategy = to see what actions they take and what actions are proven working; all actions should be reviewd, but only legal/moral correct/transparent should be discussed for later usage

there are certain parts of the komodo platform that can be marketed to the plebs


[28-Jun-18 06:54 AM] Mylo#8306
once scaling is turn key, a lot of app developers will be able to make an economic system in their apps that can interact outside of the app without the operational overhead of centralised systems and built in security.  blockchain provides operational efficiency.


[28-Jun-18 06:54 AM] jorian#4555
jumblr for example, no need for devs


[28-Jun-18 06:55 AM] Meyse#0952
ok but jumblr needs user friendly apps first


[28-Jun-18 06:55 AM] Mylo#8306
jumblr requires education.  people don't know yet how much they need privacy.  they are used to getting reamed by tracking networks.


[28-Jun-18 06:57 AM] Meyse#0952
i think the plebs need education first actually, they dont understand the concept of the need for security,scaling,decentralization


[28-Jun-18 06:57 AM] Mylo#8306
Education, exactly.  Developers don't know how much they can benefit from blockchain tech that is secure, private, interoperable, scalable.

And I'm constantly pointing devs and the like to KMD

THere's certainly more out there just like me


[28-Jun-18 07:00 AM] Mylo#8306
It will come with time, just like the internet came 10 years after it first arrived.  We want their first time to be in the komodo ecosystem.  So it takes education, easy tools, and usefulness.  1m tx/s is useful.


[28-Jun-18 07:00 AM] CollectorKC#4360
There's still so much barrier to entry anyhow


[28-Jun-18 07:01 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And the first wave of crypto is more speculatory rather than use case


[28-Jun-18 07:01 AM] Meyse#0952
there are kinda 2 choices of marketing, 1. market the promise of price increase, artificial value increase by plebs buying the coin 2. market the possibilities for devs by using the ecosystem which creates real value by real usage of the coin


[28-Jun-18 07:01 AM] CollectorKC#4360

Education = smart marketing. Good marketing is not simply "selling the shit". Should be informative, building awarness, education.

"There's still so much barrier to entry anyhow"
Because you don't have $1.60 to buy 1 KMD?


[28-Jun-18 07:03 AM] CollectorKC#4360
The tech is what sells KMD, not the promise of the price going up

yes

Marketing results <- marketing targets. For jumbler you may like to increase user base. Same for DEX, Agama... I believe you can set up some measures, KPIs and check them different ways. KPIs example = { new downloads by IP addresses, nr of addresses in usage, ...}


[28-Jun-18 07:04 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I'd certainly focus on KMD's useful tech and market it


[28-Jun-18 07:04 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
for DEX target would be actually volume ...


[28-Jun-18 07:04 AM] jorian#4555
yeah but who the hell needs to jumble weekly


[28-Jun-18 07:05 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also for DEX partially marketing is done by different teams doing diff UI's ...


[28-Jun-18 07:05 AM] Meyse#0952
more volume is created by devs creating multiple dex's that users can choose from


[28-Jun-18 07:05 AM] Mylo#8306
@CollectorKC if you are in contact with devs, could you please get some details - what languages/platforms (mobile /web/desktop etc.) they work on and keep a record of where the target market is for the people you are in contact with.  We can provide developer onboarding stuff in the future.


[28-Jun-18 07:05 AM] CollectorKC#4360

[28-Jun-18 07:06 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
success = bigger volume traded

and more users or sth like that


[28-Jun-18 07:06 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I mean DEX UI


[28-Jun-18 07:07 AM] Meyse#0952
DEX devs are already rewarded by percentage of DEX txfees, this should be marketed cause nobody knows about this, also they can setup their own LP's in certain apps which can also make them money


[28-Jun-18 07:08 AM] CollectorKC#4360

[28-Jun-18 07:08 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so you see what tyou can market -> earn money with KMD building DEX UI -> you earn fees. Here marketing effort needed so that the world id educated/informed well about it.

I haven't been able to read all 40+ pages of it yet, but it appears to be extremely professional and well thought out. It would be definitely beneficial to have such an objective report written about Komodo and we could potentially present it to institutional investors as 3rd party objective analysis in addition to our traditional marketing material.

@n2okpride hey Steve I know you've got new templates/themes you want to use for Komodo updates, announcements etc that have specific feel and color schemes.

I think we should make one specifically for coin announcements getting listed on BarterDEX. I tried doing this a while back but the updates of new coins seemed spaced out and made distribution of any marketing material difficult/last minute. I was thinking we could have a pre made template with komodo logos and listing announcement etc and when coins put their info in on Github to be listed, they can give their logo and the email address of whoever runs their social media, and we simply add their logo to the graphic and email it to their social media person saying, "hey here's our official announcement poster, your coin should be supported on X day, feel free to post this to your Twitter and tag us and we'll retweet!"

The github request makes it so we can reach out into other coin communities and get unique impressions. 

"Adding a coin got much easier. Any new coin add request now ONLY has to go to this repository: https://github.com/jl777/coins."

not per coin, like batch updates


[28-Jun-18 01:59 PM] n2okpride#1967
weekly or monthly. we're figuring out what the best process would be for meaningful  updates


[28-Jun-18 02:00 PM] Regnar#6164
I mean us announcing it I feel will only get it out to our own followers. Wouldn't per coin be more effective at outreach? A small cap coin that gets listed is probably going to be less receptive to tweeting to their followers that they are 1 of 20 coins to be added.


[28-Jun-18 02:02 PM] Regnar#6164
It's of course more work, which is why I suggested having a simple Komodo template where we slap the logo they provided us on it, and send their social media email the poster to tweet.

[29-Jun-18 12:58 AM] Audo#5667
Those five points are a good summary towards investors.

We are about to announce 5 technology pillars (security, scalability, interoperability, privacy, simplicity) that we hope would make it easy to understand what we are trying to offer. These pillars are directed more towards businesses / entreprise / developers to which we want to sell our Komodo Assetchain technology.

I would love to market Agama Wallet more, but for that to happen our team needs to finalize PEN testing and then we it would deserve its own landing page. We might actually soon have something cool to announce as Steve has been talking with one Agency who is going to help us build THE BEST multi-coin wallet on the industry. I heard from Steve these guys are really exited about Komodo 😃


[29-Jun-18 12:59 AM] Audo#5667

Good news @Audo , you talk about HyperDEX website ?


[29-Jun-18 01:07 AM] Audo#5667
My elevator pitch for KMD is... 

> Komodo is an end-to-end technology provider with a vision of building an interoperable ecosystem. With Komodo you can host your own infrastructure and connect your project into the whole ecosystem, including a multi-coin wallet and decentralized exchange. The Komodo blockchain offers security and interoperability services for all the other blockchains on our ecosystem.

Something like that... what do you guys think?

If I would be talking to an investor perhaps I would highlight how Komodo is the base currency of the entire ecosystem, and that you get 5 % rewards and good privacy.


[29-Jun-18 01:09 AM] Audo#5667

[29-Jun-18 01:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or something else relevant to our case....


[29-Jun-18 01:16 AM] Audo#5667
Since Komodo offers very wide range of technologies we have concluded to talk about 'end-to-end technology'. I guess 'blockchain' is the standard term everyone uses to refer to the technology. Even wider term would be 'ledger technology'. I haven't came up with any other term that could hold all our tech inside it.

The best option in my mind would be to talk about "Blockchain as a Service", "Infrastructure as a Service" or "Platform as a Service"... but we are little concerned to promise this as currently we have a DIY model. For now we are just providing technology, there is no service to sell. If we would mention service then many businesses would assume we offer a lot more than pure technology.

[29-Jun-18 01:55 AM] sφldat#8733
It's very clear, and I think it's very important to really explain that the big difference of komodo with other blockchain platforms is that on Komodo you can create your own completely independent blockchain. people have trouble understanding this


[29-Jun-18 02:01 AM] Audo#5667
yeah they do. Even when I explain that "with Komodo you get your own blockchain" or "native blockchain" .... most people don't understand what  I mean by that. 

Thus now I prefer to tell them that "with Komodo you can host your own infrastructure and not be dependent on a public blockchain". That makes our benefits more clear, but I'm afraid that then we have the problem of making a distinction with a private permissioned blockchain. At least the moment we only provide public permissionless blockchains.


[29-Jun-18 02:05 AM] sφldat#8733
Yeah, it can be confusing. Maybe give an concret example with Eth. 
For example, when you create an ERC-20 on Eth, you are 100% dependent on the Eth blockchain.
So if the Eth network crashes, your company crashes too.
And if you want to leave the Eth network you have to develop your own blockchain and swap your ERC-20 tokens, as for EOS for example and can make investors lose confidence and it costs millions.. 
I don't know it's just an idea.


[29-Jun-18 02:07 AM] Audo#5667
yes an example is always the best

I have an idea for a 'brief and micro-bounties' community that would create a decentralized resource for our content, comms and marketing and bring it into line with Komodo's ecosystem. I've recorded a video of myself explaining it (not offical KMD video just me talking!).

If you're interested please come and share your thoughts here and leave comments https://forum.komodoplatform.com/t/about-the-komodo-influencer-network-category/117. 

If this gains enough traction and you like the idea I can take this to Steve and JL777 and suggest we try it out. Please make your voice heard! 

P.S. if you just want the video it's here https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=O1LdWU1WEQo.

[29-Jun-18 10:14 AM] n2okpride#1967
In regards to the explanation of independent chains we've been employing two analogies.


[29-Jun-18 10:15 AM] n2okpride#1967
1) Other platforms/eth are like a giant highway dapps as cars. When there were less cars its was fine, but as the influx of cars exceeded the limited lanes in the highway traffic becomes inevitable.


[29-Jun-18 10:16 AM] n2okpride#1967
KMD gives you your own dedicated private highway. If you outgrow that, we can add another lane (scaling solution) on demand. We can continue to do this to scale linearly.


[29-Jun-18 10:17 AM] n2okpride#1967
2) If you lived in an apt complex, would you pay for internet that was being shared by the entire building? Eth/other platforms is like sharing a single wifi/broadband connection and being affected by other people streaming, gaming, or downloading etc


[29-Jun-18 10:18 AM] n2okpride#1967
KMD gives you your own dedicated wifi and internet per unit. If bandwidth usage exceeds you can always upgrade (scaling). This has no limit.

we've used the road one a lot with influencers and research groups and press and was well received.

the wifi one can be extended to our other pillars, so i'm thinking we might use that one


[29-Jun-18 10:20 AM] n2okpride#1967
as your wouldn't join a wifi network that allowed anyone to pry into your browsing and history...people deserve privacy


[29-Jun-18 10:21 AM] n2okpride#1967
you wouldn't join a wifi if they controlled and limited what sites/apps you could access - need interoperability


[29-Jun-18 10:23 AM] n2okpride#1967
you wouldn't go on a wifi /isp that took hours/days to setup, need special hw, complex configuration. - need simplicity, we have end to end solutions and whitelabel products that accelerate deployment


[29-Jun-18 10:27 AM] PTYX#6840
I'm not sold on the wifi analogy


[29-Jun-18 10:31 AM] n2okpride#1967
ok fair enough


[29-Jun-18 10:32 AM] n2okpride#1967

[29-Jun-18 10:39 AM] xRobeSx#5136
cars/highway seems like the better angle imo. most people can relate to driving faster with more lanes

We have some time wanted to bring more transparency on our marketing efforts, and as a result of that we have created a public marketing Trello board.

We will keep it up to date and share everything we can. It is a new thing, so there are probably some things missing that I didn't think of. I would us also to document our marketing strategy there later on.

**Public Marketing Board**: https://trello.com/b/xCc8hngf/public-komodo-marketing-board

# How it works

* Post your marketing ideas to our forum or share them on Discord (https://forum.komodoplatform.com/c/marketing)
* Ask questions here on this channel
* Provide us feedback on things that are not yet published, so we can do even better marketing!

It's a win-win for our team and for our active community. You will get an insight into what will be happening and we will get valuable feedback and more ideas.

@smkhound it was pointing to the email list to focus on  building and increasing signups, and we've reached 12K now + had a lot of growth. I've had this discussion in DMs.

Really we need a stronger popup on the website @n2okpride.

But I've now changed the link to the website and will switch to sharing FBF links on Sat + Medium summaries @smkhound. We can put this one to bed 🙏🏻

not that this has something to do with marketing, but i highly recommend starting 1 place (an official blog with news updates) where stuff like the 1,000,000 block change is laid out. Putting it on read the docs and linking to it, is not the proper way to announce this

just a simple blog post with what is happening and why it is needed


[30-Jun-18 02:33 AM] Audo#5667
we just decided to make a blog post about this change ~1 month before the 1M block. Until then it's just few smaller reminders


[30-Jun-18 03:55 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@jorian exactly a dedicated blog is needed, where one could track hisotry of changes of anything / not only tech but also new partnerships and other news

yes, what passcombo said. not specifically for that 1M block, but for everything


[30-Jun-18 04:48 AM] jorian#4555
just in the last month, blogs / news updates could've been made about 
- the importance of GAME using dPoW (or maybe after a couple of months to test the time a bit)
- crypto conditions, scaling and all that has been going on in #dev-scalability 
- (a short summary of) the advancements in CHIPS and the creation of the CHIPS community
- the creation of several third party ecosystem developers, like DEVSEC, ChainZilla etc.
- someone doing a write-up about what the consequences of the ASIC for KMD are
- someone doing a write-up about what ZEC is doing and why or why not KMD is integrating their updates

and i'm sure there's more. when bundled in a single location, people start to see that as authorative. that KMD is expert in these things.

most in marketing, the deep tech is not comfortable to write about


[30-Jun-18 04:51 AM] jorian#4555
the thing is; i often see people come in and ask james a lot of useful questions. but they get lost and nobody knows what has been said.


[30-Jun-18 04:51 AM] jorian#4555
yes, i know


[30-Jun-18 04:51 AM] jorian#4555
but it's a simple question from the marketing department, and i don't see that question often


[30-Jun-18 04:51 AM] jorian#4555
that Trello board that just created, is a good start


[30-Jun-18 04:55 AM] jorian#4555
and i dont expect marketing to have deep knowledge about everything KMD does, that isn't possible. maybe a community curated blog? with different people explaining different things?


[30-Jun-18 05:49 AM] Audo#5667
Thank you for the ideas @jorian , they are good ones.

There definitely is room to improve for us. We should produce content in more regular interwals and maybe our focus on a single campaign has made us blind to some of the things we could have blogged about. Many times, however, we need a bit more time to write about something and often we have hard time understanding the technical aspects and angles.

Example 1: You suggested a blog about *"the creation of several third party ecosystem developers, like DEVSEC, ChainZilla etc."* – This is definitely a blog we will write. The situation is very young still, however. These businesses are just setting themselves up. Also our business development team is planning how we handle this exactly. Thus it's better to wait for the situation to mature, at least in my opinion. A blog about this in 1 month will be just as powerful as it would be today.

Example 2:  *"someone doing a write-up about what the consequences of the ASIC for KMD are"* – sounds interesting, but I'm not sure what this is about. Our marketing team needs a better bridge to the technical minds who would feed us content. Indeend, @jorian if you could help us in this perhaps we could talk. We are looking people like you.

Example 3: - *"someone doing a write-up about what ZEC is doing and why or why not KMD is integrating their updates"* – the same as above, our resources are limited and it takes a long time for us to understand these in enough detail to blog about them. We need a dedicated technical person to help us out.


[30-Jun-18 05:49 AM] Audo#5667
*"the importance of GAME using dPoW (or maybe after a couple of months to test the time a bit)"*
 – A team decision was made not to draw too much attention to our dPoW promise as of yet, because it's in PEN testing and so on. Thus our marketing team has only been able to retweet mentions and not directly blog about it. We will be making a blog post about this in time once we are ready to market this feature. It will still work as we can interview GAME and explain that they have been using our security service for 3 months without any attacks, and so on.


[30-Jun-18 05:49 AM] Audo#5667
*"crypto conditions, scaling and all that has been going on in #dev-scalability"*
 – We have been giving the stress test small mentions here and there. However, it has been a conscious decision on our part not to make too much noise about it until the numbers have been validated and the infrastructure is ready. We haven't had any timeline on how long it takes to setup the infrastructure and it is better to make the noice once we know for sure when the actual live marketable stress test will happen.

*"(a short summary of) the advancements in CHIPS and the creation of the CHIPS community"*
– Good point, we should, but there is no rush. CHIPS project was started with the decision to have ZERO marketing for it.


[30-Jun-18 05:50 AM] Audo#5667
'All in all let me just sum up this to two points:

1) Yes, our marketing could do better job on few things. We are improving and now we want to get you guys more involved.

2) One problem we have indentified is that Komodo is all over the place – and with that we mean the messages we send out through marketing

We are trying to focus on one talking point at a time and build campaigns. Since the ICO our marketing has been reactionary but we want to get to a position when we can plan and anticipate. That means that we are not going to talk about all the "noice" that is going on before it is mature enough to be properly marketed (i.e. CHIPS and Assetchain businesses).


[30-Jun-18 05:50 AM] Audo#5667
**Then what do we talk about today?**
Right now we started our "Komodo Evolution" campaign in which we revealed our 5 technology pillars. We will talk about security, scalability, interoperability, privacy, and simplicity – and how a blockchain platform/ecosystem needs them all.

These are the 5 main selling points why a business should use Komodo instead of some other blockchain/technology provider. From this campaign it is natural to transition more towards

 a) scalability test marketing – including some short of an online event with a scalability test demonstration
 b) announcing how to get started with Komodo through the 3rd party businesses

[30-Jun-18 06:30 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
IMO, the top 3 marketing "Average Joe" priorities should be:
1) DEX
2) Agama features
3) that a QT wallet exists


[30-Jun-18 06:35 AM] Audo#5667
## Why don't we market Agama Wallet more?

We would love to market Agama Wallet more, but for that to happen our team needs to finalise PEN testing. Our team must be sure that there are no critical bugs or user-experience issues. Our marketing team needs a green light from the testing team.

Next, we need to work out a new landing page the dApp deserves. We might soon have something exciting to announce as Steve has been talking with one Agency who is going to help us build THE BEST multi-coin wallet on the industry. 

According to Steve, these guys are extremely excited about Komodo tech.

@Audo no wallet app is completely free of bug. Agama has been running smoothly for some time now and no major issues reported. @pbca26 is constantly working improving Agama features.

[30-Jun-18 06:49 AM] Audo#5667
ok, then it sounds like we can give it more attention.

Last time we wanted to market it and build a product page we didn't get a green light (maybe 1-2 months ago).

Now we are in contact with that agency though, so not sure what is the strategy

I think pushing agama is important, but we seriously need to get the visual appearances of the apps to look somewhat similar. Right now BarterDEX and agama looks like you had downloaded from two completely different places. They should have similar colors and feel, custom icon buttons, etc. I'm still not a fan of the white layout in agama, it doesn't feel like a cool, secure, multicoin wallet. Even simple things like nightmode always appeal to users.


[30-Jun-18 07:08 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Well, 'BarterDEX GUI' was meant to be a reference implementation of all features that can be done with the DEX API, so I'm not sure that it could/should be changed to "match"


[30-Jun-18 07:10 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm not sure why that affects basic color scheme matching?


[30-Jun-18 07:10 AM] Audo#5667
@Regnar exactly!

We have had a little easter egg on the public trello board that I think no one has yet noticed: https://trello.com/c/rQT96e2v/13-hiring-an-agency

We will be working with this agency to create public facing products that all share the same branding: https://www.ideasbynature.com/

They are the same guys that created Shapeshift, so we feel pretty confident that they are able to pull everything off from technical standpoint.

I can totally understand some of the buttons and layouts etc. But themes etc


[30-Jun-18 07:11 AM] jorian#4555
i noticed that agency


[30-Jun-18 07:11 AM] jorian#4555
i just wonder what that means: complete rehaul? Komodo 3.0?


[30-Jun-18 07:12 AM] Regnar#6164
Sorry if I'm being succinct in my responses, typing on mobile


[30-Jun-18 07:12 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
IMO, any theme "matching" should happen in similar apps - i.e., Since Agama is an "every man's apps" then some "SimpleDEX" should "match" it
Otherwise, you're at "My cargo truck doesn't look like my Porsche"


[30-Jun-18 07:13 AM] jorian#4555
i tend to agree with what grewal once said: komodo should present a reference app of the tech that komodo makes. then others can see how it could work and make an own version.


[30-Jun-18 07:13 AM] Audo#5667
We will post more info later, but we are talking with them and they are very excited about Komodo and atomic swaps. We will be building user facing applications with them with a goal of getting a wide user adoption.


[30-Jun-18 07:13 AM] jorian#4555
since anyone can build on Komodo tech


[30-Jun-18 07:13 AM] Audo#5667
yeah, that's what HypderDEX did 👍


[30-Jun-18 07:14 AM] jorian#4555
exactly


[30-Jun-18 07:14 AM] jorian#4555
and with hyperdex, anyone can make a DEX. (How to make your own DEX in 30 minutes)


[30-Jun-18 07:14 AM] PTYX#6840
We are doing it without an agency. I feel the resources are available. At least to me they were


[30-Jun-18 07:14 AM] PTYX#6840
However, if it means results. Then I'm for it.


[30-Jun-18 07:15 AM] jorian#4555
so the roadmap that existed before, is that still in place?


[30-Jun-18 07:17 AM] Audo#5667
Using an agency is certainly costs more, but at the other hand we get very reliable launch dates and world-class UX & UI. Considering that Komodo is currently leading the industry on many aspects we need to move fast. It's not enough to let everyone know that we have the technology, we must bring the proejcts cross the finish line so the average users can use them (think of Shapeshift or Exodus Wallet).


[30-Jun-18 07:18 AM] Audo#5667

We are just getting started from what I know – that's all I know


[30-Jun-18 07:19 AM] PTYX#6840
I see


[30-Jun-18 07:20 AM] jorian#4555
in my opinion, you'll have 2 different target groups. hiring the agency will help the end-customer. Granny friendly apps, catered by the komodo platform. Then there's the developer as target, where Komodo Platform caters developers with good documentation and tools, so that anyone can build their own app.


[30-Jun-18 07:22 AM] jorian#4555
and with that, i remember some months ago the discussion about which way the Komodo Platform should develop, and I remember that each tech would get his own 'group' of people working and marketing it. JUMBLR, DEX, Agama, etc.


[30-Jun-18 07:44 AM] dan.#2473

and i hope the agency that's about to be hired, can help with getting direction


[30-Jun-18 08:00 AM] Audo#5667
yep, that number one goal for Komodo is to provide Assetchains (and technology in general).

If 100 projects start building something with their own Komodo Assetchain then they form an ecosystem.

The user facing applications we have are to support that ecosystem vision, e.g. multi-coin wallet and DEX


[30-Jun-18 08:02 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
*e.g. multi-coin wallet, single-coin wallet, and DEX

I think an agency is a good move

[30-Jun-18 08:13 AM] dan.#2473
Is this agency getting involved with social media as well ?


[30-Jun-18 08:36 AM] Audo#5667
no, they will do GUI development (including UX & UI), branding

Details are not clear and could change. This is just a headsup about our plan. We will announce more once things are finalized


[30-Jun-18 09:17 AM] Regnar#6164
Honestly, I love the exodus wallet look and feel for a user facing wallet. Not as much functionality vs agama, it's very friendly to new crypto users. I'm sure there is a market for a version of agama like this. Though not necessarily needs to be released by Komodo


[30-Jun-18 09:32 AM] PTYX#6840
I tried to poach one of their frontend devs


[30-Jun-18 09:32 AM] PTYX#6840
Lol, it didn't work


[30-Jun-18 09:32 AM] PTYX#6840
We was "extremely happy" with exodus


[30-Jun-18 10:37 AM] Audo#5667
The current marketing team is:
 - Steve: the marketing lead and strategist
 - Ben: Social Media and community engagement
 - Audo: I help out everywhere I can, like community building!
 - Daniel & Davion: our writers (currently part-time)
 - Bryan: animation/video (part-time)
 - Graphics: we are looking for someone to come full time

When it comes to marketing strategy, Steve would be the best guy to explain. In short, there are few things we need to have a solid foundation for effective marketing:

 - Clear vision about what our Komodo project wants to do and achieve
 - Brand architecture among all the various parts and projects we have
 - Messaging and stories to quickly explain what we do and how our tech works

The goal is to have a clear brand for Komodo. That means, that if I say "Komodo" you will think about one thing... and that one thing is the most important thing.

If I say Shapeshift, you think of an easy exchange service
If I say Ethereum, you think of a smart contract platform for developers
If I say, Stratis, you think of a blockchain provider for the enterprise

If I say Komodo, what do you think?

If we ask this from many people, I would guess we would get very diverse answers ranging from DEX, to dICO platform, to privacy coin... and that is one of the problems we have. We need to develop a clear brand and messaging for Komodo for the marketing to work.

If our community struggles to explains what we do, how can we ever grow?

At the moment it looks like we are planning to brand Komodo as an "end-to-end blockchain technology provider" that allows everyone to launch their independent blockchain.

I also want us to talk more about 'ecosystem', and that is where I believe our vision comes in. We provide technology for the whole industry to build an interoperable ecosystem. Komodo itself is not an ecosystem; it is just helping to build an ecosystem.

`That means, that if I say "Komodo" you will think about one thing... and that one thing is the most important thing.`
I'm not sure that "one thing" could ever do justice to all of the things that Komodo is and/or will be


[30-Jun-18 10:41 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Unless that "one thing" is "a pioneer and leader in the crypto space"

I agree with the above. I don't agree with it taking so long.


[30-Jun-18 10:44 AM] Nickname_01#2701
What first comes to mind when I think Intel would be CPU's, but they produce much more than CPU's.. When I think Komodo, I believe I should think of one thing as well, so one feature should be primary, the other features while those in the know have a hard time deciding how any could be secondary, they should be and tagged as projects "Powered by Komodo" ..Thats my opinion


[30-Jun-18 10:45 AM] Audo#5667
Yes that one thing has to more or less hold everything we do inside it, and "end-to-end blockchain technology provider" pretty much does, right?

To create a powerful brand it has to be a one thing – and it cannot change.

{Reactions}

[30-Jun-18 10:49 AM] Audo#5667
yes exactly @Nickname_01 , that is our current plan for BarterDEX backend. It would carry its own brand and it would be "powered by Komodo"


[30-Jun-18 10:50 AM] Nickname_01#2701
I personally like "end-to-end blockchain technology provider" as primary as it is reaching out and feeding the ecosystem, the more projects using Komodo as a provider the more visibility / clout is had behind other Komodo powered projects.  The provider angle is  great marketing in a way, just as people may of initially noticed Intel after buying a PC containing its chips


[30-Jun-18 10:51 AM] Nickname_01#2701
I think in short, I just agree /votes the way you all are already thinking 😃


[30-Jun-18 10:56 AM] Audo#5667
Yes, and I can't stress the brandin value there enough. We must get hundreds and thousands of projects to use our technology. Our brand has to scream security & innovation, and we must be seen as the authority on the industry.

If we try to mix in other things it would dilute our brand value, e.g. a decentralized exchange, and even a multi-coin wallet in my personal opinion. Many of these things are still under discussion.

Take a real-life case: Lexus is a luxury car with its own branding, but it is made by Toyota.

We want to make BarterDEX its own brand, made by Komodo


[30-Jun-18 10:58 AM] Audo#5667
There's a very good reason why Toyota gave Lexus it's complete brand indepenence. For the same reason we are looking many other aspects in the Komodo sphere and thinking if they should get their own independent brand.


[30-Jun-18 10:59 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"There's a very good reason why Toyota gave Lexus it's complete brand indepenence. "
Because no one is going to pay $100,000 for a Corolla


[30-Jun-18 11:02 AM] Audo#5667
in our case that's a bit more tricky, and BarterDEX backend in my opinion could be under the main Komodo brand. Both have their plust and minus sides. One other thing our team was thinking was the importance to make BarterDEX seens as an independent project so that other blockchain projects would be more happy to use the technology. If it's seens as "komodo feature" some projects might ignore it as they see us as their competitors.


[30-Jun-18 11:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Imo:
1) it's not always a good idea to rely on the luxury car analogy (after all the difference between many GMC products and Cadillacs is smoke, mirrors, price, and perception)
2) When promoting flagship products, never forget that there are other products under that flag that appeal to other demographics (i.e., multi-coin and single coin wallets)


[30-Jun-18 11:08 AM] Nickname_01#2701
Good point, even if the technical team working another project understood BarterDEX as the obvious choice to build upon, the "suits" may overule that decision seeing it as technology of a "competitor"...Lots of stupid out there making decisions that don't make sense, so taking away obstacles that could interfere seems wise.


[30-Jun-18 11:17 AM] Nickname_01#2701
@ComputerGenie Awesome analogy with the cars.. Lots of assets (car bodies) with the same engine, transmission, etc (drivetrain) ..Very analgous to Asset Chains built around a Primary chain

"we must bring the proejcts cross the finish line so the average users can use them"

I agree with this. An easy to use UI will bring more users; it will essentially market itself. The average user won't care how it works they just want it to work.

@Audo is there dedicated KMD blog somewhere? In the marketing strategy I still miss clear communication / kind of blog with historical progress notes, strategic changes, new devs, new significan community members, technical, partnerships and so on.. to be able to see progress chronologically ... partially it should serve as a chronics but also education and information... also this builds "legacy" which is useful since many brands use it / people trust when there is clarity of information and kind of constant progress visible... Also media will like it  - source for information how KMD/Supernet develops over time. Such blog should be updated with any useful information, but start with what historically happened.

@Audo I ment history more in terms of a time-line where you could see KMD development (tech+strategy+partnerships) down to the origins (maybe also supported in some kind of a graphical map?) -> this is useful for media/bloggers and allows them to build articles since most required information would be in 1 place + ongoing updates. It will allow organic growth in awareness about the platform, because it will allow many people for easy access of information. Easy access for information collected in chronological order in one place is sth basic for marketin I believe, people need to land somewhere when they hear about KMD. Current site is nice, maybe adding a blog section in a tab + some twitter box on the front would make it more "alive" ... I think marketing guys will know it better.

We've recently invested in a platform called Melt Water that will drive insights on what is being talked about and by what writers and contributors. We have several influencer databases that we've spent time developing relationships with. Once categorized, we've decided that we will also make this public to our community to help add to, or understand the level of engagement and activities are.


[01-Jul-18 03:25 PM] n2okpride#1967
we will offer more transparency, which is something we've not focusing on as much in the past.


[01-Jul-18 03:29 PM] n2okpride#1967
we've  made the decision to share more and not be in an endless "planning" and "perfecting loop that has often slowed down production output. we will share drafts under disclaimers and provide updates, whether they're formally announced or not. please also remember there are many items that are under NDA, where contractually we cannot disclose things until they've become finalized. we will however give high-level updates on status updates regarding these but won't disclose company/project names until allowed.

We've been invited to be a founding member of a UN affiliated consultancy that is building a Blockchain Consortium group. This is an exciting opportunity for us, and will help give us credibility and validation as we pursue a nation-state blockchain solution that is a primary use case james has identified for our scaling solution.

or we switching to hyperdex?


[01-Jul-18 03:42 PM] n2okpride#1967
currently hyperdex is the main focus for the barterdex frontend, as decided by the technical team. we are aligned and will support any co-marketing activities that the hyperdex team needs.


[01-Jul-18 03:43 PM] n2okpride#1967
we're in discussions with several projects on integrating barterdex to their front-ends. licensing of barterdex backend for liquidity providers is also being worked on.


[01-Jul-18 03:43 PM] n2okpride#1967

Someone mentioning in telegram about how to convince waves and erc20 tokens to move over to KMD. Obviously independent blockchains are a big factor, however does anyone think that providing your own mining power might be a turn off to many projects?


[01-Jul-18 04:12 PM] Regnar#6164
obviously we can encourage them to use dPoW to help secure their chains, but they are likely to be under powered still, any thoughts on this?


[01-Jul-18 04:54 PM] n2okpride#1967
There are efforts in creating solutions that will make ERC20 migrations more seamless. We haven't targeted waves at all, but they do have a targeted solution to create a token on their product that is  streamlined.


[01-Jul-18 06:17 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea I guess I'm just trying to figure out if we have a viable solution for ultra light, bordering on skeleton projects that have no desire for their own mining capabilities


[01-Jul-18 06:25 PM] Regnar#6164
I guess PoS would be a suitable mining algo for barebone projects.


[01-Jul-18 10:10 PM] RAE#3178
There's an Instagram channel: 'ethereum_updates' that I've noticed bullishly posts KMD graphics and news and reaches 43.1k followers. 
Thought I'd mention it for everyone's info and liking the KMD posts. 
Also...Steve Lee thanks for the updates today, very encouraging to read.

I think the top one sums it up nicely and gets people more interested. Youll hear lots of blockchains with "protection" but for someone to read "Protect with bitcoins hashrate" sort of grabs their attention

@sφldat  I added "at a fraction of the cost" as it is a unique differentiator that we can even extend bitcoin level security, but at the cost we offer it makes it a no brainer.

[03-Jul-18 09:01 AM] n2okpride#1967
@Meyse  the way i've been positioning it is as a regular backup, where we take a point in place snapshot that we can restore


[03-Jul-18 09:01 AM] n2okpride#1967
this is similar to a checkpoint


[03-Jul-18 09:03 AM] benohanlon#7045
I like a checkpoint much more than a backup

{Reactions}
💯 

[03-Jul-18 09:03 AM] benohanlon#7045
as we often have to explain it's a counter


[03-Jul-18 09:03 AM] benohanlon#7045
i feel like a checkpoint is great because people understand you'd restart at a checkpoint


[03-Jul-18 09:03 AM] n2okpride#1967
how is that different than a backup restore?


[03-Jul-18 09:04 AM] benohanlon#7045
a backup is something you're saving... to use it you feel like you lost

whereas a checkpoint has a more positive connotation because you're still in motion... 

maybe ive played too much mario kart?


[03-Jul-18 09:04 AM] n2okpride#1967
haha


[03-Jul-18 09:04 AM] benohanlon#7045
but you see what i mean? a checkpoint in my mind means you're in motion 😄


[03-Jul-18 09:05 AM] n2okpride#1967
i guess it depends on how you define "checkpoint"


[03-Jul-18 09:05 AM] benohanlon#7045
a back-up is for floppy disks


[03-Jul-18 09:05 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Very good analogy @benohanlon  It does feel like the difference of a positive connotation versus a negative.

a checkpoint is more visual too - something that would be easy to create a graphic for

ive never seen an image of a sexy backup

yeah its the weight of words i suppose, checkpoint=light, backup=hard


[03-Jul-18 09:07 AM] n2okpride#1967
but we're talking about protection


[03-Jul-18 09:08 AM] n2okpride#1967
depends on approach I suppose as i'm much more used to not needing to be positive for DR and BC


[03-Jul-18 09:08 AM] n2okpride#1967
it's always pushed as a risk mitigation and needing to quantify the cost of an attack


[03-Jul-18 09:09 AM] Meyse#0952
restoring a backup sounds like a lot more work then going back to a checkpoint


[03-Jul-18 09:09 AM] n2okpride#1967
yes agreed

we can't really position DR, but it is a similar concept in how data protection has become a proactive design requirement, when it used to be an afterthought


[03-Jul-18 09:14 AM] n2okpride#1967
checkpoints do have a very specific meaning in the states, but i do get the video game metaphor


[03-Jul-18 09:15 AM] Regnar#6164
I mean, I like checkpoint as well, but Iron Mountain, AWS, and IBM all use "backup" for their product names and descriptions


[03-Jul-18 09:15 AM] Regnar#6164
which might translate better in b2b


[03-Jul-18 09:15 AM] n2okpride#1967
backup recovery is widely understood, but data protection is the umbrella term that has a whole set of solutions


[03-Jul-18 09:16 AM] Meyse#0952
for me dpow is easier explained in visuals with checkpoints, how to explain it to businesses could be better like a backup, but i dont know whats best


[03-Jul-18 09:20 AM] n2okpride#1967
We'll need to further message test the checkpoint concept


[03-Jul-18 09:21 AM] n2okpride#1967
But if someone asks "ok so what exactly is a checkpoint, and how is that actually done?"


[03-Jul-18 09:21 AM] n2okpride#1967

[03-Jul-18 03:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
When they add coins they usually run a promotion to get you to hold your coins on the exchange by giving away their CET tokens to people who do it. I honestly did this with Siacoin awhile ago and the CET I earned is worth 170 bucks today 😅

[03-Jul-18 09:09 PM] Mylo#8306
there's a (fairly newish but very very useful) feature of kmd assetchains to self-detect if they are on a fork and auto-rewind (using these notarization checkpoints).  this happened for the first time in the wild on may 21.
the use case encountered was during the initial sync of a chain and has been documented for some writing to be made from it.  @n2okpride it's in the team wiki under my space with a few pages of relevant chat from notary node chatter about it.

the feature reads as though it could be extended to non-kmd-ecosystem chains in the future.


[03-Jul-18 09:23 PM] Mylo#8306
so there's one really useful `checkpoint` example.  helps lots of nodes sync and stay in sync without the need for a team of engineers to mollycoddle a blockchain to sync across multiple nodes.


[03-Jul-18 09:25 PM] Mylo#8306
so it lowers the barrier to entry for a dApp or organisation to enter the blockchain space without needing to be blockchain operations experts, e.g. lowers operational costs yet again by using notarization.

Hi, I've seen a discussion on Pepedapp (a collectible dapp in the ethereum network) about komodo and changing its dapp to the komodo blockchain
I copied the conversation into a file but I can not upload it to this discord channel
Senda 
they have doubts about komodo smart contracts, some say they are not well tested
all this comes from the problems of congestion and high gas prices that the ethereum network is having
They also have doubts about how they could change the cards already created, it seems they see it complicated

If someone wants to see the conversation or tell me a link where they can find the best information, let me know, thank you

[04-Jul-18 07:03 PM] Regnar#6164
I've got an idea, though I'm not versed in the specifics of dPoW enough to do this solo, but this website that calculates the costs of 51% attacks on specific coins on Nicehash. What if we could make our own version of this list and show how dPoW can actually decrease the potential gains from hacking each coin. https://www.crypto51.app/


[04-Jul-18 07:05 PM] Regnar#6164
iirc 51% attacks occur when an adversarial miner creates a silent chain of conflicting transactions, multiple blocks of which, and on the current chain sends a transaction to an exchange or something, it is confirmed, they trade and pull their coins from the exchange, and then release their longer, silent chain, and begin mining that new chain so it becomes the legit chain, except all their transactions are erased.


[04-Jul-18 07:07 PM] Regnar#6164
hacker keeps the newly traded coins, and the coins used to trade for them. so dPoW with a notary every 10 minutes limits the upside potential for a hacker to silently mine multiple blocks (or only up to the most recent notarization)


[04-Jul-18 07:07 PM] Regnar#6164
Is there a good way to quantify this with this data from the site?


[04-Jul-18 07:19 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm not sure there's really a good way to quantify it. I feel like the best strategy for an exchange to not get ripped off is wait for a notarization or two. so if there are silent chains they would have to be between notarizations, and as soon as a new notarization is added all their silently mined blocks aren't good anymore. Just trying to figure out how to quantify it in dollars.


[04-Jul-18 07:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hard to do, but yes, exchanges just have to wait for a notarization, then any chain mined back past that notarization will not be valid and the deposit to the exchange would be valid.


[04-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Regnar#6164
^that's what I figured, it'd be tough to quantify that. Though I assume a coin could notarize more frequently on the Komodo blockchain if they wanted an even shorter time frame (<10 minutes) to be vulnerable for attacks (hackers would have to beat Komodo and the notary nodes too) and then notarized to BTC after.


[04-Jul-18 09:06 PM] Regnar#6164
I can't even take previous attacks and reduce the amount by what could have been done in 10 minutes, because the whole attack was likely done at once. so it either happens, or it doesn't.

What's the strategy to sustain and increase our discord, telegram and Twitter followers?


[05-Jul-18 07:48 PM] smkhound#7640
I think the micro bounties will help. Little competitions for a few free coins motivate people to keep eyes on, but need some stuff which luddites can be in the running for too. Someone mentioned a "pick the peak" comp for the scaling test for example.

[05-Jul-18 08:38 PM] Regnar#6164
Anyone else think that the dPoW explanation hasn't quite hit the mark in how it is effective against 51% attacks?


[05-Jul-18 08:40 PM] Regnar#6164
I feel we jump to saying, notarized on the BTC blockchain, but don't really ever get into detail with how exactly that works in defense of 51% attacks. sure we say if you want to make a change to the notarized blocks, you have to change btc too. but I was thinking it would be effective to show how an attack works in process, and how the notarization essentially cuts off all the past blocks that were silently mined with double spends ready to be broadcasted.


[05-Jul-18 08:49 PM] Regnar#6164
for instance when a hacker is mining a silent chain and hasn't broadcast it yet, they are say, one block longer than the main chain. So say they have 11 blocks mined and the main chain has 10, and have their double spend transactions already in place throughout the 11 blocks. but when the main chain notarizes the past 10 blocks to BTC. the hacker is no longer able to use the first 10 blocks they mined, and none of the double spends that were mined in there will work because when they broadcast the 11 blocks as the longest chain, the notarization will not match the one on BTC. so the hacker is stuck working on the 11th and on block and must perform their attack in the time period between the last notarization and the next notarization, which depending on how quickly the notary from an asset chain gets on KMD (and then later to BTC) could make it very difficult, and expensive as they would lose money renting mining power for all the no longer effective 10 blocks.

unless I'm wrong in this?

From what Ive seen most people dont even understand the basics 😂 I think what most people are worried about is how "new" or "unproven" this is, though they don't understand or neccessarily want to understand.
I think the best way for mass marketing would be to find a few more other chains, preferably a top 50 coin or one that people have heard of, though I'm sure that will eventually happen in time once the team has solved all the small kinks and made the procedure a lot easier.

Another main thing to focus on would be to emphasize how it is not centralized, and how notaries cannot collude to launch their own attack. From my postings, most people seem to think that notaries are centralized and that coins hand over control to kmd/notaries if they wish to use dPoW which is far from the truth


[05-Jul-18 11:56 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@Regnar yes, that's a great idea! Ben and I were actually talking about that just yesterday. We're planning on writing a separate post about 51% attacks, how they work, and how dPoW prevents them

however, that's just overkill. I think 2FA gets the point across and it resonates with most people

We'll be pushing out more stuff like this in the coming months. THere are a few ideas why. First, some of this knowledge is necessary to understand Komodo's tech so we want to give ppl the chance to learn about it but we don't want to constantly have to explain it. So we can just link back to posts like these again and again. Second, it will serve some SEO purposes and draw in some organic traffic from Google. Third, we hope to build a large body of educational content about blockchain-related topics so that we can establish Komodo as an authority in the space (we are but ppl may not know that). Maybe in the future we'll be able to pull it altogether for an e-book or something along those lines

[08-Jul-18 11:23 AM] Regnar#6164
Anyway, this was just my take on trying to figure out how we can approach a liquidity problem for our DEXs. it seems enough of the coins are off exchanges for there to NOT be a liquidity problem (assuming everyone wanted to trade and not just Hodl) but I think it would also be important to create a rich list to figure out how much of KMD is being held by a few hodlers.

[08-Jul-18 11:32 AM] Regnar#6164
But anyway, it would be helpful to get balances of whales and core dev who have been around a long time and likely accumulated a lot, we don't need to announce balances etc as that is private stuff but I'm predicting that low single digit percentages of coin supply could be held by certain members. Not saying this is bad, but maybe they would be interested in being liquidity providers, we just need a better way to find them without outing anyone's ID or tying them to wallet addresses

To be very general, he's trying to get Komodo registered as a legal entity, develop revenue streams, and attract investment


[09-Jul-18 05:17 AM] PTYX#6840
You mean redfox?


[09-Jul-18 05:19 AM] PTYX#6840
I don't see how the redfox thing I got wind about is any benefit for Komodo. Given that other duties are being ignored to get it done and it's being done in back channels. However, I guess the community will have their take on it.


[09-Jul-18 05:25 AM] PTYX#6840
Why does Komodo need to be a legal entity? It's an open source project and not having an entity to go after is one of its strengths

{Reactions}
🤔 

[09-Jul-18 05:53 AM] Audo#5667
Here's my take

- Open source development should be kept separate from the 'for profit' side or 'legal side'
 - Some legal entities are necessary to make business deals and partnerships, and to generate a revenue model for the long term foture.

What is the best approach to do this is a huge question that our team is researching. Not much more can be said at this point.


[09-Jul-18 06:16 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I agree with Audo. Just because some form of a legal entity exists doesn't mean that it has to be directly associated with or even called "komodo", but having a legal entity is gonna be essential whether we like it or not


[09-Jul-18 06:17 AM] Daniel CP#2020
VC funds and other large investors won't do touch a decentralized, open-source platform


[09-Jul-18 06:19 AM] Daniel CP#2020
And we don't necessarily need funds right this second-- things are humming along just fine -- but there are many competitors out there flush with cash who will catch up with our tech if we aren't careful


[09-Jul-18 06:20 AM] Daniel CP#2020
So raising funds will prob become very important at some point in the future


[09-Jul-18 06:22 AM] PTYX#6840
So a foundation structure is needed first which doesn't engage in business directly and a llc to engage in business.


[09-Jul-18 06:23 AM] PTYX#6840
That's the proper way of doing it. However, how are you going to create a foundation for an already established project that didn't run KYC during the ICO?


[09-Jul-18 06:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020
To be honest man, I don


[09-Jul-18 06:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020
don't know


[09-Jul-18 06:23 AM] PTYX#6840
The only way, is a Tezos style buy-out


[09-Jul-18 06:24 AM] PTYX#6840
Where the project is bought out by the foundation


[09-Jul-18 06:24 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I'll plead ignorance here. I was just answering your quesiton why a legal entity was needed


[09-Jul-18 06:25 AM] PTYX#6840
My point is, I don't see the above solutionsin the Redfox whitepaper which is supposedly what I hear business development is working on.


[09-Jul-18 06:27 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I see. I don't really have any answers

{Reactions}

[09-Jul-18 06:36 AM] Audo#5667
Indeed, in my humble opinion we need at least three things which should be kept separate

 1) the open source project (as it is)
 2) an entity or entities driving business adoption (blockchain as a service)
 3) startup incubator / accelelator


[09-Jul-18 06:46 AM] PTYX#6840
The startup incubator can be a branch of the business entity. I don't think a third entity for the incubator is necessary unless it gets huge.


[09-Jul-18 06:47 AM] PTYX#6840
But definitely, I agree with that.


[09-Jul-18 06:47 AM] PTYX#6840
It needs to be separate


[09-Jul-18 06:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
You have stuff like Odoo/OpenERP which is SaaS and opensource, yet there is also a licensing model for the 'for profit' side of things.


[09-Jul-18 08:19 AM] Regnar#6164
The development of Komodo is already decentralized and open source, should remain as such, a business entity would simply be the experts that know how to leverage the Komodo open source platform for business purposes and have a close relationship with the developing team. They use that knowledge and development relationship to create products, services, for businesses that drive revenue using the Komodo platform, which is shared in the form of R&D (paying Komodo developers for continued work as "contractors" or outside sources, paying for other types of additional costs, salaries, expansions, marketing, client acquisition etc).


[09-Jul-18 08:19 AM] Regnar#6164
That's my belief on this.


[09-Jul-18 08:20 AM] Regnar#6164
That way we have a business entity that is working to leverage the Komodo team/platform by offering its products and services to other business entities (on behalf of Komodo)


[09-Jul-18 09:45 AM] Regnar#6164
@Audo any chance we can get a business development channel or something that Benny can own? There's a lot of thoughts here that aren't marketing related

[09-Jul-18 02:53 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
my understanding is KMD provides platform for other entities like Chainzilla to make business on it, right? So there can be many legal entities helping some business to utilize KMD, and KMD by itself no need to care about that legal stuff? What KMD needs to care is maybe some infrastracture and revenue stream for network supporters like notary nodes and so... just to support internal KMD existance ?


[09-Jul-18 02:55 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Ok maybe long terms it's good to have some kind of KMD board, where by voting most interested parties/entities could point out some future development ideas, but it can be little chaotic as this board or even more simply forum would allow open discussion between people enganged on different levels and with different, sometimes oposite, interests


[09-Jul-18 02:56 PM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
However forums/boards we have now already here, so maybe good enough 😃


[09-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Regnar#6164
The difference is many of these entities that will be providing BaaS to businesses can use any platform including Komodo. There are businesses out there that want to use Komodo but are hesitant to work with a decentralized group of anonymous developers. They could use a 3rd party but we would be leaving a huge hole in the market of established businesses looking to partner with a coin team. A separate but official entity provides us some means of outreach to businesses that shows we are a legitimate project and with close ties with the developing team. 

This isn't saying all businesses are going to go through this official team and not a 3rd party, but right now Komodo is in a spot where they have no way of reaching out in any official capacity. I think having an official entity will help us bridge that gap.


[09-Jul-18 05:01 PM] Regnar#6164
having the entity technically separate prevents any legal recourse from happening to the entity from Komodo actions or refusal of KYC, and any recourse happening to the business from shutting down the Komodo project. The "official" capacity should be in the closeness of the relationship, and the use of the entities revenues to hire/pay Komodo devs for their work and redistribute the remaining in a way that helps grow the ecosystem.

getting some of that "bitcoin is useless" feedback from comments i left in slashdot.

tech people - with what i presume to be techy jobs (or students) with nice cushioned centralised pay checks that hold a lot of "power" being system administrators, domain administrators etc. in the safety of hierarchical gatekeepers.

They are loud and know-it-all types of techs.
I would say the software dev is more the open minded type of tech.
A network administrator, just interested in connecting things - and blockchain is "interesting" to them after they learn past the scammy parts.

@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 yes.  KMD offers an DIY-blockchain-ecosystem a la chain(zilla,makers) - where every blockchain is a fork of komodo (same tech)  and inherits all of it.  in the past, komodo has blazed a trail / pioneered the tech (atomic swap DEX, dICO crowdfunding, and now crypto-conditions implementation) and made it work.  all of these tools are available to anyone to build on and create value, to themselves and to the komodo ecosystem.
stuff like notarizations to btc for security, zero-confirmation atomic swaps, jumblr for privacy, scalability - all require KMD to "make faster or make better or make more secure".  KMD enhances the tech because it's been engineered for usage - that's how i read it.

It gets really interesting when dApps are built on KMD with these strengths, and the dApps offer interoperability with other ecosystems via crypto-conditions and atomic swaps.  So hopefully that stuff can be prototyped soon.

@Mylo I think the big tech firms missed the crypto boat because they want to drive the boat and not let the boat drive itself because thats not good for profit as any Ferengi would say. I am happy to be on the KMD boat just hope that there is a lifeboat that can make it continue to drive itself no matter who trys to sink/control the ship.

```yea i think biggest hurdle is making it simple enuf. All the jargon has to be stripped down. Average joes need easy to understand and use tools to securely story their own private keys.

at the moment its just the uber techs getting their jollies and noobs getting fleeced
i wld be a lazy tech getting fleeced```

smart mate of mine who i debate with about crypto whilst playing playstation/beers

If you strip down *all* of the jargon, can Joe Average really know the difference between good, safe tech and a complete scam?

Average Joe fails to understand usuary and inflation, gets scammed constantly by banks, yet fails to recognize the irony of perceiving crypto as more of a scam.

We can make post several times in Telegram the Discordlink from our Komodochannel , also the link in the Newsletters - and in the description from the YoutubeChannels & Twitteraccount - this will increase the members from time to time .
But closing Telegramchann with over 8500 Members in my view not a good idea.
Many Members will join in Telegram & Discord  if the Bullmarket starts


[10-Jul-18 10:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Just because you have "members" due to signups doesn't mean that a large portion of them didn't just come, look once, turn off notifications, and go away @Acura 
It's a misleading statistic if you use "members"


[10-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Acura#2748
Correct - but if Komodo Marketing works well and the price goes up , many old members will look into the channel

@Acura the idea isn't to close telegram, but to instead funnel that community into one primary location.


[10-Jul-18 01:40 PM] n2okpride#1967
Previously it made sense to have both telegram and slack as they served different audiences and purposes.


[10-Jul-18 01:41 PM] n2okpride#1967
The issue with our slack was the barrier to access. You had to join a wait list, wait until you get on. Then there were tons of channels and it was intimidating for a new user.


[10-Jul-18 01:42 PM] n2okpride#1967
Telegram was easy to join, and had just one room to worry about. Considering Discord is also easy to join, and is being more widely adopted in this industry, we thought it made sense to consolidate.


[10-Jul-18 01:43 PM] n2okpride#1967
we definitely wanted to first consult both yourself and @yorklab  as you guys are active in that community.


[10-Jul-18 01:53 PM] yorklab#7270
I understand Acura's concerns, there are certain aspects of Telegram that work well and it is much easier to monitor just one single Channel. But I do think it's a good idea to start funneling the crowd over to Discord. If eventually nobody posts on telegram you can always shut it down at that point.


[10-Jul-18 01:55 PM] n2okpride#1967
ok good to know.

Been thinking of an addition to HyperDEX. I posted it in their channel to see if it would be a good fit. I'll post it here too.


[10-Jul-18 08:51 PM] Regnar#6164
It's a way I've been thinking about how to resolve some liquidity problems we have with our DEX


[10-Jul-18 08:52 PM] Regnar#6164
I can't post pictures in here though


[10-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Regnar#6164
I was thinking a chat could provide some type of positive benefit especially for atomic swap powered exchanges. I'm thinking that if you were to open HyperDEX to make a trade and see little volume you might just leave. Trades can happen any time but only when someone is on and leaves the DEX is open. So a chat box might give people a reason to stay on and chat, find traders, or do something while they wait for confirmations. 

Obviously this could be done in here or telegram or something (BlackJoker mentioned Matrix servers for chat which would be really cool, I'm still reading up on how they work exactly) but to be able to access it from the DEX would be cool. A chat might be a way for people to set up direct trades also, just come for "the hanging out" and end up finding someone wanting to trade or someone telling you about a coin you didn't know of.

I think for true DEXs, liquidity will always be a problem. CEX can only have a small sample size of the population worth in volume, amounting to no more than the total people on their exchange and coins in their wallets, but CEX are very active because the people there, are there to trade. 

Because a DEX can trade from the same wallets we safely store coins in, we can have true population sized volume (every coin in every wallet), but only if people are on at the right times to find each other (makes it tougher on other sides of the globe) and actively trading. so it would only make sense to give them more reason to be active on the DEX than simply to trade and close the DEX (takes their potential volume with them)


[10-Jul-18 09:02 PM] Regnar#6164
So this might build a lot more users who are on it for trading and chat (about trading or w.e.) which can add more liquidity. Just thinking about the times a few years ago sitting in Poloniex Trollbox talking with people and then buying some pump, or learning about different projects (actually its how I learned about Komodo, someone mentioned that we should be pushing polo to add KMD) 

we'll see if it's something HyperDEX or BarterDEX likes? But seeing as this is the marketing channel, what are our thoughts on this as a marketing opportunity or way to increase liquidity??

[11-Jul-18 09:47 AM] Regnar#6164
@jl777c I'm thinking of adding a couple of steps to this process (for marketing reasons), not to affect the ease of requests or anything.


[11-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Regnar#6164
Basically they already provide their logo (to be used on barterDEX) so we use that for the poster, and they should provide the email of their social media contact. Someone on our team, or me or whatever, would basically add their logo to a template that shows they are now supported on BarterDEX, with Komodo logos, social media handle, etc and theirs. and we provide it to their social media account holder so they can post the promotional material on their twitter, reddit, etc


[11-Jul-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
ok by me, just tell me when I can approve a pull request


[11-Jul-18 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
someone that is part of the process needs to give a "ready to merge" comment on each pull request, I can go with that


[11-Jul-18 09:57 AM] Regnar#6164
okay @benohanlon  @n2okpride I'm not sure who we want to put on this part? I think we could just add an optional step in the readme that says have their social media contact email  X address. or something. in the nature of Komodo, it shouldn't be mandatory to be listed, but should be a way for mutual marketing benefits


[11-Jul-18 10:09 AM] Regnar#6164
2. Icon file (Required)
•    The icon file is required.
•    Icon must be a .png format file.
•    Dimensions of icon file is 82x82 pixels.
•    Icon file name MUST be in small letters.
•    Icon file location is icons directory.
•    Send a (XX) sized PNG file of your logo in an email to (XXX) from your social media/marketing lead’s email to receive joint marketing material upon integration (Optional)
 

I'm thinking something like this, just put in whoever is going to handle the template, adding their logos and emailing it back. This way they can still add to barterDEX (jl777 doesn't have to wait for merge approvals) and we can still get some joint marketing


[11-Jul-18 10:11 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
imo, if the repo gets used in any marketing way then "It must be tested and working before it will be added" needs to be in as large and bold lettering as possible


[11-Jul-18 10:13 AM] Regnar#6164
step 0 is The coin must be tested with BarterDEX atomic swaps. So by the time they are applying for it to be listed, including the marketing part in step 2, we assume they are already working right?


[11-Jul-18 10:14 AM] Regnar#6164
but yea, the receiver of the email might have to make sure they have posted the request to github, and if jl approved the merge, we can send out the email? or do we send out the email just before the approval? I don't think there is too big a difference in the order of this aspect. just as long as we don't send the email when it's not going to be listed


[11-Jul-18 10:51 AM] Regnar#6164
any of the marketing guys I tagged have thoughts on this idea?


[11-Jul-18 10:52 AM] Regnar#6164

Yea I posted this back on Slack but we were updating barterDEX so frequently that it was impractical tbh. but now that we are pushing out scheduled updates with batches of coins, it seems this would be much more effective, and now that it's done through github I figured I'd just modify this plan to fit this route

let's take 0.00001124 BTC in fees:
2016: $0.0051704 - BTC was $460
2017: $0.1850104 - BTC was $16,460
2018: $0.0692384 - BTC is $6,160
for the **same** tx fee
fee/USD **isn't** important

Yes @Daniel CP @Regnar I've submitted an idea to @n2okpride where we would create a series of evergreen posts... each post focuses on one coin that BarterDEX supports with a one line description of what that coin is about + tags their community into it and uses their currency ticker.

These kind of posts can be created once and sent out once or twice a day randomly using a tool like meetedgar to help bring other communities to us and showcase how many coins are supported and educated people.

This is on hold until we have liquidity - I believe @n2okpride concern is that we'll be pushing people onto barterdex / hyperdex and there won't be enough liquidity to allow them to buy / sell anything.

@ComputerGenie @grewalsatinder yeah but most people dont think in satoshis but in fiat


[12-Jul-18 03:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Do those same people look at their grocery receipt and determine how much the tax cost them when converted into South African Rand? No. Just because some choose to have an incorrect view of the space doesn't mean the space (and especially marketing) should change to their wrong view.


[12-Jul-18 04:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
No but for example over here, sometimes you have to pay extra when you want to pay with card

@Cryptoon If people start calling a rabbit a lion, should marketing also call a rabbit a lion or tell people that a rabbit isn't a lion?


[12-Jul-18 04:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@ComputerGenie you know what I mean


[12-Jul-18 04:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Sometimes it's better to explain things in a way normies understand

[12-Jul-18 04:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I can explain crypto to my mother in a way that makes me sound like an asshole and she still wont understand a thing


[12-Jul-18 04:25 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
`you know what I mean`
yes, and I also know it's dumb to let wrong people change the meaning of the space


[12-Jul-18 04:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But it's better off to explain in laymens terms and compare it to stuff they understand


[12-Jul-18 04:26 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
in this instance, it's really not; words matter


[12-Jul-18 04:28 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
on this topic, it's not just a matter of semantics, it's an entire conceptual shift


[12-Jul-18 04:31 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
for crypto to succeed, the `currency` part of `cryptocurrency` must be in the forefront; otherwise, were all just messing about with commodities and no real adoption will ever take hold


[12-Jul-18 04:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yes for sure, but for example when we switched to the euro in 2000 over here, a lot of people were (and still are) calculating how much is was in the previous currency. So expect the same thing to happen even when the big shift to crypto happens. It's in the nature of people that change is hard for them and don't think you can change that.


[12-Jul-18 04:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Basically, it's hard to change that it's hard for people to change. (lol)


[12-Jul-18 04:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
And even harder when no one corrects their wrongness, and even harder still when their wrongness is catered to 😉

[12-Jul-18 06:38 AM] Regnar#6164
I was thinking we could probably make a marketing plan and material to specifically target CEXs


[12-Jul-18 06:39 AM] Regnar#6164
something that we could reach out to different exchanges that don't have KMD and show them why dPoW will actually protect them from double spends (they just need to have easy access to verify notarizations, I'm not sure if there is a simple location to find notarizations?)


[12-Jul-18 06:40 AM] Regnar#6164
which could help them decide to list KMD, and also to list coins built on Komodo that use dPoW


[12-Jul-18 06:40 AM] Regnar#6164
thoughts from the marketing channel?


[12-Jul-18 06:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
KuCoin has their own ERC20 coin as well


[12-Jul-18 06:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Tell them if they list kmd and do some promo we will migrate their coin to an assetchain for free


[12-Jul-18 06:41 AM] Regnar#6164
yea we could secure it hahaha


[12-Jul-18 06:41 AM] Regnar#6164
thats good!


[12-Jul-18 06:41 AM] Regnar#6164
I like that idea. okay so what is the incentive for an exchange to maintain an erc20 token?


[12-Jul-18 06:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And then the road to BNB is right open ;p


[12-Jul-18 06:42 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We're not quite ready to start integrating ERC-20 tokens yet


[12-Jul-18 06:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[12-Jul-18 06:43 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Yeh the plan is to find a small project that wants to migrate and them do it very quietly as a test run


[12-Jul-18 06:43 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Then once the process is smoothed we could open things up a bit more


[12-Jul-18 06:44 AM] Regnar#6164
okay then, back to the other plan, marketing to CEXs by showing how dPoW can protect them from 51% attacks

{Reactions}
Komodo 

[12-Jul-18 06:44 AM] Regnar#6164
do we like this idea?


[12-Jul-18 06:45 AM] Regnar#6164
especially for targeting the small exchanges that a single attack would likely wipe out


[12-Jul-18 06:45 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Hmm not sure. Might have to huddle with the rest of the team on that one


[12-Jul-18 06:45 AM] Daniel CP#2020
In some ways, I see the benefits


[12-Jul-18 06:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
it can protect them from double spends


[12-Jul-18 06:45 AM] Daniel CP#2020
But in other ways, we would be giving them ground


[12-Jul-18 06:45 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Like why help the CEX when we want to push a DEX


[12-Jul-18 06:45 AM] Regnar#6164
I don't see crypto as a fight here


[12-Jul-18 06:46 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Yeah I feel that way too


[12-Jul-18 06:46 AM] Daniel CP#2020
It might be worth exploring


[12-Jul-18 06:46 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I guess I'm just thinking, we're super limited on time and resources so might be better to focus on marketing BarterDEX as opposed to helping secure CEX


[12-Jul-18 06:47 AM] Regnar#6164
CEX hacks are good for DEX adoption, but any hack is bad for crypto. and pushing dPoW as a protection for exchanges can actually help adoption of dPoW and Komodo chains


[12-Jul-18 06:47 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Even though theyd be using Komodo security services


[12-Jul-18 06:47 AM] Regnar#6164
are we even marketing BarterDEX right now?


[12-Jul-18 06:48 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Honestly not really haha. But HyperDEX official release is coming soon and we'll def help them with marketing


[12-Jul-18 06:48 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Plus we might be getting a new GUI for both Agama and BarterDEX. Although we're not 100% on that yet


[12-Jul-18 06:49 AM] Regnar#6164
okay, so no marketing dPoW to exchanges as a way of demand driven adoption


[12-Jul-18 06:49 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I'm not saying no, i think it's worth looking into


[12-Jul-18 06:49 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Something we can def talk about


[12-Jul-18 06:50 AM] Regnar#6164
okay, Komodo just retweeted my tweet lol


[12-Jul-18 06:50 AM] Daniel CP#2020
oh nice!


[12-Jul-18 06:51 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Sort of where the marketing team is at now: we're re-grouping a bit, figuring out a strategy, and deciding what products/services we really want to push


[12-Jul-18 06:51 AM] Daniel CP#2020
So offering dPoW is def on the table, whether it be to a CEX or a small PoW project

@Regnar  the idea I had discussed before was positioning dpow as something a CEX can utilize (or potentially even enforce) as an added layer of security for coins they list. The idea was to build a business case where we illustrate general benefits, along with the added savings in downtime and support mitigation if they do so. We will however have to wait until dpow for external chains becomes something we GA to the public which won't be until the aug/sep timeframe

I got a question about Atomic/etomic marketing and thought I should paste my answer here too.

> The problem with heavily marketing the swaps is that the pairs have no liquidity. We are going to need few fundamental things in place first.

> 1. Rewamp the UX/UI, which is basically being done now by the HyperDEX team. We will be doing co-marketing with the HyperDEX team once they officially launch. BarterDEX GUI is lacking a clear product brand to attract and maintain a userbase, and the UX/UI is not on the level it should be. As a result many people just try it our out of curiosity and never return.
> 2. We need to formulate a strategy on how we attract liquidity. My thinking is to focus on few pairs and guarantee their liquidity, and the not so liquid pairs are not listed on the dApp itself. Perhaps there should be a requirement to get listed on HyperDEX, e.g. "if you want your coin on HyperDEX you must commit on running a marketmaker for your coin and to provide sufficient liquidity".
> 3. We should also look for ways for a normal users to become a liquidity provider very easily. 
> 4. Some of the DEX branding and positioning is still on the drawing table as our marketing team is preparing for the Komodo rebrand together with 'Ideas By Nature'. Once that is clear we can do better marketing. For example, one thing we have been thinking is building a separate website for the DEX (backend) and highlighting the benefits, expalining that anyone can build a GUI, advertising how you can become liquidity provider, and then listing the existing GUI's like HyperDEX.

If there is an easy way for people with big bags to set up a MM that would definitely attract liquidity


[13-Jul-18 01:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If you design a MM gui, where you just deposit x funds onto the MM wallet and choose the pairs you want to trade against and for which % of the coinmarketcap prices


[13-Jul-18 01:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And just leave the thing running


[13-Jul-18 01:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Because you should make some money when being a marketmaker in most of the cases


[13-Jul-18 01:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And you could market it as a way for big holders to have some extra returns on their bags


[13-Jul-18 02:11 AM] jorian#4555
i think a marketmaker needs VPS'es and therefore a strong command line tool


[13-Jul-18 02:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Its easy enough to make a GUI to manage a remote bob. I already have a command line tool for this, its just simple API calls over an ssh tunnel.


[13-Jul-18 02:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> You can spin up the marketmakers in the cloud... the issue only comes because electrum in bob isn't reliable... There must be a way to make that work. Maybe its a request for MM2.0

@Jazzy brigading is an online harassment tactic where a group of people rally against an individual (or occasionally against a small group of people).

What constitutes vote cheating or vote manipulation?

@Jazzy harassment vs 'ask me questions' is not semantics. It's a fundamental difference in meaning.

Not a fan of Reddit of their censorship, but for the sake of being forthright d:

Thank you @Patziggy

I'll take your advice under consideration for future AMAs. Thank you.


[13-Jul-18 04:17 AM] Patziggy#9371
Certainly. With the strength and development behind Komodo something simple like "vote manipulation" on an already censorship-happy platform may give the nay-sayers some unwarranted yet psychologically effective ammo


[13-Jul-18 04:18 AM] benohanlon#7045
Next time I'll do it without the search URL @Patziggy . We can agree on that.


[13-Jul-18 04:20 AM] smkhound#7640
is this any different to posting a link to a tweet which has a link to the ama?


[13-Jul-18 04:21 AM] Patziggy#9371
Given that was that was the express purpose for the link format that may bode most favorable. Less about my agreement and more about the stated rules and public optics, yeah?

Ultimately the format and @ everyone is what makes it a toss up IMO. Just my 2 cents and community management experience 🤷


[13-Jul-18 04:21 AM] benohanlon#7045
@smkhound prob not - my mistake was to articulate that an upvote would be appreciated. In future I'll give links but not explicitly say that - only factually state the AMA is going on.


[13-Jul-18 04:22 AM] benohanlon#7045
At the end of the day I am answerable to the community so even if I personally disagree with @Patziggy and @Jazzy I think there is more value in listening than arguing. I want us to work together.


[13-Jul-18 04:22 AM] benohanlon#7045
Also - I am wrong sometimes. I can admit that 😃


[13-Jul-18 04:22 AM] benohanlon#7045
So maybe this is one of those times.


[13-Jul-18 04:25 AM] Patziggy#9371

I'm wrong more often than I'm right, so many good heads with good intentions helps us all go further. Thanks for your hard work @benohanlon!

[13-Jul-18 04:28 AM] Jazzy#0001
I think the place to toe the line is generally around asking for upvotes


[13-Jul-18 04:28 AM] Jazzy#0001
Linking and notifying people is fine, but the arbitrary line is suddenly crossed when you ask for support


[13-Jul-18 04:29 AM] Jazzy#0001
The search URL is actually a good way to mitigating risk around being flagged for this kind of activity and is probably good to maintain

if up voting gets Komodo more visibility, I dont c the problem. Komodo is already being ignored by almost everyone, so I dont see the harm in the above tactics to it very easily foster some needed discussion about how KMD compares to others that have just an "idea" and got tons of money during their ICO. I have tons of CREDITS AND REN PROTOCOL, all great ideas but nothing tangible and the same goes for Vertcoin, ARK, EOS  and the like. I promote KMD whenever possible in response to articles about crypto.

Someone was talking about improving liquidity on the DEX. As I understand it, liquidity comes and goes  with the user's online status.  Is there a Liquidity/trade Oracle?  Ie: a website or app that tracks and notifies users of liquidity(buy/sell offers) so as a user can interact  with DEX at the right time. Maybe even post requests for liquidity to be added to a pair so as someone knows there is interest in a trade. Thanks

On the graphics for the email, the reddit Snoo looks like he's smoking komodo 😛 which may or may not be intended.   The credit card says CrytoCard.  Did they name it that or did we drop the p? 😃   Sorry i've been so absent lately.

@benohanlon  mentioned a debit card,  https://peer2.krd/ , in his Friday Five this morning.  In their FAQ, it says  the minimum deposit is  500 Euro, but the maximum deposit is 250 Euro.    

What is the minimum amount of load in cryptocurrency?
The minimum amount of load in Komodo or Bitcoin is € 500.
  
What are the conditions of my Prepaid Debit Card?
As of the date of publication of this FAQ, the limits of the cards are:

– Neither registration nor verification: just one load of up to 250€.

@༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻ great ideas. Something like this could be helpful for more obscure coins. For common pairs, major coins, liquidity will come as BarterDex software matures and simplifies the setup process. It doesn’t take many BarterDex marketmakers to provide adequate liquidity. “Someone was talking about improving liquidity on the DEX. As I understand it, liquidity comes and goes  with the user's online status.  Is there a Liquidity/trade Oracle?  Ie: a website or app that tracks and notifies users of liquidity(buy/sell offers) so as a user can interact  with DEX at the right time. Maybe even post requests for liquidity to be added to a pair so as someone knows there is interest in a trade. Thanks”

The key thing here is not the hack itself - it's the fact the Bancor team had the ability to freeze funds. How many other "decentralized" DApps have a built-in kill switch that's centrally controlled? https://t.co/3XtULafGRD

^ maybe we should get Jackson to check out Komodo decentralization and DEX.


[14-Jul-18 07:00 AM] Regnar#6164
He's been on a tear running through "DEXs" and smart contracts finding back doors, kill switches, and pause buttons controlled by a central authority, and posting them in that thread for different projects.


[14-Jul-18 07:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
then ask him this question on his weekly crypto show and let KMD fans ask and vote on those questions.


[14-Jul-18 07:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I mostly find him favouring BTC and ETH. Feels like everything else is just NOT BTC and NOT ETH for him. 😄


[14-Jul-18 07:04 AM] Regnar#6164
haha yea that's fine though, but he's bringing publicity to the false sense of decentralization


[14-Jul-18 07:04 AM] Regnar#6164
which is why I was thinking we could ask him if Komodo DEX is decentralized


[14-Jul-18 07:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
sure give it a try


[14-Jul-18 07:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
For business someone's opinion might be less than their own needs and assurance of what one tech solution gives them. Both in short term and long term.
Any major influencers like andreas, vitalik or charlie etc are looked at by those who mostly seek for expert's opinion on subject matters.
I looked at those too at some point. By time I understood the tech and could evaluate myself that their expert view points are not always reliable.


[14-Jul-18 07:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess the same case applies to businesses too.


[14-Jul-18 07:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
If they see the Komodo tech useful both in short term and long term for their business, they'll adopt it.


[14-Jul-18 07:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like Linux.


[14-Jul-18 07:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Just takes some time.


[14-Jul-18 07:12 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm not sure I understand what you're saying here. I understand that the big names are not always reliable experts.


[14-Jul-18 07:13 AM] Regnar#6164
and businesses know this too, which is why firms hire consultants, "expert brain power" for hundreds of thousands of dollars and then sometimes don't take their advice. "experts" aren't always right, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't look to them, even in crypto.


[14-Jul-18 07:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree


[14-Jul-18 07:14 AM] Regnar#6164
So are you saying getting Jackson to look at Komodo isn't a worthwhile idea?


[14-Jul-18 07:15 AM] Regnar#6164
I guess I'm just trying to understand the flow from Jackson to "their expert view points are not always reliable" haha I'm not trying to argue


[14-Jul-18 07:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm saying I don't keep my hopes high with such influencers. 🙂


[14-Jul-18 07:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's all


[14-Jul-18 07:16 AM] Regnar#6164
high hopes of their accuracy in expert review/opinion


[14-Jul-18 07:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
they can still discard that Komodo tech isn't worthwhile while it is. But to them it might not be from their point of view. I keep my bets on my own evaluation.


[14-Jul-18 07:18 AM] Regnar#6164
right, there is a risk "experts" don't like the tech, but that's the whole point of trying to get objective views, the risk being the objective view isn't favorable, or that it is biased, but that's the risk


[14-Jul-18 07:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think it would be good free publicity 😛


[14-Jul-18 07:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
Any publicity is good publicity, even better if he doesnt shut down our tech


[14-Jul-18 07:19 AM] Regnar#6164
I don't think we can change that. So I think this comes down to do we open ourselves up to that risk of an objective review being biased or unfavorable, and the deciding factor is the upside returns we can expect to gain from the positive review, and the downside we expose ourselves to the downside


[14-Jul-18 07:20 AM] Regnar#6164
and regardless of our involvement there is the chance he comes across our DEX on his own anyway


[14-Jul-18 07:27 AM] yorklab#7270
As a non-Dev, Jackson Palmer has always appeared to be objective in his talks. It would take a Dev to see through the bias. I suspect that 99% of the people that listen to him are like me, so he carries a lot of influence to his followers. I do like that he doesn't appear to shill coins, but he is still trying to make money like every one else.


[14-Jul-18 07:30 AM] Regnar#6164
I think some good points have been made on the pros and cons of this, what's the consensus on seeing if we can get him to look at Komodo for either a DEX tweet, or his weekly show?


[14-Jul-18 07:30 AM] Regnar#6164
I say yea


[14-Jul-18 07:33 AM] Regnar#6164
He does a lot of "what is" videos on youtube. but hasn't done a "what is an Atomic Swap" video. Maybe that's where we could reach out. What is atomic swap video, we send him the github links, KMD atomic swap explanation video, and any other resources


[14-Jul-18 07:33 AM] Regnar#6164
that might be better than the tweet thing


[14-Jul-18 07:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@PTYX  retweets can be manipulated by bots -> if any better tip retweets with followers lower limit whatever is reasonable. Joining discord could also be manipulted this way, and adds no value. Tipping might be better to people having personal blogs and writing some decent articles. But make sense only if planned -> simultaneous articles similar time , like 100 a week in different blogs, media and so on. Must be coordinated. @Deleted User  the airdrop I would suggest to split by weight of followers, meaning calculate avg weight of retweet to measure share of this 10k USD. Will be more resonable to impact and more interesting for bigger players, for whom 10k $ is still nice money for a retweet 😃


[15-Jul-18 12:58 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
This way if 5000 people with 1 follower will do retweet and 1 person with 5000 followers, the 1 person will get 5k $  and the rest will get 1$ each, which is relevant for impact and less bot/spam-prone.

I see

Would it be possible to make some code example? This capability was brought to us from the cryptoconditions & interoperability tech? It would fit nicely to our Komodo 5 pillar campaign.

It would be nice to highlight this with something concrete, i.e. "how to develop X on KMD"


[16-Jul-18 03:02 AM] jl777c#5810

I have been thinking of ideas for simple games too, but they always end up becoming too complex 😄


[16-Jul-18 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be a simple 2 player card vs card game. At the start two players agree to the deck used, like N cards with total value of X. The the players bet a card against the other player. higher denomination wins. Owner of the card, owns the coin value


[16-Jul-18 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
so fund cards with 1, 2, 3, ... 13 CHIPS (to represent ace high) and then each round one card is dealt by each player. at the end of the round, the results update who has what cards


[16-Jul-18 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
likely not a very exciting game, but should demonstrate the important parts

So I was recently talking about KMD in a crypto trade group. I knew right off the bat these guys are anti KMD, but never got a clear answer out from them. I finally got it, and of course its around the history of JL777 and the moves from NXT to BTCD and then BTCD to KMD.

I was able to answer the move from NXT to BTCD (NXT devs changed their vision for the project and JL777 decided to move on since it was counter intuitive to what supernet was trying to do)

The move from BTCD was to incorporate ZK Snark technology from ZEC to provide real privacy for supernet and all the projects (from my understanding but not 100% sure about this)

However, I couldn't answer the question of why KMD needed an ICO and where the ICO funds came from. These guys are under the impression that all these moves were money grabs. New ICOs to get more BTC. I know BTCD to KMD was a swap, but there was also an ICO. Does anyone know where the ICO funds came from?

Of course these guys took it a step further to say not only did the project grab more BTC by having another ICO, but BTCD value was hurt when KMD was announced allowing for an easy pump and dump scheme to occur to get even more BTC. Double dipping on the BTCD to KMD swap so to speak

Think it would be nice to be able to answer these concerns of people. A lot of old school people have a negative view of the project and a lot of these old school people have money/influence. Think it would be good to address this stuff in some way


[17-Jul-18 04:10 PM] NewEra#5902
thats the question I couldn't answer. If KMD was just an upgrade to BTCD then why was there an ICO for KMD. Think of it like a project launching their own token and getting off of ETH. There is a swap for the ERC20 token for the real coin, but there isn't another ICO


[17-Jul-18 04:10 PM] NewEra#5902
this I couldn't answer so if anyone has an answer I would like to share it with this group and any other KMD haters I come across in the future


[17-Jul-18 04:12 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The ICO was to fund DPoW for a dozen or so years until Komodo became self sustaining


[17-Jul-18 04:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And development of course, but much more towards the former(90% )than the latter.


[17-Jul-18 04:15 PM] NewEra#5902
ok I know if I go back with just that answer people will scream cash grab and say "see they just wanted more BTC". If I can prove that BTC are being spent every notarization then I think that will help. Is there a way to check each notarization and how much BTC it cost, like on a blockexplorer maybe?

most people don't have time to look into every project @Deleted User there's so many projects out there and in the past marketing has fallen short for KMD. People write off scammy projects and unfortunately the complicated history of this project has turned people away.


[17-Jul-18 04:42 PM] NewEra#5902
hostility toward these people doesn't help the cause either. I'm taking the time out to get good answers to inform people and help promote KMD in a positive light. These guys aren't stupid, but have a huge demand on their time and can't dive into slack/discord to find these answers. A red flag appears from a high level view and thats all they need to move on

You can’t dPoW to BTC without paying BTC fees. And that adds up

Very necessary in my opinion. And differs from most projects that take the btc and spend it all. At least all Komodo and all of the assetchains are benefiting from dPoW.

Can see by amount received in the btc address above how much is used in notarization then add fees on top

My node had over $5000 AUD put in it after election from the ICO fund, and it already nearly gone. And I am one of the lower nodes in counts. Its a horribly expensive process at the current market price. Although it would still be cheaper at these prices than paying for BTC hash power, which is some astronomical amount money.


[17-Jul-18 05:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Without the ICO to fund the process back when BTC was cheap, it would likely be all but impossible to have this platform in its current state.

@NewEra I can point out few additional things:

 - I don' know how BTCD project got started initially, but when jl777 joined the project (later) there were no funding for it
 - BTCD was envisioned to be part of the NXT system (I call it SuperNET 1.0), so I would say there was just one change from NXT+BTCD -> KMD (but there indeed was a period when the plan was to move everything 100% under BTCD).
 - Komodo was created because of two things 1) privacy and 2) security. The dPoW implementation needed money, and a lot of the ICO budget was put aside for those Bitcoin notarizations that we have been doing everyday since day 1.
 - In general, the whole blockchaini industry keeps evolving very fast, and things must change and change and change. I don't know how anyone could not see that. Thus obviously under SuperNET things have been changing and changing too for our project to stay innovative. However, the vision has always stayed the same. The difference is, that jl777 respects the previous investors and doesn't abondon any project.

[18-Jul-18 02:42 AM] jl777c#5810
I did a total of 2 ICO, SuperNET and KMD. SuperNET funds have grown over the years more than 10x even after all the expenditures and KMD ICO did ok so far. The vast majority of the BTC from KMD ICO is to pay for notarization fees, we had to do an ICO otherwise dPoW would not exist and without dPoW none of the assetchains would be secure. I explained this many times, even during the ICO!

[18-Jul-18 09:22 AM] tolken#2655
I’m just guessing here as I haven’t dug deeply. But aside from people just not “getting” kmd at first glance, here are the common reactions I get:


[18-Jul-18 09:22 AM] tolken#2655
1. Who’s this jl777 guy.


[18-Jul-18 09:22 AM] tolken#2655
2. Kmd is too late to the game


[18-Jul-18 09:23 AM] tolken#2655
3. I looked at the website, what does it do?


[18-Jul-18 09:25 AM] tolken#2655
1. I agree with jl777’s point that having open source and a track record is far more important than a closed project with well know names attached. That said, I think it might serve KMD marketing well to refer to jl777 as James Lee exclusively.


[18-Jul-18 09:26 AM] tolken#2655
2. I disagree with their assessment here and think kmd is well positioned to provide game changing services to the masses with some of the smart contract/scaling jl777 has hinted at.


[18-Jul-18 09:27 AM] tolken#2655
3. Doesn’t seem like KMD has a clear audience yet, so message isn’t as laser focused as could be, but seems kmd 2.0 branding is making some good headway with this.


[18-Jul-18 09:28 AM] tolken#2655
KMD has an image issue. People look at Ethos wallet and drool. I tell them about Agama and they just shrug. It doesn’t feel safe to them for some reason. Not sure what the answer to that is ultimately.


[18-Jul-18 09:34 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think the rebranding will make the messages different for end users or for business/developers. For now the target has been more the latter and it seems to work fine IMO. For end users it's been somewhat harder so far

We do have a bit of an identity issue. As we're a growing and evolving project there are times that this identity will also change.


[18-Jul-18 09:41 AM] n2okpride#1967
We are however shifting to focus more on creating a better developer community program, along with renewed focus on how we educate, train, and attract more developers to Komodo.

As cool as “Jumblr” is, maybe it deserves to be put on the cutting room floor (marketing wise) like as a DVD  bonus feature. As legitimate of a tool as it is, I don’t think it clicks with mainstream users. There are so many features to promote, not every amazing one needs to be in the forefront.

That prism model is becoming quite popular it seems, I'm pretty sure that's how Abra works too, which is why many coins on abra you cannot withdraw from the wallet.


[19-Jul-18 04:41 AM] Regnar#6164
It's really a derivative I'd say, you're trading on the coin and portfolio valuation and not necessarily trading the coins themselves. so the volume there does nothing for the volume anywhere else, but it's good to get Komodo logo and idea in front of people.


[19-Jul-18 04:44 AM] Regnar#6164
I also don't think I'd want to be Prism in this case, this whole model exposes them to some insane potential losses. If they hold ETH in contract and allow you to trade against it, any of the gains must be made up from losses elsewhere (either individual portfolios) or their own. Think if you put in ETH, "buy" bitcoin and bitcoin goes back to 20k and you cash out, you have just about tripled your ETH holdings (assuming ETH didn't grow proportionally)...now imagine thousands of people did that. All that extra ETH has to come from somewhere

so Sandy is the main dev and CEO of the project. He seems to be opened to the idea. So what I see is that since his project is on Ethererum , Nxt and Ardor. And if he decides to build on KMD asset chain as well. This will be the best opportunity for a project to have a live comparison of the four platforms.

Cool article - great to see higher throughput from EOS.

TPS record was set by Komodo in May 2018 at 20k tps, data here https://komodostats.com/sca...

And description here: https://i.mylomylo.com/komo...

KMD news article about the method https://komodoplatform.com/...

And a more recent load test: https://en.insider.pro/info... with infographic https://insdrcdn.com/media/...

Komodo will post all details for download and verifiability throughout further testing.

Any details please ask Mylo in the KMD discord (#scaling-test) for further details. We will continue to optimise KMD scaling solutions to 1 million tps.

Cheers

@Mylo  good comment. I would call it more aggressive marketing (contacting 3rd parties co-working with competing solutions to check out KMD for comparison). Might be good if marketing team monitors competing solutions for their partners and emails them with comparison to KMD about the key part for selected 3rd party. Full time for 1 person should be enough to "steal" some partners from time to time 😃


[22-Jul-18 03:59 AM] Mylo#8306
i don't mind starting a website that rebutts all these things to highlight KMDs advantages - if the community finds sites claiming things that are not and i can republish things from komodo's perspective that are justified and true - then let's do it.

As part of the Komodo Pioneers notary election, we encourage ppl to start meetups.  Because I'm least likely to participate in meetup activities, I threw the idea of a komodo ecosystem website https://imgur.com/a/n7qG2 (this is the mockup).

If the community wants some way to republish information, i can work towards iKomodo being a community site.  I've got the ways of getting accurate information required through dev/marketing/community here - just need to work on the publishing model.  And once someone works out how (and shares how) to IPFS host  (decentralized web) something like this, then ikomodo doesn't have to be the centralized point of accuracy.

There's reddit.com/r/ikomodo we can use, it's private at the moment but if this is a direction the community marketing wants to go - let's do it.

Need 10 KMD emojis and we start.

I like that idea @Mylo .

I would like to link that website with Komodo forum, meaning that you could submit articles there by making a new thread on the forum (published with forum name). Then that website can just make the formatting more pretty than the forum itself.

The comments can appear on both, the blogging website and the forum, i.e. interoperable comments. I have seen that on few other websites, so it should be possible.

@Daniel CP the objective was to sell the exchanges that paid for the advert directly or indirectly. If they mentioned BarterDex or anyone platform that actually works it defeats their purpose  ( make the DEX look terrible to the reader so they believe Coinbase and Kraken is the best they have)

Just a thought, I'm by no means a marketing expert but I've noticed that in the other asset chains that simple games and airdrops bring a ton of people into the community. Like @benohanlon mentioned micro bounties for spreading the word and  after the inital "fun and givaways" I think KMD  would spread like wildfire. HyperDEX is a "everyone else" app that literally anyone can do (I'll have intro docs ready) that we can expand on a new base, not just the crypto savvy base. Again, just a thought

Seems that our strategy is a defensive one. Many articles, blogs, tweets either fail to mention or incorrectly mention kmd. We defend with correct info. Maybe at some point the strategy should change to offense. Ie: a crypto challenge or a crypto throw down. Make the other projects go on the defensive. Or when a scaling test is done, make a big deal about it.  Advertise the coming achievement and deliver it to the masses with a little fanfare.

Have we stopped trying to get Trezor integration? Ledger has obviously been nothing but problems, and I remember from a while back Stick was pretty receptive to the idea and he knows some Komodo Devs? Maybe we should set up a twitter blast to randomly target some of their tweets with Komodo integration comments, likes, retweets. Could potentially focus on the fact Ledger hasn't resolved core issues we need for too long and they'd likely make a lot more sales of KMD holders moving from ledger (like me) though this may appear adversarial, I think we've given Ledger enough time to correct this issue. 

@benohanlon @n2okpride  What do you think? are we ready to help them integrate if they need assistance?

@RunningMantheCoin so the answer is top 10 non-exchange addresses hold ~25% of KMD as far as we know but it's probably rounded up because the list very likely still includes other exchanges addresses, just not sure which ones

so not sure how you calculate 25% of the top 10

it seems less than 10%

ok, excluding SN and Mshark it's far lower

Kind of like when a big family holding holds a large portion of a publicly traded company

it is far closer to exchange holdings than a single whale holdings

It is a wordpress site for it's simplicity to publish.  Currently need to organise a bunch of kmd work relating to what the team is working on across  dev/marketing/qa-support.

There is a podcast coming out soon where team member Alright and I discuss assetchains, and if you haven't listened to the BBC radio podcast where KMD's siu talks about the potential in Puerto Rico for a brief section - there's that to keep you occupied and excited with what is happening.

@RunningMantheCoin I've been thinking more about that table, there are some fundamentals differences between KMD and other platforms that is hard to fit them into those categories. You may want to explain this to the author. First is the question about Token Creation, KMD allows to create independent blockchains that can do atomic swaps with each other and they work as the equivalent of colored coins/tokens on other platforms. So answering the question depends if he means specifically colored coins from the technical point of view, then it's a work in progress, or if he means the purpose of token creation, then KMD assetchains can fit both the token and sidechain categories. Then there's a question about transaction costs: the assetchains  are independent and can decide their own tx costs and pay them in their own coins,  they don't pay kmd tx fees

Beauty is it's a separate network.  That's a very important distinction.


[25-Jul-18 01:51 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
exact, even that definition must be taken with a grain of salt, some approximation for fitting into the table at all

wow we are at 10% BTC activity level. the other coins use very chatty protocols so the tx count is not directly comparable


[25-Jul-18 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
this is an unexpectedly high percentage


[25-Jul-18 08:14 AM] CHMEX#0686
To be fair I told the guy to count payments and not transactions as he talks about activity. For BTC the still counts trx. 
I also gave him the scale test numbers.


[25-Jul-18 08:15 AM] CHMEX#0686
For KMD its payments thats why it 28k; trx are around 5.5k


[25-Jul-18 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
yes payments are fair


[25-Jul-18 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
for BTC, it would probably not even double things as most are single payment tx


[25-Jul-18 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe we are a bit under 10% of BTC activity level and being above BCH shows the KMD usage level in context


[25-Jul-18 08:18 AM] CHMEX#0686
Intressting is that zcash has about the same volume trx wise. But a higer mcap


[25-Jul-18 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
ETH seems to count each opcode as a transaction


[25-Jul-18 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
also we really should be counting the activity of all the assetchains, pretty sure ETH volumes include ERC20 activity

When approximately is the scaling test? And is there any complimentary marketing to go along with it? Ex: Evel Knievel markets the hell out of his events before they happen. Kmd going for a world record TPS should be treated like an event and preferably (my opinion) marketed like one. Who here recently  watched those twin rocket booster's touch down at the same time? This is just as epic in my opinion. 🤣

Once the last parts are tied up, marketing will have plenty of notice before the test is run.

@Regnar__ @KomodoPlatform Just so I understand correctly, this scaling is already part of the deployed KMD network? If tomorrow there was a sudden burst of real use of kmd, how would the network cope? Would someone have manually add more capacity somewhere?
Twitter


[25-Jul-18 10:06 AM] Regnar#6164
Thinking of a clear simple response. "It's our proven scaling tech that is in the final stages to remove bugs, we've already tested 45k tx/s using this, but are securing the infrastructure to push that to 1M tx/s to make sure there are no bottlenecks when we turn the throttle up."

he is assuming it is KMD itself that would scale, he doesnt seem to understand about the independent chains


[25-Jul-18 10:10 AM] Regnar#6164
yes, he is assuming it's just KMD and not the use of merkle trees for scaling. but anyway, the answer to his question is it's not deployed as a scaling tech yet

cool bean, no problem, I was just browsing btt and a lot of projects out there like to have masternodes. So it could be a great selling point as well on top of all the other great features.


[26-Jul-18 01:48 AM] Audo#5667
@PTYX / @siu , do you guys provide some master node implementation option in regards to Komodo? If yes, then we can include it – if not, then it's not ready for marketing.

I just vaguely remember there have been some talk of using your own set of 'master nodes'. I guess that is what verus did with their KMD "fork"?


[26-Jul-18 01:48 AM] Chipmoon#7477
BNTN plans to have masternode on their roadmap as well

@webworker01 I agree...👍🏼

`masternode implementation` is a possibility for assetchains that have CryptoConditions enabled. The `rewards` part of it has been written in its simplest form and needs to be tested. The other parts of a `masternode` might come in the future. All of this is currently in development and can be followed in the #dev-modules channel.

[26-Jul-18 01:56 AM] jl777c#5810
what about masternodes makes them popular?


[26-Jul-18 01:56 AM] jl777c#5810
from what I have heard it is the ability to lock funds to earn rewards and all the other parts of the masternode is not really that much of interest.


[26-Jul-18 01:57 AM] jl777c#5810
if somebody can precisely describe what more than pure rewards CC is needed for a "masternode" CC, I can think about implementing it


[26-Jul-18 01:58 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
from what I read masternodes are like PoS stakers, they validate blocks and earn the tx fees and/or stake new coins


[26-Jul-18 01:58 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
for that network


[26-Jul-18 01:59 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
though there are many variants


[26-Jul-18 01:59 AM] Chipmoon#7477
MGN/MGNX masternode has governance voting and of course the reward as well ( 80% rewards goes to node holder)


[26-Jul-18 02:01 AM] jl777c#5810
CC is not in a position to validate blocks (without major overhaul which I wont do), but it can deal with most other aspects


[26-Jul-18 02:01 AM] Chipmoon#7477
dash has private send and instant send features on masternode


[26-Jul-18 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810
all KMD chains have private send


[26-Jul-18 02:03 AM] jl777c#5810
instant send is not really something CC can do


[26-Jul-18 02:03 AM] Chipmoon#7477
probably can be implemented like zeroconf?


[26-Jul-18 02:04 AM] Mylo#8306
instant send is like 0-conf by the sounds of it.
masternodes lock the coins up.  and then everyone wants a masternode because it earns block rewards, raising the price.


[26-Jul-18 02:05 AM] jl777c#5810
@Chipmoon I await your design of 0conf CC implemetation as it is beyond me

just a quick question, I saw it was asked somewhere earlier but I don't remember the answer specifically. What is the reason behind the 500MM max supply for asset chains? integer overflow? what about if coins wanted to be non divisible but have high supply (kind of like NEO)?

I don't know enough about this to know if Michelson isn't possible on AC, or if it's something that could transfer over. It may have interop difficulties when it comes to cross chain comms, but again, not sure.

We aren't pushing dPoW yet just because of the amount of work to implement it for other coins, but I think ERC20 coins or small bitcoin based coins could be interested in converting to a KMD AC for the additional features, scaling tech, and dPoW I think.

[26-Jul-18 12:24 PM] Regnar#6164
@xRobeSx any idea on a general turn around time on dPoW for a bitcoin protocol coin? I understand it varies, but any baseline would be useful.


[26-Jul-18 12:26 PM] xRobeSx#5136
i'm not sure the amount of code that is necessary to be added to the new coin, but james did it for GAME, so I'm sure the PR's can be somewhat copied to the new coin. 

Basically you just have to get all the Notary Node's to install it on their servers. That takes a day or so to get everyone doing it and synced

{Reactions}
👍🏻 (2) 

[26-Jul-18 12:28 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay so likely not month long, or something that will take too much effort away from KMD core development/scaling etc


[26-Jul-18 12:28 PM] xRobeSx#5136
and the amount of time it takes for the coin's dev team to accept the PR and update their network to the new code


[26-Jul-18 12:29 PM] Regnar#6164
I am assuming there would be a review period though, in which a KMD dev goes through their code to see if there is anything blatantly malicious or wrong in it that could hurt KMD or notaries etc


[26-Jul-18 12:29 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I think most of it can be done without KMD core team doing much. The updates for iguana are minimal, its just getting the dpow code into the coin and NN's running it


[26-Jul-18 12:30 PM] xRobeSx#5136
yes @Regnar thats important too. We've discussed it would be dangerous if the NN's just blindly install someone's coin and then update it without reviewing


[26-Jul-18 12:30 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I guess thats why james recommends legit dev team coins first


[26-Jul-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
count on a week to deploy, but for bitcoin forks not based on 0.11 or 0.15 there will be unknown amount of time, maybe a month or two

[26-Jul-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
2 weeks to deployment, while might be possible if it was made into absolute highest priority, it would create stress, derail all the other projects and not anything that makes sense to do

👍 (2) 

[26-Jul-18 12:33 PM] Regnar#6164
Not trying to make false expectations, just had zero idea on what to go on. Okay sounds good, so finding viable projects will obviously have some type of priority set up. Is there something coin dev teams can do to prep themselves if they are on a "waiting list" or something? implement code but leave it inactive.


[26-Jul-18 12:34 PM] Regnar#6164
Not that I need to know that tbh


[26-Jul-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
they can look at GAME or CHIPS to see what it required. but once the code is done, it is a matter of merging the pull request and then doing a height activated hardfork


[26-Jul-18 12:40 PM] Regnar#6164
Okay, for dPoW services prioritize bitcoin protocol based on 0.11 or 0.15, with legit dev teams, and we can prioritize based on their social media presence, market cap, cost of attack, etc so that we can get some solid marketing from the integration. 2 month deployment is realistic but could be more depending on the project. Coin devs can look at Chips or GAME to see what is required (we should get the github links for them that show the code added just so we have it on hand).

btch will have it's own token/asset exchange and smart contract functionality - like blockchain enforced faucet and other contracts as they are developed and saved in the src code as a "catalogue" to choose from to adopt or customize for your own needs.

and you never know what other goodies hush will get....kmd has the CHIPS project.  so whatever non-assetchain-to-KMD interop happens, hush will be pretty close to the action.  duke probably will innovate his own magic.


[26-Jul-18 04:44 PM] Berg#2666
I currently volunteer as Hush's marketing lead, and I don't expect compensation for what I'm doing as a community member. However I know JL spoke of bounties, and I currently have no position in BTCH, so to become to lead marketer for that project I'd required to be rewarded a stake in the project, lump sum or annuity. I'd definitely love to do so, but I'd first need some agreement on that front, as well as someone figuring out how to obtain the BTCH twitter from me (I'm pretty sure Clamoring still owns it)

it would be possible to dPoW non-bitcoin protocol coins, but that is a lot of custom work in a new codebase. however, if the coin has a dev that is familiar with their coins consensus code, it could be done efficiently

Typically it’s a simple infographic with a requirement to follow You, Komodo, tag three friends with a hashtag of your choice.

Awesome thanks for the info Regnar. I will see what I can come up  with 🧐

Is there any particular aspect that the marketing efforts are being directed towards at present?
ie I was reading above that the DPOW aspect  is something to be brought to peoples attention.

Yea Gordon and I have been looking for dPoW areas to reach out to other coins. Graphics stuff isn't a high priority for community driven marketing right now just because we are revamping designs and are shooting for it to be a unified, consistent look.

[28-Jul-18 09:21 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm also collecting a lot of his best quotes throughout the years but it has been a difficult process because many of the forums that he was on back then have since shut down or changed and I'm stuck using way back machines searches which often doesn't have those smaller forums.

anything else anybody would like to add, it seems that HKN would implement masternode, but i haven't mentioned masternode capability


[29-Jul-18 10:26 AM] Regnar#6164
yea I'm not sure masternodes are a thing KMD asset chains are going to have.


[29-Jul-18 10:28 AM] Chipmoon#7477
I think most functions of masternode are already accomplised by kmd blochchain


[29-Jul-18 10:28 AM] Chipmoon#7477
like private send , near instantsend(60 seconds)


[29-Jul-18 10:29 AM] Chipmoon#7477
security - we have dPOW


[29-Jul-18 10:30 AM] Chipmoon#7477
so using masternode as just a gimmick name for reward for holding a certain amount of coin , could be a thing?

[29-Jul-18 10:36 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
masternodes can earn a lot of tx fees if the blockchain is successful, because they're the ones validating blocks


[29-Jul-18 10:36 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
this feature is not available yet for kmd assetchains


[29-Jul-18 10:37 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
**all** nodes validate blocks 🙄


[29-Jul-18 10:37 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
yeah I mean generate blocks


[29-Jul-18 10:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
privileging those that can afford excessive amounts over those that cannot


[29-Jul-18 10:38 AM] Chipmoon#7477
it's like staking


[29-Jul-18 10:39 AM] Chipmoon#7477
but it can be programmed so that only masternode can generate block for an asset chain?


[29-Jul-18 10:39 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes like PoS staking but only those with above a set amount


[29-Jul-18 10:39 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
actually, it's not like staking - with staking, nearly any amount can get you earnings; with MN, only those with bank can afford to generate


[29-Jul-18 10:39 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
James said it's not possible yet, adding this customization will take time

it seems a lot of projects that could move to KMD, also like to use masternodes


[29-Jul-18 10:44 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
because MNs attract investors looking to make a "free" buck off a passive activity


[29-Jul-18 10:44 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
from an investment standpoint they are nice


[29-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Chipmoon#7477
we provide the tools, let the projects decide whether they want to use it or not , i'll say


[29-Jul-18 10:46 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
this parameter is a consensus thing, like choosing PoS or PoW. I wonder how hard it would be to add this option. Is it just like PoS but with a minimum staking amount?


[29-Jul-18 10:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
We looked at this before. And I know a dev who can code it for us, provided a bit of help in setting up the right -ac parameter

It's all about perspective @ComputerGenie  😉


[29-Jul-18 10:52 AM] Chipmoon#7477
so i think  it's comparable to spend money on ASIC, or spend money buying coin to stake on masternode


[29-Jul-18 10:52 AM] Chipmoon#7477
both are pretty much passive


[29-Jul-18 10:54 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@WhiteWidow  `Today at 12:51 PM
It's all about perspective`
That's my point, some have a "vision" of what Komodo "is" (be they on the inside looking out or the outside looking in) and things done can change *how* they view the future
A feature **could** be added to telly you to "Go fek off you broke bastid" if you have "insufficient funds" to make a transfer; however, that doesn't mean that it **should** be added


[29-Jul-18 10:55 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Major protocol changes are no different


[29-Jul-18 10:56 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Chipmoon I'm not sure an $850 ASIC compares to a $16,000-50,000 MN


[29-Jul-18 10:56 AM] Regnar#6164
But we're talking about coins building off of Komodo aren't we?


[29-Jul-18 10:56 AM] Chipmoon#7477
@ComputerGenie so set the MN to $850 a piece 😄

{Reactions}
😄 

[29-Jul-18 10:57 AM] Regnar#6164
in which case, why should we have any say in how those coin teams, investors, or adopters, set up their chain?


[29-Jul-18 10:59 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Regnar because, consensus?


[29-Jul-18 10:59 AM] Regnar#6164
Develop without Limitations
Enjoy the benefits of your own independent chain with zero dependencies or commitments to the Komodo main chain.


[29-Jul-18 11:00 AM] Regnar#6164
Isn't consensus met by the adoption of a coin by its community, fully knowing masternodes are part of the project?


[29-Jul-18 11:01 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Chipmoon tbh, I'd actually be in favor of a MN system with a flat permanent cost that didn't cost $5 for people that found it on day 1 and $10k for anyone that never heard of it until 6+ months later after it hit an exchange and mooned


[29-Jul-18 11:03 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Regnar `Today at 1:00 PM

I mean that, imo, there should be a consensus of even adding the consensus mechanism for MN consensus (sounds circular, but it's realy not)


[29-Jul-18 11:04 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
`Today at 12:59 PM

There's nothing stopping a dev from adding it on their own (development)


[29-Jul-18 11:05 AM] Chipmoon#7477
that could be a feature on the masternode


[29-Jul-18 11:06 AM] Chipmoon#7477
a selling point


[29-Jul-18 11:06 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'd imagine that if CoinX wanted to both be part of the platform **and** develop good code for a MN system that jl wouldn't be completely opposed to a PullRequest that implemented it well and safely

{Reactions}
👌 

[29-Jul-18 11:09 AM] Regnar#6164
So I guess it comes down to this here, do we as the marketing team, reach out to MN communities in order to spend our time and efforts to convince them to change their coin design (potentially losing their adopters) because we don't support MN and want more projects to migrate?

Do we reach out to them and offer half baked services and see if they want to spend their own effort to design the MN system that works with KMD AC?

Do we ignore these communities and focus only on those coins that are consistent with the AC structures we can provide?

Real question btw.


[29-Jul-18 11:15 AM] Regnar#6164
Notice I didn't say should we add MN capabilities in house, seeing as that doesn't appear to be something we want to work on.


[29-Jul-18 11:15 AM] Regnar#6164
which isn't a problem, just trying to get marketing/migration focused in on


[29-Jul-18 11:16 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I can't see any way where I'd consider any solution Komodo has to offer as "half baked"; however, the reality is that dev only goes so far so fast. *Someone* has to dev  anything to be added.
The real question is:
Do you want to over-burden dev just to have a "good marketing plan/campaign" for those that currently have a differing structure than Komodo offers?


[29-Jul-18 11:17 AM] Regnar#6164
Perhaps that was the wrong word choice? I didn't mean it insultingly, just in that we can offer blockchain services, but if we are offering them to a specific group (MN communities) and we don't offer the MN parts...


[29-Jul-18 11:17 AM] Regnar#6164
So it comes down to how do we engage with MN communities about migration, or don't we?

@Chipmoon what do you think?

[29-Jul-18 11:19 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
If Magna is anything to go by, anything but a pure conversion is going to make some MN folks pissy


[29-Jul-18 11:19 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and all they did was add a 2nd coin 😕


[29-Jul-18 11:22 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm not too familiar on Magna conversion, but that's the point I'm trying to make. Do we ignore these communities because we don't have the MN solution their investors and adopters want, which is why they invested in those projects? or do we approach this differently.


[29-Jul-18 11:23 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm personally in the camp that we shouldn't focus on MN communities right now. until we have a solution they will actually want.

{Reactions}
👍 

[29-Jul-18 11:25 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
imo, the best solution would be to find a few MN oriented devs and see if they would be interested in doing the work. Like I said before, the code will not just appear out of thin air, someone's gotta do it and there's plenty of existing Komodo irons in the fire as it is


[29-Jul-18 11:25 AM] Regnar#6164

[29-Jul-18 11:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
I am sure hes more than capable, but it needs to be placed into an -ac_mn= parameter


[29-Jul-18 11:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
likely would be more than 1 even. To defin rewards/eras

[29-Jul-18 11:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
Probably not, it was something another community member came to me about asking if it was possible, so I asked this guy, and he said he would port MN for us.  But it was just port MN, discussion never went any further.

I've been trying to figure out the true difference in MN and just regular PoS to try and understand this better, but it looks like MN are just PoS but only if a staking wallet has a certain amount (minimum) of coins in it?


[30-Jul-18 05:55 AM] yorklab#7270
Well even Agama needs a minimum amount.

I personally think the Website needs a serious overhaul. From colors to breaking everything down in a way for companies and investors to understand that Komodo has MORE to offer than any other project. I’m just not seeing it on the current site. I have a large position in this company as I think — in time — it’ll do well. How will you (Komodo) let the world know you’re better than ETH? You are, now let the world know.

Yes, website getting some love - I think you're in the majority there!  Yes, CTAs (call to actions) - see something KMD can do, use it - for whatever purpose/demographic and one of the 5 pillars of a blockchain ecosystem we are working on is _simplicity_.  Security, scalability, interoperability & privacy KMD is great at.  Simplicity - we are working on getting the tech into more peoples hands - across different desirable markets.

atomicexplorer.com ?

Not official.  Yes, good point.  These are things that marketing and the agency have on the table.  There is a some unity required, and 1 or 2 community sites will 99.9% be voted to receive some branding love as well as better resource linking.

"We are all involved in the education aspect, it's part of our social contract to leave something for other people to learn from" (paraphrased badly) was what was said to me in the first meeting.  This is another part we are working on, a "learn more" area for traders and developers.

peer2krd and notary involvement with the world/community/side-projects as well.  There are non-english speaking forums where out of all popular equihash coins, kmd is the lowest mentioned.

Has anyone used this peer2krd?  Has anyone ordered?   @Virginia (Peer2Group) how many batches/customers can you guys support - i read in one channel the first batch of cards is out and waiting for next batch - which EU countries etc.  need more info.  Can you work with community #komodo-team - i had a quick look at kmd twitter and a message was retweeted once or twice in mid July.  Do you want more ppl to sign up, can you work with this channel first for feedback and i'll see what our writing resources are like for an update.  we recently wrote about a partnership with gonetcoins which has a service in canada entering the US with reloads available in many stores via virtual ATM.

@Regnar nice twitter poll 😃  thanks for getting the info, it is quite interesting.

@Kay Gee sell brand to who? 

I'd like to re-visit the twitter poll concept.

Anyhow, I've got some dev work to do.  My first exposure to smart contracts was to test a blockchain enforced contract for a faucet.  This is in alpha testing, history is in #dev-modules channel.  https://github.com/imylomylo/KMD-CC-Token-Test-Guide/tree/master/rpc/faucet

Unfortunately i ran into a conflict with a docker image for testing contracts.  Docker is a technology where you can basically "press play" and you have a service.  It needs some further work but makes the dev-experience for non-system (e.g. front end) & other tech users quite easy to get involved.  https://github.com/imylomylo/docker-komodod is the start, it needs some docs and maybe a simple dev front end so community can get involved during alpha phase.

There is also lightning network testing being done with a side project, which integrates with smart contracts - hopefully include community too!!

@Mylo sorry, I’ve worked in advertising for years and I fall back to default positions. Imo copy should always sell the brand to the reader, all readers- that’s why there is copy.  Surely that is why there is a website, right? To inform and involve KMD users and to grow the KMD user base? Selling the brand just means explaining why KMD over ETH, for example.

On each page, in each block of text, you want to trigger an emotional response - whether that is pathos or desire is largely irrelevant, but the stronger the emotion evoked, the greater the likelihood you will create a behavioral change. What I was clumsily saying is that short copy can sell the big picture concepts (simplicity, security, flexibility, etc.) but the CTAs don’t just have to be “[we’re the brand/platform/ for you]” as there are deliverables which in and of themselves are seemingly creating hype - without any context.

Anyways, I’m sure you know this and I’m just riffing because of excitement: for once, this is a project I’m invested in (quite literally) rather than one I’m being paid to care about. 

There may also be an element of advanced procrastination at play 😉

Yeeeeewwwww!

@Kay Gee i'm a dev by trade, but worked with more bad marketers than good, so only know enough to be dangerous.  evoking emotions that's advertiser's craft, but yeah marketers (the good and bad) make a living on those emotions.   CTAs and _all_ the copy are being updated - there was a message testing post on reddit in the past few days and we're working with an agency to unlock what we have already, where we'll be in jan 2019 with the new tech, which is super engaging - interoperable, simple to make apps on with a very rich feature set.

Hi @Mylo Mylo, 

First of all, I want to thank you for the support.
This 1st batch was 100 cards. For the moment, the cards are only eligible for legal EU residents, that is, citizens who are legally living in a european country which belong to Eurozone.

Your proposal sounds very good! I'm going to contact you by another channel, for more details. Thanks!


[01-Aug-18 02:49 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@Virginia (Peer2Group) @Mylo  is that also possible to add topup of other KMD platform coins like Hush, BTCH or Chips? I saw currently it's BTC and KMD, which is good enough, but possibility of other coins (not assets) would be good? I also didn't see more detailes on the page (from where the price it taken and how much % the provider takes. Also good to display team members details (linkein?) for more trust then just anon page. Then I think KMD card could compete with other popular ??


[01-Aug-18 02:51 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Actually to topup also other popular coins like LTC/ETH/XMR/Dash could be good from marketing perspective - other communities may like to have it.


[01-Aug-18 02:58 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
also for better marketing if pre-ann correctly (widely) after doing above adjustment some time limit could be made to subscribe for "free card" and after that period cards could be like 10$ or so (or lower % charge margin for early birds) ? Thanks to this hurry-up effect more people could join this quickly and could be more viral...


[01-Aug-18 02:59 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
For example the charge could be 1% for early birds and 3-5% afterwards (not sure what is it now, but should compete with Monaco and TenX)


[01-Aug-18 03:00 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
And also calculate the cost of card production per unit - later it might be charged that amount.

@passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 thanks for the great suggestions and ideas. This is just a  1st step phase thats why 100 cards. Of course we can accept many other cryptos, but as you see we are already sold out the cards in about 4 days and have quite a big waiting list. We will work on it during next months and I don't discard a 2nd, bigger batch in september


[01-Aug-18 07:10 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
so this is also maybe a reason to have these cards paid sth - to hire more people as there is probably some manual work involved in the process ? question if you got already a business model to make a proper pricelist or overall action plan. If there is so many people waiting seems idea is great and might be worth investing more time, people, money.


[01-Aug-18 07:27 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
For the reason of not wasting time/human resources /(sending cards to people who will never use it) I would suggest to revert the process a bit: 1. user registration and KMD+BTC address creation  (if not registered - lowest priority) 2. user optional payment - just anything between 0 and 10 KMD (for sorting out priority list + having money to pay additional people helping with faster cards creation 3. preparing and sending batches according priority list 4. iterate 😃

@Chipmoon  thx for sharing. Personally I treat card-coins (created only on purpose of the card) as scams or ponzi. No need to create new coin just for card purpose. You can use existing once -> does not make any sense to create a new one -> shady thing.


[01-Aug-18 09:59 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
The exception could be if the card-coin is revenue based (you buy shares of company) or sth, but I believe mostly purpose is to create new coin, hype it with the purpose of card (like there was no other possibility without?) and dump it later sucking money from "lucky investors" 😃


[01-Aug-18 10:01 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Actually making revenue coin for perr2group card could be interesting - get money for bigger marketing of the card and promise  some % of charged fees in the future. But a decent plan and market knowledge needed  before starting.

Komodo kann es mit vielen seiner Konkurrenten aufnehmen. Dabei bezeichnet sich Komodo selbst nicht als ein Konkurrent von, sondern sieht sich als Bereicherung für den kompletten Kryptomarkt.

I think go less into detail into exactly how it works (the ones who already know a bit about tech/work for blockchain etc will do their own research and ask questions) but the general public mostly don't care much for that side of things


[02-Aug-18 02:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
its hard to see how we could explain things much simpler than theyre already put I think LOL but thats partly due to already understanding or being around komodo for so long, just as a test I showed the articles to some of my friends who are the average casual investor

He said specifically we need to say why it benefits him, and why should he care about it. He wasn;t being rude, he just said that sthe only why you will make people care about it.


[02-Aug-18 03:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
1 million transactions per second, btw:
1) Its cheaper for you to use the platform than any other
2) Increases your security  and anonymity as there are so many TX's its almost impossible to trace a single one. 
3) its more reliable for your use and wont fail when too busy


[02-Aug-18 04:31 AM] Regnar#6164
4) it's not 1M tx/s for Komodo Platform that is shared among all chains built on it. Every chain is capable of that scaling, and even scaling tx/s greater than Komodo itself. (Might just be a point to make)
5) Tx/s don't just mean individual people buying things. They can mean messages sent, things like tweets, products communicating with each other, buying and selling to one another, automated micro transactions. which allows for scaling of any type of product or service imaginable.


[02-Aug-18 04:40 AM] Regnar#6164
I read something, think it was on XRP tbh, but they talked about autonomous cars/uber communicating with one another and send micro transactions to allow cars to tip one another to move through traffic faster. Or the conversation with Richard Gendal Brown in which the famous quote comes, "on the blockchain, nobody knows you're a fridge". I think when we get out of the mindset that a transaction is a person walking into a store and swiping a card to buy something, and instead we realize the world of microtransactions, of instant, automated transactions by people, and automated transactions by machines. we realize that the even with half a century that VISA has had to build infrastructure clearly isn't effective enough to handle these types of transactions. hell, VISA crashed in Europe two months ago, failing to do exactly what it was designed to do, individual human transactions.

I are a fridge ❄


[02-Aug-18 04:41 AM] Regnar#6164
or we realize that things like email, twitter, text messaging, or any form of communication COULD (not saying they all should) exist on a chain, or form of chain, it's easier to understand that the 1M tx/s milestone, while arbitrary in scale, is important as a benchmark to competitors.


[02-Aug-18 04:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
Not looking forward to that future hahahhaha id rather spend money on a turbo than to tip other drivers on the blockchain 😂😂😂 makes me wonder what the worlds gonna look like when im in my 30 40s


[02-Aug-18 04:43 AM] Regnar#6164
If we said 7.4B transactions a second we could say it's important because every person on earth could transact at once every second. or however many fridges there are, cars, etc. it's easy to see how even the 1M mark could be overshadowed haha

[02-Aug-18 06:50 AM] Mylo#8306
@Regnar yeah humans aren't going to be doing the most transactions.  we're moving from a time where people paid for software, to people & machines paying for services - it's the original IBM SaaS vision from 20 years ago - and now these services (and devices that use these services) have to pay themselves to be maintainable by humans and other machines.
the economy now involves "robots".  they create value, and now that value is programmable.  they're pseudo-autonomous - and nobody wants to pay for software to run these machines.  my 2c


[02-Aug-18 06:53 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea, "transaction" is in people's minds as a human transaction for goods, either on Amazon, in a store, or with someone else, and though IOT and robots buying/selling/transacting has been known about for decades, it seems most people don't see it on the horizon.


[02-Aug-18 06:56 AM] Regnar#6164
Just looking at VISA infrastructure, or traditional banking infrastructure and the use of ACH systems to clear transactions at T+3 its laughable to think that they will be able to handle these micro transactions, or non human transactions (transactions of monetary value, or even information)


[02-Aug-18 06:59 AM] Regnar#6164
The problem I see for us is, internet, coding, and even blockchain is like clay for bricks. it's difficult to show the builder they can build a house from this clay. But if we turn that clay into bricks, move our product/service one step down the line, it's much easier to show them they can build a house of bricks. So we either need to take that step ourselves and develop these bricks for use, or we need to find others who are willing to turn our clay to bricks and then sell it themselves.


[02-Aug-18 07:00 AM] Regnar#6164
Not a perfect example obviously


[02-Aug-18 07:11 AM] Regnar#6164
So I guess by this analogy it is up to us to identify the markets that each Komodo product or service is designed for, either as of now, or planned in the future.


[02-Aug-18 07:12 AM] Regnar#6164
ie. selling bricks to builder, or selling clay to brick maker


[02-Aug-18 07:21 AM] Regnar#6164
@Mylo are you typing?


[02-Aug-18 07:21 AM] Mylo#8306
it's spot on.  kmd does a lot of things first.  we're a small focussed team.  and you're right, we don't know all the potential markets for our tech.   for one group, it's empowering - for another a convenience.  in one culture it's accepted in another it needs to work a different way.  we are all pioneers.  the other blockchain groups too.

the server for the "community news site" has been provisioned - probably be a few days til it's testable.

does it say i'm typing the whole time?  i'm doing a cpl things at once

[02-Aug-18 07:28 AM] Regnar#6164
It would be worthwhile to get a list of Komodo capabilities, features, or functions, so we can see which are clay and which are bricks. Also which aren't "products" yet but could be, and which ones are products that have limited use cases and would be better bundled with others.

Someone should make a sticky for our subreddit. I went on google to try and find out how hard it would be to find out about the tech we have, and it's not the easiest LOL.
There were a few small places, but I think the main place people look is reddit to begin with, so having a stickied "What is Komodo" might be a good idea


[05-Aug-18 01:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
From the outside we do sort of look like every other blockchain platform, so having a few keypoints and explainer paragraphs would help people understand more I think

"We offer blockchain creation"
"We have infinite scaling through ___chains and they are all secured by dPoW, which _________. We also offer this service for other blockchains who wish to secure themselves against attacks"

btw it may make sense to donate some sites like CoinFairValue or Bloctivity for building alternatives for CMC


[05-Aug-18 03:06 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
it make sense, since they 1. could stop their sited if they don't have revenue 2. they do sth positive also for KMD 3. if they get some tips they will most probably use it for marketing to be more recognized and KMD will also benefit from that


[05-Aug-18 03:08 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
I believe all treu projects should donate these alternatives (if they are found to give some additional value for the crypto space)

i wonder if it would be a great idea to have bitdegree doing an article /lesson about kmd. they did an article about zcash https://www.bitdegree.org/tutorials/what-is-zcash/amp/?utm_source=twpg&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=ign&__twitter_impression=true

Hello Komodo 😃 I wrote the Komodo history book in 2017.  Would you like to discuss the possibility of a second book for 2018?


[05-Aug-18 05:51 AM] Regnar#6164
I think the Bitdegree would be a great idea. their Zcash one seemed more about the zkSNARK idea and how it worked, maybe we can have them write an article on Atomic Swaps that we can provide information for and possibly when the nuances of the tech are finalized, MoMoM scaling.


[05-Aug-18 05:51 AM] Regnar#6164

yea I really really like Brave. They have built in Tor tabs, and I like that the tabs are separate from one another, so a private tab, or tor tab doesn't require a new window


[05-Aug-18 07:17 AM] Regnar#6164
make sure you activate the BAT payments, they'll hook your wallet up with some BAT and you use it to pay websites for visiting, decide how much you want to pay per month to avoid all the ads (or not pay lol)


[05-Aug-18 07:18 AM] Regnar#6164
But I'll be paying because I want to support Brave and BAT and make an incentive for sites to stop shitty ads

hello guys, i was thinking about ways to make public aware of komodo power, maybe a double or triple interview done to people (recognised by public audience already) that represent other tokens similar to komodo like ethereum and then put them together on the screen so it will look like they answered at the same questions in the same moment, the questions would be about TPS, scaling, notarization, consensus et cetera all about putting a nice light on komodo's characteristics. what you guys think?

[05-Aug-18 08:58 AM] okthen#8167
@criptobear I think that's a little manipulative while KMD really doesn't need anything like that. A clear and precise outline of what it is that KMD exactly does or wants to do is more helpful IMO. The more precise, the better. If you want to highlight everything it can do, it becomes a little overwhelming and detracts from the appeal, imo it would be better to concentrate on 3 or 4 core points where it excels and outshines others. Besides this effort it can always be helpful to explain in detail every feature (separately), just not everything in one go. Just my 2 cents.


[05-Aug-18 09:51 AM] Regnar#6164
@benohanlon @n2okpride  I'm not sure if I'm missing it, but we need to include an ethical or professional code of conduct as a project on our website or white paper. I understand the white paper is more about how Komodo and it's features works rather than a "marketing white paper" so I think it wouldn't belong there. But it definitely needs to be somewhere on the website and if it is already, it needs to be easily available/found.


[05-Aug-18 02:40 PM] Regnar#6164

Okay here we are, this link to the time in the video someone asks about Interop and Atomic Swaps.

May be something you'd want to look into? Maybe not idk 😛 But my ads were targetted very specifically, and with minimal followers/likes so prices were high and even so they were cheap compared to other methods


[05-Aug-18 08:34 PM] Mylo#8306
Yes social media campaigns are on the roadmap.

For the community news site, what categories do you think will help?
 - ecosystem (kmd and related blockchains announcements)
 - service providers & exchanges (like chain makers, chainzilla, digitalprice etc.)
 - development/tech
 - other crypto news (competitions running e.g. for listing)
 - social media news

The beta site is up on the server it will run on.  Have a few things to test before public show


[05-Aug-18 08:35 PM] Mylo#8306
- community opinions


[05-Aug-18 08:37 PM] Deleted User#0000
Development/tech 
Ecosystem
Social Media news
Service providers and exchanges
Other crypto news

That would be the order I think from most to least important

competitions/listings would be good, but I'm guessing most people will see those and vote from our discord/reddit more so than on a community news site

Rebrand 2.0 is currently exiting discovery phase with our new agency partner Ideas By Nature. Current website is 1.5, but we're working incorporating a few updates to introduce 2.0 messaging and details while we wait for the full 2.0 rebrand.

@everyone I'm going to create a place on Discourse for ideas and suggestions we can better review them and give them the attention they deserve. @n2okpride and our team were discussing this yesterday. 
- also we'll have medium writers for anyone who wants to contribute written content - if it's good we'll approve it and if it performs well we'll reward it
- as a team we can review suggestions / ideas much better via the forum in our marcomms meetings rather than Discord chat

Hello @@n2okpride, @@benohanlon  , could we get an compilation of Marketing pictures of KMD (maybe on the Main Homepage) which is always up to date? 

I ask, because my english is not realy good (maybe like Others on the kmd forum) , but I believe in KMD and would like to help more to bring the Word out. 

The votings on Twitter (or other Plattform)... Where you can vote for Different coins (like: which is the Best Plattform for ICO: ETH, KMD,... vote now) , are in my opinion important and cheap marketing... And the Best : the community of kmd, who cant speak/write well english (like me) , could post the pictures about KMD too, because we cant make any failures by writing :) 

I think many people are feared about make writing mistakes... But with pictures... Could be easyier... And the voter from other Plattform see the Posted Marketing pictures too. 

Maybe you can tie this with a reward System... Everyone who Post Marketing pic by votings get... xxx ammount of kmd?

Maybe you have some more ideas for people who dont speak english well but would like to bring the Word out?

We just discussed last week that we will use some platform to host alll pictures/infographics about Komodo, so that should be coming soon.

On the longer term we are looking to build a comprehensive 'press kit' that contains information about Komodo so that it's easier to write about what Komodo is and what problems we solve. We are still focused on working out that base story for 2.0, but it's looking quite good at the moment.

We have those 5 blockchain pillars we have been talking about, and we are now considering to move towards describing Komodo as an architecture solutions provider.

We have worked our a website wireframe that contains this new messaging. I'll share with you guys shortly so we get your thoughts.

[09-Aug-18 01:12 AM] Audo#5667
yeah I think a dedicated page for investors/community would be good, but that's not in the scope of this website update. Instead we we are planning to rely on a welcome email / email journey.


[09-Aug-18 01:13 AM] Audo#5667
and people are focusing on developer documentation, and after we have that we can market/highlight it. The CC / 2.0 smart contract tech is in development/testing at the moment.

2019 will be very exciting, most pieces will come together


[09-Aug-18 01:37 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
about the website wireframe, what about adding links to technical docs/github at step 4? Next to Chainzilla and Chainmakers. Or in a separate step. Like sending the message that expert developers can do it themselves, not necessarily hire a service provider


[09-Aug-18 01:38 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
This would avoid giving an impression of centralization

price dropped so now first. Anyway fair value is actually only a simulation - market is not reasonable and won't be reasonable anytime soon or maybe never.


[11-Aug-18 08:27 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
kind of "manipulative marketing vaqlue " index could  be more accurate - but it's just imaginary as afar


[11-Aug-18 09:53 AM] Regnar#6164
well value is subjective of course, and the metrics used to measure it can be "beaten" or manipulated to mean or show different things. But that site does offer some interesting insights and a cool way to determine a networks value beyond a price. I think combining that with blocktivity info is a pretty strong indicator of network value, at least as a value measurement of capacity.


[11-Aug-18 09:54 AM] Regnar#6164
for example I think the monthly rewards requirement will actually positively help us in these rankings, without having any real material difference in the network itself. Just based on the increased tx's that are likely to be moving on KMD from people claiming rewards monthly as opposed to semi annually or annually.


[11-Aug-18 09:57 AM] Regnar#6164
So that is a way that we can see "beating metrics". or in another case it could be how tx are counted, and whether they measure payments vs tx for different chains. again, just showing the limitations of metrics like these, but it doesn't mean we shouldn't throw it out, just think about the model as a conceptual framework, just need to understand it's limitations.


[11-Aug-18 09:58 AM] Regnar#6164
Anyway, I like the site and their measurement methods, it's a nice take on valuing networks. I am curious how a manipulative marketing value index would work. thoughts?


[11-Aug-18 11:38 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
No doubt fair value index is interesting and possibly usefull.


[11-Aug-18 11:43 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
"Marketing manipulation index" is pure fantasy. My guess there is so many tricks you can do in marketing might be hard to get just few patterns. But maybe am wrong. It could be checked tough - I was suggesting to MA team to make a review of marketing efforts by top 20 coins - what they do legal and not legal actions, and those on the edge - just to see what they do and what brings most impact. Week work for someone understanding tech good enough and marketing/promotional/manipulation methods good enough, including wash trades check, specific exchanges (by location also) with big volumes (where most volume comes?), checking inside forums, coins distribution, ads bought on google, facebook, twitter, how many true and fake followers they got, and so on...

[12-Aug-18 11:44 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Hi guys,
Yesterday, I ran into a buddy that does programming in the SF bay area. As an original SN investor I gave him an over-view of the project. He mentioned that he developed some report generating backend software for a crypto tax accounting and law firm.
 
https://cryptofifo.tax

From their website when talking about their formatting..

"The format is exactly what is needed for tax return preparation, and the "Assets Remaining" ledger is extremely useful for analyzing when to sell cryptocurrencies to maximize returns from a tax perspective."

So my thought process is that this type of thing could be useful for liquidity providers (maximizing returns from tax perspective). I know I and a few friends have put the breaks on Crypto trading due to uncertainty of tax obligations; was planning on becoming a liquidity provider. Combine this tax reporting software with tradebot technology and marketmaker portfolio management, could be rather useful.

Anyway, is there any use for something like this? What channel/ person would be a good contact for my developer friend.
Thanks guys

@PTYX Good AMA. I still wonder if a 2FA makes sense for the chain.  Or whether a cold storage such as ledger is the solution. But unfortunately without Agama connection...

@Cryptoon but it's pointless, if the private key is lost. More sense it’s make for the transactions, but then the 2FA must be implemented in the chain. Please correct me if I‘m wrong, you are the technical devs...;)

I thought Komodo wasn't married to BTC but only using it because it has the highest hashrate and therefore the most secure blockchain but could swap if it changed in the future.

We funded in BTC for the ICO to pay notarization fees, but if it was needed to change, you can notarize to another chain, notarization is just a transaction with OP-RETURN.

[14-Aug-18 07:47 AM] CHMEX#0686
komodo repo would be the correct one for KMD but than again SUPERNET repo is used by notaries so its kind of revelant too and they only track master branch and also only the last 12 months so it's like statistics you can look at it in different ways.


[14-Aug-18 07:48 AM] Regnar#6164
right, I'm trying to make sure it shows activity accurately, however focusing on a single repo likely doesn't do that, and as far as I'm aware most testing and work is done on jl777 test channels and then merged to Komodo when done.


[14-Aug-18 07:48 AM] Regnar#6164
So I'm not sure I can request and update on cryptmiso, or redirect where they get their commit data from.


[14-Aug-18 07:50 AM] Regnar#6164
Only reason I bring this up is I was curious to overlay Github activity to current prices, and if I can get enough data points for it run a correlation. My hypothesis is most coins reduce github activity as prices decrease, and vice versa. I think it would be a good marketing point to show that Komodo doesn't decrease activity based on price, but has consistent activity.


[14-Aug-18 07:51 AM] Regnar#6164
and having a single location for this information like CryptoMiso would make it easily replicated so other's can see the same.


[14-Aug-18 08:31 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah we already got in contact with them - their metric is 1 repo.  that's now how we work unfortunately.  so if you really wanted to collect kmd stats across all repos, then you can get stats for other projects similarly and provide an alternative stats model to cryptomiso - unless you really wanted to do it and loved doing stats work - meh.


the current #1 for their latest 3 month ratings is this repo: https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo  if you then go into the packages directory, you see they load the website into the rankings, changelog.json type of files as well.  Not to be too critical, they do a lot of commits and clearly are busy - they also merge from other repos into a central project repo which is both very organised and clap-worthy and also helpful for this type of statistic.  they may also have external repos that don't get counted like we do.

Komodo has separate repos for the wallets, the dex, notary, marketmaker, scale test, notary node operator's individual scripts etc.

And if we point out and be too critical, then our own development gets put under the microscope - why we commit changes in cpp across different servers for testing smart contracts etc.

ca has his own repos as well.  at the end of the day.  if we were to put daniel and steve's notes about blog posts, all our comments/discussions/edits/opinions in git instead of google docs, then there'd be an extra 1000 commits a month from the marketing department.

If the market prices such activity, then it's about as accurate as the mythical man month, how accurate cost estimations are in relation to LoC (lines of code) output per programmer etc.  

end rant.

Should we plan a Komodo week? 😛  Don't know how well it would work out, but say we have 10 or so contributers with good karma reddit, and we get them all to pre-write an article or material about Komodo, and we get them to post it onto reddit cryptocurrency, cryptotechnology, cryptomarkets etc etc within the same few days.
So sort of a planned mass awareness program, cause if your regular joe sees the name "Komodo" a few times, I'm sure they'll take notice.
Maybe similar to chainzilla where we do a smaallll bounty for commenting something useful on it, so we can have a couple comments/likes and bring the articles up to the top. Our reddit presence is pretty small and generally gets shut down pretty quickly or removed LOL. 
Would be good to see a few articles flooding reddit and blockfolio news

I dont know much about tech or how things work, but the fact we are the only blockchain with crypto conditions (I think) sounds like pretty big news, our tx/s was largely ignored, and dPoW for other blockchains is still unknown and misunderstood. Would be nice to see it all come together 😮

There is a plan for a large marketing push, however we're coordinating and ensuring we've got timing and all the content ready so it all aligned.

We will share more details with the community next week. I'm working on getting additional AWS funding and advancing the partnership to the advanced tier. This will allow us to get a joint press release and a quote from an AWS exec sponsor. I've been talking with mainstream media and influencers so once we hit the 1M milestone, we can get coverage all at once and it'll be much harder to miss.

People like getting something for nothing in my experience :) I recently stumbled onto the Electroneum wallet for Android. It benchmarks your phone then fake mines a nominal amount of coin - but I do find myself keeping it running in the background and having a glance at its progress now and then (it barely used any resources) Could this be something an android wallet for Komodo could incorporate? Kinda like staking without it actually doing any work?


[16-Aug-18 07:53 AM] xRobeSx#5136

[16-Aug-18 07:54 AM] figgy132#7531
It could work out good if you have 100k 'miners' offered a nominal bounty to upvote something.


[16-Aug-18 07:54 AM] figgy132#7531
Beyond my scope and time at the minute :)


[16-Aug-18 08:05 AM] Regnar#6164
Idk why that just reminded me of BURST. Anyone remember that coin? They had Proof of Capacity which, idk how well it worked but it was a cool concept. IIRC it basically mined coins based on the available hard drive space you had.


[16-Aug-18 08:08 AM] Regnar#6164
So even cellphones could mine just by the available space on the device, throw a 128gb sd card in your samsung s5 and you could mine. or plug a 2 TB external hard drive into your laptop and mine. I wonder if a mining algorithm like that would be a cool feature for Komodo AC to choose from?


[16-Aug-18 08:14 AM] xRobeSx#5136
@Regnar yea i remember that. It was a cool idea for an algo. Implementing new algos into AC parameters is a cool idea. Its just getting people to code it ha I know verushash will come back to KMD assetchain's eventually.


[16-Aug-18 08:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yep and they claimed to do first smart contract or something like that back in those days 😅


[16-Aug-18 08:16 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea I'm in the camp of offering as many algos as possible. But of course I'm not really a programmer and don't have the capability to do these myself and understand it is difficult to implement it. but from a marketing standpoint its an awesome idea to have a DIY chain launch service just clicking the box on things like algorithms, coin supply, block size, etc.


[16-Aug-18 08:18 AM] Regnar#6164
haha I'm not going to talk about Burst too much, I don't have any or invest in them either, but I do understand why some investors would want low energy mining. Hell they stopped allowing asic imports into a bunch of countries specifically because they don't want people to not use their fiat. Having mining via cellphone is a cool idea. then again it becomes trivial to mine via cellphone when you can hold a coin that gains 5.1% rewards 😛


[16-Aug-18 08:19 AM] Regnar#6164
Trivial in an income sense, not network sense


[16-Aug-18 08:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Compare a PHP progrramer and a CMS user like wordpress. Both have their own place and need in industry. CMS drives more quick adoption, core devs innovations.
In that analogy I want both types the more in KMD.

[16-Aug-18 09:11 AM] Regnar#6164
I think that's something people don't realize about open source projects, it's not as easy as just copy and pasting lines of code. There is much more to it, specifically the level of expertise and intimate knowledge of that code, how to fix issues, what every line means, etc. We all know how Google and Amazon works, we have their full blueprints, business model, structure, everything. Yet it's nearly impossible to replicate. It isn't about just having the bricks and blueprints to build something, it's about knowing how to do it and understanding how to adapt to variables in design, how to modify as it needs, and how to constantly improve. Anyone can copy an open source project and think it's just as good, or change small things like coin supply, block size, add a privacy feature, launch a blockchain from their desktop, but if you have something, anything on the line with the success of that project. It's best to work with those who know what they are doing.

[17-Aug-18 12:04 PM] Regnar#6164
I mean, it doesn't need to be an official thing, but it could be useful for us to get an official Komodo account on PirateBay to host BarterDEX. That way when people download it they can trust the version they get from the Komodo account?

as opposed to just downloading it from some random person hosting it.


[17-Aug-18 12:07 PM] Regnar#6164
And then we just update it with the newest versions as they come out. I'm not sure how effective it would be at bypassing censors seeing as they likely block piratebay, but there are dozens of PB mirror sites that can get by. And I'm sure if a country tries to crack down on downloading this type of stuff they'd likely start by cracking down on github, and crypto sites like Komodo

Censorship of GitHub
GitHub has been the target of censorship from governments using methods ranging from local Internet service provider blocks, intermediary blocking using methods such as DNS hijacking and man-in-the-middle attacks, and denial-of-service attacks on GitHub's servers from countri...

For torrent not necessarily meed any specific website login. Only tracker is enough and a .torrent file or magenet link.

I also expressed to team to consider our website on Tor and I2P network like Zcash has, since we are a privacy concerned project.


[17-Aug-18 02:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also a good idea to highlight somewhere on website and other places that cypherpunks can also connect with us on Martix Network, which is better than other chat, along with IRC bridged general channel.
Not sure if discord is still irc bridged. 🤔


[17-Aug-18 03:00 PM] Regnar#6164
yes, I agree with all this. I think being available through multiple avenues would be a great idea. having a p2p exchange, and privacy focused tech is great, but defeats the purpose if it's only available in a centralized location.


[17-Aug-18 03:03 PM] Regnar#6164
I think it is also probably a good idea for us to be the one's who starts the seeding on some main sites as we can build a reliable base. instead of downloading original from an unknown that may or may not have code changes and be malicious, having a Komodo platform that releases the updates would be the safest for users. Though I'm not sure if changes can be made to it and still "seed" it as the original? that might be a security concern we may have to address? If they can't modify the code and still seed it as the original then it shouldn't be a problem.


[17-Aug-18 03:04 PM] Regnar#6164
providing magnet link might be enough

For me good marketing is education. And education you always start with most simple message and then you split into more and more details topics. This way it is clear and logic, attractive and easy to deal with mind.


[18-Aug-18 02:52 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Maybe even shorter would be "KMD already got what NEO, Verge, Eth, Dash dreams about" -> massive CMC or google ad (directing to bitttrex KMD sale point? maybe even deal with bittrex to double chain efforts) with that on fine keywords  -> wait 2nd marketcap :trollface:


[18-Aug-18 02:53 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
Before true ad campaing - just try 1 day (cheaper then full month or week) and see what happens. If make sense -> repeat for a month and see. Best when bear market is not so active.


[18-Aug-18 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
prices for advertising have not gone down due to bear market, but due to bear market it costs a lot more reserves. there are still many projects that raised tens of millions or hundreds and are spending like crazy on advertising.

[18-Aug-18 03:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
I guess specific targetting to the people you need, and not just the general investor (maybe keywords like "blockchain solution for your company" etc etc not the things normal people on reddit would google) could lower the price significantly and bring some partnerships or investors interest?

I was paying around 1 cent per view on my ad which was pretty broad, and got around 4000 affiliates who clicked, verified and used  some shitty exchange for $6000 or so.

If you target really specific keywords, then I'm guessing it wouldn't cost more than a few tenners a week, and may hit the target audience you wanted, though it might not as well LOL.

@jl777c  well in that case ads expensive if there is no gaps in good keywords.


[18-Aug-18 05:13 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
sometimes good agencies can find some gaps in targeting keywords that make ads cheaper, but on competitive market might be noe so many.


[18-Aug-18 05:15 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@PTYX proposals at least initial should be quite cheap - possible someone will have good proposals but not so much KMD - in that case he would be silent... better would be to limit proposals per account per blocks (if your intent is to reduce spam?)


[18-Aug-18 05:24 AM] PTYX#6840
I've been giving it some thought and initially I thought it would be simpler to just fork the dash dashboard but there are many factors that wouldn't fit to the Komodo ecosystem. We would need to come up with a proposal mechanism. In dash, you have master nodes with voting power and users can vote by vouching funds. It's all done through multisig so the funds can be returned if it falls through or if funds need to be re-allocated


[18-Aug-18 05:25 AM] PTYX#6840
Aside from the technical aspect of repurposing the dashboard, we would have to explore ways of encouraging voting and participation.


[18-Aug-18 05:26 AM] PTYX#6840
Maybe we can include notary nodes as entities with proposal Power..... Not sure yet


[18-Aug-18 05:42 AM] passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋#0622
@PTYX that sounds good Usable for many purposes not only crypto projects but any projects like on kickstarter.


[18-Aug-18 05:44 AM] PTYX#6840
Yes. My plan is to expand our faucet dashboard to include governance and marketing functions. I'll be exploring some options when I have more funding. In my eyes this type of governance is long overdue for Komodo.


[18-Aug-18 05:45 AM] PTYX#6840
I'll start by quoting how much work it would take to repurpose the existing tools.


[18-Aug-18 06:52 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm iffy on ads. I think we should (and we are currently doing this process) first establish what it is our goals and measure of successes are. This could be increase in price (not a great one imo) user adoption (as currency),  launch more dICOs, launch more ACs (businesses or projects), migrate tokens to KMD AC, etc. but find which segment we are best suited to cater to, is attractive for adoption and the ecosystem, and is an opportunity for growth in both users and developers. 

Only then should we re-position our branding, tech, and focus to cater to these solutions (not excluding the other segments) and then find out the best way to target advertisement and marketing towards actual segments. For example, ad space on an exchange landing page could help traders buy KMD and increase price, but if our target segment is say, AC migration, we would be much better off spending money sending reps to coin meetups where other dev teams will be there in person.


[18-Aug-18 06:59 AM] Regnar#6164
Based on a focused plan and target segment we should be able to actually measure the cost of every increase in our metrics when measuring our success. For example, a $5000 ad on CMC may show us click through and we can try to associate it to a measurable increase in say "user adoption" or price, but that would be a reach of an argument. On the other hand $5000 for a table and airfare + hotel at a blockchain conference in which we get a commitment from an erc20 token to migrate to Komodo, or a business that wants to use an AC to build an audit/notary base. Would be measurable to split those costs.

It comes down to what we WANT to accomplish, as in the main goal we want to focus on or problem we are trying to solve, the segment that is having those problems, and how do we get in front of them to show our solutions. The measure of success isn't always shown in price either, but increased network effect and ecosystem breadth can lead to greater prices later.

[18-Aug-18 07:01 AM] Regnar#6164
But again, this is what is being done. It takes time and rebranding isn't easy. It's also important to realize that if we (as individual investors) are not the target segment, our avenues likely won't see the marketing efforts targeted towards that segment. unless we look for it, or someone shows us

China has released its new cryptocurrency ratings index, featuring a big surprise in the top three. EOS, Ethereum, NEO and Stellar are all holding on strong to the number 1, 2, 5 and 6 positions, which they earned last month as well. Bitcoin jumped in the rankings. It now hol...

To activete community even more: got an idea of  a crypto investments manifest: Buy, Hodl, Add Value. As it totally make sense for all hodlers to make at least any action to increase their holdings value. Can we use that slogan? What I mean by add value (could be deifned by community leaders) is example download app, install it, try it, let us know your experience on reddit and bitcointalk. This way KMD gets testing + small organic marketing (people writing about their tests) AND investors increase value of their holdings. So do you think we can create a new fashion in crypto to move from "Buy and hodl" to "Buy, Hodl, Add VAlue" ? 😃

Plus for good descriptions, valid bugs found some tipping budget could be set, so that some people will get rewarded, and more people will be motivated to involve. So some small comitee needed to receive emails and judge posts on reddit and bitcointalk?

So like we have AMA Mondays,  Friday Bullets, can we add some "Hodlers Add Value Wedsnedays" ?

VIT is an ERC20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain, which presently can handle about 15 transactions per second.

I was thinking instead of focusing on exchange listings based on volume, it could be better to focus on exchanges in areas of the world where we don't have as big a presence, but the exchanges have their local Fiat support.

I only have this free sample right now, and we might have a better one but it looks like France traffic is up 41%, Netherlands 15%, and UK 27%. So it might be beneficial to look at exchanges that are located in these regions and request listings

Brazil has 13 exchanges on that site totaling 572 BTC daily volume.

trying to figure out what countries are checking out Komodo website and then target exchanges in those countries with their local currencies. If the French are interested in Komodo and have to use chinese exchanges that's just more barriers.


[21-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea exchange volumes are often wash trading, that's the reality of having tens of thousands of exchanges across the world, and that's a good reason to not chase exchange volumes, but the location of the exchange and local fiat support is a much better targeting method when it comes to finding interested investors. My inclusion of trade volume above is not to say it's all organic volume, its definitely organic mixed with washing or simply all washing, but that's still a better chance than the exchanges with 0 volume in those areas.

here's a suggestion for marketing and SEO.
Please focus on keyword CryptoCondition.
make as much #CryptoCondition hash tag posts and articles referring to Komodo Platform.
Since Komodo Platform is the 1st one to have #CryptoConditions working on a live blockchain, we should popup first in result whenever people actually start searching on the keyword CryptoConditions.
Another keyword of interest is "UTXO based Smart Contracts".
these 2 should be useful for Komodo Platform.

So just looked at CMC for Komodo and it has a get wallet button on the top right that redirects to Atomic Wallet, which doesn't support KMD. Anyone know how we can change this wallet direction to Komodoplatform.com or even any other wallet that actually supports KMD?


[22-Aug-18 04:51 AM] Regnar#6164
I can't access the email to contact Komodo team from that article, says Emailprotected?


[22-Aug-18 04:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
this looks like advertisement on CMC

<a href="https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/"> Here is KMD wallet</a>


[22-Aug-18 04:56 AM] CHMEX#0686
AtomicWallet most likely paid to get there on as it's the same link for all coins


[22-Aug-18 05:01 AM] CHMEX#0686
actually it looks like advertisement for an ico that will do atomic swaps


[22-Aug-18 05:59 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
it's an ad


[22-Aug-18 05:59 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
atomicwallet has some sleazy marketing


[22-Aug-18 05:59 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
they use atomic swaps only for a few coins, based on Decred AS tech


[22-Aug-18 05:59 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
but with that name they make user think it's all atomic swaps

manners are not techniques, but minds. technology-only manners will not only reveal the bottom in a few minutes, but also allow the other person to feel it. what I learned from speaking to a number of companies is that people with true manners survive through.

[23-Aug-18 05:46 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
how Komodo would appear on this charts? How many nodes run the 20k tps test?


[23-Aug-18 05:52 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
This could be reused after the 1million tps test


[23-Aug-18 05:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
The question is what they mean with # of nodes


[23-Aug-18 05:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
# of nodes needed for the test, or # of nodes as a measure of decentralization?


[23-Aug-18 05:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
In case of the latter in real world utilization the # of nodes would be immense

(I think?)


[23-Aug-18 05:57 AM] KomodoWorld#8282

In which case KMD would be as far upper right as it could possibly be? 😄

yes at scale with real usage it should be in the upper right

[23-Aug-18 06:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Otherwise just for the 1M TPS test, it's at least 1048 nodes, one for each chain?


[23-Aug-18 06:04 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
yes, but I think a chain needs at least 2 nodes, so 2096 nodes

16384 nodes is 16384 komodod binaries. You need at least 2 one to send transactions and one to mine, although in the real world it would require more, come to think of it, for the notarizations it needs at least 3 nodes per chain, but it depends how you want to define it, as I am doing 64 chains (64 komodod binaries) on a single notary server, so is a server a node or the software a node?


[23-Aug-18 04:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think for technical reasons each chain having 3 nodes minimum to work would be the best way to describe it.


[23-Aug-18 04:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
That allows all chains in the cluster to talk to each other as a single chain.


[23-Aug-18 07:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <n2okpride:matrix.org> I believe Zilliqa is measuing nodes in actual EC2 instances.


[23-Aug-18 07:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <n2okpride:matrix.org> I think we need to do a very indepth competitive analysis against the other projects in the scaling race, and their scaling methods. I'd like to be able to make an accurate like-for-like comparison, and avoid having holes be poked in our stories at a technical level.

Regarding rebranding - maybe I'm wrong but I believe communication strategy more important, so if you do rebranding, but no big change in communication strategy or just marketing strategy then I do not expect big impact.

Creating new messaging will def be a part of the rebrand

yeah the rebrand is a large scale process that involves a lot more than new visuals. If it was only about visual appeal the rebrand would be done already 😃

@Seko  No official decisions have been made but we will probably be keeping the same name (or at least the "Komodo" part of it, the word "platform" is still on the table since we want to differentiate ourselves from all the other projects calling themselves platforms)``` 

I really don't get why we would want to change the name from Komodo... ? 

Is there some way to for KMD holders to vote on this, similar to NN elections


[24-Aug-18 07:10 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I can't even tell you how many people have asked me about komodo completely rebranding and starting new coin, similar to BTCD -> KMD and I feel like everyone who I've talked to is taking it in a bad way...


[24-Aug-18 07:11 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I understand changing the logo, or colors/text,  but changing the name of the entire project is a bit dramatic

@xRobeSx , as Daniel said rename is unlikely, it would only make sense if the new name would make a lot of sense, i.e. a brilliant name that fits the rebrand.

I agree that changing the name just for the sake of it is a bad idea.


[24-Aug-18 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
In several cases, name change for sake of name change has hurt things significantly


[24-Aug-18 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
everything is on the table, but it needs to meet some sanity test requirements and any change of "komodo" name itself brings the risk of this, so by default all rebrands that retain "komodo" have less risk.


[24-Aug-18 08:07 AM] dan.#2473
if its considered there should likely be tons of stats/unbiased surveys to back up data. it's less about the name, but more about what people currently think when they think komodo. If achieving the goal is more likely/easier with a new name, that might be a better choice than trying to rebrand with the komodo name. Personally I don't really care one way or the other, but every single person in this discord is likely bias and likes the name komodo, as we all made our way here so something about it compelled us


[24-Aug-18 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
since most everybody says the problem with komodo marketing is that nobody has heard of it, there seems to be not much gained by changing the name itself


[24-Aug-18 08:09 AM] dan.#2473
could be correct, I think it would be worth it for the agency to get some data to back that up

Hey all! glad to see we won against Scroll in that twitter contest and it'll be onto the next one as soon as it's posted, but it has me thinking that Scroll may be a good project to reach out for coin migration to KMD. Currently it's erc20 but they seem to be using something they call a "hypernode protocol" which if I'm reading the white paper correctly, is a way to prioritize their traffic on Ethereum and increase the number "payments" in a tx. though I'm using our terms "payments" and "tx's" but I think it's very similar to how we can include multiple payments in a tx. 

Anyway, what are your thoughts on seeing if they would be interested in launching on KMD instead?

"We’re not Ethereum based, we’re providing the solution on a different network. The consensus mechanism is a fraction of what we intend to do, it is how we prioritize file traffic. Ultimately we want to replace relational databases, that is is long term objective but in the short term we are a new database option for businesses and offer new storage options for consumers. The vision is to get the 3rd party out of your data and give you back the ownership of all of your information."

though a decentralized, cc driven version of this game would be awesome! https://www.bustabit.com/ I'd imagine the cc outcome is determined by the outcome of the "crash" machine, and having it all with micro transactions would be cool. however, I think the game would likely need a pool of money since everyone could technically "win" a game.

Hi..have you considered publishing KMD core tech about dPoW to a scientific journal?


[28-Aug-18 03:49 PM] shnu#0359
say IEEE..


[28-Aug-18 04:10 PM] Mylo#8306
can you link to specific publications please?   we have a maths paper on decentralized poker, shuffling etc.  which may be more suitable.   relating to  dPoW, i recently came across a comment with links to stats on the energy use for gold mining and how the inference made was that gold currently uses much more (2x-4x is being conservative) electricity than bitcoin alone.  if this is true and dPoW is used to secure an ecosystem of chains and contracts, it's v.v.v.v efficient for what it does (imo).

Has anyone done a focus group on the name Komodo and gotten some actual feedback or are the name haters just using their feels to make decisions. I still contend there is nothing wrong with the name. Ethereum, eth is a horrible name. Stellar, Neo,  Tron, Dash, Steem, Waves, these are all stupid names. Whereas XRP, EOS, and other abreviated names, are not necessarily awesome names, but fit better then silly new age names. In that regard just KMD ain't too bad.

Here is SEND platform listing form. It seems like they link a crypto wallet to various social media accounts so you can send funds directly to someone's social media account. Says registration is free, though there may be a listing fee. Admittedly Cryptodude in Telegram found this and told me about it earlier but I kinda dropped the ball on passing the information along, my bad. Schedule had been hectic. Anyway, it seems like it would be a cool/simple feature. Thoughts?

It's obviously a much smaller platform than we generally want, but it is worth exploring since they are attempting to do something we aren't developing native. unless we plan to do that too haha

Hi.. have you thought about naming the different code releases/major updates/roadmaps? People usually remember names better than v0.x.x.x

about a year ago, not quite that long, not sure. we had to buy a bunch of the binance coins to get the listing

top coins and real projects dont necessarily have to pay the retail price. ERC20 vapor projects likely need to pay more

@Daniel CP, That seems logical, though what is your perceived value as to the exchanges that offer listings for free vs the ones who want .25 million. For whatever reason, free never appears as valuable as those who charge. Maybe the solution is to value listing on the barterdex at some really high number. Then offer discounts because you can always lower your price. Any money gained would go to... liquidity providers, or bounties, etc.

"The Microsoft Network failed because it was just one more walled garden. One that was walled-off in two ways. One was from a business standpoint, of trying to keep users locked into it and locked off from the rest of the world. But the other was the technical standpoint. It wanted to make it look like the Network was something you had control over, something you could interact with just like you could with your own data. And it was a lovely idea, but that's all it ever was. The thing itself was never more than a facade. Meanwhile those Internet nerds were off pasting hyperlinks around, doing wreckless things like setting up their own email addresses and adding new things to the network without having to ask anyone first. And despite The Microsoft Network making every object look so real on the outside that you could just squeeze it and watch the AddRefs ooze out, the Web's simple idea of giving every thing a unique readable location won by a mile. It wasn't the Object Oriented dream we might have hoped for, but Open Always Wins."

Don't sell yourself short jl777, $50,000 per line is a small price to pay for sexy code. Just think of the deals these early adapters are getting, $50,000 per line of the best DEX code for the low cost of Free. Act now and you'll get not one but two extra lines of code comments each valued at $10,000. Offer not found in stores. Call now.


[30-Aug-18 09:40 AM] Regnar#6164
ha yea I understand your point Joe, and with some specific marketing it may work well. I am thinking that if we charge for listings, teams are forced to prioritize their funds which could take us out of the running for them. The listing fees themselves I don't think are much of a priority for Komodo as much as getting liquidity through the DEX where we generate dex fees from.


[30-Aug-18 09:42 AM] Regnar#6164
My thought a while back and still think it would be better suited for MM2, would be to make a form on our website with those basic requirements jl just listed, plus a few more like contact information for an actual team member (if we have problems with their stuff) and some of the Icon work and social media contact info. This way it's crazy easy to list (just fill it out) and we make joint social media announcements with each new coin to help spread awareness of Komodo and the DEX.


[30-Aug-18 09:45 AM] Regnar#6164
This additional contact info can also be used for us to reach out to them and request they provide LP's if they can.


[30-Aug-18 09:52 AM] Regnar#6164
Some additional products could be creating Agama and BarterDEX like white labels, and selling customized team skins for projects when they list. like if Xcoin submits for a listing, we could reach out and say we're listing on the DEX for free (and maybe OUR version of Agama) but we could also say we can customize a Xcoin themed skin Agama for a price, and maybe even an Xcoin themed BarterDEX skin. Something like when if they wanted the multicoin wallet with their theme, we basically have it so on opening it has Agama Logo and Xcoin logo and maybe some of their colors (they provide hex#), and it loads up with Xcoin, Komodo, and Bitcoin or something at start, has Jumblr feature built in, etc. 
That way they can get their coin users to download and use it, explore Jumblr, BarterDEX, Agama etc without feeling like they are pushing Komodo products on their users, we instead use BarterDEX, Agama, Jumblr as features and independent brands. It feels more in-house, and not "Komodo" but really it's all running on Komodo engines.

I personally think it would be a great feature in Agama. A little mail box in the corner, and it's really just a wallet that views all the messages that were sent to your address.


[31-Aug-18 06:56 PM] Chipmoon#7477
It would be great for all projects , I'll say 😄 , The main issue  is I think to make it easy to use.


[31-Aug-18 06:59 PM] Regnar#6164
yea a great feature of KMD AC too, seeing as they all have shared addresses, you could easily send messages to whales and ask if they want to be liquidity providers, warn addresses that accidentally fork off, make a community game like smart contract locked riddles posted on a message board, the right answer is the key to the wallet lol

[31-Aug-18 10:39 PM] Regnar#6164
Just to give everyone in here the heads up, Gordon Komodo and I just spent the past 3 hours creating a completely custom Seed phrase. We've been contacting various KMD AC projects and searching their pages/documents/information to find a word to use for part of the seed. Each word doesn't have to be/or isn't at all related to crypto or even Komodo (this was so normal words could be used and not easily guessed/brute forced with Komodo key words). and we have some directions to find the word in the resources. something like "Bitcoin/bible/48th word"  which could be interpreted as the 48th word of the Bitcoin White Paper. easy. But not all will be that easy.

We've also gotten commitments from two projects so far to donate coins to the seed wallet which should really up the pot. We are waiting on a few other projects as well and because there is some decent coinage here we did NOT want to make this TOO easy. We are still working out the clues/directions to see if they are too easy/hard but that will be determined later. 

The words locations are picked strategically to get as many eyes on Komodo tech, resources, the AC's, channels, etc. 

Ideally we think that before this goes live we can create some simple posters, and tease the wallet balance on twitter as a "Seed Scavenger Hunt" or something. We were going to do riddles, But this seems like a better way because the winner just needs to be able to interpret the clues, find the location, and find the word. It would probably be much better to have the official twitter blast this out when it's time so that we get it out to as many people as possible as fast as possible. Another criteria we were thinking was to release the first 6 clues immediately, and when retweets hit a certain point, we release the rest. this way we create an incentive for contestants to actually spread the word. 


Thoughts?

[31-Aug-18 10:43 PM] Regnar#6164
Another thought was to add a 13th word/string as a safety so that the first person to show the correct seed gets the 13th word to get into the wallet, that way when there isn't a bunch of people snagging coins with the same seed when they are trying to move them out. OR we just let it be a free for all lol


[31-Aug-18 10:44 PM] Regnar#6164
No idea right now tbh. we have two commitments which is much more than I thought we'd get just asking, especially because a lot of people are sleeping haha

It might be a good idea to have a much longer seed phrase, like the true seed be 24-36 words, and we just give out the first 12 as clues


[31-Aug-18 10:49 PM] Regnar#6164
just so if the person decides they don't feel like moving all these coins haha they will be safe in the wallet

Much appreciated jl


[01-Sep-18 07:18 AM] Regnar#6164
So if I'm reading this right, I should be looking for the "notarized hash" in the "btc_txid"?


[01-Sep-18 08:15 AM] Regnar#6164
So looks like we have commits for 6 different types of coins to be in the custom seed! should be a lot of fun :D
I think because of the variability in the wallets required (PIRATE needs z address and full node, and Verus isn't in KMD agama, but only Verus Agama) it will be very difficult for the first person to solve all the clues to move all the coins to a safe wallet before someone snatches part of the prize.

This could be part of the game, or we go with a winner takes all style. And this would have us build an actual 24-36 word seed, and only release the first 12 words. the person who finds the first 12 words of the seed and tells us, will receive the rest of the seed and can take their time removing coins or w.e.

Thoughts?


[01-Sep-18 08:57 AM] jspook16#3059
i would think that a person that believes they have solved it would keep the "seed" private (to themselves), try to login and see if it is the correct one without it going public.  Or am i missing something


[01-Sep-18 08:57 AM] jspook16#3059
we  would know the riddle was solved when the funds move


[01-Sep-18 08:58 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea that was the original idea


[01-Sep-18 09:00 AM] Regnar#6164
I think the problem is that there are a lot of different coins, and they aren't all supported in Agama. So it would be hard to move all the coins out of the exposed address quickly. so for example PIRATE has been chipped in, but that coin ONLY works in Z addresses and needs a full blockchain download. Which makes it not easy to access that wallet. So while multiple people may solve the seed, and the fastest starts removing coins, they may not get all the coins because someone else might take PIRATE, or Verus (which is in a different version of Agama)


[01-Sep-18 09:01 AM] Regnar#6164
Then again that could be the point. that there can be multiple winners and the fastest wins


[01-Sep-18 09:01 AM] Regnar#6164
or we do winner takes all


[01-Sep-18 09:04 AM] Regnar#6164
It's included as part of the fun. Not because it has any value


[01-Sep-18 09:04 AM] jspook16#3059
I think having multiple winners can be good for the following reasons. If person A solves the riddle, he is now on time crunch to move the different coins using the different wallets. So solving it does not gaurantee all (or any for that matter) coins and the urgency usually leads to quickly learning to do something that you might not be familiar with


[01-Sep-18 09:04 AM] Regnar#6164
yea I kinda agree jspook


[01-Sep-18 09:05 AM] Regnar#6164
plus it is less effort on our part, I don't have to monitor my twitter and find the first person to send me a message, verify the seed, etc


[01-Sep-18 09:06 AM] Regnar#6164
@Chipmoon  what do you think?


[01-Sep-18 09:07 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah its "less" controlled by you guys too. If a person is serious about it, when the address goes public, they would get familiar with the different wallets needed based on the coins in the address. Just my thoughts


[01-Sep-18 09:07 AM] Chipmoon#7477
that will be easier on our part


[01-Sep-18 09:08 AM] jspook16#3059
I think thats where the real value is, getting people to interact with the different wallets and actually make z transactions if they have to.


[01-Sep-18 09:09 AM] jspook16#3059
Either way its a really good idea


[01-Sep-18 09:10 AM] jspook16#3059
Maybe in the future, a cc contract and some AI can take the human factor out of creating the seed. (Basically an AI created riddle)

at least this way.


[01-Sep-18 09:11 AM] jspook16#3059
yeah you have to put it together then test to make sure it can be solved im guessing


[01-Sep-18 09:12 AM] Regnar#6164
We are picking words that force people to look through information about komodo, apps, AC, whitepapers, blogs, pretty much anything. and are really creative in picking the words. It's not as easy as "Komodo uses what mining algo" or anything. There is some effort, which is why I think fastest wins


[01-Sep-18 09:13 AM] Regnar#6164
and then having to make directions to find what is oftentimes a normal word, and then figure out how to make it a bit trickier while still solveable


[01-Sep-18 09:13 AM] jspook16#3059

Why we have no listing fee at @krakenfx and no ads on @cryptowat_ch. Too many services perversely complicit, pimping their victim flow to obvious scams. Sucker liquidity providers. Our clients’ welfare is not for sale. https://t.co/seEjGCGLVb

If $BTC is a #honeybadger

Then $KMD is a KOMODO DRAGON 🐉. A lizard evolved to hunt patiently of prey much bigger than itself. @KomodoPlatform got a lot more fascinating lizard family tech too. 😁😎☠️

The seed words are hidden in various Komodo/Asset chains/friendly forks in apps, articles, pages, papers, etc and the clues for each seed word will direct people to different projects to search for the right word. Some words are only found by searching through an app or apps or maybe a reddit post by Komodo, or even some past twitter posts etc. It's a scavenger hunt, meant to get people to explore Komodo tech and not just like/retweet with the hopes of winning some money.

just an idea for something fun - lottery, with smart contract if somebody up to it. We can make a simple lottery which will draw random address to distribute to once a week or a month. To participate , deposit 1 kmd ( or less or more)  for 1 chance to get pick. what do you think?


[06-Sep-18 08:58 PM] Chipmoon#7477
Depending on the level of programming intricacy, to give incentive to developers,  maybe we can raise money where holders of lottery tokens will get percentage of the tickets sold.

Forget about dApps with no users, let's talk about tokens with no users.

Only 27 cryptocurrencies had over 400 active addresses today. Yes. 400 users.

You'd think if there was ever a time to 'buy the dip' or 'panic sell' it would be today. 🤷‍♂️

Hey marketing channel, especially @n2okpride @benohanlon  and @Bitcoin Benny I'm sure you remember Min-Liang Tan from Razer posting about looking for a blockchain platform to build upon that was especially good at high TPS and volume, if not, here's the tweet:
https://twitter.com/minliangtan/status/1021564383258759169

anyway, he posted an update about Razer E-Payment proposal for Singapore:
https://www.razer.com/sg-en/epayments-proposal

In particular pay note to "Accordingly, as we do not see any third-party consumer e-payment provider that is gaining traction, we plan to launch Razer Pay in Singapore by Q1 2019. "
https://www.facebook.com/notes/min-liang-tan/e-payments-proposal-singapore-an-update/2023698290983945/

Which indicates that they are in-fact likely to move forward with launching Razer Pay and I can't think of a truly better platform to launch on than Komodo. I'm hoping we can reach out in an official capacity and attempt to woo them to look at Komodo or build upon it. 

Not sure how many of our devs use Razer products but it would be a nice side note in addition to the obvious benefits our platform has. Figured this would be a good lead to reach out to, Min-Liang mentioned getting a lot of shoutouts about building on XRP but XRP is not nearly scalable to nationstate payment processing, nor should a nation share infrastructure and therefore be subjected to limitations simply because someone else on the channel is bigger than they are.

@sφldat they source active addresses from coinmetrics.io


[06-Sep-18 11:11 PM] Regnar#6164
"Active addresses data is sourced from Coinmetrics.io, which states: "Active addresses is the number of unique sending and receiving addresses participating in transactions on the given day." 

who I already reached out to a few weeks ago and was told:

"Since resources are limited, we are focusing on supporting larger projects first and working our way down the list. Komodo is on our 'nice to have' list - you're not the first that has asked for it so we're are definitely taking those requests into account."

I'd love to get their data on Komodo, they put out all their data in CSV which is great for messing around in R. If I could post pictures in here I'd show you some of the charts I've made recently haha


[06-Sep-18 11:14 PM] Regnar#6164
Though getting scaling test data may be tricky, I asked in the scaling channel what could be done, but the reality is the scaling data in CSV is likely going to just look like a regular single blockchain, that we just multiple a bunch of times. So charted wise won't be very cool... also the tx fees on KMD don't change as much as some other chains. but this is besides the point

I mean, that’s a good question as well.. More or less, I was wondering what’s the point of someone (like myself) investing hours into this infographic only for it to be rendered irrelevant when Komodo rebrands in the coming months? I imagine a rebrand as a complete overhaul btw, like when raiblocks rebranded to nano. Why have Komodo infographics when by years end Komodo could be called (whatever) is really what I’m getting at.

The long answer is that the infographic won't be rendered irrelevant, even after the rebrand


[07-Sep-18 03:01 AM] Daniel CP#2020
The rebrand will deal with things like colors, typeface, and the logo, but those are relatively easy to swap in and out once a graphic is complete


[07-Sep-18 03:01 AM] Daniel CP#2020
(the rebrand will also come up with new messaging, new product strategy, a new website, and other things, but the new visual identity is the important point here)


[07-Sep-18 03:02 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We want the infographic to be a visual explanation of the architecture of Komodo's tech, which isn't changing one bit. The infographic will remain useful far into the future


[07-Sep-18 03:06 AM] jorian#4555
i dont call that a rebrand. more a restyle. i thought we all agreed the marketing from komodo was lacking, but what you're saying now is that even with partnering up with Ideas by Nature, we don't get to see a change in marketing strategy?


[07-Sep-18 03:11 AM] Daniel CP#2020
What about it isn't a rebrand? Just because the name isn't changing?

[07-Sep-18 03:24 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Just some more info about the rebrand, since a lot of people have been asking about what exactly it will include. We don't have specifics or details yet but one of the major things we're trying to improve is the messaging. We want to find ways to talk about Komodo that are both easy to understand and really do justice to the magnitude of the tech itself. That's a hard task, as explaining Komodo is complicated. We are also working on the "user journey", which will help educate people about Komodo and guide them through our ecosystem in the way that makes the most sense. We also need to figure out what we want out CTA (call to action) to be, which is tough because it may be different things for different people. If you're a developer, we want you to build on Komodo. But even that isn't clear because devs can build in different ways (do we want devs to launch a blockchain? start coding smart contracts? building dApps? or something else??) If you're an entrepreneur or business leader, we want you to use Komodo tech but you can't build yourself so we would need the CTA to be contacting ChainZilla or Chainmakers. If you're a user, the CTA might be downloading Agama, downloading HypderDEX, buying KMD, etc. So we need to figure all of this out and really craft the messaging and website in a way that caters to everyone while also pursuing the goals we've decided help Komodo the most.

[07-Sep-18 03:30 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We're also working to establish a clear product strategy. This will, at some point, need to come with a legal business entity which will work closely with Komodo but still be separate. This is necessary for a few reasons. First, the legal entity will allow us to raise funds from investors and VCs. Second, it will help to build new partnerships and agreements with other projects, businesses, educational institutions, etc. Third, the legal entity will leverage the product strategy to develop revenue models, which will sustain the project well into the future.


[07-Sep-18 03:31 AM] Daniel CP#2020
And of course, once all of this happens, the marketing team will help promote the CTAs that support the product strategy and revenue streams


[07-Sep-18 03:32 AM] Daniel CP#2020
So lots and lots of stuff going on behind the scenes. The new visual identity is just the "front end" of the rebrand

@jorian crowdsourcing ideas doesn't always mean you have to use them verbatim. It's a seeding ground. Let me quote feverbee who are a good source of community ideas that I read regularly. 

"Crowdsourced competitions are widely misunderstood. Visit any major crowdsource effort and you will find only a tiny percentage of ideas are ever implemented. Most contributors don’t have the skill, knowledge of your products, or understand your company’s constraints well enough to develop a fully-formed idea. Worse yet, crowdsourcing efforts are rarely set up to accommodate truly groundbreaking ideas.

Browse the 550+ ideas implemented through Dell’s Ideastorm, is there really a game-changer in the bunch? Most ideas tinkered around the edges of old products. There aren’t any new smartphones, social networks, cryptocurrencies, machine learning, or breakthrough products here. Crowdsourced ideas often closely resemble a list of customer complaints (isn’t every complaint also an idea of what to improve?)

But the real benefit of crowdsourcing ideas and solutions extends beyond fully-formed ideas. It helps identify amazing talent to hire, new approaches to follow and to confirm or refute your existing thinking. You might not use an idea in its entirety, but you may learn from unique aspects of each idea.

Having a hundred, or even a thousand, fresh pair of eyes give their opinion on a problem more than pays for the relatively tiny fee to attract them in the first place." - https://www.feverbee.com/crowdsource/

So you asked what's the point? The point is to engage creatives and have them think about Komodo and identify great talent to hire, new approaches and to confirm/refute existing thinking.

yeah we indeed are doing a **rebrand** not a simple visual refresh (http://fabrikbrands.com/rebranding-vs-brand-refresh-whats-the-difference/)

Actually even a rebrand is an understatement. We are doing much more, rethinking everything and coming up with a grand plan & strategy for Komodo, from development, to business, to marketing. There are a lot of things to figure out before we can lay down the final marketing strategy for Komodo. The marketing comes last, and is affected by the business strategy, goals, and so on.

The big question is what Komodo is looking to achieve during the, let's say, next 10 years. What is the ultimate goal and vision? Is all we do alligned with that vision? Are we focusing on the right things today to get there? How do we track our progress and measure success?

Hi, 
What is the official way to write cryptoconditions?
"Crypto-Conditions"?
"CryptoConditions"?
"Crypto Conditions"?
etc...?


[07-Sep-18 07:25 AM] CrisF#3405
And is "CC" the official abreviation?


[07-Sep-18 07:32 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I always say CryptoConditions but googling shows BigchainDB using both Crypto-Conditions in some places and Crypto Conditions in others. But it looks like Crypto-Conditions does seem to be the proper way as far as I can see. https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-01


[07-Sep-18 07:36 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi, @xRobeSx .  I've seen many variations too so was wondering if Komodo had an official version.  That link is very useful and I'll go with that.  Thank you!


[07-Sep-18 07:38 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Good points @CrisF I think its important we use the same spelling as other projects since Crypto-Conditions is a standard and not just for KMD

@jorian @Everything Tangle I just wanted to clarify the reasoning and logic behind the infographic bounty contest.  Could our team and/or Ideas by Nature produce this infographic? Absolutely. However, getting the design of an infographic isn’t the main goal of this bounty contest. The main goal is to educate people outside of our existing community and leverage their networks to promote increased awareness and growth. Although the bounty is open and shared within our own community, we’ve also identified finalists from bounty contests ran by other projects. We’re also reaching out to crypto agencies, research organizations, and freelance content contributors that might not be familiar with Komodo. We’ve also kept the guidelines open-ended and the resource material fairly dense, so it forces these content creators to really understand and learn our technology and vision. This will push them to creatively reinterpret the messaging in ways we might have thought of versus copy pasting and adding a stock image. Creating the infographic ourselves and only promoting it within our own community is like preaching into an echo chamber and can also be seen as biased. However, if people are seeing 10-30 different infographics all talking about KMD, it might entice people to really look into us and tell their friends if the messaging resonates. Our hopes are to introduce KMD to a whole new audience as well as reintroduce the new KMD to those who might have not stayed up to date. This bounty will serve as a pilot on how effective this sort of approach could be.

Bruce Fenton's chainstone labs/atlantic financial (he didn't clarify which) sold almost all of their ETH by March this year because he doesn't believe ETH will maintain dominance over their "killer app" which he says is tokens themselves. Likely meaning he believes another platform will move in to take hold of the "Token" market. In our case this would be the independent chain market, but as easily launched as a token on ETH or Waves. 
https://twitter.com/brucefenton/status/1038165837818068992

Bruce is a huge Atomic Swap fan but I haven't been able to get his attention unfortunately. Perhaps we can reach out in a more official capacity to turn him into an ally, or advocate of Komodo tech. He's also involved in the Ravencoin project which is already listed on BarterDEX engine. He is also a proponent of the tokenization of real world assets which I know has been of interest to many here in Komodo.

Our fund held ETH since the crowd sale

Sold almost all of it by March of this year

Main reasons:
- overall portfolio rebalancing
- concerns over scaling & immutability / central control

Tokens are the killer app of ETH & I don’t think it will maintain its market share...

'Crowdsourcing' is simply a PR scam. Nothing more. It is a shameful marketing practice which takes advantage of and manipulates naive people to invest their precious time, skills and resources without a reward or legal pay for their efforts. It is quite sickening that companies relentlessly and cluelesssly think this is ok. Offer a bounty, 50 naive people work their ass off, 1 or 2 get some 'reward', the rest get nothing.  It is a completely LAZY and unjust way to accomplish something.  Do your research, go through portfolios of designers then HIRE/CONTRACT a designer to do consistent good work.

No one is forced to participate in a bounty contest. People choose to do it, probably for a variety of reasons. Some may do it because they are creative and enjoy making visually captivating graphics. Others may be doing in hopes of winning the bounty. Others still may be strong supporters of Komodo and want to help promote the project.  I'm sure there are plenty of other motivations. But in no case is any one tricked or forced into making in infographic.

I read that paris-saint-german team wants to launch its own token. They partner with a firm called Socios that plans to tokenize soccer teams. Socios is partner for the technical part with a project called ChiliZ that wants to use Ethereum to build this tokenization platform for sport teams: https://twitter.com/chiliZ?s=09 
This seems another project going to migrate to KMD in due time. I'm still on vacation but try to shill when I return

So many friends are playing this fantasy "American" football league. I'm amazed at the level of dedication to this. 

It's got me thinking. How cool would it be if we started a "Komodo Fantasy League" asset chain. It could be a good opportunity to advertise Komodo brand, onboard new users, show off some crypto conditions, build team spirit, and gambling.
I'm betting that this could be mostly built from the existing CC rpc.
With oracle's it could take the shape of a crypto league, your chosen team of crypto vs another using metrics from say CMC to determine the winner. It could be any sport? The league could take the shape of anything goes, teams could be consisting of weather patterns, YouTube video game players, Trump tweets, stock markets, elections, comic book characters, etc, or even leagues vs other leagues.  
Just a fun seed I wanted to plant.

It wouldn’t be hard to make an esport betting platform right? Many people still using game skins to bet since they can’t directly use cash, but a decentralised betting platform with kmd (which already has value) would work right? 😮

Did I mention that it could be a K Pop fantasy league. Not sure if that is a thing. Yet!

Does it make sense for Komodo team to buy back its own KMD, as a campaign to show undervaluation?


[13-Sep-18 06:13 AM] DangerousFELLA#0674
@shnu why do buy back?it is cryptos & not buy back program..


[13-Sep-18 06:26 AM] shnu#0359
@DangerousFELLA 😃 is your argument that buy back can't be done in crypto?


[13-Sep-18 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
is it worth reducing the number of years of dPoW that can be funded?


[13-Sep-18 06:44 AM] shnu#0359
Fund it in KMD. Don't you see a rise in value for KMD?


[13-Sep-18 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, we can make a donation address for people to send in KMD for a buyback of KMD?


[13-Sep-18 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
to do that we would need to sell the KMD so we can buy it back


[13-Sep-18 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
also I dont expect a lot of donations would come in


[13-Sep-18 06:48 AM] shnu#0359
Why donations?


[13-Sep-18 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
we dont have any funds allocated for buybacks


[13-Sep-18 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
remember, KMD is an open source community, not a corporation


[13-Sep-18 06:49 AM] shnu#0359
So dPoW is funded by BTC?


[13-Sep-18 06:53 AM] shnu#0359
Open source community with a CEO/CTO/CMO.. 
In my opinion, Komodo Platform should fund dPoW through KMD.


[13-Sep-18 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
how to convince the bitcoin blockchain to accept KMD?


[13-Sep-18 06:56 AM] shnu#0359
Clearly, I have no idea.


[13-Sep-18 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
we notarize to the BTC blockchain, that requires bitcoin. there is no other way


[13-Sep-18 06:57 AM] shnu#0359
Is the cost in BTC fixed, to notarize?


[13-Sep-18 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC txfees are variable, remember last year?


[13-Sep-18 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
for now it is stable, but it can and has changed


[13-Sep-18 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
to me it is more important to have a longer dPoW reserves than to do some market support. If the market says the price is X, who am I to argue with it

@hvaminion @Bl0ckchain Notarizing to $BTC is very expensive. Why pay double, when kmd is already notarizing to btc? Notarizing to $KMD costs about 300kmd and 300 of the coin to be notarized yearly.

Focus Fire: Komodo (Part 1)
Think of Komodo as the crypto multiverse. Within Komodo, there can be an infinite number of “universes”, each with their own laws and conventions -- interdependent, yet very much independent at the same time.

"Fundamental CC Contracts" are the most basic forms of contracts which facilitates the 3rd party devs to build custom smart DApps with independent governance capabile blockchain, totally independent to @KomodoPlatform blockchain. No Strings Attached.

And later this "MultiGateWay" technology also adopted by @wavesplatform in their codebase. I'd say the best of MultiGateway tech ideas used in Waves made  it the better version of Proxy Tokens based DEX than SuperNET's MultiGateway. https://t.co/Lx7XGYaYMU

To clear further on "Fundamental CC Contracts", the purpose of these contracts is to allow developers to give most required basic functionalities of Smart Contracts which they can get just by issuing RPC commands instead of manually coding the smart contract for basic thin...

“An employer will pay wages in traditional fiat into a nominated treasury account, which receives the money and mints the stable coin. When the person receiving the payment wants to redeem the funds, the coin is ‘burnt’ and money is sent back in Australian dollars,” Hill said.

Hill said the new platform may allow employees to receive the funds in a split format — say, 90% stable coin and 10% Bitcoin — and they could then remit the Bitcoin component to family members overseas.

Security is, and has to be, the top of the list for any blockchain technology that hopes to last for any amount of time. Without security, no bells and whistles will compensate for rampant double-spending via 51% attacks and compromises in the integrity of data.

There is my infographic in the video :-) thx for using it


[24-Sep-18 02:18 AM] Lennart#9331
Question for the infographic contest: when i want to improve my proposal, should i delete and reupload the images in my original post? Or just attach the improved version in the comments thread?


[24-Sep-18 02:22 AM] benohanlon#7045
@LakshmiNaveen you can certainly participate. Create your own post on reddit and use the 'infographic contest' flair, then go to the master post that is stickied and link to your post. And let me know too and I'll include it in our master twitter thread here https://twitter.com/KomodoPlatform/status/1043563944227622912.


[24-Sep-18 02:22 AM] benohanlon#7045
@Lennart you should attach the improved version so we can see the improvements you've made.

@FishyGuts Let's hold off and let the team first consolidate answers first so we can distribute and maintain consistency in our answers across multiple submissions.

"let the team first consolidate answers first so we can distribute and maintain consistency in our answers across multiple submissions." 

This is what I was wondering or looking for.   Would be good for people to have a format to share.   This is big business... this isn't a listing on a new unheard of exchange 😃


[25-Sep-18 04:08 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@n2okpride understands what I was trying to get to.
Like,   Would you prefer one infographic to be shared?   All of them?   
Any blurbs about WHY they should add that people can copy paste?    
Make sure someone goes through the app first and can detail the response meticulously.

Hello mods, I was looking at the Reddit post concerning the submissions and feedback. I noticed a type, I think, since I was looking into the recommended fonts. Here's the post: 
```Recommended fonts: Monseratt, Roboto, Open Sans, Helvetica, or Arial```


Is that Montseratt with the missing'T' or are we talking about a different font?
I know it seems trivial, but I don't want to miss a single thing.
Thank you.


[25-Sep-18 05:23 PM] n2okpride#1967
We meant Montseratt. Thanks for pointing it out, we'll correct this on the master post

@benohanlon Hey, me again! Don't mean to be picky or annoying, but I was looking at the color palette and noticed there was some colors that are new and pretty much unseen on the main website. I'm probably just looking for reassurance here, but before implementing them on my infographic, I wanted to make sure that these were accurate and possibly being used for the "rebrand", so to speak. Here's the link I'm referring to: https://i.redd.it/7w49eqqt9fo11.png

Thank you.

[25-Sep-18 07:16 PM] Regnar#6164
@n2okpride those look like some of your colors. Can you comment?


[25-Sep-18 07:21 PM] benohanlon#7045
The colour palette is an interim set. @n2okpride put them together himself so I'm confident they're correct @MoldyLunchbox. It's always good to check though 🙏🏻


[25-Sep-18 07:23 PM] Regnar#6164

@benohanlon Thanks, Benohanlon!


[25-Sep-18 08:03 PM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
Alright, more questions! I'm trying to color the logo (the octogon) but we don't have a reference for the new logo using the new color palette. I know you guys want to distance yourself from the yellow and orange, so I'm guessing they'll be dropped. Are you looking to have the infographic contestants try to implement the new color palette into the logo's original shape, or do you guys have one already made with the new color scheme?

Thanks for the info!


[25-Sep-18 08:17 PM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
More precisely, I'm talking about how your old logo has very matching and appropriate color schemes. With the new ones, we're looking at something like this: https://imgur.com/a/IpN0BKn

[25-Sep-18 08:18 PM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
I'm sure you guys already have an idea of which color goes where, and that would help tremendously as it would eliminate the guess work. Thank you.

It likely won't make a huge difference based on their coins they list etc. but it could set a positive precedent for other exchanges to look for the dPoW notarization to validate deposits.

@jl777c  I;ve seen you got pretty valuable account on steemit ! 😃 Not used for some time, maybe could be used for marketing purposes on steem (supporting KMD articles with Steem Power or sth) ? I believe many people on steemit are into cryptocurrencies (if not most) so that seems a good target media, at least oto publish every KMD article also there.

Something that just occurred to me.  
The bitcoin vulnerability discovered last week, how many coins were hit by the bug and suffered losses?   All those coins are prime to be added to dPoW right now.   Some are probably still fixing the issue or dealing with hacks.


[28-Sep-18 01:50 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I have at least one coin I know of that would implement it ASAP.   Who should I talk to about that?

(we're in the middle of creating a new pricing structure for dPoW but we'd still love to bring more projects on board. Only thing is, it's a bit of a process to integrate a new project so it can't happen too quickly. Will take a few weeks at minimum before a new blockchain is getting notarized)

Hi guys! I've updated my infographic submission  and made a new post on reddit and included a link to the previous one. Is that ok? @SHossain @benohanlon ?


[01-Oct-18 03:54 PM] n2okpride#1967
@savandra I don't know if it's just me, but I don't see a link to the infographic, only a link to the icon set.

@Daniel CP sir good day can i still edit my post in reddit?


[02-Oct-18 04:10 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Technically, edits are not allowed past the deadline. The Komodo marketing team has already started reviewing submissions


[02-Oct-18 04:11 AM] Daniel CP#2020
With that said, a few very minor changes to text are OK


[02-Oct-18 04:11 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Major revisions are not allowed


[02-Oct-18 04:12 AM] Daniel CP#2020
But if you've noticed a typo or want to adjust the text a little bit, that's fine @jon008


[02-Oct-18 04:27 AM] jon008#5899
@Daniel CP ok sir thank you i made a post in reddit i hope team will consider thank you. i forgot to upload the image directly in reddit instead i upload it in imagebb and make a text post.


[02-Oct-18 04:49 AM] DesignBlock#0184
@Daniel CP can the edits be traced? Also I have notice many late submissions..


[02-Oct-18 04:50 AM] DesignBlock#0184
@Daniel CP oh yes, ive tried editing because of typo.. still original image appears on thumbnail picture..


[02-Oct-18 04:50 AM] Daniel CP#2020
@DesignBlock the submissions aren't late, they are just now being accepted and approved


[02-Oct-18 04:51 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We will download all submissions and save them locally. I will do this now


[02-Oct-18 04:51 AM] Daniel CP#2020
And those will be reviewed by the team


[02-Oct-18 04:51 AM] DesignBlock#0184
So the date reglecting on reddit in when the admins approve their post?


[02-Oct-18 04:51 AM] Daniel CP#2020
So if you've got changes to make, please make them now


[02-Oct-18 04:52 AM] DesignBlock#0184
@Daniel CP beware of major edits also, to be fair :)


[02-Oct-18 04:52 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We're handling it, don't worry too much about this


[02-Oct-18 04:52 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Just make your edits and we'll take care of the rest

Some feedback on the crypto class interview.  It’s cool to get exposure but I could barely understand a word of what they were asking.  Terrible quality of their mics and overall audio quality.  Would love to see a higher quality feature/interview for Komodo, would help it promote itself much more professionally.

Question regarding voting on the infographic contest


[05-Oct-18 05:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
You can vote on multiple designs?


[05-Oct-18 05:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Also I think M_eyse's design is added twice in the twitter thread?


[05-Oct-18 05:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
ah wait maybe first and second draft


[05-Oct-18 06:08 AM] xRobeSx#5136
there was a second one with updated KMD things. I sent in a PR to fix everything with Smart Contracts/Wallets

I didn't wanna bother with any more options, just fix the ones they have 😃


[05-Oct-18 06:24 AM] xRobeSx#5136
yesterday's one had Smart Contracts as the yellow in progress symbol, and no language for the contracts, but we have Crypto-Conditions now. Also it showed a red X for iOS and webwallet, but we have atomicwallet.com/wallet and Coinomi for iOS.

Andreas seems to care only about lightning network. Thats what he thinks will solve all the bottlenecks, and thus, is the only thing worth talking about innovation wise.


[09-Oct-18 06:10 AM] actionslacks#4072
I am a fan of his work, and his outlook on things


[09-Oct-18 06:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
He lacks the updates on the topics he says is not solved.
If he is not up-to-date on the subject that if anyone has solved it, his opinion on it doesn't mean that it's not solved.
I prefer to see the solution working in practice than just listening to his opinion.

He's a great speaker and influencer for Bitcoin community, and I respect his ways of dealing with cryptocurrency crowd.
But I don't like his way of discarding the fact without being assured if he's up to date on the subject and commenting it's not done/solved yet.

[10-Oct-18 07:09 AM] Meyse#0952
congrats to the five picked! so the nice graphics won. im wondering what your target group for the infographics is, cause all i see is huge blocks of text that no one is gonna read with nice graphics. i might sound like a sore loser, but just my opinion 😛

for the honourable mentions there will be some KMD also

[10-Oct-18 07:25 AM] benohanlon#7045
ultimately it's not my decision... we've picked the finalists and the community will vote on the final 5


[10-Oct-18 07:25 AM] benohanlon#7045
we've also got 3 honourable mentions


[10-Oct-18 07:27 AM] Meyse#0952
i was just wondering who you want to convince with the infographics that komodo is the bomb


[10-Oct-18 07:35 AM] benohanlon#7045
@Meyse we want to help people to better understand our architecture story and tech...

there's a recording on reddit in the main sticky post where we give feedback - you may find that insighful


[10-Oct-18 07:42 AM] Meyse#0952
i dont really understand the value in that. to me it would be obvious to try to onboard as many developers as possible (push them away from the ethereum is best bias) and to grow the ecosystem


[10-Oct-18 07:44 AM] benohanlon#7045
@Meyse that's certainly something we want to do 😃


[10-Oct-18 07:47 AM] Meyse#0952
to be blunt, i dont think these infographics will do that job. i might be wrong ofcourse


[10-Oct-18 07:52 AM] jon008#5899
for me it is nice to see lot of infographic contestant who participate in the contest. lot of them make their entry to be qualified and they tried hard to complete it in time of submission. i hope that we all recognize the time and effort of all contestant..

Hehe what a spoilt sport, sounds like NIH syndrome.

Consensus customization with crypto conditions allows for dApps to be built with access to all parts of the blockchain.

 - the block reward distribution (and probably fancy cryptonomics and governance) Mr Vlad probably dreams of
 - off chain data oracle ized to become part of consensus rules
 - utxo locking for stable coin gateways
 - tokenization of assets
 - instant payment channels, on chain, comparable with lightning network.  Also lockable and therefore exchangeable for other gateway coins, crypto or stable coin, tokenized asset or combinations.
 - fungibility between chains

This is only the beginning too!  Very flexible extensions to v1 and v2 blockchain tech.

Hey all.. ViisiitCoin will become a new coin that will be used to create a new marketing channel, so I guess, no better place to also send this message. There is an active bounty challenge going on for people that want to give feedback on the whitepaper of the ViisiitCoin. ViisiitCoin will become an assetchain of Komodo.

The whitepaper is a Google docs, and we cannot give the link to it away freely, so’ I’ll need to add you to the document through an e-mail if you’re interested.

for hash to be stable price must be stable. For price to be stable community must grow, because miners will not sell to same people everyday (same people have limited amounts), so new people are needed to sustain the network, otherwise all collapses. One can actually calculate at what rate members must grow in number daily (assuming avg BTC one have to spend), assuming amount of KMD or BTC needed to sustain mining/hashrate.

The original english whitepaper is good but almoust nothing about userinterfaces. I think many users want just a quick intro to get the basics an start then. What do you think?

@BrownCSDept @mpherlihy @ethereum @KomodoPlatform Basically, it allows sending a transaction to a cross blockchain, and it's not exactly an atomic swap. This is the base important part of Crypto-Conditions Smart Contracts which made it possible to solve Nothing-at-Stake pr...

Please be nice and congrats to fellow project devs, and let them know we have it already solved it in different architecture than ETH, and in any case can be of help if they think we could be of help.

What are your thoughts on Komodo?

- Independent blockchain creation.
- 51% attack resistance.
- Atomic swaps in use over 100,000 times.
- JL777 one of the most active lead devs I’ve seen.
- I think the project would fascinate you.

What would it take?

The CEO of DijitalPara INC is in our Marmara Chain Discord group. DijitalPara INC is the first and the only exchange in Turkey buying/selling Komodo. I may introduce the leaders and developers of all Komodo projects to him. It would be great to see coins/tokens of all Komodo projects in that exchange. I wish we could also create a gateway to exchange directly with turkish lira and maybe with post-dated cheques in lira/tokens. The following is the Marmara Chain Discord group. Thanks to all. https://discord.gg/8mBSKC7

Hi guys, next week I'll make some shirts for me, with some Komodo designs. I can send t-shirts to anyone who is interested in exchange for $ KMD or $ arrr. I can also customize them if there are any requests.
I will say the price when I know it, I will have to add the shipment. And I will also send photos to see how the shirts have been.
The first shipments can send me the coins once the T-shirts have been received (only for trusted people with whom I have spoken these months).

Thank you!

Citi Ventures Believes These Are The Next Disruptive Technologies
Innovation doesn’t always happen overnight. And it’s exactly the slow-changing technologies that tend to have the greatest long-term impact, according to a recent report by Citi Ventures.
https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/hn4TLqk8S0KpP6L9Ua7kzpXr9GwA3li2tjGoy4KFO7k/https/news.crunchbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/busy-robot-vector-id472290447-1.jpg


[21-Oct-18 07:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
When City Venture is looking for these futuristic technologies, it is said that over time it seeks "accelerating" and "irreversible" characteristics. To explain this to you, Uber was an example, and when she first used Uber a few years ago, her hands were full because he had a baby, and if he was a regular taxi, she would just leave the baby, open her bag, and come back to her wallet, and look. It seems like nothing, but users who have more comfortable experience can never go back to their previous uncomfortable experiences (=non-transferability), and once they have this experience, change is accelerated and the world is changing.

coindesk makes an article about @Geocold51 51% attack attempt and there is no mention of dPOW or KMD at all... Instead they prefer to shill Horizen who doesnt have anythign to do with the sotry.... please people... make this a public issue, let everyone know coindesk is editorializing in favor of their paid partners.

@bpkdasbaum Hi, we only track the core repo at this point. Tracking all repos would introduce a lot of noise from irrelevant repos being added.
Twitter


[26-Oct-18 02:06 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Any chance that the main repo can be changed from bdex on KMD site?


[26-Oct-18 02:07 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
And make a new repo that tracks the important current projects on KMD in one (sry but don't know how these github stuff works)


[26-Oct-18 02:08 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Then simply ask miso to replace the bdex with the real current kmd prjects


[26-Oct-18 02:24 PM] Audo#5667
I believe we are looking into a solution where we would track all of our repos ourselves on our website.


[26-Oct-18 02:24 PM] Regnar#6164
yea that's probably the easiest way.


[26-Oct-18 02:24 PM] Regnar#6164
cryptomiso probably does an API call to a single repo or something


[26-Oct-18 02:25 PM] Regnar#6164
doing multiple calls, and then compiling them by date would be possible, but probably a bit extra work for miso, as they'd have to do it for every coin they track


[26-Oct-18 02:26 PM] Regnar#6164
maybe afterwards we can just give cryptomiso access to our site tracking too


[26-Oct-18 02:26 PM] n2okpride#1967
Other coins most likely aren't in the same situation as us


[26-Oct-18 02:26 PM] Regnar#6164
yea maybe.


[26-Oct-18 02:26 PM] n2okpride#1967
we're exploring tracking this ourselves on our website update as Audo has mentioned


[26-Oct-18 02:27 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
cool thanks for the update, glad this is already being worked on 😃


[26-Oct-18 02:27 PM] n2okpride#1967
What's disappointing is that I've been promoting their site to analysts, influencers, and media in all of my briefings.

{Reactions}
💯 

[26-Oct-18 02:27 PM] n2okpride#1967
Can no longer do that considering the lack of accuracy.


[26-Oct-18 02:29 PM] Regnar#6164
yep, that is unfortunate. Their tracking shows decentralized ICOs which obviously isn't where work is done on anything else KMD besides dICOs


[26-Oct-18 02:33 PM] actionslacks#4072
It's a bit like comparing apples and oranges at this point. Considering all the new things going on here, we could start our own commit tracking just comparing projects within this ecosystem.


[26-Oct-18 02:37 PM] Regnar#6164
Or if we simply start our own git tracking, show what we are tracking and why, and how we compiled them all to get the end result. we can set the standard for other projects to show their own work


[26-Oct-18 02:41 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Setting new standards is always tricky, because it just adds another level. I was concerned originally that when people try to find and compare coins with high activity, and look at KMD, when on crypto miso it appears as if KMD is dead, although that's not the case. Ideally we'd have something that can be visible / shared on third party sites. So when people do compare to other projects, they see that KMD is active.


[26-Oct-18 02:42 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I see activity in general in high regard. Be it wallets, transactions or in this case github commits.


[26-Oct-18 02:43 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
I think more ppl do this and it would spark more interest from ppl who don't know the project yet, bring more ppl in


[26-Oct-18 02:45 PM] bpkdasbaum#4592
Only need to create visibility for it that can also be used by third party sites. If it was for example only on the kmd website, it would only reach ppl who are already interested in KMD and visit the site to find out more. But if we show up on comparison sites like blocktivity and also get high scores there, then this brings ppl in who haven't even looked into KMD yet


[26-Oct-18 02:47 PM] actionslacks#4072
as far as diy tracking we should also include all the outside projects using dpow


[26-Oct-18 02:48 PM] actionslacks#4072
I agree it would be nice to get an unbiased analysis from outside sites but I'm not gonna hold my breath

👆 when kmd address tracking


[26-Oct-18 03:11 PM] Regnar#6164
I was trying to indicate that if we track ourselves, and show exactly how/where we are tracking and why, we could see if third party sites will just mirror our tracking method.


[26-Oct-18 03:13 PM] Regnar#6164
Which means if we track a repo, we need to explain and show how that repo is related to KMD development. which right now a lot of KMD development is done through other Repos like Staked, KMDice, etc. and then there's also development that is technically third party but is on run time forks and can be brought back to KMD like Veruscoin (though this stuff shouldn't be tracked) it's a tricky situation but it's also the nature of a truly decentralized project. clarity is key


[26-Oct-18 03:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
I agree. sorry to insert my skepticism into the conversation. There are so many people doing so many things here that a complete and accurate analysis would be a task in itself. Which I think is wonderful.


[27-Oct-18 12:25 PM] Regnar#6164
Oh @actionslacks I didn't take your statement as skepticism, nor is it a bad thing if it was! haha skepticism is good in crypto! yea it's tough to get an accurate gauge of the development being done, or trusting self reporting, which is why I was saying we openly show what we are tracking and why, so others can verify it.

[06-Nov-18 09:22 AM] Regnar#6164
@grewalsatinder  I think it's a way of sending your transparent KMD to a Z address in common lot sizes to blend with other jumblr transactions. I've never used it, but I think it could be a way to atomic swap a non anon coin like BTC, for KMD (t address), then send it to a Z address in common lot sizes (100, 10) then send back to T addresses (multiple?) and atomic swap back to BTC. so you have the same end result of N Bitcoin but with no connection from the initial purchase, to the ending wallet? not sure though

[06-Nov-18 11:58 AM] Audo#5667
I am not sure what I can say and what not. We just had a meeting though. Things are progressing.

We do plan to keep the community updated, so sooner or later there will be a blog post that covers the current situation.

We have also worked out a quick content update to the website that includes new messaging. That's not really part of the rebrand, but a step to the right direction.


[06-Nov-18 12:47 PM] grumpygoron#4320
Hate to be this guy, but would love some actual timeframe rather than the “wait and see eventually” answers.  That’s been going on for nearly two years now.  I know the transition is new but for excitement, interest, and overall brand trust it’s good to have deadlines we can look forward to.

Crazy idea I had in mind : i imagined a promo video once scaling is done : a guy at home receiving his salary. Zooming on the amount and currency showing KMD. Then showing that guy paying for stuff with credit card : choose currency : KMD. Payment done. Then global zooming out : seeing the whole country : the user is now a pixel. But progressively others pixels shows up representing the whole population and a text showing : state transaction/s average : X.
Capacity of KMD tech chains : 1 million. 
Fade out with KMD animation showing up.

I can deliver it in Polish if materials in english will bw provided ;)

It’s a text outline.  For developers.  But managing assets can easily be included.  It’s only in planning stages.  The focus/polish on dev docs is also being worked on and must be completed more.  It is about 50% through first draft.  Maybe 2-3 more weeks til first draft.

[08-Nov-18 08:42 AM] Audo#5667
Hey guys, I'm looking for ideas. Let's think big for a moment... how do we *really* make Komodo succeed? In my mind we just must focus on building a large ecosystem. Here's what I am thinking: 

Our vision is to build an ecosystem.

To do that we need to empower developers and start-ups to build products using our technology. Thus we must understand what they need and then have all the solutions ready for them.

Here’s a list of what a developer or start-up might be looking for:

- get a high-level overview of what Komodo is about
- understand what he can build with the technology
- browse actual projects which use our technology
- access Komodo’s developer documentation & code examples
- learn more about blockchain & coding in general (courses)
- participate in networking opportunities: a forum to talk with other developers
- get capital for development
- have a platform to let the community know about the project he started
- provide updates about his progress
- share his experiences & frustrations through a blog & articles

Question  1: What is a developer or project looking for? What do they need?
Question 2: How do we build a scalable platform (not in a technical sense) that empowers the developer?


[08-Nov-18 08:44 AM] Audo#5667
what are all the components we need for this dragon to wake up? We have been discussing about launching a community news/blogging platform, and we have also been thinking how to use/leverage our forum more... how do we empower and activate the community members.

[08-Nov-18 09:31 AM] yorklab#7270
GUI, GUI, GUI.  Komodo is so diverse and goes through so many changes that creating a single GUI  for the entire exco system  will take some time. I think @grewalsatinder  library and education approach to attract new devs is a great idea, but that also will take time. In the meantime perhaps the team can come up with something that is very narrow in scope; start off with something basic. It doesn't matter what it is, as long as it's a GUI that performs a task that the rest of the crypto world says "Well, the best way to do that is with Komodo's (whatever the app is).  For instance: in parallel with the MM 2.O development someone also develop's a very basic BarterDEX GUI that can only trade BTC-KMD and KMD-BTC and nothing more to start with. If it's really easy to use it could create a lot of demand and of course more attention to Komodo. After writing this I realize this may not answer your specific questions, but it's something I've been thinking about.....A simple GUI that performs a simple task that people will use.

This project seems to do a pretty good job at attracting and even creating developers. The biggest hurdle is educating the prospective user. Most are easily lost, overwhelmed by the scope, or don't have the technical understanding to see the advantages. Pirate is easy because it just does one thing really well... privacy. The magic word for komodo is a little more elusive.

[11-Nov-18 05:58 PM] Regnar#6164
I would definitely like to get more dApps on board and then have some links to where to find them like what @Audo said with maybe some analytics too. I think we need to get more first of course. There's also stuff like this:
<https://dappsforbeginners.wordpress.com/>
which would be really helpful as well for people to build dApps using CC. 

Also the 3rd party ecosystem section here is loaded with projects that are building on KMD or working with us on things. There should eventually be a place for them as well so investors/developers can explore what's being built.


[11-Nov-18 06:13 PM] Regnar#6164
also @Audo I like this idea by Clovyr which has a smooth button focused way of building basic chains.
<https://clovyr.io/>
Which I imagine would have simple things like uploading an image, choose a name, and sliding bar for parameters of coin amount and premine. buttons to choose distribution method (dICO, ICO, AirDrop, mining) if you want mining halvings, and how long you want the chain to grow for (say 20 years, and it will auto calculate the block size needed). Tx fees, if you want a founders fee on transactions, privacy functions (zk snarks, starks, ring CT), choose mining algorithm (equihash, verushash, Proof of stake, others, or hybrid with a percent slider. A single click for dPoW protection, auto push updates (KMD updates are auto pushed to your chain), and selecting where you want to start your nodes/mining (have click options for various servers like AWS, other 3rd parties, or local machine), if you want Agama and BarterDEX integration, and whatever else will be modular. 

Then at the end it spits out a summary document showing all the relevant chain related highlights so other people can truly see what your chain is, as well as a hash of the chain document information and date of time, that we notarize to the KMD main chain channel to prove a chain exists in our ecosystem (just for the coolness and legitimacy sake, so someone can see a chain information and KNOW that there was a premine or w.e.)

And of course any of the additional services that actually cost money will need to be paid.

[11-Nov-18 07:12 PM] Regnar#6164
oh, an autoscale button! you add the option for autoscale, and anytime your chain starts to hit peak load it spawns up the scaling chain either locally, on AWS, or whatever else.

Hi folks, Looking at the new website, trying to get a feel for the intent before I post specific comments. Who is the primary target audience? It feels to be geared towards businesses (using words like customers, product etc), definitely a change from the previous 'to the masses' approach. 
Not voicing an opinion whether that is good or bad, trying to understand the intent 😃


[12-Nov-18 02:21 AM] jansako#3330
Here is one suggestion. If the team thinks it is valuable and would like more feedback, feel free to DM:
https://imgur.com/a/qvnym4Y

I think this (perfectly valid!) question should be asked in a one-on-one biz dev meeting, not on the website. The prospects come to the website seeking options/answers, not more questions. The idea is good, but the page should contain options as answers to the 'what you need' question (which it does).  The question itself should not be highlighted, is what I am saying.

Formulate the question the visitor is most likely to ask, then present the answer(s), not the question itself.

@jansako our main target audience is the developer / business who will be using and buildin with the technology. We had limited resources on what we could put to the current webiste. On the rebranded website we will have content for all audience types.


[12-Nov-18 04:48 AM] jansako#3330
@Audo, I think I just got too excited... the post about phase 4 rebranding mentioned feedback, I read it as 'asking for feedback', while it was really about the KMD team providing feedback 😃


[12-Nov-18 05:42 AM] Audo#5667
it's all good 👍 Feedback is always welcome.

We are looking for big ideas for the rebrand about how to really promote the Komodo *ecosystem*. Any ideas can be shared on this channel and we'll grap them from here


[12-Nov-18 05:50 AM] Lennart#9331
just one thought: I'm missing a bit the word "decentraliziation", since that is the driving factor for blockchains. I don't want people think of KMD to be similar to EOS, when they read high TPS, notary nodes (when they don't understand), they might think that this is at least "semi-centralized"


[12-Nov-18 05:51 AM] Lennart#9331
looking forward to what you guys come up with! 👌


[12-Nov-18 05:53 AM] Regnar#6164
@Audo I noticed that on the interim page we seem to have dropped off Privacy and Simplicity from the 5 pillars and replaced it with Adaptability. Was this intentional?


[12-Nov-18 05:56 AM] Audo#5667
@Lennart yes that's important for sure. We need to tell our story how we differ from the general purpose blockchain platforms (which a single chain / shared infrastructure) and the block producer platforms  such as EOS. Doing that so that everyone understand what we talk about is a challange for sure, but one of the goals of the rebrand.


[12-Nov-18 05:57 AM] Audo#5667
@Regnar yes, we used to have 5 technology pillars, but we changed them to be 4 technology pillars + 4 business pillars. Thus the privacy was dropt from the technology pillars.

Privacy is important pillar, so I would personally still consider adding it and having 5 technology pillars and 5 business pillars. What do you guys think?


[12-Nov-18 05:59 AM] Audo#5667
Simplicity was moved to the business pillars, which are:
 - Autonomy
 - Flexibility
 - Simplicity
 - Reliability


[12-Nov-18 06:02 AM] Audo#5667
We always felt the first three technology pillars were very strong: security, scalability, interoperability.

I like the new 'adaptability' pillar a lot as it covers Komodo's key strength, which is that each blockchain can be fully customized, even their consensus rules can be changed to develop powerful "smart contracts". In other words, we can say that with Komodo you can *launch special purpose blockchains versus getting fixed features on a general purpose blockchain platform*.


[12-Nov-18 06:18 AM] Regnar#6164
Also on the State of dApps site here:
<https://www.stateofthedapps.com/dapps>
You can break down the search into those that are still in concept phase and reach out to the teams making them to see if building on Komodo would be better suited for their needs. Also what types of resources, libraries, guides they need to make their projects work, or expect from a development platform

[12-Nov-18 07:38 PM] Deleted User#0000
I don't think the website needs much more or anything. When was the last time you went to Microsoft.com and gave an f what it looks like. If KMD is good, it's good enough to move up in this space. Right now it's a popularity contest. The projects can shift ranks at a drop of a hat. Komodo's tech is a great building, increasing blockchain and btc's foundation. The work can be seen as creative, robust, innovative and flat out cool as hell. Other projects focus a huge amount of time on partnerships, business, legalities, economics, and image. Resources get overdone, and freedom to create is hindered. Tensions build in a tight-fitted federation leaving the dev's tired and pressured. Komodo's move towards rebranding is a refreshment of personality. It gives more presence. It will attract those who have given into the hype and not artistry. There are two visions: one many use to make something likable, and the other few use to like something they make. Ok that was too long lol.

Re: new site. Looks clean. My minor critique, and this is a very subjective one, it seems very popular these days but I’ve grown tired of it (super long vertical pages).  I want to personally see the whole thing at a glance, at least as much as possible.


[13-Nov-18 09:09 AM] tolken#2655
The first thing I see (on mobile) is “Open-Source Infrastructure For An Interoperable Blockchain Ecosystem” in huge bold type. Is that what best describes Komodo? Seems like it describes many other projects.


[13-Nov-18 09:14 AM] tolken#2655
If I am still interested after that, I scroll down and see some icons without any key definitions. Nice icons but they don’t mean anything. Then a full screen listing  “scalability, security, interoperability, adaptability”


[13-Nov-18 09:15 AM] tolken#2655
Security “bitcoin level security” that’s sexy. I want to know more.


[13-Nov-18 09:17 AM] tolken#2655
Scalability “limitless scalability” slightly intrigued? Many claim scalability, maybe being slightly more specific, even if not entirely accurate, would be more informative. A theoretical near-term scalability as an example (like 1m tps)


[13-Nov-18 09:19 AM] tolken#2655
Interoperability: “seamless interoperability” using the word interoperability to describe interoperability, seems like there could be a more descriptive way to say this.


[13-Nov-18 09:20 AM] tolken#2655
Adaptability: “continuous development” I’d hope so!  Could we give some indication of how active the development is? Team size, team growth, github activity?


[13-Nov-18 09:22 AM] tolken#2655
I know these aren’t meant to be huge text bubbles, but at the same time this is of course the first thing people see. Making it as potent and concise as possible can help people get it. Regardless, nice work team, great to see progress!


[13-Nov-18 09:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@Acura Yeah I have their whitepaper


[13-Nov-18 09:41 AM] n2okpride#1967
@tolken  Just a reminder, this is an interim web refresh where the main goal was to get updated messaging and minor visual update. Full focus is now on the actual rebranded website where we're introducing a entirely new web experience and incorporating a re-hauled design.


[13-Nov-18 09:42 AM] n2okpride#1967
regarding the header - i agree we could add something stronger here. the challenge is that Komodo is complex, and it's hard to incorporate everything without sounding too high-level marketing speak. But we'll look into this.


[13-Nov-18 09:43 AM] tolken#2655
Certainly, just wanted to provide some personal feedback. I’ll let the experts parse what’s best to do 😃


[13-Nov-18 09:43 AM] n2okpride#1967
All feedback is useful for sure.


[13-Nov-18 09:44 AM] n2okpride#1967
we were purposefully keeping those initial descriptions vague as below is the CTA to go to the technology page, which expand on all 4 pillars in great details


[13-Nov-18 09:44 AM] n2okpride#1967
Looking at it now, it might not be apparent that the CTA below is tied to the pillars above


[13-Nov-18 09:45 AM] n2okpride#1967
we tried to get the tech related details for continuous development in, but that would impact launch so we're rolling that over to the rebranded site


[13-Nov-18 09:46 AM] n2okpride#1967
We're thinking of having a dedicated "proof points" section that would aggregate github commits, dedicated solutions and technology landing pages, a dev portal etc.


[13-Nov-18 09:47 AM] tolken#2655
Vague isn’t bad I suppose, but it seems the challenge is to ensure they’re interested to dig deeper. Also it’s important to consider that the website isn’t necessarily people’s first exposure to Komodo (maybe they hear word of mouth, or because of some awesome PR that comes from a successful 1m tps test :P), so it doesn’t have to say everything at once, but just lead them to what they’re looking for.


[13-Nov-18 09:48 AM] n2okpride#1967
right that was the goal


[13-Nov-18 09:49 AM] n2okpride#1967
We do have a few updates already planned for this interim site, but the majority of focus will now be on the rebrand.


[13-Nov-18 09:51 AM] n2okpride#1967
If there are any specific examples of things you've seen that you'd like to see in the new rebranded site, feel free to dm them to me. We're currently building out our requirements list to drive a new sitemap.

[13-Nov-18 12:11 PM] Regnar#6164
Just made me think of a cool visual to show scalability. It could be a chain with green orbs flying around in the link, and it gets more and more intense and then a second chain spawns out of it kind of like a DNA strand splitting. and now they both have green orbs flying around (but less intense) and some orbs flying between the chains, and when it gets more intense it splits again etc.


[13-Nov-18 12:13 PM] Regnar#6164
to show how when the transaction amount gets too large on a chain, a scaling chain spawns and handles some of the load, but the two chains are next to one another and transactions (the green orbs) can move between the chains

On our explorer we give this explanation about Komodo:

**What is Komodo?**

End-to-end Blockchain Solutions Provider empowering developers to build freely and participate in creating the largest open blockchain network.

Komodo Platform strives to accelerate the adoption of blockchain technologies around the globe and to lead the world in blockchain integration. All of the Komodo’s unique and cutting-edge technologies are open-source and available to everyone.

With a collaborative approach, rather than a competitive one, Komodo Platform is working to unite the blockchain industry, empower business leaders and entrepreneurs, and eliminate the need for centralized third parties in financial transactions.

"Komodo is an opensource blockchain, tool kit suite, and protocol that is used in the interconnected open blockchain network." 

My explanation in one sentence. I'm defining komodo in the scope of a larger umbrella network called IOBN in this instance. Just my 2¢

In other words we should properly define /name that overall network/forest/universe komodo is creating and use that to help define komodo

If $BCH devs are mindful and sneaky they can make $BCH network absolutely equally hash-strong to $BTC. It will be resistant to 51% attacks completely. Apply delayed Proof of Work on it. It's practically field test proven tech. Contact @KomodoPlatform

Using dPoW is the most cheapest way to secure itself against any current or future 51% attacks. I am pretty sure $KMD community will even fund your dPoW fee devs are willing to apply it to $BCH. A possibility of absolutely free 51% attack resistant $BCH.

I was just thinking a discord widget for the new Komodo site could be pretty cool, showing maybe the biggest/most visited channels (jl777, marketing, support, the github commits, and maybe other tech channels) so users visiting the site can see into the Discord to see what the content is like before joining up. could help lower any barriers to entry people have if they don't already have discord, and I'm sure our content here is quality enough that having a widget view (read only) will entice people to join.

Not sure if this works for this but it may:

if it were interactive too it would be great, like mousing over a point and can access it on github. I'm not sure what software was used to make the video, or if it would be something we can create/host on the website, it would make for a super cool center piece of the development section


[19-Nov-18 08:36 AM] Regnar#6164
Just tracking #feed-github shows like 25 commits in the past 24 hours alone. So it would be a quickly growing web.

I think that's an excellent opportunity tbh. We already talk about having nation state capabilities, and while that may not be as a currency, it is still a huge opportunity. Look at Factom, they will probably go for that one, but they have won some prior ones as well. So it's definitely an interesting shot. Assuming that Komodo wants to be involved in government in anyway.

Currently passports use rfid chips that have your personal info in it.  The idea is this in conjunction with their current method of swiping and comparing .  When the passport gets swiped the system sends a coin from host country / confederation account to visiting country  address with encrypted hash of the encrypted rfid chip info.   it provides a way of tracking . When a person enters and exits a country .

[19-Nov-18 04:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
its just a general idea,   im not sure of the low level aspects of blockchain for feasibility.   Another way of doing it, would be AssetsCC,  where each asset is just one token which corresponds to a passport,  tokens name can be the hash.

The standard use case gov sees for blockchain is tracking/verifying info. Hashing docs and storing them on a chain, or a variation of that. I'm willing to bet that will be the most common application type, and definitely one of the easiest or most useful. Depends again, if Komodo or one of the 3rd parties here wants to try and build something to pitch.

Yea but considering the proposals that solve certificate, license, attestations issues related to issuing and verification and storage maintenance, it's most likely they aren't looking for this to track people, but to track and prove the legitimacy of official government documents that are issued.

I don't use Bitcointalk as much anymore, but did notice that there is no link to the Bitcointalk ANN page under the "Get Social" links on the Komodo website.
Many of the uninitiated think Komodo (KMD) is a simple privacy coin; this is the title of the Bitcointalk ANN page: “ANN][KMD][dPoW] Komodo - Zcash Zero Knowledge Privacy Secured by Bitcoin"
If this was my first visit to that Bitcointalk page I would think it's just another privacy coin too.

Rebrands take time. If this was just a visual upgrade it could be done in a month or two, but it is a lot bigger than that.

At the very root of our discussions is that "komodo is not a platform" and how we position that story. We want to reintroduce Komodo in a new light so that everyone understands the scope and potential of our technology.

just looking at it though, I don't recall KMD having a soft or hard cap. Pre-sale, maybe BTCD counts? the base/quote public sale amounts could probably be updated, accepting currencies could be (btc and btcd?) definitely the ICO start and end dates, bounty detail URL (probably bitcoin talk thread?), amount for sale (denominated in KMD?), KYC required should be False. Anyone else know the answers better for these?

It may be already addressed in the rebrand site but if not here's some thoughts:
The Technology/Overview section on the page should have buttons/links after each section that acts as a CTA that either links to appropriate page or contact form. So Security should have button like "Secure my Chain" that links to the security service section, and so on.

Also things like Interoperability, Adaptability, and Scalability should have maybe two CTA buttons like "Make your project scalable" or "Get Started" which lead to "Blockchain Starter Kit" for the new projects and another page that is made for already built projects. I think the "Starter Kit" makes sense for new projects but if we are to help active projects scale, we want them to migrate, so another section under Developer Portal or Solutions should be something called "Blockchain Migration Kit" which is more inviting for active projects who might see "starter kit" and be turned off by the idea of "starting over". The migration kit could show specific features that help them do this. These might be about Atomic Swaps specifically to bring ERC20 or other chain to Komodo etc.

Thoughts?

Hi, my name is Ahsan and I am an Editor at BlockPublisher. We are planning on covering Komodo in our journal. I have 5 to 6 questions that I want to ask someone from the founding team. Would be wonderful for the coverage.

@ahsanalikhalid you can ask questions to jl777 himself in #🎰┃ask-jl777 channel

especially for tech, platform, vision questions... For marketing, business stuff there are other people


[28-Nov-18 03:18 AM] Audo#5667
That sounds wonderful @ahsanalikhalid 

Indeed, as the founder jl777 is one of the best persons to interview. We can also arrange other people to answer questions so you get what you need, depending on what the questions are.

Develop On Komodo - Komodo
This is your entry point into Komodo's vibrant developer community. Here, you'll find all the information and documentation you need to develop on Komodo.


[28-Nov-18 12:41 PM] Audo#5667
We noticed our documentation is hard to find through Google search as well as on the website.


[28-Nov-18 01:06 PM] jorian#4555
that is 5 lines of text and a link to just one of the many komodo documentations around


[28-Nov-18 01:07 PM] Audo#5667
yeah, and it's better than nothing  ;)

Our focus is the rebrand. We don't want to put too much effort into the current page, like 80/20 rule I guess

we are starting / have started an entire project to figure out how to build a developer portal. We would like it to have more than just documentation, e.g. a social aspect. It's too early to say what will come out of it – still brainstorming. There is a lot of potential though.

1. Is there one global order of blocks or is relative ordering sequencing only done on as needed basis?
2. How are state changes authorized?
3. How do you exchange state between chains?
4. How do you protect the soundness of the system against invalid state transitions?
5. How do ensure data is available?
6. How does it prevent forks/halts?
7. Expected number of blockchains in the ecosystem?

If you being a developer say that delayed Proof of Work is a "Centralized" solution I assume:
- most probably you just skimmed the whitepaper
- or read and didn't understand it
- or didn't read it?
- even worst, you just believe that someone said it is "Centralized"

problem with MIT and FreeBSD licensing is theat they dnt NEED to open source it ... although its usually in their best intrests to do so


[04-Dec-18 10:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
opensource means that you get FREE development

thing is ... if you write the code, they are going to approach you about develoing things on it I would assume, as most code isnt exactly easy to follow for someone to start from 0 and have to read all of it to figure out how it works.

If a dev thinks adding a google 2FA to their website makes their website/project devs look less capable coz they themselves could not make it better without 2FA, that is such a silly argument. It instead gives their website/project more solid security.

[06-Dec-18 01:30 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
@grewalsatinder can you further elaborate on what results from having Komodo work on a RISCV board? You could expand the tweet or write a blog post. For me it's quite obscure topic and probably for most other people too


[06-Dec-18 01:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
CPU
there is not other CPU in industry which is open source. At least don't know any other open source CPU than this RISC-V


[06-Dec-18 01:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
That is what is exciting


[06-Dec-18 01:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And since CPU like RISC-V is open source I expect there will not be mess like other CPUs
The security mess there is. For almost all CPUs.


[06-Dec-18 01:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
RISC-V board is like a raspberry pi
It is less powerful than desktop but at least it is a start.

So it’s to my understanding that KMD hasn’t spend much of really any money on marketing yet. When will the true marketing campaign for the komodo platform start? What is the final thing that needs to be accomplished before the team starts truly marketing itself. I understand we’re still building now, so I don’t expect anything yet..

@grewalsatinder  Those things look really interesting, saw a video about them, they also have open source FPGA's and custom chips you can build on  website and then order ... While they are not as fast as x86 based cores right now, the ability to easily offload complex instructions to FPGA's and create your own instructions pretty easily will mean that once people start using them and open sourceing the code things will take off very fast. Really one of the greatest things that has happened in a long while to Open Source space.

guys i love komodo and i had an idea about how to spread the love, with a partnership with a great company for a great product used by thousands of people in the world Hasbro inc. and in particular to use the erc20-like capability of komodo for one, or more, of the collectible card games they manage, i know one of them would be very great in this "Magic the Gathering" the cards have a value on the market and some are very expensive  so  having them on the blockchain would be a great thing

@crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy always worth reaching out to coindesk journos.  I have a feeling there are many contract journos that use crypto media as a stepping stone to their next gig in tech journalism.  So on their next gig at least they may remember Komodo in the future....?


[11-Dec-18 02:00 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Yeah i agree @Mylo , it's always good to make people aware of Komodo and dPoW, even if they don't give us a mention. Ive been doing a lot of PR outreach lately and haven't gotten a huge response but really the value is in slowly putting Komodo on people's radars. Eventually everyone will know is and what we do.

best case scenario would be for him to start mentioning Komodo as one of the solutions (perhaps THE solution) to 51% attacks @Daniel CP @Mylo

[13-Dec-18 11:41 PM] Daniel CP#2020
@FishyGuts  does the new WP plugin allow vendors accept other ecosystem coins, maybe VRSC or OOT or ARRR?


[13-Dec-18 11:42 PM] Daniel CP#2020
The reason I ask is that KMD is already available with CoinPayments, which holds something like 1000 different coins and tokens and is available for woo commerce, magneto, and a few other e payment platforms


[13-Dec-18 11:46 PM] Daniel CP#2020
Just trying to figure out what a good unique selling point would be for the new plugin


[14-Dec-18 12:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The plugin was developed solely for KMD by the dev who is going to do the Pirate plugin.
Does coinpayments have any fees or additional requirements for clients/users?
This is a plugin that anyone can install in any wordpress site to accept KMD.  It's already been approved by wordpress and can be used anytime.
@Daniel CP


[14-Dec-18 12:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
He could make other asset chain plugins fairly easy at this point I am certain and would be glad to get him to help any ecosystem devs who might want something like this.


[14-Dec-18 12:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
The largest hurdle was linking wallets as Agama doesn't have a native option to create a master private key for the plugin to reference.


[14-Dec-18 12:02 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So we used the paper wallet data to link to the plugin.


[14-Dec-18 12:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Coinpayments has a .5 fee on the front page.  Wonder if there are other fees.


[14-Dec-18 12:04 AM] Daniel CP#2020
CoinPayments is also free and permissionless to download and install but yes, i think there is a 0.5% fee per tx.


[14-Dec-18 12:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Fiat settlement is pretty cool.


[14-Dec-18 12:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Does anyone have any feedback or experience here?


[14-Dec-18 12:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Using them?


[14-Dec-18 12:05 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I think the new plugin would be awesome if it supported a few more coins and tokens from the KMD ecosystem


[14-Dec-18 12:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Perhaps that is possible.  I hadn't thought of it.  
The dev who did it really likes Komodo and would be eager to see if it's possible.  
Who would I put him in touch with?


[14-Dec-18 12:06 AM] FishyGuts#5085
He asked me when he finished if Komodo was hiring 😂


[14-Dec-18 12:07 AM] Daniel CP#2020
haha well if he keeps building cool stuff we might be!


[14-Dec-18 12:07 AM] Daniel CP#2020
You can ask him to get in touch with me and then I'll figure out who from the dev team can help more


[14-Dec-18 12:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Give me some ideas?  Should I just see if he can integrate a 2nd coin in for now... and go from there?


[14-Dec-18 12:08 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Which coin should he start with that would be straightforward?


[14-Dec-18 12:08 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I like your thinking.


[14-Dec-18 12:08 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Yeah seeing if integrating more ecosystem coins and tokens to the plugin would be possible a good place to start


[14-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Then we could add that as part of the deal when projects choose to build with Komodo


[14-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Daniel CP#2020
the marketing team is really trying to create a big list of extra benefits to building with KMD and this would be a cool one


[14-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Get your own customizable blockchain, then get: integration to Agama, integration to BarterDEX, integration to the WP plugin, etc


[14-Dec-18 12:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Already sent him a message.
He was very eager to take the KMD and then Pirate plugin job.   He immediately asked me if KMD was hiring. 😛


[14-Dec-18 12:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I said just get through the job and well see.


[14-Dec-18 12:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
So I asked him to add EQL, hush or Utrum to the same plugin.  Ill let you know what he says. 

He did this plugin for a different chain I worked with 8 months ago.   He is capable with this work.

@Daniel CP no answer back yet however, the plugin could easily be modified for any KMD asset chains by anyone familiar with these things to change it to a different currency.  
They just need the paper wallet option to generate MPKs or their own wallet to have this option.

Multichain hardforking with timestamp based activation was a new development in @KomodoPlatform 
This method since worked out perfectly fine, would make it easier for future multichain hardfork upgrades possible no matter what amount of multiple blockchains there'll be.

There is already a "zmigrate" dapp made, which can be used to migrate the funds via command line from sprout z addresses (starting with "zc") to sapling z addresses (starting with "zs").
I don't know about it's GUI updates, but know somebody is doing it. Read instructions ...

@FishyGuts so the MPK from the paper wallet used in the WP plugin, does that mean all payment addresses are the same? Or can multiple addresses be created and used?


[15-Dec-18 11:12 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Do you mean as the shopkeeper?   I believe your payment address persists.

[15-Dec-18 11:13 AM] FishyGuts#5085
@Chand would know more. 

I think with Komodo using the same payment address for native coins, that it’s merely a matter of adding a dropdown menu to the plugin and the Price APIs for all that are available.


[15-Dec-18 11:59 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea I guess I'm wondering if there is a way to create new addresses for each shopper to send to, or if that would be beneficial?

Hey, any chance we can get a place for API endpoints for different things for each of the explorers here?
<https://dexstats.info/explorers.php>


[16-Dec-18 05:01 PM] Regnar#6164
We only really have Insight and Iquidus explorers but it would be nice to have the API endpoints for each of them so when new coins get created it'll be easier to send the API end points to sites like CMC, Coinpaprika, and coingecko.


[16-Dec-18 05:04 PM] Regnar#6164
obviously adding them to the explorers themselves would be best, but should be left up to individual teams. It would be nice to have the commands in a single spot so developers/sites know what commands to use for each coin, instead of having to navigate explorers and may or may not find the API endpoint info (most of our explorers don't have the API endpoints listed)


[16-Dec-18 05:07 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm thinking something like this:
<https://liraexplorer.com/info>
Except instead of pre fill the site name, we have a drop down menu to pick a coin, and it will select the right API endpoints depending on the type of explorer we have on file. for example Iquidus explorers use /ext/getmoneysupply to get the circulating supply, but I have no idea what that end point is for Insight explorers...

There is also a json format:
http://api1.barterdexapi.net/supply.php?coin=KMD&format=json
( Which I need to enrich with the sprout and sapling data )
Returns the supply and works for all notatized chains. CMC coin paprika and coingecko are using it. If you need other calls let me know.

1/ Assetchains are the "runtime forks" of "komodo".
"Runtime Forks": It means all the end user need is the exact same `komodod` daemon which they use to run/sync $KMD blockchain. But using this `komodod` with different `-ac_=` parameters creates a new network/cryptocurrency

the arguments against dPoW are like saying the manufacturer of a home security system can tap into the sensors to know when there is nobody home and use the backdoors to get entrance to the house, of course it will be known that they did this and oh, they cant actually steal anything. Since this "attack" is there, it is better to just not have any security system and let anybody just smash the window and break in.

First I will say. I like komodo. 

Here is my contribution from the German telegram Komodo chat.
Translated with Google

Just my modest opinion: In over 25 years stock market, I have often put on the best technology. In the end, I still work today.
Most of those with the best marketing have won.
Therefore, I would not necessarily recommend today in the circle of friends to buy kmd.c
We absolutely need aggressive marketing, and very quickly. The technology and the ecosystem is absolutely great, but that does not help us if nobody is interested in investing.

Not to dilute your point however many times it has been the best technology that has won out in the end.  Alternating current over direct current.  Google over Many of the search browsers of the late nineties/early 2000's,  intel and amd over motorola.  FPGA over gpu .

[25-Dec-18 05:09 PM] Regnar#6164
It's also important to establish just what we will be marketing. Is it a platform for dApp development, a dICO platform, CC contracts, the KMD coin itself, etc. So if we are going to market one as a flagship, or all (though it is difficult to "sell the world") we need to have those aspects ready for easy use, building, and some examples built in. just flat out picking the right approach is difficult and is in process with the IBN team and Komodo, the marketing should promote a type of adoption, development, and usage that will drive value for KMD and it's holders, among other things. So yes, I definitely agree with the point of increase marketing. However,


[25-Dec-18 05:11 PM] Regnar#6164
I disagree with not investing in KMD because of marketing not being aggressive yet. I'd much rather invest in a project with actual technology and increasing marketing, than a marketing powerhouse built on vapor. And if the only downside isn't the tech, but marketing, then I'd say THAT makes it a great investment in itself.

[26-Dec-18 05:59 AM] gsnew#5366
hello together, 
i think we agree, thats we have with komodo a very good technic an a very good team. ( i admire their performance ) but some things must be advanced. to example JumbLE,  its to complicated for the masses. Whenever I use it I have problems. Only the native mode of agama is a challenge. That can not help inspire the masses.
But a anonymization tool, thats easy to use fort he masses, thats a very good argument for buy and use Komodo. A detour over another blockchain ( like pirate or whatever ), i think so, is not the right way.
I would like to give you to consider: In the past, not always has the best technology won. See Microsoft, Apple or whatever. it won the easy to use technic. technology, everyone is talking about. you know the answer of a question from the people when he say: "google this"
I think we must see komodo everywhere. In coinbase? ( thats would a big step ) , in computer newspapers... I dont know,  im not a specialist.
Also I see many interesting projects in development. Thats very good, but I'm afraid komodo gets entangled in too many of these.
i think all of the team works hard and I hope their think about my constructive criticism.

I would like to thank the team for the successful work in 2018.
and wish us all a successful 2019.
Regards from Germany

Imagine when BarterDex matures and acts as an automatic intermediary for jumblr. You put btc in one end, trades it for kmd, jumblrs, then buys back btc at the end.  😃

The most sound investment Komodo could make would be to run ethereum on the platform. Showcase the ease of use of running nodes vs Ethereum network's peer dropping node sync failures. This will essentailly end Ethereum, bring developers and clients to Komodo and thrust Komodo's market cap close to Bitcoin.

You will have to create professional press releases and marketing materials that must be sent out to financial & news publications as well as the cheesy blockchain news websites. Komodo must be dedicated and implacable in promoting this.

It would be the biggest shakeup in recent years, and crypto is due for a heavy shakeup. Komodo will be doing the industry a huge favor by extinguishing the Eth scam and saving the devs who are wasting their lives on it.


[26-Dec-18 01:52 PM] chris#0517
then kill the eth chain after mission accomplished


[26-Dec-18 06:06 PM] Mylo#8306
Yes i found eth quite convoluted and layers of confusion compared to kmd.

The success of any crypto(ICO) depends on the actual value of the ecosystem. If an ecosystem is valuable, the token that is commonly used there is also valuable. Investors look for ideas and buy tokens in advance, expecting return on investment. As a resource to sell tokens, publishers create ecosystems. When ecosystems are created and activated, investors' expectations are realized. This is a virtuous cycle structure. It is self-prophecy reinforcement that expectation creates reality and reality reinforces expectation.

The problem is that the issuer sells the tokens while ensuring value is in conflict with traditional securities laws and investment regulations. The standard of judgment of securities does not appear. Because the issuer-investor relationship is the criterion, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) claims that most ICOs violated securities laws.

It is necessary to reverse the idea of ​​ensuring the value of the ecosystem rather than guaranteeing the value of the token. If an ecosystem has value, it can collect a variety of resources through the token without having to convert it to money or guarantee its value. It is not the mileage coupons that a valuable ecosystem meets with the block chain, but currency, so the government can not prevent it from being traditionally legal.

Are we still trying to push MM atomic swap adoption prior to MM v2? I'm not really sure how far off v2 is, so should we still try or should we wait? 
Reason being is I remembered  the p2p market place Open Bazaar let's you buy crypto now too, but it is done through escrow or trusted trading. Seeing as Open Bazaar is p2p and relies on both parties being online, it makes it a perfect candidate for vendors to be liquidity providers for MM. I figured we could probably negotiate the MM backend and request KMD integration for buyers/sellers too. 
All assuming we are still pushing MM prior to v2. Thoughts?


[27-Dec-18 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810

oh then my apologies, I was under the impression it was still pre-release/in testing


[27-Dec-18 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is


[27-Dec-18 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
basic functionality. in testing


[27-Dec-18 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but from what i have seen there is no point to support 2 independent implemetations


[27-Dec-18 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
mm2 is the future, the future is in testing


[27-Dec-18 09:40 AM] Regnar#6164
Right makes sense to support only v2. Just wasn't sure if it was something that we could push today for integration into Open Bazaar, or if it would be best to wait.

They are using etomic tech. I was supprised, ivan on tech published a video today, where he announces to make a series about dexes. He also sayed he will promote resistance and that they are using etomic swaps. I was sure that is a unice komodo term. After a bit of research i found an article where is written that they use komodos etomic swap tech

`As an added feature, users can add privacy to almost any cryptocurrency, including bitcoin, even if that currency doesn’t support private transactions natively. By harnessing the power of the Resistance privacy-oriented blockchain as an intermediary, users can enable this privacy feature at the click of a button. ResDEX will then automatically trade the coin of your choice to RES and send RES in place of the original currency, thereby adding privacy to the trade. Users can also utilize the same trading mechanism to add privacy to a non-private cryptocurrency by automatically trading to RES and then trading back to the original cryptocurrency.`

Daniel:
Our consensus mechanism is different than KMD as well :) We are our own Blockchain using Proof of Reward Splitting. But yes there are indeed similarities between BarterDex and us.  Where we are different is our focus towards better UI (one step privacy, one step instant atomic swaps), fiat gateway and ensuring liquidity on our platform through onboarding market makers :)

To the topic Resistance...
And they advertise being a fork from BarterDEX.  In the Telegram Channel there is criticism of Komodo's marketing.   That your work will be completed by others.
We receive criticism from users again and again. „The marketing is weak and it comes too little.“  The dissatisfaction increases.  Especially after the Dex copy.


[29-Dec-18 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
but it seems the fact it is being adopted is a marketing success? in open source, projects that are forked improve, sometimes exponentially. if nobody knew of barterDEX, it wouldnt be forked


[29-Dec-18 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
we are in open source


[29-Dec-18 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
how could marketing prevent something from being forked. makes no sense


[29-Dec-18 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
with proper attribution, I have no problems it is forked


[29-Dec-18 09:21 AM] klunex#3191
yea the code seems to be good. I am also convinced about the tech. Thats the reason i am invested. But I cant realy apprechiate that others making gains with the work komodo has done. Is komodo a charity projekt which delivers high tech to others for free?


[29-Dec-18 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
it is an open source project


[29-Dec-18 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810

[29-Dec-18 09:31 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
@klunex keep in mind that if they actually improve it, Kmd can then add the same improvements back and it has also a growing ecosystem of blockchains and dapps and technologies. It's not like kmd is dead because someone forks one of the technologies, far from it

[29-Dec-18 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
it is very very rare that a fork ends up with more value than the original


[29-Dec-18 09:36 AM] klunex#3191
btc was clearly first in the collective mind. I am concernet that  barterdex isnt...


[29-Dec-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
but they are giving proper attribution to barterDEX. how can it be that people dont understand that barterDEX was there first to be able to be forked?


[29-Dec-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
if we are talking about people who cant understand that something needs to exist before it can be forked...


[29-Dec-18 09:39 AM] klunex#3191
The people out there which is using the dex are mostly not interrestet about history and background. They want just to trade and use a known instrument. Like most of btcusers dont know what is a merkletree.

@klunex  nearly everything kmd does is universally ignored or dismissed. If the tech created here needs to be co-opted to get recognized then at least it is getting acknowledged. I doubt anyone wishing to implement a custom barterdex is gonna be successful without help from this team anyway.

maybe they bring in a lot of marketmakers, which we can all tap into

Is it possible to get there liquid providers to bdex?


[29-Dec-18 05:30 PM] chris#0517
No one really knows about barterdex except mostly the kmd ppl in discord. No one will know its origin if someone forks it, makes GUI smooth and releases it. I haven't seen anyone talk about/promote it outside of discord.


[29-Dec-18 05:43 PM] Regnar#6164
BarterDEX doesn't seem to be the focus as a GUI. Just looking at the channels here we have #dev-marketmaker and #dex-hyperdex which is core of BarterDEX and then a 3rd party app that is building on the core. Building the core market maker (v2) has been the focus, not the GUI of barterDEX itself. I think the thought process here is build the engine that works really well and is easy for 3rd parties to build a GUI dApp on top as their own business.


[29-Dec-18 06:15 PM] chris#0517
thx I will learn more about marketmaker


[29-Dec-18 06:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
marketmaker is based off code james wrote a long time ago. He made an entire BTC daemon in C called iguana. Marketmaker is built on that code base. IT has functions to do just about anything and can talk to just about any BTC clone. but its out dated and slow. As its multi threading was removed for stability. MM2 aims to solve all the issue found when making MM1. Any project hoping to use MM1 to build on, will just run into the same issues as HyperDEX faced. Hopefully they can figuire out how to solve some problems, and we can use that code. This is what open source is about.

to be fair to the much maligned mm1...
it was designed to do atomic swaps and order matching, along the way SPV to be added. so it achieved more than it originally set out to do. from a cli basis, it works pretty well. any sort of multithreaded and queueing ability can be added ON TOP of mm1, which is what is required to create a performant multithreaded system. With a multithreaded overlay and queuing of requests to native mode, it would work, but then people want multithreaded and SPV servers....
that runs into the problem that SPV servers are slow, much slower as compared to native. mm1 served its purpose, it blazed the trail and showed it is possible to make a decentralized orderbook cleared via atomic swaps. the utxo issue is probably more of a hindrance than the single threaded issue for the daemon level. Remember all bitcoind rpc calls are single threaded and mm1 uses the same model


[30-Dec-18 01:12 AM] jl777c#5810
last i checked we do have performant multithreaded systems using bitcoind, even though bitcoind is single threaded. this should prove that even though mm1 is single threaded (at the rpc level), it is also possible to have a multithreaded view


[30-Dec-18 01:18 AM] tolken#2655
Hopefully Artem and team are well on their way for mm2. I’m eager to see it adopted and used regularly.


[30-Dec-18 01:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
I used a multithreaded marketmaker for the streamer, works really well.


[30-Dec-18 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, proving the multithreaded use of mm1 is possible, it just means you need to implement the multithreading on top of mm1. given enough work it would be possible to make mm1 appear much more seamless, but mm2 will make it easier to achieve

@actionslacks the point is that we had from 16th of march on a dex which was able to do swaps over around 95% of all existing coins. We where the only one in the space. Thats a huge advantage from a marketing perspective which we lost now. At the end its not important who invented the tech, at the end counts who brings the tech to the users. Lets say gerneral motors build a new engine, bmw copies it, make publicity and sells it.  Nobody of the car users care who build the engine. They are just happy that they have a car with an amazing engine who drives them from A to B.  In the space general motors has the recognition of the nerds, yes. But it doent harvest the fruits.


[30-Dec-18 11:28 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No one will dominate the Dex field until the tools that are needed are built for LPs


[30-Dec-18 11:29 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Resistance does not have those tools either


[30-Dec-18 11:39 AM] klunex#3191

@klunex whit that logic there is also one exchange in the world. there will be many Dex some use kmd tec some don't.

@hastrup  What do you think is the future of barterdex? Whats the strategy to attract users?


[30-Dec-18 12:27 PM] hastrup#8742
Bdex it self is not trying to find users. Projects that makes nice gui will find users  project like coin collect, zaddex, Magnum, pungo, ø crypto union, Hyperdex bdex is the tech behind its not trying to get users it's trying to get projects


[30-Dec-18 12:28 PM] hastrup#8742
@klunex


[30-Dec-18 12:30 PM] klunex#3191
if i use barterdex or the hyperdex gui i am always on the same marketplace or not?


[30-Dec-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
same


[30-Dec-18 12:57 PM] hastrup#8742
@klunex  that is the beauty of bdex all of the above project will use the same tech under the hood so all of them will get the advantage of the other projects lp. All the project is helping each other to succeed


[30-Dec-18 12:58 PM] klunex#3191
@hastrup how can we attract users to our marketplace?


[30-Dec-18 12:59 PM] klunex#3191
do you think they are coming by themselfs?


[30-Dec-18 01:01 PM] hastrup#8742
@klunex no that is the marketing from all of the above mentioned projects. bdex role is to provide a easy and stabile setup for the programmers so that they can write gui code that is easy and fast for the user to use.


[30-Dec-18 01:23 PM] klunex#3191
Resistance is using komodotech but its a different marketplace. In my opinion they are ready now. Now they go into phase two. Phase two is to get the stone rolling. For that they make a big marketingcampaing to bring the volume and useramount to a level that other users get attacted (high liquidity etc.) and so on. This is necessary to get an exchange running. 
We have to go trough this process as well if we want that barterdex is usable. We can program the most userfriendly gui in the world and the most advanced tech. Trough this process we have to go. And its not getting easier as we see that we have a competitor. And do not believe that this competitor is advicing komodo to their users. They are focused and determined.


[30-Dec-18 01:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Have you ever used BarterDEX or another atomic swap Dex like blocknet .


[30-Dec-18 01:24 PM] klunex#3191
bdex and hyperdex i used


[30-Dec-18 01:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Now put yourself in the mindset of someone who trades for a living, what do they need to accomplish their livelihood above board.  And do any Dex setups have this now.   It's not as simple as bringing users and liquidity.


[30-Dec-18 01:30 PM] klunex#3191
I think this guys spend a lot of money for the maketingcampaign.

2.) they know what they are doing.


[30-Dec-18 01:30 PM] hastrup#8742
Jl777 said: maybe they bring in a lot of marketmakers, which we can all tap into. So as far as I understand it we can use there lp. They Wil differently not be the only one in the space and when some clever ppl come in the space they want to know how did they do it. Kmd tec that's how. And meybe they fork and give back some great code we can use and some advertising or they want kmd help to get started. Both ways is good for kmd


[30-Dec-18 01:38 PM] klunex#3191
@hastrup in the idle case most of the ppl dont care how they do it, they just want to trade, enjoy the advantages of a decentrlized exchange and thats it. If they like, they tell to other ppl and so we have a network effect. Nobody care that the tech comes from komodo. Komodo? what? Isnt that a lizzard?

so you are pretending that we have millions upon millions to spend. we dont


[30-Dec-18 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and of course, if we had $100 million to spend on advertising, then we could have done a lot of advertising


[30-Dec-18 01:45 PM] jl777c#5810
but KMD is more an infrastructure project, not really direct to consumers, so consumer advertising is not really effective

my idea was to reach out to ivan on tech that he make a interview with komodo, where we can explain hyperdex and show on screen how it works. We could have collected donations for this action. I would have donated for sure 😉


[30-Dec-18 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
ivan charges something like $25000


[30-Dec-18 01:47 PM] klunex#3191
that we could have collected i am sure


[30-Dec-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
you dont understand how expensive the advertising is. and it only has a short term effect.

without actual usage, advertising to consumers is pretty silly


[30-Dec-18 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
at this stage we need to connect with the other projects that will utilize the komodo tech


[30-Dec-18 01:49 PM] klunex#3191
i dont like verges marketing at all

[30-Dec-18 01:50 PM] klunex#3191
lets see how it plays out for resistance. That was my idea, i posted already in july here. We will see. Maybe i am wrong 😉


[30-Dec-18 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
we need to make the DEX easier to use before pushing a lot of people to use it. maybe resitance will solve the user adoption problem after they raise $10 million


[30-Dec-18 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe they raise $500,000


[30-Dec-18 01:51 PM] klunex#3191
but our dex is easy already isnt it? hyperdex?


[30-Dec-18 01:51 PM] jl777c#5810
regardless of how they do, it will help us


[30-Dec-18 01:51 PM] Meyse#0952

Got infos about the rewards ian balina is getting from resistance:
Resistance

        DMM will receive compensation in the amount of 1.5% of the hard cap
        DMM will receive compensation in the amount of 218, 000 tokens
https://ianbalina.com/pages/transparency

Ivan is getting at least the same if not even more.

Crazy, realy risky in my opinion. Like all in....

i scam i wouldnt say. I know ivan on tech, he is very serious. But maybe they make a mistake. As jl777 sayed the dex has to work fluently. Otherwise people will move again to centralized exchanges and it was just a huge waste of money. 
Or you are right. They dont care because they could gather a lot of money. 
18M is quite a high hard cap. All the tech they are mentioning to use is more or less existing....

@jl777c ok sounds not bad.
What do you think about bisq fiatgateway? I understood it like this:
Alice Bob and an arbitrator have a 2 of 3 multisig address. Lets assume Alice has crypto, Bob fiat. Alice puts an order. Bob want to fill it. 
He makes a small securitydeposit in crypto to a timelocked address with the condition that Bob can withdraw if time is over or an arbitrator can transfer just to Alice. 
Alice make payment to the 2 of 3 multisig address. 
Bob makes fiat transfer to her bankaccount
After receiving, Alice sign tx from multisigaddress to Bob-> Bob can get crypto

If Bob doesnt do the fiattransfer, Alice consult arbitrator.
Arbitrator check evidence and eventually sign funds from multisig back to Alice and small Bob deposit as well.  As well if Alice got fiat and doesnt sign, Bob can complain and get 

I find the concept not bad. At least better than the visa/mastercard fiat gateway resistance is using which requires kyc. Its a bit tricky with the arbitrators, they have to be trusted, somehow chosen and in the idle case noone of the participants. An idea is to chose one randomly of a list of elected arbitrators similar to notary nodes and show both participants his telegramlink or something like that. A small fee for arbitration is an option.

human involvement requires trust,but fiat tx seems to always require that

@tolken given how prone Bluetooth and wireless connections are to attacks, I would think a skilled hacker could intercept the signed transaction. Not sure what he could do with it other than broadcast it or withhold it but I just thought it would be an attack vector.

Hi, would it be allowed to use the Komodo logo for selling die-cut vinyl stickers online? Would implement Komodo as payment method too: www.substicker.com
Thanks guys

@dsk0_ I don't think that's a problem, there's a logo pack at the bottom of the page under Resources here <https://komodoplatform.com/>


[09-Jan-19 06:15 PM] Regnar#6164
Also we should probably add the Woocommerce plugin link <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/WooCommerce-KMD>
to this page:

As a form of accepting KMD as payment

@PTYX  we're working on building the new website with Ideas By Nature and dPoW will get its fair share of attention. We've considered creating separate sites for things like dPoW or Agama but ultimately decided against it because we don't really have the resources to build and maintain 3 different sites.


[11-Jan-19 02:31 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Plus, the Komodo website's domain authority is pretty strong so it has a much better chance of appearing in search engine results


[11-Jan-19 02:32 AM] Daniel CP#2020
For instance, if you search for "blockchain security service" on Google , Komodo is the #1 result.  If we had a separate site for dPoW, we wouldn't be able to rank that well


[11-Jan-19 02:56 AM] sφldat#8733
I also think that dPoW should not be separated on another website
"blockchain security service"
Google #3 page 1
Ecosia #2 page 1
Duckduckgo #1 page 1


[11-Jan-19 02:57 AM] sφldat#8733
Are you planning to add a Chips page to the Komodo website?


[11-Jan-19 03:04 AM] Daniel CP#2020
No specific plans for Chips right now but we can try work it in

This has been said many times but I'll cover it again-- it's not just a new logo. It's not just a new website. It's not just a new GUI. It's a full rebrand. We're literally trying to redefine Komodo from the ground up


[11-Jan-19 06:13 AM] Daniel CP#2020
So yes, it takes time. We're going to make sure everything is done properly, rather than getting it done to say we did it

We were expecting it to take this long from the get go


[11-Jan-19 06:50 AM] Daniel CP#2020

There's a lot going on behind the scenes, we're trying to get the messaging just right, Sidd and Mylo are working on a developer portal that will be integrated into the website, and we're now looking to finish the blockchain generator web app for the rebrand too

Rebrand info is here on Komodo's Youtube page:
<https://coinpaprika.com/event/58735-full-rebrand-20/>   
2018 marketing review and goals:
<https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RDgtFKf0JI23othrPVvZ45miSLwhTmxX/view>  

I understand rebrands take time, and I'm not discussing how long it is taking, or when it should be done, just that the communication put out about it hasn't been consistent, or at least has been consistent up until the end of Q4 2018.


[11-Jan-19 07:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
I just think Komodo needs a bit of business mind. 
even a very good innovation is meaningless if it is not presented as a business. 
komodo needs careful strategy and planning.
all weapons should not be shown at once, but komodo seems powerless to captivate the public.


[11-Jan-19 07:02 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I hear you @Regnar but to be fair that marketing report was made in Jan 2018, long before we ever had plans to work with IBN


[11-Jan-19 07:02 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We've tried to be consistent as possible but the truth is we were thinking Q1 2019 all along


[11-Jan-19 07:03 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We never committed to dates b/c we know there are always unforeseen events and challenges


[11-Jan-19 07:03 AM] Meyse#0952
I've been following this rebrand from here but there was really never ever any date set. That 31dec came out of thin air, nobody from the team ever mentioned that on discord


[11-Jan-19 07:03 AM] PTYX#6840
that's possibly the error


[11-Jan-19 07:03 AM] PTYX#6840
dates and deadlines need to be met as with any business


[11-Jan-19 07:03 AM] Daniel CP#2020
A lot of what we're waiting on too is establishing revenue models


[11-Jan-19 07:03 AM] PTYX#6840
they can be adjusted sure, but they are there for a reason


[11-Jan-19 07:04 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We need to figure out how to keep Komodo afloat and once we establish that, then we can create marketing strategy


[11-Jan-19 07:05 AM] PTYX#6840
Ok, so the priority now is to keep Komodo afloat?


[11-Jan-19 07:05 AM] PTYX#6840
That is why the marketing strategy hasn't been put in place yet?


[11-Jan-19 07:05 AM] Regnar#6164
Agreed, it is bound to have changes, but changes would be best to be communicated, or at least the information updated. That video is Komodo's official youtube but we don't see anything about where the rebrand is now, even if it is pushed back for good reason. in fact we haven't had a new video there in 6 months haha


[11-Jan-19 07:06 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We're working on a lot of different things at once. It's probably easy to think the rebrand is limited to the 4 or 5 guys on the marketing tram but it's not. It's a team wide rebrand and a complete overhaul of Komodo. Audo mentioned this not too long ago, I think he explained it very well


[11-Jan-19 07:06 AM] PTYX#6840
I disagree here


[11-Jan-19 07:06 AM] Daniel CP#2020
@Regnar we have no funding for videos. Maybe we could start a community fundraising project to make videos


[11-Jan-19 07:07 AM] PTYX#6840
This rebrand could have been done in a month or two with a focuses team like the one we have for design and web development.


[11-Jan-19 07:07 AM] Daniel CP#2020
@PTYX it could have been done very very poorly in a month or two


[11-Jan-19 07:07 AM] PTYX#6840
@Daniel CP there is no funding for a team member to get in front of a camera?

[11-Jan-19 07:09 AM] Regnar#6164
Not to argue the point too much but there is a deliverables timeline on the 2018 marketing strategy I linked here. Again, I'm in the camp of dates not being set on fairly opaque goals such as rebrands. Just saying the communication needs to be updated more frequently when we have in the past set timelines. But that's all I'll say on that, it's in the past, we aren't setting dates in the future, which is the right answer.

@PTYX not Komodo, we never said that.

I guess it was just picked up telepathically then

Not Komodo, not Komodo.

I am certain that if we go through the telegram, twitter, or discord messages it's mentioned

Okay but lets be real here, there WAS a date set in some of Komodo communications (those communications are cited in links here). That date was set prematurely in early 2018, we failed to update people that there was going to be delays, delays for good reason or not, now we are here with rebrand still in planning/implementation. Rebranding is obviously going to take time since it isn't just changing a website, it's about changing how we are perceived and who our target market is. 
There is no point in arguing whether we set a date or not, we did. it's cited. What we should be discussing is what do we do next, or while the rebrand is happening

[11-Jan-19 07:18 AM] Regnar#6164
We already know not to set dates in the future for opaque goals. Launching a new website is not opaque, but that isn't what is really being discussed here. Rebrands are opaque, and the right answer is not to set a date. That should be settled, and doesn't need belaboring.


[11-Jan-19 07:19 AM] PTYX#6840
what is a rebrand though? it's not that opaque.


[11-Jan-19 07:20 AM] Daniel CP#2020
OK even is I agree for the sake of argument that we did say Dec 2018, I'm not sure I understand the concerns are here


[11-Jan-19 07:20 AM] Regnar#6164
a clear date in which one is "accomplished" is definitely opaque


[11-Jan-19 07:20 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We can def improve communications. I hear that point and agree


[11-Jan-19 07:20 AM] Daniel CP#2020
But what is the urgency here? Why should we rush through a major rebrand?

If you guys would prefer us to rush through the rebrand and do a shitty job, I''m sorry

We aren't going to do that


[11-Jan-19 07:22 AM] PTYX#6840
seriously?


[11-Jan-19 07:22 AM] PTYX#6840
that's your argument


[11-Jan-19 07:22 AM] Daniel CP#2020
@PTYX at this point you're just trolling.


[11-Jan-19 07:22 AM] PTYX#6840
I honestly think that it's getting to the point that if we want something done for Komodo, we have to do it ourselves.


[11-Jan-19 07:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Wonderful


[11-Jan-19 07:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020

we welcome all contributions

Yes with investors


[11-Jan-19 07:24 AM] PTYX#6840
and the team in charge of public image isn't communicating anything or willing to answer valid questions. Even going as far as acting there was no date insinuated for the rebrand


[11-Jan-19 07:24 AM] Daniel CP#2020
What questions have not been answered?


[11-Jan-19 07:25 AM] Daniel CP#2020
And you still haven't shown me Komodo comms that committed to Dec 2018


[11-Jan-19 07:25 AM] PTYX#6840
I have a few questions actually. how much has been spent on this rebrand?


[11-Jan-19 07:25 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I don't know tbh


[11-Jan-19 07:25 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Not my role


[11-Jan-19 07:25 AM] PTYX#6840
Aside from the cost of time that we already know, it would be interesting to see how much was spent in these past 6 months of planning


[11-Jan-19 07:26 AM] Regnar#6164
Okay instead of assuming what you both actually want to say here, @PTYX what is your suggestion we actually do?


[11-Jan-19 07:26 AM] PTYX#6840
We need a firm deadline on the rebrand and certain actions from the marketing team


[11-Jan-19 07:26 AM] PTYX#6840
if they are not met, we should look for another solution.


[11-Jan-19 07:28 AM] Daniel CP#2020
"certain actions"?


[11-Jan-19 07:28 AM] PTYX#6840
yes


[11-Jan-19 07:28 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Not sure what that means


[11-Jan-19 07:28 AM] PTYX#6840
for starters Benny


[11-Jan-19 07:28 AM] PTYX#6840
what is he?


[11-Jan-19 07:28 AM] Regnar#6164
What about milestones that the rebrand needs to go through, would deadlines on those be suitable?


[11-Jan-19 07:28 AM] PTYX#6840
is he the Komodo manger, ceo, just a volunteer?


[11-Jan-19 07:29 AM] PTYX#6840
is he running redfox labs now too?


[11-Jan-19 07:29 AM] PTYX#6840
what are his responsibilities and how do we hold people in their position accountable?


[11-Jan-19 07:29 AM] PTYX#6840
right now we have no way to quantify how much is being spent and what is actually being delivered.


[11-Jan-19 07:29 AM] Daniel CP#2020
To my knowledge, Benny is a volunteer


[11-Jan-19 07:29 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I could be wrong


[11-Jan-19 07:30 AM] PTYX#6840
Well, all those details need to be cleared up


[11-Jan-19 07:30 AM] Daniel CP#2020
As for milestones, @Regnar i think that's something we can work on

[11-Jan-19 07:30 AM] PTYX#6840
If this is supposed to be a professional project it needs to begin setting professional boundaries and guidelines. Right now it's like everyone is working on their own thing and not communicating anything to the community.


[11-Jan-19 07:30 AM] Daniel CP#2020
About marketing and rebrand


[11-Jan-19 07:31 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I don't know what I can say publicly right now and I dont want to say a bunch of things that are meant to be internal


[11-Jan-19 07:31 AM] Daniel CP#2020
@PTYX it seems like many of your questions are not about marketing or the rebrand, I'm not in a position to answer them


[11-Jan-19 07:32 AM] PTYX#6840
i'm talking about marketing and the business side.


[11-Jan-19 07:36 AM] Regnar#6164
I think there should be some milestones established. "finished rebrand" imo is too large/opaque. what does rebrand mean? new logo? new front facing UI? does Komodo create a foundation to focus on business? coming up with business plan? What is the goal of rebranding, to drive value for KMD? establishing new target market? new market positioning? etc.

Because it's the end result, it's expected to be longer away in the future, with a lot of time in between of uncertainty and guesses/rumors. Milestones will at least give investors a way to track progress and know things are being done.

What other actionable things would we want to see more from marketing?


[11-Jan-19 07:36 AM] PTYX#6840
I agree, part of a rebrand or any development is the scope of work


[11-Jan-19 07:37 AM] PTYX#6840
that needs to be made clear with deadlines for each individual milestone of this rebrand


[11-Jan-19 07:37 AM] PTYX#6840
I would say communication from management


[11-Jan-19 07:37 AM] PTYX#6840
I want to see videos with Steve and Benny talking about Komodo, the weekly or biweekly progress


[11-Jan-19 07:37 AM] PTYX#6840
or whoever is meant to be the leadership at the time


[11-Jan-19 07:38 AM] PTYX#6840
I don't think the team has internal metrics but if Benny is a volunteer and he is representing komodo, we as a community should be able to gauge his contribution and decide if we should look for other volunteers


[11-Jan-19 07:39 AM] PTYX#6840
So I think we should specify the responsibilities of any volunteers within the leadership team.


[11-Jan-19 07:39 AM] PTYX#6840
As I see it right now, benny looks more like he is from Redfox than from Komodo. So from an outsider's point of view it can be confusing.

sadly, feel the limitations and fantasies of being decentralized while watching this conversation... and feel the need for centralization.


[11-Jan-19 07:43 AM] PTYX#6840
Marketing Wishlist

- Scope of Responsibilities of the Leadership memebers
- Scope of work for rebrand
- Deadline for rebrand milestones
- Annual review of volunteers and possible election of new candidates.

@Deleted Usercentralization and organization aren't mutually exclusive

--> "What other actionable things would we want to see more from marketing?"

This is the most important question in my mind. Thanks @Regnar

[11-Jan-19 07:45 AM] Daniel CP#2020
All very reasonable requests

@Deleted User trust me, this is the same type of stuff you see in many companies. lol


[11-Jan-19 07:48 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I've brought up the idea of an AMA with Steve and Ben. It seems like the plan was to release the year-end report and hold an AMA about that, as well as the plan for 2019


[11-Jan-19 07:48 AM] Daniel CP#2020
So all rebrand questions can be brought up in that


[11-Jan-19 07:48 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We will announce dates ASAP


[11-Jan-19 07:50 AM] PTYX#6840
recently nem held an election to replace their entire leadership team. The community voted in the team they wanted to represent them for the next 2 years. pretty neat system.


[11-Jan-19 07:50 AM] Regnar#6164
I think along with Scope of responsibilities would be a list of Komodo resources and who currently has control/ownership of them. Simply to make it easier for us to respond to bugs and issues that are brought to our attention. for example, if there is a spelling error on Komodoplatform.com who do I tag to get it fixed? Or a Komodo explorer is down, who owns which one (if they are team members)


[11-Jan-19 07:51 AM] PTYX#6840
There was alot of hate from some of the candidates and it was similar to a political campaign


[11-Jan-19 07:55 AM] Daniel CP#2020
I guess I can give a somewhat vague update re: rebrand. 

The new logo is done. New typeface, new colors, new logo, new everything. IBN was working on the wallet and well into the design process. We've actually paused that temporarily because there may be a change of plans. We might shift to the blockchain generator instead, which would mean IBN would design that for us rather than a new wallet. There are already several good wallets in the ecosystem so we're trying to work out if it makes sense to continue progress with the wallet or shift gears. The blockchain generator would ideally (not a guarantee and I cannot offer timelines) be hosted on AWS, which would allow self-service model for people to launch a customized blockchain with just a few clicks. None of this is certain yet.

We're also working on new messaging (which has been a work in progress for months now, with everything from the 4 pillars of blockchain tech to the new architecture narrative we created). We're working on the wireframes and copy for the new website, which will incorporate all of the new messaging and visual identity.

We're  hoping to launch all of this at the end of Feb or early March. These dates are subject to change.


[11-Jan-19 07:55 AM] PTYX#6840

[11-Jan-19 07:58 AM] Daniel CP#2020
@Regnar feel free to tag me or DM if you see stuff that needs fixing. Even if I can't do it myself, I can find out who can and pass the request along


[11-Jan-19 08:03 AM] tolken#2655
As far as marketing is concerned, I can’t remember who mentioned it, maybe PTYX. But the recent promotion of Veriblock, offering something that sounds similar to dPoW is an indication that’s there’s more room to get the word out on kmd’s dPoW. It’s a hot topic right now and perhaps could benefit from a very focused marketing pitch independent of the rest of kmd.


[11-Jan-19 08:05 AM] tolken#2655
All of the discussions that jl777 has been having with various critics is a good angle, but perhaps a bigger marketing pitch for the masses would be beneficial to pressure other projects to at least take a closer look.


[11-Jan-19 08:05 AM] tolken#2655
the average Joe out there may not understand how dPoW works, but if everyone is talking about it; they’re eventually going to want it.


[11-Jan-19 08:06 AM] PTYX#6840
we're working on our own dpow page by the way


[11-Jan-19 08:07 AM] tolken#2655
Btw, can anyone explain how Magnum Ledger fix came out of nowhere? Is that @lukechilds ‘s Ledger fix or something else?


[11-Jan-19 08:07 AM] Regnar#6164
"We might shift to the blockchain generator instead, which would mean IBN would design that for us rather than a new wallet."
What is the overall goal of this rebrand? Obviously to increase KMD value, but what is the established method of doing that? Wallets cater mostly to crypto users, which could drive value. While blockchain generation can drive value by creating more users (variety of users too) as well as dPoW, MM fees, etc. bring in more devs to create better wallets, exchange UI, etc. 
If we think like a business, we build products like wallets, if we think like a platform, we build a platform that lets others build products. I'm a fan of the latter.
What does Komodo see as the best method of creating value for KMD and the ecosystem, and will this rebrand position us to actual do that?


[11-Jan-19 08:08 AM] PTYX#6840
@tolken magnum is a wallet that came from the Guarda team


[11-Jan-19 08:08 AM] PTYX#6840
They split up and created mangum


[11-Jan-19 08:09 AM] tolken#2655
So this is Lukechilds fix that has been in works for a while?


[11-Jan-19 08:09 AM] PTYX#6840
Luke fixed the ledger's issue with being able to make a transaction that sets the nlocktime. He pushed that update to the ledger github and it was accepted.


[11-Jan-19 08:10 AM] PTYX#6840
So anyone using ledger on Komodo and is able to claim will do so thanks to luke's update


[11-Jan-19 08:11 AM] tolken#2655
Oh I thought it was some weird work around. So with the Ledger update, can you just send from and to your Ledger, like you do on Agama?


[11-Jan-19 08:11 AM] PTYX#6840
yes


[11-Jan-19 08:12 AM] PTYX#6840
you can't use the claim function yet on magnum because sapling broke functinality

New Ledger with the Bluetooth and something like Chameleon on mobile would be beautiful. Would be nice to have access to that many coins, eth, tokens etc.

with crypto or fiat


[11-Jan-19 08:27 AM] tolken#2655
@PTYX any chance Chainzilla will work toward offering STO options (specifically for the upcoming securities crypto market)? Like Polymath and Securititize?


[11-Jan-19 08:27 AM] PTYX#6840
I think that if it's an app people use at least once a week to do something in the real world it will add that much more value to it


[11-Jan-19 08:28 AM] PTYX#6840
Actually once we finish our ICO in February i have to sit down with our devs to implement the new secion for the STOs


[11-Jan-19 08:28 AM] PTYX#6840
i've already coordinated everything regarding the legality of us offering those services but we haven't promoted them.


[11-Jan-19 08:29 AM] tolken#2655
We’re exploring those options now, but it’s all so new. Leaning toward Polymath.


[11-Jan-19 08:29 AM] PTYX#6840
it's going to be a huge market


[11-Jan-19 08:29 AM] PTYX#6840
not only issuance of new securities but migrations


[11-Jan-19 08:30 AM] tolken#2655
I wish KMD was ready to get in on that, but kmd would need some specialists to grow the right legal and use CC to customize the tech accordingly.


[11-Jan-19 08:30 AM] tolken#2655
maybe chainzilla will be able to leverage it soon.


[11-Jan-19 08:30 AM] PTYX#6840
I think it will be possible to launch non-fungible tokens with CC


[11-Jan-19 08:31 AM] PTYX#6840
which is what security tokens are. basically a token that carries an identifier with it or some other metadata


[11-Jan-19 08:31 AM] tolken#2655
I think technically KMD could do it, but there’s the whole front end dApps that need to be developed for management of securities/tokens, accounts etc.


[11-Jan-19 08:32 AM] tolken#2655
Lots of work, I think Polymath is barely there


[11-Jan-19 08:32 AM] tolken#2655
The exchanges that trade securities have to be compliant with these tokens as well since they go off chain.


[11-Jan-19 08:33 AM] PTYX#6840
i agree


[11-Jan-19 08:33 AM] PTYX#6840
there's an entire infrastructure that needs to be created before issuing and trading securities on the blockchain


[11-Jan-19 08:33 AM] tolken#2655
So the first runners like Poly and Securitize will have an advantage here as they’ve been in constant negotiation/communication with exchanges to establish standards to interoperate with their token specs.


[11-Jan-19 08:35 AM] PTYX#6840
I can see them having an advantage in certain jurisdictions


[11-Jan-19 08:36 AM] Instel7#1416
What @Regnar said about "what is the goal of the rebrand" is something you guys from the inner marketing team should absolutely keep in mind, deciding between spending resources on making a new wallet or the Blockchain generator will drastically change the evolution of this Platform. I agree with Regnar on prioritizing on the blockchain generator as there are other projects from the ecosystem developing nice looking wallets, like the one from Utrum, Pungo, Chameleon from chainzilla, etc.

[11-Jan-19 08:39 AM] Instel7#1416
Yes, creating a new wallet may help a little with user adoption, but I think that what Komodo actually needs is to bring here more developers and people that will make different uses and implementation of the platform


[11-Jan-19 08:40 AM] Instel7#1416
that's something Ethereum has that Komodo is lacking


[11-Jan-19 08:41 AM] Daniel CP#2020
@Instel7 I agree with you but the marketing team doesn't control development. We were going with the wallet b/c the blockchain generator was not complete but then the Dev team had some big breakthroughs and were able to make a lot of progress very quickly.  So now we're pivoting. If we had known the blockchain genrator would be finished this soon, we prob would have focused on this from the beginning


[11-Jan-19 08:42 AM] Daniel CP#2020
And yes, bringing in more developers is a key focus

The scope of the rebrand is not a new logo and website.  If that was the case, we'd have it completed in a month. The current website was built in 3 weeks which is a clear example.


[11-Jan-19 08:59 AM] n2okpride#1967
The delays have come from having to make decisions on which product the ux/ui focus will be on as it is a key component of the rebrand launch.

[11-Jan-19 09:03 AM] n2okpride#1967
there are other dependencies and decisions that need to be made across the team. gaining agreement and consensus on things, along with understanding developmental timelines isn't something that is easily and quickly accomplished


[11-Jan-19 09:04 AM] n2okpride#1967
many of these decisions will dictate the strategic priorities of komodo in 2019. these things cannot be rushed and the rebrand is a vehicle to launch all these things together


[11-Jan-19 09:04 AM] n2okpride#1967
it'd make sense to launch one thing at a time.

[11-Jan-19 09:10 AM] Regnar#6164
**Assumptions leading to Question:**
Komodo has been a platform in which products are built on top that either utilize KMD, or utilize services of 3rd parties that hopefully drive back value to KMD and Komodo. Asset chains for example drive back value to the Komodo ecosystem through dPoW costs, tech development (like Verus), bringing more users who may buy KMD, use contracts paid in KMD, use BarterDEX (generate fees), Jumblr(fees) and others.

But technically things like Jumblr, BarterDEX, etc are not exactly Komodo (from my understanding) though mostly developed by the same devs that are on the Komodo team. They are 3rd party programs, apps, services that create more value for the platform. They generate revenue from the service itself being valuable (not a token required to be used for the service) but then use the revenue collected to purchase KMD on open market and distribute to their owners (creating demand for KMD). Broad generalization btw.

**Question:**
As Komodo rebrands (or positions itself in the market building tools catered to certain target markets) is the goal to continue this cycle, 3rd party development of products and services with attempts to tie those services into the value of KMD (without choking innovation and adoption like ETH), or is Komodo going to look to establish it's own products, partnerships, services? and can it technically make partnerships with companies without having a foundation (non code-controlling) or some other "entity" to sign papers?

For example I think of Mozilla Foundation.

Here are some highlights from 2018 @PTYX 😄 

We have had no big investments in paid ads or promotions which means all of the growth below has come about from the excellent tech, word-of-mouth and the work we’ve put into our community. 

Email Marketing: delivered 828,419 emails, of which 115,737 were opened resulting in 10,532 clicks.

Infographic Content (viral contest) using Gleam.io generated 10,989 actions and attracted 1047 people to take part. Drove 2.9K users to Reddit which saw a big spike in subscribers and 715 to our email newsletter.

A large rise in the daily views on Facebook in 2018 where we’re getting many 100s compared to 2017 where we were getting single digit daily views.

Our Reddit community has grown from 1K subscribers in Sept 2017 to 8.2K subscribers in Dec 2018.

Community Onboarding: created welcome posts on Reddit, Discord and via automation in an email to new subscribers via automation was introduced with a welcome email which currently has a 62.2% open rate and 20.4% click-through-rate (very high).

Migrated from Slack to Discord and reorganised the channels for better navigation and onboarding.

Increased our scores on Binance and ICObench as a result of outreach in Dec 2018.

Applied and accepted on three crypto portfolio apps to publish our updates on to their audience.

@Mylo @Bryan_Beus  pls have a look here: https://twitter.com/paddykcl/status/1084591275234467845  
this would help in getting more developers to know Komodo. For sponsorship my funds are available. Mostly is needed a good video presentation of CC for developers

the ICObench overview is quite good for being so short: https://icobench.com/ico/komodo I spot only 2 minor mistakes about the Ico: only 20% were sold to new investors, the other 70% were distributed to Bitcoindark holders since Komodo has an old history, then in the financial tab it say it was an erc20 on Ethereum

[31-Jan-19 06:23 AM] PTYX#6840
If you need managed services, please reach out to hello@chainzilla.io


[31-Jan-19 06:25 AM] linuxchip#2621
OK


[31-Jan-19 06:26 AM] linuxchip#2621
@PTYX is there any demo available


[31-Jan-19 06:26 AM] linuxchip#2621
i mean is there any kind of sales demo can be arranged


[31-Jan-19 06:27 AM] PTYX#6840
Yes, please write me an email at hello@chainzilla.io and I'll send you the brochures, and we can coordinate a meeting in order to walk you through what KICs can do.


[31-Jan-19 06:27 AM] linuxchip#2621
what is managed services ?


[31-Jan-19 06:27 AM] PTYX#6840
(KIC) Komodo Independent Chain


[31-Jan-19 06:27 AM] linuxchip#2621
OK


[31-Jan-19 06:27 AM] PTYX#6840
If you are a developer and have a team, you don't need managed services


[31-Jan-19 06:27 AM] linuxchip#2621
I think its better to have a call and discuss more


[31-Jan-19 06:28 AM] PTYX#6840
If you don't have a dev team but have everything else, Chainzilla can launch and manage your blockchain for you on Komodo.


[31-Jan-19 06:28 AM] PTYX#6840
Sure, send me the email and let's coordinate a call.


[31-Jan-19 06:28 AM] linuxchip#2621
Is chainzilla from Komado


[31-Jan-19 06:28 AM] linuxchip#2621
or other


[31-Jan-19 06:28 AM] PTYX#6840
It's a Komodo service provider

@linuxchip Hi! Welcome to Komodo. Glad to hear that you're looking to build with Komodo.

As PTYX just mentioned, ChainZilla is one of our Komodo service providers. That is one option.

The other service provider we have is Luis Garcia @siu  who runs ChainMakers. You can view their website here:

is there any new script added to Komodo website? I can't load it with Firefox, I have the NoScript extension but it worked until yesterday, so it must be some old script I blocked elsewhere that now has been integrated in Komodo website


[01-Feb-19 07:50 AM] Regnar#6164

I keep seeing people suggest we 'contact' certain people to make new content, or reach out to exchanges for listings, etc. but most of the time this stuff costs money, listing fees, interview fees, etc. We should have a fundraising page since we are a community, where we have addresses dedicated to particular projects. So KMD/BTC/other addresses specifically for "exchange listing fees", or marketing, or bounty support, UX/UI developer costs. or whatever else. I'm sure we can come up with some pretty mutually exclusive/collectively exhaustive buckets to simplify it.


[01-Feb-19 07:58 AM] Regnar#6164
For example, Development expenses, Marketing and partnerships, Listing fees, dPoW notarization fees. or something


[01-Feb-19 07:59 AM] Regnar#6164
I always see you posting bounties @KomodoWorld which is why I suggest this


[01-Feb-19 07:59 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think the people more asking for it are probably the less likely to donate


[01-Feb-19 07:59 AM] Regnar#6164
I agree


[01-Feb-19 08:00 AM] Regnar#6164
but it still stands that we should be able to point people to a location where they CAN if they want


[01-Feb-19 08:00 AM] Regnar#6164
and actually select where they want their funds to go. I'm not really for paying listing fees to exchanges, especially being established and on major exchanges already, so I wouldn't donate to that pool. etc


[01-Feb-19 08:01 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
well, all that is needed on the website is a list of donation addresses for specific purposes

[01-Feb-19 08:02 AM] Regnar#6164
I imagine something like this <https://airdropvenezuela.org/> where it just has simple addresses for each. and you can click on a bucket and see what exactly those funds will be used for, exclusively


[01-Feb-19 08:02 AM] Regnar#6164
right


[01-Feb-19 08:07 AM] Regnar#6164
Like saying "development expenses" entails hiring 3rd party developers to fill skills needs we don't currently have in house, or expanding into areas we may not have a lot of industry expertise in (IoT devices, Supply chain development, or w.e.) things that are niche but are industries Komodo products would do well in. or even supplementing for current developers who are being paid. 
"Marketing" would be partnerships, conference costs, travel to meet person to person with execs, content providers, outreach etc.


[01-Feb-19 08:07 AM] Regnar#6164
like I said, there are probably some pretty solid buckets we can create that are mutually exclusive and cover all reasonable ground

I feel like we have a lot of stuff that is depreciated still in the docs, sometimes it says it's depreciated up top, and other times it only says it's depreciated as a response. 
For example:
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/komodo-api/wallet.html#getaccountaddress>
^ Has depreciated in the tip up top. 

<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/komodo-api/wallet.html#getaccount>

[02-Feb-19 03:15 AM] jorian#4555
at a first glance: `built atop an unsturdy foundation` isn't that a bit too difficult language? i had to reread it 3 times. also, a Read More would be nice to have in there, since not much technicals are given in there


[02-Feb-19 03:15 AM] jorian#4555
otherwise, good to have this!


[02-Feb-19 03:16 AM] jorian#4555
and more as a general note: it looks like all the text is written in some headline font. spacing is weird between letters and so it doesn't read that 'fluidly' like a book


[02-Feb-19 03:22 AM] Daniel CP#2020
About the language, you're probably right, we could simplify


[02-Feb-19 03:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Not many technical details, but this is mostly intended to capture interest and have people contact Komodo for more info


[02-Feb-19 03:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Just a hook, so to speak


[02-Feb-19 03:24 AM] Daniel CP#2020
About the spacing, not sure exactly what you mean but it might be due to the "justify" alignment. We can play around with it


[02-Feb-19 03:24 AM] Daniel CP#2020
This is just v1, we can always improve : )


[02-Feb-19 05:30 AM] yorklab#7270
This was well written. As a non-techy I was able to understand without too much thought - of course I've been here a while so that helped also. The ```built atop an unsturdy foundation``` part does have a somewhat negative tone to it and perhaps could be re-written in a better way, but it otherwise seems fine.


[02-Feb-19 08:51 AM] Regnar#6164
"Attackers  cannot  re-org  any  blocks  that  were  mined  prior  to  the  notarization, **uinless** they first overpower the KMD network and..." pg 6


[02-Feb-19 09:05 AM] Regnar#6164
Also "In 2018 alone, 10 separate attacks led to more than $23 Million in losses." or a close variant of it has been stated 4 times in the promotional. reading through the promo it feels repetitive, and not in a way that solidifies the point. I think we could probably change the wording a bit. my two sats


[02-Feb-19 09:18 AM] Regnar#6164
My revision of first page:
"Without adequate security, a blockchain project cannot thrive. Therefore it is paramount that a project's blockchain be strong enough to withstand attacks that undermine it's integrity and immutability. Traditionally, the solution was an expensive arms race of hashpower, forking mining algorithms to counter an ever-growing ASIC market, or novelty consensus mechanisms that compromise decentralization. Fortunately, there is an easy solution. Komodo’s Blockchain Security Service uses proven technology that protects every integrated blockchain with the power of the Bitcoin network, for a tiny fraction of the cost."

@Daniel CP In the Year-End report under "Community & Social Media " it states +425% growth and 8.2 subscribers. That subscriber number sounds just a bit low. 🙂


[02-Feb-19 06:00 PM] PTYX#6840
But it was much lower definitely


[03-Feb-19 12:10 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Thanks for the feedback and comments guys. 

@yorklab  425% growth is accurate. Jan 1, 2018 was under 2K subscribers to the subreddit. We saw a lot of growth in Jan and Feb, before the market really tanked, and then also a huge surge when we ran the infographic contest. I think we grew by 1.5K from the infographic contest alone


[03-Feb-19 12:10 AM] Daniel CP#2020
@Regnar thanks for spotting that typo, I will fix that now


[03-Feb-19 12:11 AM] Daniel CP#2020
About the other comments- let me explain a bit.

The first paragraph is extremely negative. This is intentional. It provides strong contrast between 1st and 2nd paragraphs, and highlights the importance of Komodo's solution.


[03-Feb-19 12:15 AM] Daniel CP#2020
In general, in copywriting, you want to clearly identify the problem and your "customer's pain points" in the parlance of the industry. The formula is generally explain the problem--> identify the  ways that this is problem is impacting your customer's life--> present the solution --> explain the benefits of the solution and how much better your customer's life will be after the buy your product/service

If a 51% attack is not something that a person has ever thought about or worries about, then Komodo's Blockchain Security Service is not for them. If they have worried about a 51% attack, then we essentially want to harness that negative emotion for a brief moment before introducing Komodo's solution


[03-Feb-19 12:18 AM] Daniel CP#2020
Also, the copy you suggested is great @Regnar , but it's taking a different approach. You've suggested several different solutions and then present Komodo's as the best one. This method is a bit trickier and requires much more analysis. Right now, Komodo has the only third-party security solution in the blockchain space so mentioning other ways of mitigating the risk of a 51% attack probably isn't the way we want to do things. This is especially true if we don't give those other potential solutions a thorough examination at any other point in the brochure


[03-Feb-19 12:19 AM] Daniel CP#2020
As for the mention of $23 Million lost in 51% attacks, I count 3 mentions of that and each one is on a different page


[03-Feb-19 12:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020
It's important to remember that very few people are gonna sit down and read this things front to back. All of you guys have read every word of the brochure, which is great and I thank you for that. 

But for ordinary potential customers, I'd say we have somewhere between 1 and 2 minutes of people's attention before they move on to something else. 

In those 60--120 seconds, what do we want them to learn?

-- 51% attacks are a serious problem. More than $23 Million has been stolen in 51% attacks in the last 12 months 
-- Komodo has a third-party solution that protects any UTXO-based blockchain with the power of the BTC network
-- 6 blockchain projects are already using Komodo's Blockchain Security Service and a major crypto exchange has officially endorsed it


[03-Feb-19 12:23 AM] Daniel CP#2020
If a reader can come away with those 3 key pieces of info, this brochure is a huge win


[03-Feb-19 12:24 AM] Daniel CP#2020
One last thought-- Komodo has an awesome community and we appreciate everything you guys do to help the project. But, ultimately, our marketing materials are not made for you guys. I don't say that in any kind of mean way but you guys are just not the target audience


[03-Feb-19 12:26 AM] Daniel CP#2020
We need to grow-- our community, our developers, our social media following, our investors. That means reaching new people who have no idea what Komodo is or maybe have heard of Komodo but don't really know what the project is all about. Everything we produce will be created with this audience in mind so please bear with us if it seems like we're repeating ourselves, our like we're recycling content, or like we're just publishing the same stuff over and over. All of this is intentional.


[03-Feb-19 12:28 AM] Daniel CP#2020
There might be a few hundred people who read everything Komodo publishes and we're very grateful for these people but we need to grow beyond that small, dedicated following


[03-Feb-19 12:28 AM] Daniel CP#2020

In general we are looking into what kind of products we want to develop. We have talked about the Agama Wallet rebrand, which is user facing product, but we also want to build tools for the developers/businesses.

Does the upcoming KMD/USD pairing Bittrex have something to do with the rebrand?  Kind of seems like it's coming out of nowhere


[05-Feb-19 06:18 PM] Audo#5667
Bittrex is a quality excange and they want to support quality projects. They contacted us to tell that they have decided to add KMD/USD pair. It's not directly linked with rebrand, but I'm sure our project's activity boosts the confidence of all exchanges in general.

@benohanlon I have a few suggestions for Linkedin contacts if they aren't already in your list

First are the 4 guys of <https://51pct.io/> listed at the end of the main page, they published a 2 parts article for their subscribers about interoperability:
<https://51pct.io/interoperability-and-composability-killer-of-redundant-blockchains-part-1/>
<https://51pct.io/polkadot-vs-cosmos-the-disastrous-issue-and-crowning-a-winner-part-2/>
mainly about Cosmos and Polkadot with some mention of other projects but nothing about Komodo 

Second I found this other article about interoperability on Fitzener Blockchain consulting:
<https://fitznerblockchain.consulting/interoperability-the-key-to-unlocking-the-potential-of-blockchain/> again there are some projects mentioned but not Komodo. There are profiles of 3 founders in the about page


[07-Feb-19 01:25 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I notice that Vaibhav Sani < https://www.linkedin.com/in/vasadev/> hasn't yet updated his ContractPedia  with Komodo: <https://hackernoon.com/contractpedia-an-encyclopedia-of-40-smart-contract-platforms-4867f66da1e5> did he ever answer to your message?

[08-Feb-19 04:12 PM] Regnar#6164
Suggestion for the chainlizards product (I don't know if this was planned already) but I assume there is agama/barterdex integration options, is there an explorer option as well? I'm thinking if they want the explorer it creates a <YOURCOIN.explorer.dexstats> explorer for them. 

With this it might also be a cool idea to have a live demo with modular color schemes, description, and logos for their custom explorer. I'm thinking if they provided a logo, we use the logo on the page and also extract the colors from the logo to create a way to simply click and change the color scheme of their explorer using the extracted colors (add a regular palette too) they could even match it to their external websites colors if they have one. They then fill in a type box of their chain's description, and another field for their website URL if they have one. 

Then while looking at the demo, they finalize it all and we add the Wallet: <link agama> Exchanges: <link BarterDEX>, and some "powered by Komodo" logo or something too. Basically a modular way to build something like the PIRATE explorer <https://explorer.pirate.black/> which looks like a different wrapper on the regular kmd.explorer.


Along with the explorer should be clearer, on-page API documentation so they don't have to go through insight github looking for docs, and also know what APIs will be activated (total supply, circulating supply, active wallets, or other metrics that are useful for businesses and 3rd parties, like if they are building their own mobile wallets) 

With this explorer and the APIs, we can then pass along all this information they have already filled out to this form <https://coinpaprika.com/add/> or perhaps work out a better way with coinpaprika, in order to list their new coin. There's a lot of extra detail they would be better off going to coinpaprika to do themselves, but the initial listing is valuable and only possible with API endpoints to a valid explorer for things like circulating supply.


[08-Feb-19 04:12 PM] Regnar#6164
Basically I laid out a lot of steps, but it would be a huge value add to simply point and click your own custom explorer to be added, have it match your projects colors simply(palette extractor) and have the relevant API endpoints available on the explorer and submitted to Coinpaprika (I use them because they have been super helpful when I submit changes and API updates for Komodo projects)


[08-Feb-19 04:24 PM] Regnar#6164
Eventually you could add more modular options to their explorers, like Faucets, bootstraps, mining pool info, and expand the analytics and charts sections to include transactions, tx/s, active addresses, 2 week value transferred by day, 2 week tx count by day, 2 week address growth by day. Again, all value added stuff. Whether we charge for the value added or not, Idk

As @PTYX mentioned in general, it would be great exposure and have more projects flock to get dpow for their chain?


[09-Feb-19 11:17 AM] Regnar#6164
@Audo I meant to tag you with that massive message I wrote ^^^ 
TLDR - Click and build project-color themed block explorers, upgrade statistics/analytics charts and trackers on explorers, clearer API documentation on explorer pages, automatically submit new coin info/logos/links/APIs to Coinpaprika, CMC, Coingecko etc for listings. All part of Chainlizard click and build blockchains.


[09-Feb-19 11:22 AM] Regnar#6164
Another idea, again I haven't messed with chainlizard so I'm not sure if it's there already, would be selecting airdrop as a method of distribution. Pick which coin you want to airdrop to (any coin in the ecosystem), select ratio to drop, some basic things like minimum 10 coins in address, max 100k or something, and it calculates how many coins it will create to do the drop (this part is iffy and would probably be better as an estimate) and then pick the date/time/or block number to do the airdrop.


[13-Feb-19 09:22 AM] n2okpride#1967
@Cryptoon  i've tried to push dpow to binance awhile back unsuccessfully. My assumption is that being a market leader, they would want to build value-add features and credibility in their own technical stack versus endorsing a project. If you remember back to the CZ interview on Fortune.com, he pointed out that Komodo and Tendermint would be the 'future platfoms' to succeed. I'm sure he's aware we're the leader in atomic swaps, but they chose to use tendermint to build a proxy dex. The difference being KMD is a coin listed on their exchange, and tendermint not having one. But then again he endorsed that BTT ICO nonsense. just a bit of speculation on my end.

I would probably play a ton more pixel dungeon if all my items were on a chain and I could trade them for KMD, BTC, or other items 😄 also pvp mode would be cool. to top it all off there could be a pixel city where players go to trade items for KMD and Rogue. basically players could open up a trade menu, select the items, and it atomic swaps them.

@Regnar  Any new games should be built on another chain, but that **IS** the point of the current game, to get devs to blockchainify their games on KMD.  Pixel Dungeon seems to be the community picked candidate. I think they might look into it, they've been reached out to several times, myself included. 😉 Their community requesting it from them would be the ultimate approach. I think it would be amazing if Pixel Dungeon built their game on KMD! 
It's *my* understanding that the needed underlying tech for something like Pixel Dungeon to be made on KMD , including it being on mobile, will be finished by the end of the year. (Please do not quote me on that)

There are thousands of AWS partners so it could be a non-event, but here is a little info on the AWS tier program. It does say near the bottom that with the Advance partnership one of several benefits is funding.

@Regnar what is Watabou? I need more of a reminder than just the name.


[20-Feb-19 04:04 AM] Regnar#6164
@benohanlon  my bad I tagged you on Twitter and posted about him here, it's also the github link from monday with Mylo. Watabou is the creator of pixel Dungeon, a roguelike game for computers and mobile. Over 5Million downloads on google playstore.

He had liked this tweet, but he could just like every tweet tagging him, so I was wondering if we were able to follow up with him to see if he was interested in designing a game using Rogue CC.


[20-Feb-19 08:00 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I reached out to him via email last week as well. There's a good chance they're looking to see what we can do.


[20-Feb-19 10:38 AM] Regnar#6164
I think that would be a great help, to get an established game producer to build with RogueCC. I'm not sure how we can really showcase what RogueCC can do, I have to read more into it and look for a great selling point. I also don't know what exactly about it would get Watabou to build on it, like a series of unique points that can't be gained elsewhere.

[20-Feb-19 02:51 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@Regnar  Ideally they would  use Crypto Conditions to incorporate Pixel Dungeon with their Blockchain. CC is mainly what is being showcased here.  I will go ahead and put together a write bout how/what/why of it all.  Gotta finish up some marketing  plots first. (mapping out a year+)  😃


[20-Feb-19 02:53 PM] Cryptofist#7504
In a year from now I want to be chatting with game devs  daily, explaining how awesome CC and CC Mobile is for gaming. and recruiting them to the Komodosphere of Games


[20-Feb-19 02:54 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Pixel Dungeon, Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup I reached out to first alongside some game studios. One more point of contact too... that is specifically for Rogue.  If any one of them responds to me ill be beyond ecstatic.


[20-Feb-19 03:00 PM] Regnar#6164
@Cryptofist I'm a bit of a novice programming wise but is rogueCC kinda like RPC calls that can be incorporated into in-game actions? Or do games have to display with a pretty graphic what the rogue game is showing in texts?


[20-Feb-19 03:07 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I believe so, RogueCC only works with the Rogue Game or interfaces based off of it( graphics in game, GUI, menus, etc) 
We could change all of the outputs (monster names/item names) use the drawing in ascii for specific graphics to display too, so you could make something like a Pirate themed version of Rogue  that would be on the same chain. 

... and that's just RogueCC though.  JL777c can work with other devs to make say PixelDngCC, FortniteCC and the like. 

I believe there wil/ be specific engine based CC contracts at some point as that makes some sense to have framework built.

There was some discussions I had with JL about the games, in short Rogue can be altered but not changed to an engine that is different, without severely heavy dev work. 

What can also be done is add additional features to the game on the outside (DEX, leaderboard, multiplayer, etc) this is where the tech will grab the gaming industry by the horns. There is a TON of possibilities here....


[20-Feb-19 03:35 PM] Regnar#6164
is there a way to stream games as you play?


[20-Feb-19 05:14 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Sure, you can just use a regular streamer set up. Something like OBS studio.

@Cryptofist @Regnar  the pixeldungeon dev was the first i asked @benohanlon to dm as he's got an opensource roguelike with nice graphics that CC might be able to breathe new life in.  one thing we have to understand is that many of these devs might not understand that blockchain doesn't  necessarily means cryptocurrency. Might be a turn off to open source devs when you start talking about tokenization and blockchain. We've got to better understand the current limitations that blockchain might be able to overcome. i.e. Roguelikes are traditionally single player...with cc rogue we can enable multiplayer and tournament modes that weren't possible before.

@n2okpride Absolutely! It's going to take some time for developers outside the space to not only fully understand the possibilities, but to also trust the space.  I hope that the information I present and ideas I bring to the table help with both of those aspects. I've been making a point to keep in mind that we are showcasing the tech and trying convert people *outside of* the space to be our brothers and sisters under the banner of blockchain enthusiasts.

looks like they help with monetizing of games as well (not just their own like Runescape and old-runescape) it might be a good opportunity to get in their ear about using blockchains for games and they may try to gain experience and knowledge to pass on those recommendations to their clients

That is less OSRS players than I thought there were! There is a custom bot building service for  OSRS called dreambot., mostly for farming gold. It's amazing to see what people come out with between code + gaming. 

I wonder how Jagex would feel offering blockchain services to their clients...  I think they may want to see the current PoC we have in full gear then maybe make something on komodo themselves. If that works out I can see Jagex becoming a leader in decentralized gaming......


[21-Feb-19 10:20 PM] Regnar#6164

I think a lot of other blockchain projects are looking for dApp developers (or blockchain game people), but should be looking for traditional game developers who understand all the non blockchain parts of building a game/community/ecosystem, and then bring the expertise and tools from Komodo

from a marketing standpoint, does it seem like a good idea to draw Exchange attention towards this tweet? On one hand it shows the Einsteinium is a target for attacks (exchanges may feel it's risky) on the other it shows that dPoW is doing what it's designed to do and protecting EMC2. I think this is a good way to show Exchanges additional examples that dPoW works and reduce any doubt they may have. I'm curious if anyone thinks this may be taken the wrong way and hurt EMC2 project?


[24-Feb-19 12:07 PM] yorklab#7270
If I were an investor looking into buying EMC2 I would feel much safer knowing this. I think it's good news for Einsteinium and perhaps no longer a target for attacks.


[24-Feb-19 12:25 PM] Regnar#6164
yea true. I personally think Bittrex and UpBit (Especially Bittrex after the BTG attack) would be very happy to see this, but I'm looking through the lens of a pro-Komodo business minded person, I was hoping to get some opposite insight. I was thinking of tagging Bittrex and UpBit on twitter too.

Once hailed as unhackable, blockchains are now getting hacked
More and more security holes are appearing in cryptocurrency and smart contract platforms, and some are fundamental to the way they were built.

Any news on the rebrand? Seems its being going on a very long time


[02-Mar-19 11:51 AM] Audo#5667
Hey Sdunbar, thanks for asking. I would say there are three components that all must be finished. 
1) We have few different dev projects going on simultaniously, for example few weeks ago we gave this sneak peak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaH8oR5nXpg
2) Business & product strategies have to be finalized
3) Marketing messaging & branding has to be completed

We have done good progress on all aspects, but none of them is finished – and they all must be fully finished for us to go online with the rebrand.

Expect it all to still take time. We are not rushing this as it's important for our long term success. Our rebrand is not about marketing, but more developing a product and business development.

I keep hearing how most of the real Bitcoin trading is on the OTC platforms; that's where supposedly most of the institutional investors are buying. Wouldn't Komodo's new mobile DEX (and desktop of course also)  be considered an OTC platform? When it's ready, shouldn't Komodo be pointing their tweets and advertisement towards those who rely on the OTC platforms?

Many reasons. The rebrand is about much more than just a new logo and a new website. We're releasing a few new products and want to really redefine Komodo to accompany the go-to-market


[06-Mar-19 03:57 AM] Daniel CP#2020

We did consult that with IBN, and their recommendation was to keep it – which was also the majority consensus within our team. It is a strong name and easy to pronounce around the world.

What are the guidelines for external projects using KMD/DPoW brand in their materials? I see a trend where many projects are using KMD DPoW to market themselves, but have never spoken to KMD before, nor have paid for DPoW. It's concerning.

```Which of these products and improvements should our developers prioritize?

ProtonMail improvements
ProtonVPN improvements
Encrypted calendar
Encrypted file storage
*Blockchain services such as a cryptocurrency wallet*
Encrypted notes
Encrypted password manager```

This was on a Protonmail survey, I'm pretty sure we already reach out to them (as probably a lot of other projects do) but there may be a multicoin wallet we can offer, as well as of course pushing them to acknowledge dPoW notarizations and some ecosystem projects.

looks like Coinpaprika is making a mobile app/wallet with built in exchange.


[18-Mar-19 09:39 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm talking with them on Twitter to see if they would be interested in checking out the mobile DEX and mm2 backend. their goal is ```"we want to make it possible for everybody to purchase any coin that is available on coinpaprika, it will take some time, but we're sure we'll accomplish it!"``` which means wallet integration and buying


[18-Mar-19 09:40 AM] Regnar#6164
I don't see how they will accomplish this with traditional exchanges or 3rd parties like shapeshift etc. because they have 2430 coins listed on their site... probably a thousand or more that aren't supported by those services

Hey just a thought, but we may need an article showing the differences between building games and NFTs with Komodo vs building them with things like Counterparty.
Also I do like the Counterparty explorer especially their API documentation on it. https://xchain.io/


[19-Mar-19 07:58 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Regnar tbh, reviews by independent bloggers would be better; else you get "biased" articles. Komodo has amazing features, yet the gaming part isn't super easy to onboard.... yet


[19-Mar-19 08:08 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea definitely, I'm thinking more like what Pirate does. It's pretty objective <https://medium.com/piratechain/monero-xmr-vs-pirate-arrr-d3398dbd9500>
But it could be a marketing piece


[19-Mar-19 09:44 PM] Mylo#8306
Yes eventually.  The onboarding and documentation and sample projects will allow us to provide a self service system.  Currently there is a lot of synchronous communication required.  I'm working on that part with sidd gcharang alright support input and testers inputs.

IBM opened a gunport first. 
IBM Blockchain World Wire is a cross-country payment system. 
the reason why large companies can take the initiative in what international organizations will do is because of blockchain. 
just as the Internet has approached the public under the name of the World Wide Web (WWW), IBM's WorldWire (WW) may be the first blockchain used by global citizens.

on top of the innovation driven by the Internet and smartphones, a payment war is underway for global IT companies. IT companies such as Apple, Samsung, Google, Alibaba, Facebook and Twitter all have entered the war with their respective weapons or are choosing to breathe in to jump in. the war began with the replacement of credit cards, initially called plastic money. but the Internet has no borders, so the goal of a payment war will inevitably result in creating an Internet currency that can transcend borders. the standard position is glorious, but the war is fierce because it is cramped.

numerous assets on the blockchain trustless platform will gain monetary status, but roughly 2 percent short of global identification. money is global, but if you can't identify who it is, the existing financial network, credit cards, which also confirm who it is, may be better.

And "Approximately 75% of blocks in the Komodo blockchain are mined by Notary Nodes" I forget if this is by design or if this has just been the case. If it's the latter the sentence should probably read "Approximately 75% of blocks in the Komodo blockchain have been mined by Notary Nodes"

In order to approach complex phenomena, the question may have to be rather simple.

When i first dug into Bitcoin, there was something that was simply unacceptable in mainstream economic thinking. 

So i asked myself a simple question and wanted to make a decision. 

Can the government stop it? 
It seemed self-evident that the government would try to stop it if it could. 

But what if you can't stop it? 

Of course, not all of them, but I thought there must be a government on the planet led by the elite who thought they should lead if they can't stop it.

In 1 week I bring on the #Komodo team to discuss $KMD, how to create a custom #blockchain, and their DEX. 

What questions does the #crypto community want me to ask.

RT and leave your questions in the comments.
Twitter


[19-Apr-19 08:09 AM] Berg#2666
Would it be possible for KMD to help HUSH by leveraging their scale for marketing?
HUSH has recently upgraded and become a KMD AC, with lots of exciting things in the works.
We're hoping that we can find support in the KMD community to help us gain some traction, whether it be Twitter, Blogs, Forums, Exchange Outreach, etc.
Anything is much appreciated.

If you haven't already, join us on Discord!

Hey @Berg 

Can you brief us about all the dev things going on? I'm afraid we haven't had the time to follow you guys closely.

It would be great to highlight what kind of contributions your team is making for the Komodo ecosystem.


[19-Apr-19 08:21 AM] Berg#2666
We were the first coin to convert to become a KMD Asset Chain, Komodo did a case study on the HUSH v3 upgrade as well, which I'm not sure if it's published or intended to be or not.


[19-Apr-19 08:35 AM] Audo#5667
yeah that one is not published yet.

We will of course promote that once it's out


[19-Apr-19 08:43 AM] Berg#2666
Awesome


[19-Apr-19 08:45 AM] Berg#2666
Our biggest concern is our current uphill battle with liquidity, as Cryptopia faltered and left us with extremely low volume.
We're hoping that the Komodo team can assist us with getting our foot in the door for some exchange listings, as we're now extremely easy to list for exchanges that already offer Komodo trading.
I'm hoping that we can work together to help push HUSH in the right direction.


[19-Apr-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
exchange listings are simply about paying crazy fees. there seems to be no otherway


[19-Apr-19 12:44 PM] Chipmoon#7477
or maybe polish up the whitepaper and do IEO on an exchange and you will get automatically listed on the exchange


[19-Apr-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
but there must be a fee for IEO, probably comparable to listing


[19-Apr-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no free meals? something like that


[19-Apr-19 12:53 PM] Chipmoon#7477
IF the exchange gets the fees from the funds raised then It's win win, the project gets new funds and listed on exchange at the same time


[19-Apr-19 12:54 PM] Chipmoon#7477
But if the project has to pay the fee upfront, then it is another case


[19-Apr-19 06:11 PM] PTYX#6840
IEOs are costing around 10% of funds raised plus a listing fee between 5-30 bitcoins


[19-Apr-19 06:12 PM] PTYX#6840
Some exchanges have different arrangements though.

@Berg it s not even launched, but you are already on Barterlly's prod servers with HUSH3


[19-Apr-19 11:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
btw @FabØ had to list OUR and maybe ZEX, maybe you could get in touch


[20-Apr-19 01:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@PTYX dont forget the trading fees on the huge volume following the listing

Why are there no twitter Posts about the Dex and the mm2? Think this is huge and should be shared with the public. A part from gains, a bit more volume in kmd would be nice. More volume will lead to usdt pair on binance i guess?

same engine, different GUI

@AALEXJ it's a very good overview, only the initial phrase sounds strange: "During the last two weeks, we have not seen much progress, but despite this fact, there is something interesting." then you follow up with a string of recent news that would make most other projects pale in comparison 😄


[26-Apr-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
also i didnt say an explorer for all komodo projects as there is really no way to know about all of them, but rather a combined ecosystem stats for the chains that we know about

Yes, agreed.  These things have long ago been identified and why the tech continues to be made and a rebrand of what komodo is, who it caters for and the tech and services it provided.

What does success mean to you?

Hello
Few weeks ago, jl777c asked to NN candidates to help to support coins using block explorers. Jl777 wanted that each block explorer display a banner with links to other assetchain. I heard that kmd marketing team is doing the list of coins that need support. Do you have a first example of the list ? (With social media links of each AC of the list if possible)


[06-May-19 09:40 AM] phm87#7395
I'm hosting a block explorer for chips (it should be ready about tomorrow) and I'd like to add the banner discussed (or develop it with help of other NN candidates)


[06-May-19 09:40 AM] phm87#7395
Thank you


[06-May-19 09:52 AM] Mylo#8306
@phm87  it will be small inoffesive _text_ banner - will likely just need to adjust some css to make banner taller for a line of text linking to projects


[06-May-19 09:53 AM] phm87#7395
I used an iquidus but I may use sth else later. I can have a look if some code is already developed

It's not a very good idea to tell anyone everything you know, unless you're a believer in perfectly conventional things. 

then who are you going to tell? 
You can tell anyone if you need to, but never anyone else. 
there is actually a good standard to do so. 
the most appropriate middle road between "not telling anyone" and " telling everyone," that's the company.

the best entrepreneurs must know this. 
because all great companies are built on hidden secrets that are hidden from others. a great company is nothing short of a plan to change the world. If you shared a hidden secret that only you knew, the other party is now a conspirator.

you can't separate from society and become independent. believing that alone is enough is not a characteristic of a strong individual, but just a characteristic for someone who misunderstood public worship(or jeering) as truth. the biggest risk for a start-up is to be so convinced of his own myths that he becomes a lunatic. the same risk of penetrating all enterprises is to mistake the awakening as wisdom after losing all meaning myths.

Engineers always try to make great products that are 'sold automatically'. But if anyone says this about a real product, he must be lying. He is either mistaken (in lying to himself) or willing to sell something (without thinking so).

In the world of business, this is often said to warn of the opposite. "The best product doesn't necessarily win." Economists say it's because of 'path dependence.' In other words, certain historical environments, independent of objective quality, can determine which products will be widely accepted. True, but that doesn't mean that the key arrangement we use now is purely accidental. Rather, it is better to think of distribution as a necessary part of the product. If you have invented something new, but you have not invented a way to sell it effectively, your business will be terrible. No matter how good the product is, it's no use.

Outstanding sales and distribution can create monopoly in itself. Even if there is no product differentiation at all. No matter how powerful the product is (even if it fits into existing habits and those who have tried it themselves immediately come to like it), it should be backed up with a strong distribution plan.

you've probably heard of the word 'first mover advantage.' a company that enters a market for the first time can gain significant market share while other competitors are rushing around. but moving first is just a strategy, not a goal. what really matters is to generate cash flows in the future.

so it's no use being the first mover if someone follows in and takes the top spot. I'd rather be a 'last mover' than that. that is, the last great development in a particular market is to enjoy exclusive profit for several years, even decades. the way to do so is to take over a small niche, then expand its scale from there and move toward an ambitious long-term vision. business is similar to chess in this respect. Jose Raul caplablanca, who became the "grandmaster" of chess players, said. to succeed, "Study the last card before anything else."

[17-May-19 02:52 AM] richardt#2807
By investing/speculating on KMD, you're really hoping that one day the tech will finally win over hype.  Since KMD is open source, you're also hoping no other project out there with more funding/resources will simply just copy it and market it better 😶

I struggle with the same thing that others do in regard to the frustration of kmd price and perceived market value. It hasn't been very clear over the years exactly what sets kmd apart from the other coins. To the public the other coins are easier to understand and easy to market , hence easy to speculate. Kmd changes so fast is harder for the public to pin down exactly what it is, ICO platform, decentralized DEX, DPOW service, CC, etc. This I assume is why the Ideas by Nature was brought in to do rebrand. The harder concept to get across though seems to be kmd is advertising to projects as a place to build, and the projects through advertising themselves ultimately advertise kmd and userbase grows. The thing for anxious speculators to do seems to be either help advertise to new projects, or support the projects that are appearing so as they can naturally be the ones to market kmd. Ie: Help advertise chainmakers, pirate, k64, redfoxlabs, etc


[17-May-19 07:34 AM] Audo#5667
righ, we are trying to address this on the rebrand and think about how we should explain KMD – the currency.

I am trying to find the right concepts & words to describe what we have.

I think it's semi-public info that KMD will have sidechains. Any CC-module can be turned into a new KMD sidechain. The cool thing is that anyone can launch these sidechains, so it's truly open source / open / permissionless.

How should we explain this so that the average crypto enthusiast understands and gets exited?

Should we simply talk about "side chains"? But then that could be confused with all the other "independent chains" that we have on the Komodo ecosystem.

So I was thinking what if we talk about KMD "feature extensions", and that KMD is modular money that anyone can extend with new features (unlike the other coins).

Would that make sense? What type of words/language do you guys think would work here?

Another concept I was thinking is to talk about how the *platform* and the *currency* are in a mutually beneficial symbiosis

> Most platforms are dependent on their ecosystem currency to power the platform; on Komodo it is not the case. Both the KMD currency and all the projects of the platform can exist on their own, yet they have a synergetic relationship.

--> then we describe *How The Platform will benefit the currency*

--> and *How The Currency will benefit the platform*

I think there has to be appeal to the non technical. If I’m trying to sell Komodo to an investor who really doesn’t know anything about crypto, telling them that it has asset chains and dpow will not win them over. However, if I say: they’re launching an online casino, a gaming platform and offering blockchain as a service to help incubate  other crypto projects (as an example) then they may be inclined to drop a few bucks.

yes, so what do you guys think we we would say:

**KMD is the money of Komodo ecosystem that anyone can extend with new features and functionality** Then we list some of these feature extensions, such as stable coin extension, privacy extension, a decentralized casino extension, ...

then we can explain that any new technology that is developed on Komodo Platform can be applied to KMD as another extension.

Why will KMD succeed?

1. KMD is the base currency of our atomic swap technology
2. KMD can get unlimited amount of new features via side chains (that we could call feature extensions)
3. KMD has utility within the Komodo Platform such as through the Komodo Platform services (dPoW, soon interoperability)

How does the Komodo Platform & ecosystem help KMD?

4. Platform business & developer adoption brings in new technology innovations that KMD can adopt
5. Ecosystem business adoptio drives users to the ecosystem, which then likely become KMD users as well
6. Businesses & projects of the Komodo ecosystem can rely on KMD to be intermediary currency everyone uses and trusts. All new Komodo based products & services will likely accept KMD

that's true, but it's also true that devs/businesses are looking for great technology. The rebrand will focus on pointing out how great the Komodo technology is and attract more devs/businesses. That should spill over the user side as if developers start paying attention to Komodo then so will the influencers, and then at the end the investors.

[17-May-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
"Komodo is your key to a digital future. With many features built on top of a digital ecosystem, this powerful platform will usher in a new era of creation and opportunities in the world of cryptocurrency."


[17-May-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the above doesnt really say anything and in a way many platforms could make the same claim


[17-May-19 08:25 AM] Audo#5667
yes, I think there is. With our current rebrand website structure we have a separate menu for devs/businesses and one for the community. We can use different language on the community pages.


[17-May-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe tweaking it to add the logic for expected growth, ie. no lockin, no gas, would make it so it only fits komodo


[17-May-19 08:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
That’s my point James. I said nothing in a paragraph but still could grab attention instantly.


[17-May-19 08:27 AM] Audo#5667
the general story should be

1. Komodo Platform is awesome and will get business & developer adoption
2. KMD coin uses the same awesome technology and is secure & scalable
3. The bigger the Komodo ecosystem grows, the more usage and users KMD will have


[17-May-19 08:28 AM] Audo#5667
right? That makes sense in my head


[17-May-19 08:28 AM] grumpygoron#4320
I truly admire how skilled the team is on the technical side but when it comes to marketing those “buzz words” and basic explanations are what win.  Be cautious of worrying about technical details when it comes to marketing, otherwise you lose attention of the buyer

I think we can back up the claim that many projects will use komodo as it is superior tech at lower cost


[17-May-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
and then the consumer headline can feed into the deeper content


[17-May-19 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so when people who dont believe such a wild claim start looking into it they start believing that many projects will indeed use komodo and from there the platform grows organically without artificial gas effect


[17-May-19 08:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
We like to think of Komodo as a metropolitan city with asset chains being small communities within the city, and of course we have plenty of plans to grow in population. Within our community there are multiple projects under construction to become the pillars/foundation on which we shall thrive upon.

Why will KMD succeed?

1. KMD is the base currency of our atomic swap technology


[17-May-19 08:37 AM] AALEXJ#5233
How?


[17-May-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
default marketmakers will make KMD trading pair markets


[17-May-19 08:38 AM] AALEXJ#5233
How is the KMD the base currency in BTC/ETH


[17-May-19 08:38 AM] AALEXJ#5233
BTC/USD


[17-May-19 08:38 AM] Audo#5667
Think of Bitcoin & centralized exchanges.

CEX can use any coin as the intermediatery currency, but yet they always tend to use BTC.

KMD is in a good position to be always used as is very secure thanks to dPoW and fast blocktime unlike Bitcoin


[17-May-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
not all trading pairs will have KMD


[17-May-19 08:39 AM] AALEXJ#5233
Its obvious thats its not


[17-May-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
but there will be all KMD trading pairs


[17-May-19 08:39 AM] AALEXJ#5233
its self evident


[17-May-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the goal is to provide all KMD trading pairs with liquidity


[17-May-19 08:40 AM] AALEXJ#5233
The overwhelming majority of all traded volume in all crypto currencies in traded in the top 10 coins


[17-May-19 08:40 AM] AALEXJ#5233
nothing to do with komodo


[17-May-19 08:40 AM] Audo#5667
BTC, ETH, and USDT can be said to be the base currencies of centralized exchanges, right?

When it comes to Komodo DEX we could too have several base currencies, KMD being the most used (very likely)


[17-May-19 08:40 AM] AALEXJ#5233
How will komodo the coin benefit from such transactions


[17-May-19 08:40 AM] AALEXJ#5233
.... it won't


[17-May-19 08:41 AM] Audo#5667
why would I use BTC with atomic swaps if it takes ages thanks to 10 min confirmation? Also higher tx fees


[17-May-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
liquidity creates value for the coin that is liquid


[17-May-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
how else to explain LTC


[17-May-19 08:41 AM] AALEXJ#5233
agree


[17-May-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD will get liquidity, KMD will benefit


[17-May-19 08:41 AM] AALEXJ#5233
The elephant in the room is this:


[17-May-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
not saying that the top 10 wont get liquidity, but the effect on KMD will be disproportionate


[17-May-19 08:42 AM] AALEXJ#5233
The overwhelming majority of all traded volume has nothing to do with komodo


[17-May-19 08:42 AM] Audo#5667
it's also the job of our community to promote & support KMD trading pairs in the begining and ensure that we got liquidity


[17-May-19 08:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
Why will kmd succeed?

We will succeed through adoption. Through creating a user base that developers can access via our community. P2P transaction along with  b2b and b2c transactions will allow us to scale tx speed along with user base as we gain traction. This creates a snowball effect. While you may not notice a few flakes of snow now, you cannot ignore the avalanche that is inevitable.


[17-May-19 08:42 AM] AALEXJ#5233
In a way you mainly serving an existing customer base with KMD base pairs

[17-May-19 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
@AALEXJ if you are convinced added mm2 KMD trading pairs wont help KMD, then you can believe that


[17-May-19 08:44 AM] AALEXJ#5233
I not saying it won't


[17-May-19 08:44 AM] Audo#5667
yes, we can use that, I'll take a note


[17-May-19 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
however, I believe that having KMD trading pairs in mm2 for all ecosystem projects provides a liquidity conduit for all ecosystem coins, as KMD is already in most of the large exchanges


[17-May-19 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so the more ecosystem coins, the more overall KMD liquidity


[17-May-19 08:45 AM] AALEXJ#5233
The point I am getting at is KMD is great because there is not platform tax


[17-May-19 08:45 AM] AALEXJ#5233
no gas fees


[17-May-19 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
you want xyx coin, you can get it via KMD on mm2


[17-May-19 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, no platform tax is good point


[17-May-19 08:45 AM] AALEXJ#5233
but conversely there is no incentive to use KMD


[17-May-19 08:45 AM] AALEXJ#5233
in the major pairs


[17-May-19 08:45 AM] AALEXJ#5233

[17-May-19 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810

Parallel to the komodo marketing, I believe that investors seek profitability and the komodo platform already has that profitability in their assets (Dex, Pangea, Cripto ...) could be promoted that future profitability that is what an investor seeks , most of the holders of these assets are holders in the long term so the accumulation would raise the price Komodo, We take out komodos from the market raising the price and we create need to obtain komodos to buy assets. 

Here I see 2 points 

1 assets are extremely difficult to acquire currently what slows your increase in value 

2 I know it would generate additional work, but you should distribute the revshares (now crypto) more frequently and publish more each release (generate pumps)

sorry for my bad English

the key to bitcoin gaining trust from more people is its neutrality due to the absence of its creator. While all altcoin creators are busy promoting the superiority of their creation, bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto has disappeared. Satoshi Nakamoto does not take part in a meet-up or conference and not make plausible speeches about the development direction of bitcoin. bitcoin is neutral and is entirely based on public trust. this is a bitcoin advantage that other altcoin can never imitate. bitcoin is the right money for an era of distributed trust.

bitcoin is on the verge of a leap of trust. It is not small-scale startups or idealists who play a role in strengthening trust in bitcoin. It is a conglomerate with capital and power. Already, smart conglomerates have seen the potential of bitcoin as well as the opportunity to commercialize it immensely. they are pushing for bitcoin-related projects, sometimes publicly and secretly. when the time is right, conglomerates will show their true colors and try to monopolize the bitcoin-related market.

@Audo or whoever is leading the marketing nowadays:  I think it's best to not over-complicate things when it comes to marketing.  I get that tech is very complex, but the marketing should be simple and easy/quick to understand.  Don't overthink it.  You guys have been trying to figure out how to market/re-brand KMD for a long time now and it seems you're still stuck on the initial stages of "what" to market.  IMHO, the problem lies in making it too complicated.


[17-May-19 08:32 PM] richardt#2807
As others have suggested, maybe just think in terms of end-products rather than the actual tech behind it.


[17-May-19 08:37 PM] richardt#2807
Or perhaps one of the major problems is that KMD is just simply not at a stage where it is ready to be mass marketed


[17-May-19 08:46 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
alot of misunderstanding


[17-May-19 08:56 PM] richardt#2807
Then again, there are projects out there with less working tech than KMD but have much more recognition and investor interests.  Maybe it's time to admit that whatever marketing strategy that have been used is not very effective and something new needs to be tried.


[17-May-19 09:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
We have governments and international organizations and several high profile funds looking at utilizing the tech .

^ now that would be a good marketing point.  Care to share more details? 😄


[17-May-19 09:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
When it’s time to. More important to focus on execution.   Komodo operates with lots of parallel developments hence why we can put out a stream  of development updates.  By every metric our growth continues except coin price and a lot of that has to do with Gresham’s law situation surrounding bitcoin.  And the fact that 99.99999% of people are in it for immediate fiat gains doesn’t help either.

`We need to hit the pavement more so we need need to build the tools and train the troops to do so`
This is a thing labs will help with a lot, if it takes off. The idea is to gamify teaching how to build and test the tech while offering ppl financial incentive at the same time. Because 99% of people only want money, we need to make learning about the tech and using it profitable in the short term.

the entire way they work needs to be slightly changed. The ccvout can actually contain its own "OP_RETURN" I got basics of this working already in paymentsCC, but there is a far better way to do it even than that I just need to get my head around and make something that uses it.

upon passing the quiz or test the user gets a token granted by the teacher, lessons require at least 1 teacher and 1 student, teacher must supply knowledge that will be tested so that verification of this knowledge can be displayed, after so many tokens users get different benefits from the system maybe can start teaching at some point.

But it could also be used as a social credit system which is or isn't a bad thing.  I guess that depends on how it's depolyed.


[22-May-19 04:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts many educational institutions give out digital "open badges", for say Python coding, and you can show that badge on your website, and others can cryptographically verify that yes, indeed, you do actually have that badge from that organization. It removes the "lying on your resume" part of the game, or at least makes it a lot harder


[22-May-19 04:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's been around for many years and I haven't checked on it lately, but it's well-funded and well-connected. KMD adding a badge to their system would put KMD in front of the eyes of many people that would otherwise never see it

yes, electrums updated to latest version... one still to go... but should not matter, since the IP of the one that is offline is removed from DNS answer, so you should connect normally, with electrum1 to electrum3.cipig.net and it should resolv to a running electrum

I just watched a live stream and kmd was brought up. The take was not a positive one but an important one to see as we go forward. The take was: Why would I buy kmd when it literally has done nothing as far as price action in over a year? Sure they’re “developing” but another 5 teams will pop up with marketing and just take the work they’ve done and put it to use. 
On top of that, there are so many bagholders that this won’t have a chance to grow as everyone has been underwater for so long, they will dump the first sign of breakeven or profit.

@jl777c there really needs to be a marketing effort here man. I appreciate the work you all put into this, but without a solid marketing effort all you are doing is paving the road for someone else to surpass you.

The best way anyone can help out KMD price is to support the projects and businesses in the ecosystem. Make those projects look really shiney. People will naturally come. With 1000 projects we get 1000 devs.

We do need to get out in the public more when the new imagery is out.   Part of the problems we have with “marketing” is the divide between team and community,  public will defer responsibility when they can but need to realize they too are integral are getting the word out  .  A community based price pressure cooker would help to galvanize community efforts I think .

i always thought the bear market would kill the hype coins and that it would be the chance for high quality coins to naturally float up higher on the CMC.. But now, with the bear market apparently over, hype coin shit seems to be stronger than ever 😔


[24-May-19 11:11 AM] Lennart#9331
I am so surprised that even youtube people like Ivan On Tech or the likes, where you think they are there to teach people what is really going on strong in the space, almost never touches on KMD


[24-May-19 11:12 AM] Alexfrog#1338
bear market didnt kill any shit, it only killed some good old coins that have no marketing

[24-May-19 11:27 AM] jorian#4555

what Komodo is trying to do is a nuisance to the establishment. 
the vested interests are annoying to change.
good projects are coming? 
the reality was just overflowing with garbage dicos.
I respect komodo passion and vision, but the world does not flow as you think. 
you have to be flexible and strategic.

It's hard to know who to believe in the end. There is no black and white. Just a giant mishmash of motives, priorities, and dreams. Every time I think I understand wtf is going on... everything gets turned on it's head. I fell so hard for the @airratchet bs that I had to step back for a sec. Not since paycoin did I get fooled that hard.  Some lessons are more expensive than others.

For people who follow KMD, it's easy to understand there's great tech behind it. 

But it doesn't have a strong , unique  identity and memes like ARRR has for example, or even RVN. 

Also the Komodo website still having a message at the top saying it's an interim site, after months, doesn't help, it would be better to take that "under construction" message off completely. 

I think the Lizard UI for easily creating blockchains, similarly to the one Ravencoin have, would really help. I heard about it quite a while ago and after that there have been no more news. Just my thoughts.


[25-May-19 02:48 AM] actionslacks#4072
Pirate has a much simpler mission. I think the main thing to look at is scope.  kmd is doing everything. smart contracts, dex, multicoin/multiprotocol wallet. It's a different beast than RVN entirely. putting it all in a package and putting a neat little bow on it is a challenge. Still too much hype and too little real usage for kmd to show it's value. One could view ARRR's success as a testament to the power of kmd however.


[25-May-19 02:54 AM] jorian#4555
ARRR is just one of the many applications of KMD tech


[25-May-19 02:54 AM] jorian#4555

[25-May-19 03:02 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless, the KMD marketcap is holding pretty much steady through the years, even as there keep arriving all these hype coins, so we must be doing something right. much rather be known as the coin with a lot of great tech but not so much marketing, than the other way around

I had a thought today, even people in this discord do not have the time of inclination to follow all the various projects / things that are happening. I would like to have a discussion with people to potentially have not a infographic but a interactive map/dash board showing how each project fits into the KMD ecosystem and what updates we have coming out of them


[25-May-19 06:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586

Im thinking like those sites where you see 1 blob for a tx, then other blobs spanning out from that address, but instead have KMD in the middle then branches and sub branches, then showing all the tech and innovation and progress of it

Seems no comments, so I'll make one. The whole hurry up and wait for the marketing to begin but can't because the new theme is unreleased indefinitely is a little tiring. I believe there was a suggestion for an unofficial community site that can add some marketing firepower while we wait indefinitely for rebrand. Now I'm not saying I had the best suggestion, but it was one of the two. I wondering out loud  @polycryptoblog if your time isn't better spent somewhere else and a cookie cutter website run by ncrypt would be a good investment  towards community marketing and engagement that really needs to have happened already.

Is there any kind of update from the “idea by nature” team. Seems if resources have been devoted there already some kind of delivery timeline would be fair no?
Then if a more community biased patch is needed....seems like Kmd is all “word of mouth” which is valuable but not how this industry functions

hi - yes it is probably a long wait.  in march/april - we were still testing a lot of the tech, so understanding what was going to be gold and what was going to be brown sheets was very important.
docs, dex app, multi-coin wallet, chain generator, application logic on chain, anti fud, dpow, mm2 = rebrand
all the work has to align so it's an appealing project to adopt.
some of the code is still being tested, so knowing what is marketable & usable is a 2-way street.
there's a lot of tech, and the rebrand is part of the new standard in blockchain tech.
james made some incredible stuff happen over the last 3 years that built on the previous 3 years.
komodo has one last hard fork to come and new notaries before it's never looking back.   imo anyway.
a) don't want brown sheets
b) don't want vapourware
c) want to manage people's expectations that use the tech
if you are not using the tech, ask questions how to use it.  spin up your own blockchains, make a tokendex, lock up some of your custom coins for rewards like a masternode network.
there is a crypto price competition to do with the prices of forex, stocks and other cryptos that some of the techs are working on as well.   prices of stocks & forex in crypto, all blockchain enforced.

Except that the entire delay hold back everything else,  because imagery all changes,  terminology is all changing ( why, who knows ),   So every other aspect of marketing gets held back,  no marketing materials,  no consistent messaging ,  no acquiring personnel to get the word out.

As craptacular as Bitcointalk is, in the beginning it provided a wealth of information and support for btc. Who set that up, Satoshi? Once altcoins came about, BTT went steadiy downhill but was still the defacto place to get crypto info. I believe we are well beyond the chat forum, and kmd ecosystem is it's own beast and needs a way to display its ecosystem to the world. Heck, there are people on discord that have never even heard of chips


[28-May-19 07:51 AM] Mylo#8306
also things like partner networks are being revised, what is a training partner, what is an integration partner, a reseller, a tech partner and a cloud partner.   these things don't exist in current komodo nor many other projects.  understanding how to put brilliant tech together into a form that pros can use.   we have one-shot at a rebrand.   one-shot to wow a lot of eyeballs at once.

yeah forums are good, one of my tasks is how to integrate it more effectively.   initially i had created a demo community site with single sign on with the forum - this was not originally unleashed because of the above - aligning everything so it all is a cohesive message.

the earliest versions of a cohesive message were mid 2018, komodo lowers the barriers to blockchain adoption, you spin up your chain, you get your coins into a wallet, you get listed on a dex.   the message now is you get security, scalability and a bunch of new stuff out of the box.

How’s progress going on the website updates / rebrand?  Anything able to be reviewed by the public soon?


[31-May-19 11:57 PM] Mylo#8306
internal deadline for technical documentation is looming bu tthis does not mean the rebrand, tech docs is part of rebrand.
there is a campaign due to start soon.
14 hours ago internal team got the final beta to test before public beta - that will probably take the weekend and a day or two to thoroughly make acceptible for release.
the marketing messaging has been "nearly final" for most lines of business/products/software for a couple of weeks.
that polish going from nearly-final to final is a fine line when it cuts across many parts of the project, not just the "coin" and when we are doing a rebrand, the message is not just some upgrade to tech, it's a leading role in crypto adoption (in my humble opinion)

The `RMuL` wallet https://morty.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RMuLVvWhcUj3jgJFWpi7awiC8M6Et7EN8q on the morty test chain has been busy for a few days.  i was asked to generate transactions...it's slowed down a bit, so i'll need to clean it up.

it's not the same tx generator used in the #dev-scalability , it's just some simple scripts for spamming

with that running, then sometime this week or next week maybe we can find some updated docs to run the marketmaker2 and test that.   depends on time.
the mobile dex app, you'll see some other addresses starting with `b` doing swaps on monday for testing - so maybe ask mid-next week again


[01-Jun-19 01:11 AM] Audo#5667
Yeah just a couple quick updates
 - Evolution campaign going live next week
 - AtomicDEX mobile is working and we are expanding the group of testers. Tested it myself too! We are also looking for opportunities to hold private demos for journalists, etc. before we start the full public beta.
 - We will decide the full public AtomicDEX beta launch date next week.
 - We have been working on the rebranded site and we have internal target dates.

Rebrand is getting closer but will still take time

sea is a source of international order. without the concept of sea lanes, not only can the spirit of the West be incomprehensible, but the source of modern international relations be incomprehensible.

money that pirates demand for ransom is called "real money," and the money that pirates recognize is a source of imagination: Trustless Trust. 

argument that bitcoin should be eliminated because criminals use bitcoin is logically not far from the idea that Venice's money should be removed because pirates have acknowledged it.

"bitcoin phenomenon," a strange phenomenon faced by mankind today, is different from the new industrial technology commonly referred to as blockchain. this phenomenon is clear and humanistic intellectuals who have missed bitcoin must admit that they have a narrow understanding of the source of the currency.

today, the complex international relations we face also have to do with changes in the marine order. bitcoin also exists as a result of the old order, although it may be the cause of the new international order.

It was the conclusion reached in 2014 that bitcoin was not a "happening" and its roots were unexpectedly very deep and sound.

now is the time for the humanities and knowledge communities to deal with the formidable phenomenon of bitcoin.


[01-Jun-19 07:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think we shouldn't rush to an economist to understand the bitcoin phenomenon. Rather, I am sure that very humane books such as Nanami Shiono's Eastern Mediterranean Trilogy after Rome, Sapiens of Yuval Noah Harari, and The Rise of Christianity of Rodney Stark provide clues to the insight.

"That's enough" and "Our competitors are like us," maybe I can fool myself, but I can't fool the market. You have to make the perfect product. If you're going to make a clumsy product, go home and sleep.
Germany cares about the 0.1 mm difference, Japan is talking about 0.3 mm and the United States is talking about 0.5 mm, but China cares about 1 mm. That's why the word German engineering is still meaningful on the hardware side, and China has to make more efforts for this reason." That's how much Germany and Japan put great effort and effort into pursuing perfection, and the market seems to be well aware of these subtle differences, although they are all the same on the surface.
Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto applied the principles of microeconomics to the existing cryptographic technology and included people to form the most robust system created by mankind.

Greetings,

I wanted to shoot out a message to members of the Komodo team and community to see if you would be interested in recording a podcast for my week long podcast series of the Komodo Project. 

I recorded a podcast with two Komodo team members several weeks ago and it was a big success. Many people contacted me asking to create more episodes and I would love to bring on anyone who is interested. Here is a list of topics I would like to create a podcast over, each topic would be its own podcast:

-Why Komodo is a better blockchain solution
   --Blockchain difficulties, scaling issues, problems Komodo solves, etc

-Antara
  --What Antara is, it's frame work, smart-chains, why its a superior solution, etc.

-Komodo economics
  --Token supply, POS, staking, price outlook, scarcity, etc.

- How to customize your blockchain
   --How its done, why its important, how business can adopt this solution, etc

-Blockchain Web app on AWS
   --How to use it, how business can adopt it, etc

PM me if interested or shoot me an email at drew@crusayder.com

2. If j see my KMD coins still exist in my agama wallet , Just for now , as a temp measure , could I just move my funds to an exchange and then move back to a new kmd wallet or update etc ? 
3. Can I apply option 2 to other ERC20 coins I had on Agama?

[05-Jun-19 10:41 AM] PTYX#6840
if you had an old agama (over 6 months ago) wallet you might not have the pin file


[05-Jun-19 10:42 AM] PTYX#6840
it's just a file with your seed stored inside and it's encrypted by a password


[05-Jun-19 10:42 AM] coingirl87#6489
I usrd agama wallet 0.3.5 beta


[05-Jun-19 10:44 AM] PTYX#6840
you should have a seed


[05-Jun-19 10:44 AM] PTYX#6840
just use that


[05-Jun-19 10:45 AM] coingirl87#6489
I understand nothing


[05-Jun-19 10:45 AM] coingirl87#6489
Until now i used native with wallet.dat


[05-Jun-19 10:46 AM] coingirl87#6489
In agama


[05-Jun-19 10:46 AM] coingirl87#6489
Now i have to send all my funds to versus agama


[05-Jun-19 10:46 AM] coingirl87#6489
For that i need a new seed


[05-Jun-19 10:47 AM] coingirl87#6489
Abd seed encrypted key?


[05-Jun-19 10:47 AM] coingirl87#6489
Sorry...i am stupid


[05-Jun-19 10:48 AM] PTYX#6840
if you have a wallet.dat file, you can use that in the verus wallet


[05-Jun-19 10:50 AM] PTYX#6840
but doesn't using Agama to send funds risk the funds being taken?


[05-Jun-19 10:51 AM] PTYX#6840
i agree, generate the address on an external wallet, but what should they use to move the funds? if it's a wallet.dat then it can be imported into the verus wallet, and they can send to the new address.


[05-Jun-19 10:54 AM] coingirl87#6489
Ok...so now i create a new adress on versus agama and after that send all my funds via agama to versus agama


[05-Jun-19 10:55 AM] coingirl87#6489
Is that safe?


[05-Jun-19 10:59 AM] bitcoinstrader#6920
Can I create a new address on coinomi

When i click to register versus agama say that encription key/confirmation field is empty


[05-Jun-19 11:01 AM] coingirl87#6489
So its mandatory to have this encription key?


[05-Jun-19 11:04 AM] gcharang#6833
@coingirl87 the name and encrypted pin are like username and password for the seed phrase, but it is stored only on your computer
this so that you don't need to paste seed everytime

Ok thank you...but that is really safe to have an auto fill in?


[05-Jun-19 11:06 AM] gcharang#6833
the encrypt pin is used to encrypt that seed phrase and store it on your computer
if you trust that computer to hold your wallet.dat, then this is similar


[05-Jun-19 11:09 AM] coingirl87#6489
Ok thank you

Last question


[05-Jun-19 11:11 AM] coingirl87#6489
Why i have to create a new wallet in vrsc lite mode and not kmd lite mode?


[05-Jun-19 11:12 AM] gcharang#6833
that was old instruction.
use https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.0.13-PBaaS-Cross-chain-Technology-Preview
open KMD lite mode and create a new wallet
if you get server error etc., 
follow this guide: https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000029569-how-to-stop-agama-from-using-a-proxy-server-to-access-electrum-servers/

[05-Jun-19 04:56 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
The general public don’t have the private key/seed


[05-Jun-19 04:56 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
And kmd team will be reviewing them by hand with proof of address ownership etc

Is there any option to create addresses and move coins ?


[06-Jun-19 01:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@kpprabhu use verus agama


[06-Jun-19 01:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Create new adress in lite mode


[06-Jun-19 01:37 AM] smkhound#7640
@kpprabhu you can creat address and export privkey in QT without being at full sync - https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024700-how-to-export-your-private-keys-from-the-komodo-ocean-wallet
use `getnewaddress` comand in debug console for new address


[06-Jun-19 01:38 AM] smkhound#7640
you wont see balance until synced tho


[06-Jun-19 01:48 AM] kpprabhu#9635

Check the guide linked above


[06-Jun-19 01:54 AM] smkhound#7640
basically most/any RPC call can be used in the debug console window


[06-Jun-19 01:54 AM] smkhound#7640
`dumprivkey <your R-address>`

@smkhound on ocean wallet after importing private key. I don't find my chips coins when I try to send. Should syncing headers need to finish to send transactions.


[06-Jun-19 02:42 AM] smkhound#7640
yeah, will need full sync

what about the other tokens like bntn ?

@kpprabhu have you secured your KMD?


[06-Jun-19 03:05 AM] Acura#2748
So for clarify, i can move my kmd´s via the PBaaS Cross-chain Technology Preview May 29 2019 APP to my Ledger Nano, correct ?


[06-Jun-19 03:06 AM] gcharang#6833
@Acura yes


[06-Jun-19 03:06 AM] gcharang#6833
@Acura Make sure the Ledger seed hasn't been input in the untrusted versions of Agama


[06-Jun-19 03:07 AM] Acura#2748
Thx for quick feedback


[06-Jun-19 04:06 AM] Helly88#3715
When will a Trezor connection finally come? You can see what happens if you don't have a hardware wallet. On the Trezor page it says that there is no wallet from KMD yet. When can one count on it

Komodo's response was good, but it's not trustless. 
I think that this will allow some crazy person to arbitrarily move my assets in the future. 
this is a situation where you have to trust the Komodo team. 
this isn't right.

The team will make an announcement in regards to returning funds. Be patient 🙂

How many funds are in control of hacker right now since hacker was able to take some funds out.

Not sure untill all claims are filled out


[06-Jun-19 09:11 AM] Allen#8663
It's funny that in the security announcement, they don't acknowledge that hacker was able to get hold of 'some' funds.


[06-Jun-19 09:12 AM] Allen#8663
I've tipped some cryptocurrency websites about this. Let's see who picks this up first.

People need to know the truth.


[06-Jun-19 09:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If you follow the discord a bit they have already acknowledged multiple times that approx 1million kmd was stolen and jl already pledged a significant amount of his personal funds

@Allen what are you here for exactly?


[06-Jun-19 09:27 AM] Allen#8663
Well, I came here for my lost komodo funds and discovered that team is hiding some facts from public. that's all.


[06-Jun-19 09:28 AM] AALEXJ#5233
facts are facts, no harm in reporting the facts


[06-Jun-19 09:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
Total losses are still changing, numbers don't want to be given out that are incorrect


[06-Jun-19 09:28 AM] AALEXJ#5233
technically speaking how much will be lost to komodo users may well be less than 500k


[06-Jun-19 09:28 AM] Allen#8663
@dukeleto but don't you think team should atleast mention that ~1M KMD are in possesion of hacker?

The people writing the articles are free to add how many funds were lost. It's no secret how many were taken. Next you'll be pissed that James didn't mention the color shirt he was wearing when it happened.

Hello, I’m trying to move my funds out of Agama on native mode, but it’s taking forever to sync. Any tips on how to make the syncing go faster?


[06-Jun-19 06:47 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Unfortunately can’t make syncing faster except by using a bootstrap , for security reasons it’s recommend you sync normally


[06-Jun-19 06:49 PM] jtt_som#2279
The syncing gets stuck at a certain point


[06-Jun-19 06:49 PM] jtt_som#2279
It was syncing fine but then at 82% it just stopped


[06-Jun-19 06:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It may have just slowed down to recent blocks,  #deleted-channel  is the best.  If you have your keys you can import into another wallet like Verus Agama and move them from there


[06-Jun-19 06:52 PM] jtt_som#2279
I only have my wallet.dat


[06-Jun-19 06:52 PM] jtt_som#2279
Is it possible to download another wallet and read my dat. file from there?


[06-Jun-19 07:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes , KomodoOcean


[06-Jun-19 07:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
But you will need to sync as well

⚡️Security notice for Telegram⚡️ 

In your settings, go to privacy and security, under your phone number, select to share this with nobody as its defaulted to everyone.  

That’s unacceptable and a security risk for pirates and SIM swaps.

Nobody in telegram needs your phone number and Telegram is stupid for defaulting it to share.

Just wanted to clarify something about the Agama security issue. My funds were in a wallet.dat file when I used Agama in the past. I installed Komodo Ocean QT, generated a new address, and sent all my funds to myself. Is that sufficient to keep my funds safe?

yes, that is good

@jtt_som 
for further peace of mind,
get the privatekey of that address, delete wallet.dat and start wallet again to creare new wallet.dat
then import that address

only do this if you know what you are doing

I have sent three transactions to myself trying to claim the reward using the Komodo Ocean wallet but it doesn't seem to be claiming. Is there a limit to the amount of KMD that has to be sent for the claim to perform?


[13-Jun-19 08:13 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
Rewards claim. Should have mention that.


[13-Jun-19 08:15 AM] gcharang#6833
amount > 10 and age > 1 hour
send the whole balance to the same address and wait for two hours
then send to the same address again
that should show you if it is working


[13-Jun-19 08:16 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Kitchen Table do you not have any new change addresses with some amount in them? what address/txid are you looking at?


[13-Jun-19 08:17 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
I was only sending 1 KMD at a time. All the funds is on one txid and address since it was moved after the hack notice.


[13-Jun-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
1 is less than 10


[13-Jun-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810

actually it is possible to construct an account with same id also, make sure the id matches and the color is green!


[13-Jun-19 08:40 AM] Kitchen Table#2858
I give him credit that his ID was close, 5801 instead of 5810. Of course I've been dealing with imposters for years dating back to slack so I question everything.

Hey Komodo team


[16-Jun-19 10:18 AM] apooler805#4087
Hey can you apply for your blockchain to be listed on Trust Wallet? Because theres QTUM and other blockchains in there andI would like it if you add Komodo on there because not only will it be more known but we can add all Coins on the Komodo blockchain on the trust wallet so that means we can have Pirate Chain on there too!!! For example all ERC20 coins can be added and same for other blockchains listed, so if Komodo applies to be on there all the coins and tokens on the Komodo blockchain can be added!!!


[16-Jun-19 10:33 AM] PTYX#6840
@apooler805 no need to apply

Does anyone know when the kmd team is going to finish crediting wallets that were swept as a result of the potential hack?

 I’ve been a Komodo supporter since the beginning and luckily had moved 95% of my kmd out of Agama before the sweep.  

However, I’m still very disappointed that this happened and it’s made me lose confidence almost entirely in the project.  The fact that their was a vulnerability and kmd team was able to gain access and sweep my kmd even though everything was offline.


[19-Jun-19 11:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the hacker stole the passphrases, we took it from him
over 90% of the funds have been returned, alternative was to just let the hacker take it permanently
if your refund is not processed yet, let me know the address and i will look into it


[19-Jun-19 11:17 PM] jl777c#5810
if it werent for the hacker stealing the passphrases, we wouldnt have any access. unfortunately, hacks happen across this space on a regular basis and we were specifically targeted with a long term attack. At least we will make everyone 100% refunded. how many other projects have done that?
also, the blockchain was not hacked. it was an upstream library (npm) for one of the half dozen wallets that was. we are definitely tightening our security review process and this was a big wakeup call. not just for us, but all wallet providers that use node.js

@jl777c I understand the blockchain itself wasn’t hacked but Agama was supposed to be the safe wallet for kmd storage.   It would be like someone being able to steal private keys from an electrum wallet and then sweeping the bitcoins out of them.  Appreciate the team’s honesty and transparency.  I’ll be in touch w info about my kmd address.

Does it make you question where you leave large amounts of funds? It should. Users need to start using cold storage wallets as opposed to hot storage for these same reasons. It's a cold shower for investors and developers alike.

[19-Jun-19 11:31 PM] jl777c#5810
this is a universal attack, not just KMD specific


[19-Jun-19 11:32 PM] jl777c#5810
hardware wallets or nodes that are airgapped seems to be the best way


[19-Jun-19 11:32 PM] jl777c#5810
but even hardware wallets if the hacker gets access to it, the privkey can be extracted

@PTYX unfortunately true


[19-Jun-19 11:38 PM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
@jl777c yeah cli are less prone to attacks but in order to get kmd mainstream, a GUI is a must.  It has also bothered me since day one that you don’t need to enter a password to send kmd from agama.


[19-Jun-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
well, i added the ability for KMD to have a walletpassphrase end of last year


[19-Jun-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess that feature is not in the GUI yet


[19-Jun-19 11:39 PM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
Yea in the GUI


[19-Jun-19 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure oceanQT supports walletpassphrase


[19-Jun-19 11:43 PM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
Ok thanks. Always just stuck w Agama.


[19-Jun-19 11:44 PM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
But I’ll look into oceanQT


[19-Jun-19 11:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i think oceanQT has much less attack surface than node.js and it should be a familiar interface with walletpassphrase


[19-Jun-19 11:49 PM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
So for my own learning, how is it possible for a hacker to sweep my kmd coins when the wallet itself is physically offline.  Why is the paraphrase to the wallet stored online?


[19-Jun-19 11:51 PM] OriginalBitcoin#4548
@jl777c I always thought that wallet seed is not broadcasted?


[19-Jun-19 11:52 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

@jl777c is right here. For those who are not necessarily a developer, you still have to know that the code review of blockchains projects are certainly the most difficult ones that exist. There is a lot of money in this industry, so a lot of people want to take advantage of it. The projects that will have the most rigor or those who will manage this kind of attack will emerge in this industry. In my personal opinion because of the javascript package manager, do not use this language, too risky.

I work at Chainzilla. It's a blockchain consulting and development company. We've looked at browser extensions similar to Tezbox but that's something that we will likely work on towards the end of the year if we finish all the expansions in Chameleon Pay wallet.


[21-Jun-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
sounds like very danger


[21-Jun-19 06:53 AM] PTYX#6840
That's exactly what I was about to type. There's security concerns with the extensions that we need to address before actually making it.


[21-Jun-19 06:54 AM] PTYX#6840
A browser extension with ledger/HW capabilities is probably the best option.

@barnum what are you building for polkadot and enzyme? Apps or extensions


[21-Jun-19 06:58 AM] barnum#1699
Enzyme is the name of the wallet we're building for polkadot.

Basically we want to build metamask style wallets for every network. 

The convenience of a web wallet - with keys you own/control

Yep - https://github.com/blockxlabs/enzyme

That's what we're building for polkadot. Still in development

@barnum if you ripped out the aion/web3 stuff and made a basic bitcoin version, how would you do it?   
here is a kmdrpc component for a vue app.   it's supposed to use browser's fetch api (but my latest work removing axios needs to be comitted).
take what you want to experiment https://github.com/imylomylo/komodo-cakeshop/tree/fetch-restructure/src/app/shared/components/kmdrpc

i think that component once axios is removed has dev dependencies of babel-cli only.

when i say "component" it's just a rpc wrapper lib....used as a shared component in a vue app

[28-Jun-19 05:18 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Kmd has removed privacy features for now , may appear as a side chain in the future ,  but Pirate is best for privacy


[28-Jun-19 05:25 PM] PTYX#6840
jumblr in essence was a sequence of private transactions in denominations and with time delays.


[28-Jun-19 05:26 PM] PTYX#6840
it's plausible that someone else can implement it. Nix has a sort of Jumblr with their token being the private  layer


[28-Jun-19 05:41 PM] allbits#5898
The JUMBLR asset still has value apart from the deprecated jumblr function. It receives 10% of dex revenues. It also owns 50% of BET which may have future revenue streams.


[28-Jun-19 11:58 PM] hastrup#8742
@allbits where so you ha e that info from? Can anyone confirm?


[29-Jun-19 12:03 AM] jl777c#5810

[29-Jun-19 02:21 AM] hastrup#8742
@jl777c thx👍 can anyone link to a place where I can read an in depth overview.


[29-Jun-19 02:22 AM] hastrup#8742
My source was this


[29-Jun-19 02:22 AM] hastrup#8742
Total Coin Supply: 1,000,000

The JUMBLR asset chain is tied to the fees that are required to use Jumblr. JUMBLR also receives 15% of the dex-fee revenue share. Jumblr’s zk-SNARK transactions are dramatically larger in data-size than a normal transparent transaction. To create an economic balance for this increased amount of network usage, users are required to pay a 0.3% fee for using Jumblr.

These fees are collected in the following address: Jumblr Fee Holding Address
Payouts of the dividends from Jumblr usage and from the 15% dex-fee revenue share are distributed proportionally to the holders of the JUMBLR asset coins.

Hey ALL 😃. A project I manage (THC) is in need of some Development Support. The chain will go live soon, and besides me there is a couple people working on this project. Until the new chain gets migrated there are no dev rewards, so creating new things with no funds is tough, even listing on exchanges is tough because they want funds for this. 
I believe in this project, because i have seen the value of hemp (in its use) and its close cousins as an integral part of how we can make a change to benefit our global community.
THC plans on building a supply chain mechanism on UTXO tech, this would not be possible without KMD, which is why i am reaching out here today.
If you would like to help do not hesitate to DM me or email too, adam@hempcoin.org.
thank you for your time, and have a beautiful day!

Hi, I've written in the Agama wallet group and support community and I have not received a response.  That is why I am writing my question here: my KMD tokens were stolen on June 5 from the Agama wallet.  I have completed the form and sent the transfer you requested a week ago and I have not yet received the tokens at the new address.  Could you give me some information about it?  Thank you.

[25-Jul-19 08:03 AM] Markus#5464
If so, what went wrong and what could of been done differently?


[25-Jul-19 09:18 AM] Audo#5667
Hey @Markus 

Yes, we completed the rebrand and it was worth celebrating a little bit. Our message is now stronger and everyone who checks us out should better understand what we are looking to develop and what our vision is. All the pieces are now more alligned.

However, this is just the beginning and we can't just sit and expect things to magically happen. 

The goal now is to get more projects into our ecosystem.

`First documentation sprint is over, 100 pages of carefully written and endited content that is in a logical order.`
* We are now turning our focus on building educational journeys and tutorials to get people up to speed faster
`Two new products were relased, but they are in beta with limited functionality`
* We are working on finalizing their roadmaps and adding new features
`Atomic Swap Protocol is on a stable state and we get big swap success rate with our own AtomicDEX app`
* We have to release AtomicAPI and spread information about it to get other projects to adopt Komoso's atomic swap technology
`Antara Framework is relased and documentation is online`
* We have to craft together usecases that can be built today and form a marketing campaign around them, and get new businesses on board.
`Our community has grown and new people have found Komodo.`
* We have to offer better tools to empower the community and empower them to build the multi-chain ecosystem. We are looking to launch a community portal later.
* Who's building on Komodo? Where is this information? We are working on building an ecosystem dashboard to showcase the size and activity within our ecosystem.

[01-Aug-19 10:38 AM] Regnar#6164
This is a good indicator that we need case studies using the Antara framework. Perhaps we can ask Komodo ecosystem projects that are in a particular industry to write or at least provide content for cases where they used them to solve a problem or to build business products


[01-Aug-19 10:40 AM] Regnar#6164
This would also be a good idea for community members who are in an industry IRL to chime in about how they might use Antara within their work or industry.
@Audo thoughts?

[01-Aug-19 12:24 PM] Chipmoon#7477
I am not versed in the field, but a project about financial credit history and credit score (replacing equifax etc) . I would think it is easier to accomplished using antara framework as it requires multi-chains (maybe?) and CCs (oracles , outside data etc ) 😄 If anybody wants to research on that and improve on it


[01-Aug-19 02:54 PM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
Maybe this is in the world of supply chain. But it would be great to see a system that connects small farmers with product manufacturers/distributors/end users via contracts for delivery that uses escrow, reputation, stable coins, and oracles.

Problem it solves, it would encourage small farmers to expand into new crops. It also provides a way for distributors and manufacturers to link with farmers and fill orders more effectively.

Most major consulting firms have case studies, this is likely the better approach for us. Businesses are often reluctant to try to implement solutions on their own and prefer to use consulting firms. Considering Komodo Antara is a tool set to custom make solutions, we should look to get consulting firms (of all sizes) to use Antara for their clients needs. 

Get them to produce their own case studies, offer workshops for consulting companies, etc

We have gotten questions about why K64 was removed from the website, and we wanted to bring little clarity to it. Simly put, the situation is that Komodo team is awaiting more details and information to independently verify claims made by the Komodore64 team before we list them as an official ecosystem project.

When it comes to what our marketing team is doing, there are three focus points:
 1) product/solution marketing, technical marketing, tech comparisons
 2) community portal and community strategy to increase community engagement
 3) educational journeys and tutorials (in collaboration with support/qa team)

Hi everyone.  I have a question.  In both my Agama and QT wallets, it gets stuck on a a % when I open it  and it starts downloading the recent blockchain.  What do I do?  I have installed the newer version and tried a different wallet.


[31-Aug-19 12:54 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
What’s it say when it is stuck


[31-Aug-19 12:57 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Is it rescanning,  not importing keys properly,  need more info

I can get a message to Roger ver. However, he will likely want something in return. Volume-wise, he might not find KMD appealing.


[02-Sep-19 10:25 AM] jorian#4555
what would that be? adding BCH to atomicdex?

Possibly a fee. I'll test the waters.

Komodo is certainly against censorship and very relaxed about free speech but we do need to draw the line somewhere.

the k64 situation is delicate but i recommend ignoring it. we can't save everybody. the k64 situation is a delicate one. if the situation crosses over to legal territory, we should let law enforcement deal with it. otherwise it's just peripheral noise and a huge distraction from what really matters.

for nspv, there is no username and password right now
you run the client locally and interact with it using curl commands or the builtin html wallet
example: 
```
curl --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "spend", "params": ["RFmQiF4Zbzxchv9AG6dw6ZaX8PbrA8FXAb",1 ] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:$port/
```

just use the html wallet from localhost, much easier

[13-Sep-19 01:38 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@AronXuanGoldberg#3393   You can forward them to partners@komodoplatform.com or one of our service providers to see what kind of migration they are looking for .  Biggest advantage for switching over is not being restrained by Eth gas and lower costs if they wish to do future integrations .

Possibly even a short presentation (video) as available for Atomic swaps from Komodo


[13-Sep-19 01:47 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Typically a snapshot and airdrop of the new coin needs done , some wish to remove from circulation the old Eth which is another step .   Lowest cost is free as they can do this by themselves if they need ,  otherwise cost is dependent on the service provider and the man-hours needed.  Benefits : no gas fees,  reduced cost for other Komodo integrations like DPoW and Atomicdex listing ,  CC development

Im thinking KMD ecosystem could buy DP for like 30k $ probably to have a working CEX, then delete scam coins -> rebrand -> get listed on CMC
so for about 3 BTC (amount for listing on many exchanges) some other things could be possible (getting all KMD coin on this CEX -> rebranding -> listing all on CMC)

DP outsources all their IT and pays dearly for it, making it hard for them to make money. If KMD bought it, and used all our in-house skills, it might just be a profitable venture. Just sayin'

the only thing I can say for sure is that DP supported ARRR back when I was convinced that zaddex would never even exist 🤷🏽


[17-Sep-19 07:40 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the flip-side of that is:
with the current structure split, does anyone even know who owns the IP rights for DP?

Maybe they would be the first to let their users trade with DEX users or something

Zaddex is a joint venture between OCU and Redfox, I believe REDFOX has a 50% equity stake, yet OCU is responsible for the development and operation as far as I know. From all accounts they say that the exchange is still in beta and that development is still occurring, as fsr as I have read from the whitepaper and frlm their telegram, the full exchange ought to launch before year end.

 It is hard to attract a user base without actually pushing some form awareness campaign and why would anyone begin a marketing campaign before the beta testing had been completed.


[17-Sep-19 09:07 PM] digital bullion#8223
At least they have delivered a functional exchange, it is more than what can be said of a lot of projects.


[17-Sep-19 09:12 PM] digital bullion#8223
I hope that Zaddex and Redfox succeed, because I feel Komodo needs some strong success stories and reasons for optimism.


[17-Sep-19 09:20 PM] PTYX#6840
Komodo doesn't need any projects to prop it up


[17-Sep-19 09:23 PM] PTYX#6840
There's projects within the kmd ecosystem that have delivered a full working exchange, debit card, OTC desk, and mobile apps. They get basically no credit at all. Pungo has by far the most working products that are generating revenue. Verus is also another example of great projects adding value to the ecosystem that get little to no credit in the eyes of the community.


[17-Sep-19 09:24 PM] digital bullion#8223
I think they are both amazing projects 👍

[17-Sep-19 09:47 PM] PTYX#6840
There will need to be private channels for regulated exchanges but that doesn't mean they can't use dex technology which is trustless


[17-Sep-19 09:47 PM] PTYX#6840
Maybe decentralized isn't the right word. Trustless exchange via the barterdex network.

Can you turn the KDMLABS scammers offline I keep seeing random payouts to miners not even mining in the pool on .rocks  I keep not getting my share its really annoying its funny how I get paid correctly for about 3 hours then suddenly some rogue thing starts scamming coins.  Its not tricky or some programming genius its a skimmer and a joke if its not mining dont pay it coins from the mined blocks.

It says the entire network is only about 40KS or so and there is a total of about 135KS in the pool yet everyone keeps taking more and I think the head tech is doing this buy assigning block rewards to payment address's that dont show up in the pool again why doesn't the network display all network hash and pay out properly  it must be a scam because zpool.ca doesn't work right or umining nothing works right there I tried it doesn't reward blocks properly if the block was every 90 seconds or 120 seconds it should happen that way all the time but I am seeing huge problems with your math its like you just ignore reality for 30 minutes here and there.

[20-Sep-19 09:25 AM] kevinkatovic#1278
well someone seems to be taking 50% of my coins


[20-Sep-19 09:25 AM] kevinkatovic#1278
begging?


[20-Sep-19 09:26 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
no one is `taking 50% of your coins`
the payment js codes are public as are the transactions


[20-Sep-19 09:26 AM] kevinkatovic#1278
Can you do math?


[20-Sep-19 09:26 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
no


[20-Sep-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i have been know to be able to do math


[20-Sep-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
are you able to do 50% calculation?


[20-Sep-19 09:27 AM] kevinkatovic#1278
Well do the math easy


[20-Sep-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
LABS is 50% staking


[20-Sep-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
that means half the blocks are NOT mined


[20-Sep-19 09:27 AM] kevinkatovic#1278
So what is the block reward every 90 seconds 120 seconds it can't be random


[20-Sep-19 09:28 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
there are 8 coins given per block
on average 50% of blocks are mined by PoW
on average 50% of blocks are staked by PoS
"on average" because: math


[20-Sep-19 09:30 AM] kevinkatovic#1278
Your not making sense your defending a already broken system thats being measured  what is the network block reward for POW ever how many seconds then split the math properly your staking has always been a joke

`Your not making sense your defending a already broken system`
Why is it that you seem to have a problem mining any coin in this system and everyone else can mine and understand just fine?
At some point you might need to look around and realize that your problem is you and that's why you were booted from the PIRATE discord

Note : miners call my pool umining as kind of nickname of unimining.net
I tried to explain labs 50% pos 50% pow on my discord but I was not very clear.
Maybe I missed few msgs (I will go to read arrr discord) but I guess that a website such as whattomine does not take into account pos part in profit calculation. Miner compared his earnings on my pool with this other pool http://mininglabs.rocks/workers/RDUJAMCMwcre4L1Dii5zq1XzGEHAEu94Rg and he said that a similar hashrate gave 12 times more. Do you know if website such as whattomine takes pos % into account ? And who is the pool op of mininglabs.rocks?
Sorry toaskhere but the conversation happened here

what sort of listing fees, vast majority of exchanges are basically just charging "only" 3 to 5BTC for listing, with no real trading volumes

Dont know listing fee


[22-Sep-19 02:12 AM] jl777c#5810
anything other than a top 10 (real volume) exchange is really not worth listing on, as we are already in 3 of the top4 and almost half the top 10.


[22-Sep-19 02:13 AM] Markus#5464
Maybe its free listing if they think the project is good thats why i thought it can be a great opportunity since its a new exchange with fiat gateway and everything they run is licensed

Investor question: How much did Binance pay you to post this tweet? https://twitter.com/KomodoPlatform/status/1177257973292392450?s=20  Komodo promoting one of the highest security ignorances possible in cryptocurrencies.

{Embed}
Komodo (@KomodoPlatform)
https://twitter.com/KomodoPlatform/status/1177257973292392450?s=20
Komodo is proud to be a member of the @binance Staking Platform. https://t.co/DE7qicboIS
Twitter


[26-Sep-19 03:59 PM] Portman#9202
You should have posted "Binance approached us with an offer of $XX to promote cryptocurrency users to leave KMD on Binance's Exchange. This is a very high security risk which we HIGHLY DISSAPPROVE OF. If you do not hold the security keys to your crypto, then it is not your crypto - it belongs to the exchange you store it on. Millions of dollars have been REGULARLY lost on exchanges via exit scams, corruption etc. the latest being QuadrigaCX. Instead we are doubling down on educating the masses about proper coin security and we call upon ALL cryptocurrencies developers to do the same. The most secure way to collect KMD Interest Rewards is using our AGAMA wallet. Thank you."


[26-Sep-19 04:02 PM] Oszy#5734
The most secure is ledger, and Agama is not "Ours" anymore.  They  never encouraged people to hold funds on an exchange, this post in my opinion was just formality, saying binance is doing the right thing by distributing the collected rewards which was not the case until now.


[26-Sep-19 04:05 PM] Oszy#5734
You are not getting more on binance than you would get in your wallet, but from a day trader point of view, who are keeping KMD on binance on a daily basis, it's not a bad thing to get those rewards while trading KMD.


[26-Sep-19 04:05 PM] Portman#9202
The tweet itself enourages people to hold funds "Komodo is proud to be a member of the @binance Staking Platform."


[26-Sep-19 04:06 PM] Oszy#5734
No it is not. It suggests that if you do have kmd there, you will get the rewards same as if it was in your wallet.


[26-Sep-19 04:06 PM] Oszy#5734
No one says to send it there and keep it there

and what is written is not taken as it was intended

The binace staking page the tweet links to: "With Staking, Binance users will be able to grow their funds by receiving monthly rewards & distributions simply by depositing and HOLDING FUNDS on Binance."


[26-Sep-19 04:10 PM] Oszy#5734
said binance not komodo,my take on this is obviously not to do that


[26-Sep-19 04:10 PM] actionslacks#4072
the wailing about lack of marketing has been deafening here in the past. if this binance gimmick had not been touted, the objections would likely outweigh your current complaint. I agree that binance is a cex and that comes with some pitfalls, but hey, it's the wild west.


[26-Sep-19 04:11 PM] Portman#9202

I think that documentation needs some dumbing down, or maybe just a "kmd for dummies" type page. but honestly, as more people get red pilled into crypto, It's a race to the bottom for the hearts and minds of the pre-programmed masses. Whenever you think you idiot proofed something, nature tends to evolve a better idiot.


[26-Sep-19 05:28 PM] actionslacks#4072
crypto itself is an esoteric concept to almost everyone. the details of how kmd has engineered many great solutions to as yet unforeseen problems just makes it that much more difficult to sell. But the Mobile Dex is the moon shot to mass adoption. seeing current progress makes me giddy in anticipation.


[26-Sep-19 05:32 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
There's only so much they can "dumb down" certain things
In my mind, I equate it to time-traveling back to the 1300s and trying to explain to someone from there how a 28 core and 56 thread CPU works


[26-Sep-19 05:33 PM] actionslacks#4072

No need to detail anything to day traders who do not give a crap about the tech - the explanations need to be imparted to businesses and how/if they can benefit from the platform.

About the Binance tweet, Komodo isn't recommending Binance or suggesting that anyone store their funds on a CEX. But if KMD needs to be listed on CEXs (and it does) then it's best that users are able to earn their active user rewards, rather then the exchange itself taking those funds

Hey, we got a question about how long the bans last. Technically bans are permanent and we have to manually unban people. We are not too eager to unban the banned without being sure that they really want to come back to our community.

The solution is a form they can fill and make an appeal. If they do that and promise to behave we are happy to unban them.

The form: https://forms.monday.com/forms/5fd66a8253ca0111449a26807c88a113

hey @༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻ & @siu we can continue the pricing discussion here.

The pricing we have is like a discovery pricing. We might tweak it in the future.

For dPoW we have used the concept of grandfathering of pricing concept where we keep charging the same amount that the project signed-up with. Thus even if we raise the price later it doesn't affect the current projects who operate with certain price tag in mind.


[07-Oct-19 07:45 AM] ༺α☬丂Ӧ¢ ༒ ༻#5987
```there is some bashing going on to kmd because there is a fee for using antara network gui and atomicdex gui listing.```
 
 this is interesting. I'm curious to know where the current pricing came from. The people complaining probably won't bite even if the price is $6500 or $4500. Probably not even at $1000. These people are just not interested at any price. For those truly interested you could probably raise the price to $10,000-$20,000 and still get just as many bites. (Has anyone done a focus group on the pricing?) The weird thing about pricing and perceived value is if you price to low, people perceive low quality. I'd price Antara at $100,000 just like a CEX listing. Those that can pay, you want, those that can't, probably won't at any price anyway. But the perceived value is alot more serious then a good bargain. We don't want to be seen as needing to beg people to buy.
 You can also always lower prices through sales, discounts, grants, student discounts, scholarship, etc. Encourage people to run through the tutorial to get a discount or do x for discount. Or offer one month a year for a sale etc. What do the sales and marketing people have to say about this? @siu - Chainmakers

Here is a question, why do some CEX charge so much?


[07-Oct-19 07:50 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
because people pay it
If no one ever paid $750k for a listing then no exchange would charge that much


[07-Oct-19 07:53 AM] Audo#5667
and I want to stress that

our atomic swap protocol & P2P orderbooks = decentralized open source technology without any listing pricing
AtomicDEX = a reference product build on top of this technology that is currently at least partly a propreatiery product that charges a listing fee (part of our business model)


[07-Oct-19 07:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

Nice summary:  GUI maker charges a fee.
1.  The initial research to integrate a GUI
2. The initial designs of the GUI
3. The ongoing maintenance of the GUI
4. The ongoing maintenance of the coins on the network used in the GUI
5. Also I think there are a couple of servers chucked in for keeping a running marketmaker for the coin.

(5) Itself is worth the fee alone in some industries


[07-Oct-19 04:15 PM] phm87#7395
So if someone adds a coin into atomicdex code without the GUI part, then make an ugly GUI (or fork hyperdex to add the coin), is it bad or good ? I understood that there is no 7500$ fee (but no infra and the coin won't be on the official GUI of atomicdex). In my imagination, a fee will be paid but on each trade.


[07-Oct-19 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`is it bad or good ?`
that depends on the users' perspective


[07-Oct-19 04:38 PM] phm87#7395
I have still few dollars worth of random shitcoins that get delisted of everywhere ... maybe atomicdex is the solution to let their exchange rate reach 0 slowly (it can't be worst than scammy CEX with weak security and central delisting/listing decisions and different prices)

"the Walmart would be forking HyperDEX and adding the entire coins repo to it and charging little or nothing" I also agree with one of the statement of making it back on the fees , in addition microcap coins can have an exchange,  @grewalsatinder  talked about coin addition automation I believe it the way forward and could include in addition fee to the gui as well maybe 500$ and once it reached whole community can  start trading


[08-Oct-19 01:41 AM] applecider#7505
profit can be made aback over time , assuming in the future there would be 100,000 more coins created or a 1 million per year , ( that 500,000,000 in rev)


[08-Oct-19 01:46 AM] applecider#7505
add to the assumption that antara will make it very easy for individuals to create their own coins , my only con about the charging fee is that which comes first, the coins or the volume , in all successful exchanges (although some failed after)  listed a-lot of coins for free and as they gained (or faked)volume started charging to gain access to the volume , so I think it volume first fees later , not the other way round to create a profitable GUI

I don't really like people using hyperDEX as a example of something free and kinda working as a argument for not paying a listing fee. It was not free, the bill was just footed by someone else. I cannot fault others from recouping some development costs to implement your project.


[08-Oct-19 04:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Realistically it would be hard to make back all the sunk costs of a GUI development with trading fees alone. You need to have trading volumes in the millions DAILY to make anything and 10s of millions to support more than 1-2 devs.

Or better yet charging traders and merchants to setup a stall before you have created a footfall of customers , traders would rather pay for a stall at a place with higher volume of people


[08-Oct-19 07:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Get some decent volume for some big name coins and people will be begging to pay *only* 2000 usd


[08-Oct-19 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
if you see coins paying 2-3btc easy for some crap exchange where volume dies down after a few weeks/months 2k is peanuts


[08-Oct-19 07:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and you get to claim you are atomic swap capable ;p


[08-Oct-19 08:48 AM] siu#3920
the thing about volume in atomic dex is that its shared among GUIs


[08-Oct-19 08:48 AM] siu#3920
so i dont have to look for volume for "my exchange" but for the network itself.

@PTYX didn't you also want to make a GUI for atomicdex?


[08-Oct-19 10:25 AM] PTYX#6840
We're working on the Chameleon Dex but have a few other contracts that are prioritized. It will likely be available once the dex comes out of beta


[08-Oct-19 10:25 AM] jorian#4555

is it similar to atomicdex?


[08-Oct-19 10:26 AM] PTYX#6840
Similar yeah, the atomicdex is becoming very polished and there's only a few things I'd change


[08-Oct-19 10:27 AM] PTYX#6840
It will be integrated into Chameleon Pay


[08-Oct-19 10:30 AM] jorian#4555
mobile only?


[08-Oct-19 10:31 AM] applecider#7505
@siu listing fee will be a zero sum game then as all GUIs will have to compete to earn their listing fees (or price) , to allow coins to access the liquidity pool which is where the value comes from


[08-Oct-19 10:34 AM] applecider#7505
which is good competition is great in a free market albeit  first mover will get the listing advantage (first proper GUI , on mm2 I am assuming atomicdex)


[08-Oct-19 10:37 AM] applecider#7505
which is already playing out atomicdex is asking around 6500 usd and chainmaker is asking 2000 usd (~300% discount)


[08-Oct-19 12:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362

The thing about adding coins is that you will have to not just work to place some lines of code and test, you will also have a community that will use your app and will require support.

I know there could be better ideas for revenue streams but right now i dont know anything else other than asking for donations or placing a gui fee . At this point in time i dont see any other way to sustain the development. Unless komodo rises in price and NN are enough to sustain it.

Who on this Discord is actually part of the Komodo Platform team?  I have people messaging me here to answer my support questions, but one of them said he doesn't know what a "fungible cluster" is.  When I used the Antara Composer to make a new chain, "fungible cluster" was 1 of the 4 customizable categories, so it seems like something the team would know about.  The only official communication I've had so far is an email from Steve Lee, 12 days ago, saying that someone would contact me to answer my questions by the end of the day

Basically "one coin, many blockchains"


[13-Oct-19 11:27 AM] smkhound#7640
@runpaint a fungible chain allows cross chain token migration. a non-fungible chain does not.
basically with a fungible chain, you can migrate tokens from one chain in the cluster to another. We have done extensive testing in #kmdlabs with this

If 2 coins are fungible, does that mean they have to be swapped 1-for-1 and have equal value?  Or can an exchange rate be set?


[13-Oct-19 11:30 AM] Alright#0419
they are always 1 for 1 as of right now


[13-Oct-19 11:31 AM] Alright#0419
really simple way of thinking about it is that it's 1 coin spread across multiple blockchains


[13-Oct-19 11:31 AM] Alright#0419
each blockchain can have a unique purpose or feature


[13-Oct-19 11:31 AM] runpaint#7773
Ok but I assume both chains would have to whitelist the other, or else I could just make a billion coin premine and make it fungible with KMD


[13-Oct-19 11:32 AM] Alright#0419
It relies on a notary network to keep them fungible with each other. So for example, LABS requires 8 notaries to add a new chain.


[13-Oct-19 11:33 AM] Alright#0419
but yes, pretty much. You can add new coins to the supply by adding new chains to the cluster. LABS has a bunch of stuff to limit this though, could try to walk you through it if you're interested


[13-Oct-19 11:33 AM] Alright#0419
on LABS at least, it's not as simple as 8 notaries adding a new chain to print a billion new coins


[13-Oct-19 11:34 AM] smkhound#7640
they need to share the same ac_cc parameter to be in the same cluster. and migrations  are validated via dPoW, so without notaries to confirm the creation / burn, it wont happen.


[13-Oct-19 11:35 AM] runpaint#7773
Does AtomicDEX work on fungible clusters, or is that different

yes, I've added a few with electrums in the coins repo to the TUI without issue.

Thats possible - and not a biggie. So what is still unclear to you?


[13-Oct-19 11:55 AM] runpaint#7773
@ca333 is there a list of cluster numbers that are already in use, which I should avoid because other coins are on those clusters?  If there's no need to avoid overlapping cluster numbers, then it seems that the cluster numbers are unnecessary


[13-Oct-19 11:58 AM] runpaint#7773
Maybe the Antara Composer system would've told me the cluster number was already taken, if I had chosen a cluster that was already taken.


[13-Oct-19 12:12 PM] ca333#0333
We don't enforce "unique" cluster IDs (ac_cc param) since you couldn't launch a second chain to interact with the initial chain. Already "taken" cluster IDs can be found here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/blob/dev/src/assetchains.old - and more infos ref. clusters of chains whose tokens are fungible: https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-setup/antara-customizations.html#ac-cc

If I don't die, I'm about to buy BTC at $9,900.  Either way it's no fun, but if I survive I'm planning to host a bitcoin ATM soon in a safer place.

I'd like to restate my recommendation that Komodo add a legal/compliance page to the website, as well as Antara Composer.

This should include access to the legal documentation stating KMD is not a security (Howey Test), and also an explanation (preferably by legal professional), as well as linking Money Transmitter regulations, stating that AtomicDEX does not fall into Money Transmitter category.

These are important for comforting investors of KMD to make sure they can stay compliant if need be, as well as opening up KMD to others. It also gives gives businesses or other projects comfort to build on Atomicdex.


Based on the information here.

I would assume most people who visit the site won't bother browsing the legal section, but those who are looking for it will appreciate it. The reality is Komodo is one of thousands of crypto projects and having information easily available that a company/business/project would ask for saves them the effort of having to reach out to ask for something that might not even exist.


[16-Oct-19 08:28 PM] Regnar#6164
A business browsing hundreds of crypto project websites isn't going to reach out to each of them and ask for something most of them won't even have. This may be more in line with giving them something they didn't know they wanted

Read an interesting article about the scalability issue of public Blockchains, how Ethereum is becoming increasingly centralised as more and more nodes are unable to sync due to network demands, and why this will force Ethereum to increase blocksize cap which will raise fees and eventually prevent DApps from functioning. Was curious to understand if this is an issue that Komodo may face in the future and if so, how would one mitigate the risk? https://hackernoon.com/the-ethereum-blockchain-size-has-exceeded-1tb-and-yes-its-an-issue-2b650b5f4f62

[20-Oct-19 05:21 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I believe the core concept of having a multi-chain ecosystem completely negates this from being a factor. Each chain has it's own blockchain and doesn't require the komodo chain to do anything.


[20-Oct-19 06:06 AM] Matthias#2174
Ok so nothing is built on the Komodo chain itself?


[20-Oct-19 06:46 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Matthias Whatever is built on Komodo main blockchain is adoptable by the Antara Smartchains.
If you for example start your own project using Komodo tech, instead of creating a token on top of KMD's main chain unlike Ethereum's ERC20 tokens, you are actually using the Komodo's daemon `komodod` to start your very own blockchain with few blockchain parameters including it's name, supply, consensus and many other configurable params, which gives you full control on it.

[20-Oct-19 06:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Since you have your own independent blockchain you don't even get scalability issue unless your own project hits it's peak block size limit


[20-Oct-19 06:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and even if you hit that, there is then scalability solution which lets you make a cluster of your very own project's blockchain.


[20-Oct-19 06:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
this cluster of your own blockchain gives your unlimited scalability option


[20-Oct-19 06:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

I can imagine that someday there will be stuff other than notarizations, but as pointed out above there's no need to ever carry as much data as Ethereum does per block

[24-Oct-19 05:42 AM] Regnar#6164
I think it would be a good idea to have an ecosystem github list where people who are independently developing Komodo capabilities can voluntarily list their github repos. This could account for when people fork branches to work on them themselves before merging back, or those branches that don't ever get merged into Komodo but are still part of the development ecosystem. For example I have some Python repos for an nSPV wallet, some RPC wrappers, and TokensCC APIs and projects on my github which are Komodo specific but aren't considered in the development ecosystem by a lot of metrics.

Not sure what this "list" would look like structure wise

Yea I thought it would be a good idea to try and get a better understanding of the entire Komodo development ecosystem. While I don't consider myself a dev, I do work on some things specifically for Komodo in Python, and things like that should show true activity within Komodo.


[24-Oct-19 06:27 AM] CrisF#3405
Feedback: 

- different colors on the vis? My eyes had a little trouble. 

- maybe total # of commits in the summary up top? Something easily comparable to other projects? 

I like it. That will be a useful document.

Dudes- let me just throw out this here:
https://crypto1xbit.com/en/information/contacts/
just a suggestion- 
https://crypto1xbit.com/en/
seems like a new generation crypto casino, maybe they could be interested in using KMD platform tech?
very much screams BET and CHIPS at me...
last time I checked online casinos for crypto use, nothing like this was on the market, like 3 years ago or so,  BTC usage looked mostly like a grudging and sloppy add-on, but these guys seem to have fully embraced crypto
ofc all centralized and all that- but that is status of industry now
so if they are really innovative and proactive, maybe they see the advantage of a truly decentralized casino platform and start looking at KMD platform tech and maybe implement it ?
How about just reaching out to them and try to start a conversation with them?
KMD has the tech, but not the capabilities to be an online casino (like creating GUIs etc)

ofc a business has to earn money, and online casinos that provide poker tables want to rake the fees, but that business model still works with decentralized solutions, so if they are really innovative and understand decentrlaized tech they will appreciate this fact


[26-Oct-19 10:47 PM] LocoMB#8593
Just needs some proper business development from KMDs side to inititate such a possible partnership, maybe via RFOX?!?!

"For instance, if you want to trade a OmiseGo (OMG, an ERC-20 token) with Monero (XMR, a privacy coin with its own unique protocol), you would need to trade from OMG to ETH and then from ETH to XMR. It wouldn’t be possible to trade directly from OMG to XMR"

IMHO this may not be the best example to use as XMR isn't supported on AtomicDEX yet? From the recent decentralised exchange article


[29-Oct-19 02:07 PM] Cabey#3299
Especially when this is mentioned shortly after "For a truly decentralized exchange, all of the challenges described above are overcome"


[29-Oct-19 02:11 PM] Cabey#3299
Perhaps using NEP5 token as an example may be better?

@ComputerGenie You don’t know the context, so let use moderators do our work. You don’t respond either on my messages. Please do.

[31-Oct-19 06:08 AM] Farl#9964
Discord channels of Komodo are not ment for these personal insults. We like to keep things ontopic and clear for everyone.


[31-Oct-19 06:09 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
It's just my random 2 cents that being over-restrictive to people that are confused can and usually does have a negative impact
That aside, if you think anything I said was a personal insult, then you have not read the words I wrote


[31-Oct-19 06:13 AM] Farl#9964
Insulting is maybe not the right word, but you are critizing our actions and you don’t know the whole story. That is what I was trying to explain to your personally, but you haven’t responded to my DM.


[31-Oct-19 06:19 AM] Audo#5667
A person was spamming the same message on multiple channels, called another person a scammer, and didn't respont to DM. He got muted for 10 minutes. Seems like a reasonable action to me.


[31-Oct-19 06:21 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`but you are critizing our actions and you don’t know the whole story`
And you're still missing the point that it's likely that whomever he tells the tale to will know less than I do
`called another person a scammer, and didn't respont to DM...`
then that should be the reason used, not 'repeating complaints atomicdex everywhere'
My point is that mods need to be mindful of not only what is going on, but the outside result that it can have


[31-Oct-19 06:25 AM] Audo#5667
I also said 'spamming the same message on multiple channels'

Yes, thank you for the feedback. The instructions are to first warn and then mute if a warning is ignored. There are edge cases and in this case this guy was clearly frustrated and started spamming channels. I agree with @Farl that a short mute & warning was good, like he did. I don't see any issue here.

If we need to continue this discussion let's do it on #questions-and-feedback

i just read the atomicdex stress test result announcement.   i used to load test national inbound call centres for carriers with custom software and reading @ca333 's message is great to read.  the dev of the atomic dex network, to maximize the swap-ability up until this point, that enabled ppl to work with the beta product, to see it in action has been very useful - ppl can see the magic working.

to now turn the screws on optimizations at network level is next-level professionalism.

Here is the info on hte underlying p2p network as written by the devs!

I know it isn't a thing Komodo does often but I've been thinking about how to get a better grasp on a general "road map" of sorts within the ecosystem. For example, looking at CC-Assets(tokens) I see some cool proof of concepts being made (I worked on some admittedly less cool ones here). Or the current development on the gaming SDKs, etc. Any Idea on how to display progress on these different things to give someone a single directory to learn about all the different work being done?


[02-Nov-19 04:37 PM] Regnar#6164
and by progress I don't mean commits, but more general terms that would be more "road map" like


[02-Nov-19 04:43 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Maybe an interactive visual that starts at the top and branches off in a downwards manner?

Ie Komodo up top

Scaling | cc | privacy | dex
Then branch off into what is being worked on for the categories, % to completion/estimated timeframe for beta/public release


[02-Nov-19 04:43 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Would be nice to have a roadmap but there’s way too many things to display neatly in a single line imo


[02-Nov-19 05:02 PM] Regnar#6164
yea definitely too many things for a roadmap, and individual developers are pretty scattered about doing different things.


[02-Nov-19 05:03 PM] Regnar#6164
But I'm trying to think of a good way to showcase some of the proof of concepts we see popping up on random discord channels. This came about because of the Pokemon PoC in #cc-assets


[02-Nov-19 05:04 PM] Regnar#6164
I think something like this would be helpful for developers or even just curious people to see the things that are being made or could be made, specifically with CCs


[02-Nov-19 05:10 PM] Regnar#6164

with each branch possibly being a CC and the sub branches being github links to different things being built with them


[02-Nov-19 05:13 PM] Regnar#6164
Or maybe CC is a branch with the different CCs under it and so on, but the higher branches are more wider

Hi @Regnar,
An example for devs and people to see what can be done is exactly what is needed.  I'm very grateful that PHBA made his pokemon app in #cc-assets.  It is a great answer to questions I've been getting that can then be followed up with docs and q&a.

A template of things that could be worked on for all of the CCs is what I'm hoping for.

(AtomicDEX is actually the best example of an app being made to show what can be done.)

With a basic template of what is needed a TRELLO or something similar could be made and people could work on the cc/area that they're interested in and tick things off the to do list.

Haha, well someone's got to do it :3040_kingpeepo: I've got a job I'm preparing for atm, and fitting others in where I can.  Will add organizing an example of setting up a demo app for a CC.  (assets in this case.)

The road map looks like what I was thinking for a Trello.  Things to be done leading to a simple usecase that could serve as a demo of the tech.


[03-Nov-19 08:56 AM] CrisF#3405
The roadmap would lead to the completion of the demo app and could serve as a basic template for projects to use to make use of the CC if they wanted.
If nothing more it could help us get demo apps for CC's up and running.


[03-Nov-19 09:01 AM] CrisF#3405
PHBA2061 has basically made an app (in #cc-assets that demos 1 feature of the tokens CC.  With a bit more the tokens CC's would be basically done and then making a marketplace app could complete the assets CC.

Would like to get a simple demo GUI made for it that would show off its potential.  
And get the same made for most of the other Modules.

@Bl0ckchain @zhusu What does "A DEX must be non-custodial." even mean abstractly speaking? Can (anything on top of) ETH ever be non custodial, given ETH's history to hard fork to take custody of funds from a hacker?

[06-Nov-19 05:25 AM] Daniel CP#2020
a DEX being non-custodial is a separate issue from a blockchain's immutability

Suppose a popular smart contract wallet that a large portion of the ETH community uses gets hacked. This could be reverted by reverting all chain activity since the hack and doing a DAO-style HF to recover the funds. How much ETH must be at stake for you to support this?

Hey, yeah that was part of our meetup campaign – but it is now over. Maybe we will have another one in the future. Of  course everyone is welcome to make Komodo meetups at any time and we are always ready to join calls and give interviews.

If someone wants to become a Komodo ambassador they can leave an application here: https://forms.monday.com/forms/a88c2459f9a5b716db778415e11cc18f

We are always looking for knowledgeable individuals who know Komodo technology, their local area, and has connections to the local blockchain space. Ambassador work is largely volunteer based though.


[07-Nov-19 05:00 AM] Adams#9563

@Jacobstoon @gordonkomodo Thanks for sharing, this makes more sense.

It's confusing as you can find this quote in the article:

Question, i assume its because the algo to make it quantum resistant is interchangeable?


[10-Nov-19 02:13 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
A new cc module would probably have to be coded


[10-Nov-19 02:38 PM] Regnar#6164
Basically, we can't definitively say anything is quantum resistant as there aren't any quantum computers to actually test it against. We know how quantum computers will solve problems, and can then use problems to create public and private keys that aren't easy for them to solve. NIST accepts QR proposals, but can't claim any are secure for sure until we have a QC to test them against. Dilithium module, if I remember right, requires two signatures to spend, one which is your typical signature like Bitcoin and Komodo, the other is a signature created with a problem that is presumed to be difficult for a QC to solve (I believe Dilithium Crystals is Lattice based). So both signatures are used.

Hi, I was on the Telegram side sharing my ideas and I decided to come here and see what you all think.
1. We need a tipbot on twitter. One that can send KMD and ARRR to anyone even if they haven't already activated it. This way one can tip another user first and when they ask you "what the F is this KMD" you just say "well, now you are invested in it, so take a look".
2. This is going a bit overboard but: If one could build a same kind of frame to youtube. If youtube wouldn't agree to use tipbots in comment sections, but with a browser extension that recognizes youtube you still could tip ovet youtube to for example crypto tubers.

[19-Nov-19 04:26 AM] turinglabs#2390
I think it's the "extension" part

I really need to pinpoint that it is important that one could give a tip to anyone even if they haven't already activated the bot themselves. The XRP tipbot is maybe the best at this time.

@Hember | $ARRR sure it can be done, the idea is that the bot just create an encrypted wallet and send the password via DM (like the old bucaneer). This password + payload can be imported into an extension (like https://id.scryptachain.org or metamask) and the extension will inject the necessary code to youtube / twitter to create a popup and make the transaction

if you want to send tips directly from the browser we need to know two things: were are the utxo and how to sign transactions from client side (if we want to create a trustless client-side wallet) or we can just create a couple of nodes that knows the private keys of every user and sign stuff in a "centralized" way


[19-Nov-19 05:25 AM] turinglabs#2390
i think the first is the best, for security, transparency and responsibility

[19-Nov-19 05:31 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
Would this "youtube tipbot" (I think in the end it could be used on any social media platform) be secure enough and could it be built on top of trusted projects like Metamask? I mean with is there any difference when it comes to coins, that one is more possible to build into Metamask than others?


[19-Nov-19 05:33 AM] turinglabs#2390
@gcharang i think that the hard stuff is sign transactions and if it works i've the code ready, just need to make some tests on the komodo blockchain

[19-Nov-19 05:35 AM] turinglabs#2390
@Hember | $ARRR we can build something that works LIKE metamask, i think that metamask is really close the ethereum ecosystem and it's not ready for this kind of cross chain functionalities. We can build something "secure enough" because we don't store data on a server and we don't store any kind of password. Encryption is always the AES-256 which is secure enough with strong passwords. I think we need to make the code open so anyone can contribute to these security stuff

I am so sure that this would make a huge difference in adoption of Komodo tech as the brand would be known

[19-Nov-19 09:03 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
@turinglabs , I came up with some ideas while walking in the nature a half an hour ago.


[19-Nov-19 09:12 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
So.. I was thinking about the "forced tip" that one could give to another although they aren't yet using the system. To really have a psychological impact this would be an important feature to have. But if there was such a "forced tip" I think it would also need to be a tip that returns to the sender if the person receiving the tip wouldn't collect it.
This is because it is possible that people try to tip big influencers, but those creators are millionaires. They would not collect the tip.
But to a person who gets a "big" tip from a subscriber giving him a days work of money, that would be a blessing. And the reaction in a content creators mind is to than that person giving the money.
Some projects are probably trying to use these millionaire influencers. That is why their product will die. Some people first think it is great to pay your idol yourself, but that is the only thing they will use it for - paying millionaires. These project do this because they do not already have a currency that is really worth something and valuable itself. But Komodo has, so the strategy can and should be diffetern.


[19-Nov-19 09:12 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
different*


[19-Nov-19 09:14 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
Now, I would love to be able to be the first, or one of the first people on the internet to make some donations and a video about this project. I myself would love to make another small but talented creators day. And I am sure as the word goes out again and again about how someone "just made my day/week/month/year" then the millionaires would start using it too to monetize their content further.


[19-Nov-19 09:17 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
But by this time there would be a community that understands the value of this product to have compassion to those creators in need, and this system would carry on developing. And surely in the end it might be possible to just add AtomicDEX to it and give the people the choice to use other currencies, too. But maybe making sure that when usin KMD (or another Komodo ecosystem coin) the transaction costs were the smallest.


[19-Nov-19 09:18 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
It might be nice if there was a referral link for the first people to market this product, too. Not so that everyone would have a referral, but just in the beginning to motivate tipping and publishing content about this product, and posting that referral in the midst.


[19-Nov-19 09:19 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
Some of these thoughts may be something that are apparent but I think it is better to say them than assume that people think about these things


[19-Nov-19 09:25 AM] turinglabs#2390
i think this is a second level of process, to tune the system we first need it working and realized, then we can try to understand how people will use this and how make it better. I think that if we create the system in a decentralized way there's no "return policy" because transactions are written in the blockchain..however we can try to create something that can minimize this loss of funds..


[19-Nov-19 09:26 AM] turinglabs#2390
i'm now trying to understand why the transactions are not accepted by my node 😂


[19-Nov-19 09:27 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
Yeah, I thought that this is the second step, but I thought it also might be useful to keep in mind from the start. As I don't know how coding works and how soon these things become important to realize.

And if it feels that this is going to become something, I am here to come back to these thoughts, suggestions and strategies. In fact I feel like this is something where I could find my place to provide to Komodo... not just mindlessly shilling. 😄

There is this full stack developer looking for a position and he asked me if I could point to a direction and I did. There is a bounty that if you a refer a dev and he gets the position, the referrer gets 1777 KMD. I don't know how this works, but I can give the guys discord alias in case stuff happens.

Is there any interest in having Komodo be a sponsor or just reps go to CoinfestUK this upcoming April? I'm not sure who on the team handles event planning @Audo, but figured you'd be the guy to tag who would.
If we want to be a sponsor there's a discount currently.

Bagde sounds good, Agama is not a Komodo wallet anymore tho, it's a multi coin wallet for the Komodo ecosystem, nor we have the jurisdiction to change the name i think, maybe Verus team can initiate such name change but I doubt it would beneficial for them.
Komodo Ocean QT is a komodo wallet and it's name reflects that.

Hey team, it might be a cool idea marketing wise and also to showcase what can be done with Antara, to build an Antara smartchain to put these tweets on a blockchain. We could throw an explorer up that lets people view their deceased friend's and family's twitters and give it over to the Internet Wayback Machine. Make the nodes public so others can contribute to maintaining it, and make the blocks mined on demand (when new people are added)

[20-Dec-19 12:32 AM] gcharang#6833
@k2cgroup atomicDEX uses HTLCs on utxo chains and smart contracts on ETH and other compatible smart contract chains
Monero doesn't have something similar
while there is this proposal <https://github.com/h4sh3d/xmr-btc-atomic-swap/blob/master/whitepaper/xmr-btc.pdf> for a monero-btc swap, it is vastly different from atomicDEX's protocol
while it is doubtful if we will support Monero in the near future, we might work on it at a later date

@SHossain 

Are you referring to the `DO_NOT_USE....` addresses?

I put those there because there were people a few years ago who lost money from a Bitcoin address that was on the wiki page and that address wandered its way into some user's actual wallet, and the money was stolen by someone who watches all addresses that are ever made available online.


[13-Jan-20 01:39 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, i was referring to `DO_NOT_USE...`. This doc is not for bitcoin to be clear. the doc uses a chain called HELLOWORLD which doesn't have any value. maybe you can put an warning in bold and red capital letters to not use this address for real coins.
but, the outputs should represent what the user will actually see.
additionally, the address you will use there, maybe dump the privkey of that address and put it there.

Any idea if Atomicdex will bring back 0Confs or another type of instant swap solution?


[14-Jan-20 05:44 PM] richardt#2807
@Regnar that's probably a logical next step. Most users are way too impatient to wait for a swap (especially with BTC), have it potentially fail and then waiting 4 hrs to get funds back to try again


[14-Jan-20 05:58 PM] Regnar#6164
yea AtomicDEX has it's benefits especially in safety of holding your own keys and swaps being atomic. When compared to a speed test of a regular CEX, even with a 10 minute swap time, you are still likely an hour or two under the deposit times (lots of confirmations) and then trade on a CEX. So I'd say we have the "Deposit/trade/withdraw" crowd well covered. 

However the "Deposit/trade" only crowd is a bit tougher with longer swap times. They are the most at risk of CEX being attacked, but are mostly searching for the faster trade confirmations. Giving them the benefits of holding their own keys and faster trade times is the best of both worlds. Though the instant swap services are generally using a GatewaysCC/ChannelsCC hybrid, or just lowering block confirmations to near 0 (susceptible to Replace by Fee I would assume)


[14-Jan-20 06:22 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That’s the issue.   Collateralization is a measure to stop that but will only get you so far.


[14-Jan-20 08:19 PM] Regnar#6164
Could use Gateways to tokenize an asset, Channels to instant swap them, and then convert them back to native currencies. Though that would be the whole "trading proxy tokens" thing which isn't ideal. But it could be a good idea for those who want instant, high speed trading.


[14-Jan-20 09:07 PM] richardt#2807
As long as there's a solution to make the "proxy tokens" decentralized, then shouldn't be an issue


[14-Jan-20 09:08 PM] richardt#2807
But could see how that would get complicated in an already very complicated system


[14-Jan-20 09:12 PM] richardt#2807
Regardless, the basic swaps need to be more scalable and reliable first to even begin looking into the next steps


[14-Jan-20 10:14 PM] jl777c#5810
gateways CC can make a 1:1 token and the tokenbid/ask used to make a market out of such things. they cant help but be atomic swaps as they would all be on the same blockchain. with 7of13 msig signers it can strongly be argued that no single person has any custody over the deposited funds...


[14-Jan-20 10:15 PM] jl777c#5810
however, this is a borderline case and already very crowded with competitors (though none of them seem to be using msig deposits)
