Topic: √òPay is an Android and IOS app from √ò Crypto Union that will allow users to collateralise their Komodo to receive a line of credit in the fiat currency of their choice*. In recent months, √ò has worked closely with Indenodes to bring √òPay and the other financial services that √ò provides to the Komodo ecosystem. Beginning with Kmd integration within the app, √ò also plans to release a stable coin backed by secured debt through an asset-chain as well as the migration of our security token unto the Komodo platform and much more. https://ocryptounion.io/komodo-campaign/

Hey everyone :)
A lot of you may be already familiar with us here at √ò already from the Neuchatel meetup or otherwise, but for those who don't already know we've been working closely with Indenodes for several months now and recently launched our Komodo crowdunding campaign with much help from @Ludom and others. Please do check it out over at https://ocryptounion.io/komodo-campaign/

We've already hit our first milestone and will be launching the KSB asset chain very soon, so again, big thanks to everyone who's taken part so far!


[18-Dec-18 04:53 AM] leepyd#0969
That's it! KSB is now live with its own Komodo asset chain, thank you again for your early support! üçæ ‚ú®

Nothing easier: 1 KSB = $1. But what if the market continues to decline? 
Don't worry, 1 KSB is still $1.

We have conceived KSB as a token design for diversification and securing of your portfolio.

You can find more details about Komodo Secured Bond on our whitepaper (https://ksb.money/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/KSB-Whitepaper-v0.1.pdf) and you can be the first to buy $KSB on our website (https://ksb.money/buy-ksb-now/)

Thanks to the Komodo community support, Indenodes & Metaphilibert, we have been able to successfully complete the stage #1 of our crowdfunding campaign: Komodo asset backed stable coin, KSB is now up and running (Komodo asset chain and token). 
Today, we are officially launching the stage #2 and with it its crowdfunding, migration of √ò Crypto Union Token OUR (ex GXE) from Ethereum to Komodo.
We will publish characteristics and the history of our company token from GXE to OUR later during the day.

Thank you all for your early support.

but I just do as instructed by ludom

Was Ludom one of the founders of the project at inception? Or did he join and convince them to move to kmd?

Hi

@Crabby Paddy I'm not a founder of the project


[30-Dec-18 08:41 AM] Ludom#5832
And yes I joined the project and "convince" the to move to Komodo


[30-Dec-18 08:42 AM] Ludom#5832
It was easy to convince because our tech based on own blockchain secured by Bitcoin was the best for such project


[30-Dec-18 08:43 AM] Ludom#5832
I have a lot to explain about O Crypto Union and the history of the project.


[30-Dec-18 08:45 AM] Ludom#5832
The project is well known in my frenchspeaking Bitcoiner's network


[30-Dec-18 08:46 AM] Ludom#5832
I personaly know @Adli and @fab and I also meet the team in June 2018.


[30-Dec-18 08:49 AM] Ludom#5832
I don't know if the business will be the "future" of banking, it's a start up and it's risky as every investements that could give good ROI.


[30-Dec-18 08:50 AM] Ludom#5832
But I massively invested (and invest) in the business : financialy and with my own work/advises


[30-Dec-18 08:51 AM] Ludom#5832
The business is legit and the team is serious. They work hard to make the project successful.


[30-Dec-18 08:52 AM] Ludom#5832
But it's diffculte time for them because (as you certainly know üòá ) the bearmarket of 2018 (and certainly 2019) destroy the possibility to developp the business.


[30-Dec-18 08:54 AM] Ludom#5832
That's not the point for me. Bearmarket is just a bad moment but soon the bull market will be back


[30-Dec-18 08:54 AM] Ludom#5832
And it's the right moment to developp new businesses and financial tools for Komodo


[30-Dec-18 08:55 AM] Ludom#5832
The most important is to have a well tested Banking system on Komodo when the Bull market will be back


[30-Dec-18 09:01 AM] Ludom#5832
Right now, the O Crypto Union is in "survival mode" : 
- The main tools are ready: banking licence, app and the most important bank services. 
- The team is as little as possible to manage and developp the business. The goal is to manage the survive of the company and lower the spending.
- The strategy to focus on Komodo needs less resources to developp and test the services


[30-Dec-18 09:02 AM] Ludom#5832
But O Crypto Union needs our support to continue the development

2019, Up for the challenge!

For many of us, the New Year is a moment to reflect on the past and prepare for the year ahead.

As I reflect upon 2018, I am filled with gratitude to be a part of this community. I'm particularly thankful for @Ludom , one of our top investors and board members; for @Yassin  and @sœÜldat , among our very first token holders; and for @metaphilibert and his indispensable guidance. 


We've had the pleasure of finding genuine, warm, giving people in the KOMODO community and we hope that our contribution to the community will also be meaningful as we strive to give back.


Shifting now to thoughts on what lies ahead, I'd like to share a summary of my economic prospective for 2019 (ideas that I plan to develop further on our Discord channel).


[01-Jan-19 01:48 PM] Fab√ò#8941
2019 & 2020: Years of Opportunity

What I envision happening in 2019 (and something my team members have discussed at length) is a dynamic blend of difficulty and opportunity. First, a global financial crisis hangs on the horizon and may amount to a currency crisis. While this sounds grim, I see it as a chance for our community (and for people in general) to pull together and find better ways to work and interact. 


Looking at what appears to be an impending global financial crisis, the picture does look a bit grim at first. As economic growth slows and profits slump, we may see mounting debt pressure rendering private institutions (especially banks) unable to honor their debts and fulfill their engagements -- likely resulting in default.


In response to defaults, defiant economic actors are likely to significantly raise risk premiums, triggering cost and volume of debts (and proliferating even more defaults). 

In terms of mitigation, governments and leaders are both ill-equipped and stunted by a poor track record. Many have already used and abused the buy-out card, and in many cases they lack the resources, credibility and method to pass it along to taxpayers -- who are still digesting the last bill.


[01-Jan-19 01:49 PM] Fab√ò#8941
Instead, we will see an increase in protectionist/populist political measures motivated by short term views. The result will trigger the deflagration of traditional monetary spaces.


But here's the silver lining: negative downturns in the global markets may spur a concurrent upswing in the crypto community. Coin prices may surge and relevant crypto asset projects will attract even more people searching for solutions. This could lead to an increase in demand for crypto-related jobs and with it, incentives to contribute and develop the system.


These dynamic shifts can be a positive game changer. It's times like this --when the cards get redistributed--that change be transmuted into opportunity with widespread benefits. 


Based on this forecast and the outcome of many variables, I stake my career and my family's future -- a sentiment that many of us working in the crypto community share. Looking to the future with informed optimism is how we can work to land on the right side of the fence. This is why it is critical that we develop a viable, alternative ecosystem. A major step in that direction is the creation of KSB, a stable coin by design built on a KOMODO asset chain. After numerous exchanges with different protocol leaders, we feel evermore confident about putting our time and effort into to the KOMODO ecosystem, reaching out to new users and developing our services on the Komodo platform.

@Fab√ò can I send directly from mercatox to the swap address? If so, what to use as the 'from' address in your webform? THX!


[15-Jan-19 02:02 AM] Fab√ò#8941
Hello @jansako yep no problem


[15-Jan-19 02:02 AM] Fab√ò#8941

very excited about it


[15-Jan-19 02:04 AM] Fab√ò#8941
was depressing to see such a low price and all those bots on Mercatox


[15-Jan-19 02:04 AM] Fab√ò#8941
what a relief


[15-Jan-19 02:08 AM] jansako#3330
Sorry to be a pain, does not look like I can generate a depo addres on Mercatox any more :-(... the thing is just spinning... page reload did not fix it either.


[15-Jan-19 02:09 AM] jansako#3330

no worry mate


[15-Jan-19 03:20 AM] Fab√ò#8941
we will swap your GXE


[15-Jan-19 03:20 AM] Fab√ò#8941
even if it takes a little bite of time


[15-Jan-19 11:35 PM] Ludom#5832
I continue to give this advise: use your own address when you need to swap, participate to ICO or buy things.

talking to Anton and CLaudio of  Digitalprice


[16-Jan-19 08:25 AM] Fab√ò#8941
they could list all the tokens against KSB (usd) for a 5btc listing price


[16-Jan-19 08:26 AM] Fab√ò#8941
could be done if we find a way to all the project  can contribute partially for it


[16-Jan-19 08:26 AM] Fab√ò#8941
as it will create a fiat gateway


[16-Jan-19 08:26 AM] Fab√ò#8941
KSB is a stable coin


[16-Jan-19 08:26 AM] Fab√ò#8941
so we dont keep any supply for ourselves


[16-Jan-19 08:26 AM] Fab√ò#8941
and the peg is 1/1


[16-Jan-19 08:27 AM] Fab√ò#8941
so we can't do this alone

I'm very confused about the fiat gate way into digital price


[16-Jan-19 09:48 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
for 5 btc I would also require to list again Hush


[16-Jan-19 09:48 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
@Berg what do you say?


[16-Jan-19 09:49 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
this requires a coordinated crowdfuning


[16-Jan-19 09:55 AM] Fab√ò#8941
agreed @KomodoWorld


[16-Jan-19 09:56 AM] Fab√ò#8941
Digital Price, Anton and CLaudio said that they will list all the existing tokens present on digitaprice against KSB


[16-Jan-19 09:57 AM] Fab√ò#8941
so all of them will be pair with a stable coin and offer a way in and out in Fiat (gbp/aud/euro/usd)


[16-Jan-19 09:58 AM] Fab√ò#8941
I agreed a Pooling will resolve the question of the 5btc


[16-Jan-19 09:58 AM] Fab√ò#8941
pooling versus crowdfunding whatever is best for all the parties


[16-Jan-19 09:58 AM] Fab√ò#8941
who could be escrow?


[16-Jan-19 10:00 AM] Fab√ò#8941
this is also very attractive to display that all the assetchain being listed in digitalprice could also access fiat gateway


[16-Jan-19 10:00 AM] Fab√ò#8941
and a stablecoin


[16-Jan-19 10:00 AM] Fab√ò#8941

happy to answer any questions


[16-Jan-19 10:14 AM] Fab√ò#8941
So from what I gathered this stablecoin FIat gateway solution on DP exchange could be an interesting feature for #pirate #verus #lumber #hush #coincollect and #coqui

I think we could resume KSB this way Video: https://youtu.be/r9skeEnzGLY

Whitepaper:
https://ksb.money/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/KSB-Whitepaper-v0.1.pdf

IMO the interesting are: #1 no conflict of interest (no supply kept), #2 totally atomize
the underlying assets are T-bills and secured promissory notes (basically debtors and creditors) so banks can disappear
OCU can disappear does not kill it

@Fab√ò i still dont understand if i have ¬£100, how can i get it on to digitial price without fee or minimal fee. At the moment the only way is though coin base and they charge 4% to deposit and it cost a lot to withdraw bitcoin from digital price.


[16-Jan-19 10:28 AM] Fab√ò#8941
we charge 1% for most money including the pound


[16-Jan-19 10:28 AM] Fab√ò#8941
you get your KSB right away


[16-Jan-19 10:28 AM] Fab√ò#8941
(max few hours)


[16-Jan-19 10:28 AM] Fab√ò#8941
you transfer your ksb to DP and you can buy anything you want


[16-Jan-19 10:29 AM] Fab√ò#8941
KSB is acting here as a gateway


[16-Jan-19 10:29 AM] Fab√ò#8941
we just need to proceed with the listing of all the coins with DP


[16-Jan-19 10:30 AM] Fab√ò#8941
my thinking is that we need outside money to all growth


[16-Jan-19 10:30 AM] Fab√ò#8941
we need to all X doors and bridges


[16-Jan-19 10:31 AM] Fab√ò#8941
people want know that they can go in and out fairly easily, store in a safe way without having to withdraw and go through their banks


[16-Jan-19 10:49 AM] GlorymanRTS#0512
this is a good idea


[16-Jan-19 10:49 AM] GlorymanRTS#0512
i will try it out when it becomes available on digital price.


[16-Jan-19 10:54 AM] Fab√ò#8941

And you didn't mention the possibility of KSB+ when the Lombard credits will be open


[16-Jan-19 11:02 AM] Ludom#5832
KSB is a financial tool


[16-Jan-19 11:03 AM] Ludom#5832
It's a stable coin but it'll open possibility to buy dept and receive the interest.


[16-Jan-19 11:13 AM] Fab√ò#8941

Does any of that 1% ksb fee go to our holders üòÆ


[17-Jan-19 12:22 AM] Ludom#5832
First the 1% KSB fee are used to pay expenses of the company and further development. But if there is benefit,  it would be dividends to OUR hollders


[17-Jan-19 12:23 AM] Ludom#5832
OUR are normal company shares


[17-Jan-19 12:24 AM] Ludom#5832

[11-Feb-19 11:13 AM] Fab√ò#8941
CONTEXT
As Neo bankers, we decided to issue this cryptocurrency for anyone who needs
a stable, tradable unit. One application of Komodo Stable Bonds financial services which include payments (debit and credit cards), savings and lending capabilities. Our
payment solutions are independent services and naturally compliment KSB ‚Äì
providing flexibility on how the loans can be spent.
------
3/ Komodo Stable Bonds ; A stable currency
3.1 Function 1 - A Unit of Account, measurement of value
A unit of account is something that can be used to value goods and services,
record debts, and make calculations. In other words, it‚Äôs a measurement for
the value used to represent the real value (or cost) of any economic item; i.e.
goods, services, assets, liabilities, income, expenses. It is one of three well-known
functions of money. It lends meaning to profits, losses, liability, or assets.
------


[11-Feb-19 11:13 AM] Fab√ò#8941
3.2 Function 2 - The Basis of Credit:
Credit is a contractual agreement in which a borrower receives something of
value now and agrees to repay the lender at some later date with consideration,
generally with interest. Use cases:
‚Ä¢ Student debt
‚Ä¢ Credit card
‚Ä¢ P2P loan
‚Ä¢ Equity Loan
‚Ä¢ Seller financing
--------
3.3 Function 3 - A Standard of Postponed Payment:
It is the function of being a widely accepted way to value a debt; thereby allowing
goods and services to be acquired now and paid for in the future. Use cases:
‚Ä¢ Consignment shop
‚Ä¢ Seller financing
--------


[11-Feb-19 11:23 AM] Fab√ò#8941
3.4 Function 4 - Medium of exchange
A medium of exchange is something that buyers will exchange with a seller
when they want to purchase goods or services from the seller. While many
things could be used as a medium of exchange in an economy, money is the
most common and useful medium of exchange in our society. Use cases:
‚Ä¢ Gas
‚Ä¢ Decentralized and stable marketplace
‚Ä¢ Smart Grid
‚Ä¢ Peer to Peer transactions
‚Ä¢ On demand Prepaid industry (ex: bitmedia.io)
-------
3.5 Function 5 - A Store of Value (Purchasing Power):
A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and
exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved Use cases:
‚Ä¢ Savings
‚Äì Retirement plan
‚Äì Tontines
‚Äì Insurance (health, car, home ownership)
‚Äì Health plan
‚Äì Vacations

Mercatox consider listing OUR which could be good --opening the door to fast track listing of other Komodo asset chain

We been lucky enough to test Zaddex, this Exchange gonna be a big thing in the coming months & huge in 1 semester or 2 especially with the DEX being released. Maybe an exchange with Komodo asset chains, debit card, asset backed loans and a launchpad for SME Coins who knows ... üòÉ  That would be ideal            https://coinpaprika.com/coin/zex-zaddex/

apparently somebody thought it would be a good idea to partner us with @@Fab√ò on last Tech tuesdays :) 

We do have added several stable tokens to our wallet and we are very near to integrate them with our fiat gateway & card program, so it wouldnt be a problem to make Mylo's forecast true, but I'm not aware of CryptoUnion project  status

''Also, the Peer2Group‚Äôs¬†Pungo Wallet¬†which recently partnered with the KSB (Komodo Secured Bond) Stable Coin from¬†√ò Crypto Union,¬†a fintech project leaving Ethereum.''

It's nice to see how the ecosystem develops :Komodo:


[21-Mar-19 10:32 AM] zaddex#2546
to answer few questions:
Here are some communication about where we are at.
The PLAN:
Zaddex will have its license in Estonia to operate its crypto to crypto and it crypto to fiat
we will list valuable and meaningful crypto projects with a priority to the komodo ecosystem asset chains
the fiat gateway will include mostly e wallet, instant disbursement (canada/us/australia); classic international wire and domestic wire (ach and sepa)
Zaddex will start support in beta SME launch via Launchpad in West AFrica - official release count down by official <10days
About ZEX we are considering and finalizing the details of an hard fork
As of today here will be the parameters
Supply reduce from 210mio to 100mio
Wallet will have to be updated
Hard fork will likely happen in April
Time to release properly
PoS/PoW: 92.23% - 7.77%
Rewards: 7.77% per year (dicreasing year 2 mechanically)
and 20mio dedicated to business dev , legal and marketing
Burn of coins corresponding to 7.77% per month of profit
The 60mio supply (100-mined supply)
Will be use for dev (33%) and business dev and legal (66.66%)
As of today we would like to also support margin trading of KMD but not sure need to make sure that it regulatory possible to do so
Pending final signature OCU (OUR) is the parent company of Zaddex (50% equity)
And will handle the ZEX assets
We have been consider transactional mining to promote the listed assets nothing fix as of today
Idea üí° and contributions will be more than welcome
Tip bots will be put in place for both OUR and ZEX in the coming days
Thanks for your attention
Cheers ü•Ç and please stay tuned

@zaddex , when you say supply will reduce from 210M to 100M, does that mean existing ZEX balances are basically halved after a swap, or do you mean future emission schedule is changed, but existing balances will stay the same?


[22-Mar-19 01:19 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@9oklp  can‚Äôt speak for them but I believe existing will remain the same and future emission schedule is changed, as everyone seems to be happy and welcoming the change, and they are pushing it out as good news


[22-Mar-19 01:19 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Can‚Äôt see them halving balances
