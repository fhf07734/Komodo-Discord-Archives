Hi. We are building community for #marmara Chain now where we will have chains of post-dated cheques pegged to any currency, which will allow people to create their own money based on credit/debt in their selected currency. Thanks very much to @jl777c as being advisor to us in Discord group. These cheques have more than 200 billion USD market value now in Turkey alone. It is great value when especially considering not only the neighbouring countries but also any other country where post-dated cheques are/may be used in a chain structure. We will decide which technologies to continue with soon within our community. I am personally trying to promote Komodo technologies within our community to base the project on CC by Komodo. And I personally like the #verus mining algorithm which allows people to mine with CPUs. I believe this will help creating a huge community with the mineable coin on Marmara chain. We are currently working on defining the procedures for having a complete decentralization of whole processes which are currently held by banking and insurance institutions according to central laws. I invite all interested community members of Komodo into the Discord group to realize this project together.

Actually the total amount is much higher than 200 billion USD. This is because each cheque is used many times until the date written on cheque. Therefore, it may be better to call them "chain of post-dated cheques" rather than calling simple post-dated cheques. It is also widely used in the neighbouring countries.


[01-Oct-18 02:35 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626

Can you use those post-dated cheques in a chain? Suppose I bought something from you and I paid as a post-dated cheque say with date 01.01.2019. Then you use this cheque to pay for something say bu giving to @benohanlon. Then he gives to @KomodoWorld. So it goes on until 01.01.2019 with many signatures on cheque.

This is how it goes in Turkey and in most of neighboring countries. There are detailed laws regarding the process. Every cheque writer will actually start his/her chain on Marmara chain.

But up to banks to honor the chain.  Only required to honor who it's made out to here( in USA)

@polycryptoblog this is money creation based on credit/debt without interest/usury in a decentralized way when originally invented. But they end up with banks now. The only thing to do is to remove banks and other central decision making in the process. Banks involve during delivery of cheque books and when paying on due date. It is perhaps the most common instrument in Turkey and neighbouring countries. It enables ordinary people creating their own money based on credit/debt. It works same as banking with the exception of many circulation and no interest/usury fixed to it. When you get a loan from bank, it creates money out of thin air. And that money is destroyed when it is paid back. But since nobody creates the interest the borrower becomes slave to bank with compound interest rate. The bank created money only circulates between bank and borrower. Actually government bonds are same. They borrow money from banks and make us pay (modern slavery).


[02-Oct-18 01:32 AM] jl777c#5810
very excited about the MARMARA project. It could well be the largest economic value that is transferred to the blockchain and it happens to require CC to be properly implemented. Also assets CC does the vast majority of the post dated check linked list handling simply via tokencreate and tokentransfer. It is possible to make it so is a tree instead of a linked list, so the entire balance wont need to be signed to the next person. basically utxos and this is already built in. so it would be an improvement over the paper version as there is no practical way to do partials on paper checks

where someone reputation is worth more than whatever amount gained by cheating

I guess the first issuer would have some legal liability associated too.     Still scary though,  a criminal who already doesn't care about reputation could cause doubt in the system.  No honor among thieves as they say.  I still like the idea though,  will keep an eye on what's going on with this.

It is a kind of chain/link of trust where people transfer trust to the next in the link. If you are not the last one in the link you are safe. Btw, the default rate is much lower than bank credit. If you think of laws enforcement and collaterals requirement by banks in case of bank loans, this is surprising. Isn't it?


[02-Oct-18 12:34 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I think it works like this: it always happens between two persons who know each other. There is always trust. It is not completely anonymous. It happens during business where buyer and receiver knows each other very well. Suppose @jl777c writes a cheque for me to pay on say 1.1.2019. I know that @jl777c will keep money on his account on specified date not to put me into the trouble. @jl777c also knows that I may be the last person in the link and if no money exists in the account I will be in trouble. Of course, he will not feel well, either if I am the last one in the link. He will always assume that I may be the last one. Therefore,  @jl777c will not probably do something to harm me. Now suppose I have the cheque. I will be able to give this only to one who will have trust on me. He knows me not @jl777c. So trust has been transferred to me. We should remember that these cheques are used in real economy to buy and sell things among always two persons. They do not simply go from one location to another. Even if it goes, it always happens between two persons who trust each other. I think this is one of the main reasons why they work well.

Post-dated cheques in Turkey actually works much better than Banking in Turkey with 2.5% defaulting. Defaulting in bank credits is estimated to be as much as 10%. And post-dated cheques are very transparent not like the default in bank credits.

We have conducted our Workshop and analyzed the problem from Law, Business, Technology and Road Map points of view. We discussed important design criteria  that we decided based on invaluable discussions with @jl777c. I am very happy to announce that we have a consensus in our community to go with Komodo technologies. This decision is very important since we can find Ethereum developers more easily in Turkey. But we believe that the highly challenging problem of individual money creation by people based on credit/debt in completely decentralized manner could only be solved with Komodo technologies in the easiest way. We are planning to write a paper why we have chosen Komodo. The problem is not only having a blockchain version of analog trust chain of post-dated cheques and promissory notes any more. It is very clear to us that we can easily offer together to World a decentralized self-assured way of creating fiat money based on credit/debt in a trustful network. We have already a use-case with 200 billion usd market only with post-dated cheques. We want to expand it to general money creation based on debt as a complete alternative to banking system which creates fiat money based on credit/debt. Our difference is that we will have no slavery with the interest applied in banking credits as well as circulation of credits among many people while bank credit happens only between bank and borrower. We invited officially @jl777c to be advisor to project and we are honoured that he kindly accepted invitation. We invite all good developers and frontiers of Komodo community to our founding team to make this possible.
Regards

We are happy to announce that after Komodo leader, @jl777c  as our main advisor now @dukeleto   is in our founding team, too. He is usually the person who adds KMD DPoW to external coins for instance, like $EMC2 and $HUSH. We invite all Komodo pioneers and community  for this challenging project.

Actually Marmara Chain system may be used in any business. For example, We have cafes/canteens in university. Many of academics do not carry cash. We just say "please write it". Then when we have cash with us we just go and pay then the records are deleted. It was practiced in all small shops until recently. We called them "veresiye notebooks". It is a kind of small credit creation. As @jl777c rightly addressed with very simple GUI tools for mass adoption, we could use culture here very well and I am sure it is very similar in cultures such as India, Pakistan, Gulf and Balkans. Trust is essential within the culture of those areas.

Thank you for the updates @B. Gültekin Çetiner - i'm looking forward to seeing how it works in relation to a small agricultural community i'm chatting with.  I'm quite interested in seeing farmed commodities supplied to the local "high st" and the blended economics and privacy required for making such type of transitional project and have a feeling a lot can be learned from the marmara project, thank you for the opportunity 😃


[06-Nov-18 04:31 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
You are welcome! Thanks very much for your kindness. @Mylo For smaller communities, I am sure it will work much better. Marmara is actually based on trust between people. Therefore, we have virtually no need for privacy. Actually even privacy is a problem since nobody would accept a post-dated cheque if the original issuer is unknown. I checked the defaulting rates in Turkey. It is worse in greater cities but in small cities the defaulting rate is almost negligible. Since it is based on credibility/trust, and the reputation/credibility is all lost on default the people in small communities tend to pay it without delays/problems.

We are happy to announce that Mrs. @ryilmaz  is now in founding team. Mrs. E. R. Yilmaz has studied Computer Science in Malaysia and later graduated from International University of Sarajevo in Electronics and Computer Engineering. She has got her MSc degree from Istanbul Technical University on Nanoelectronics. She is currently working at Turkish Aerospace Industry as Design Engineer in Research and Development Department. We are now testing with her the Komodo's new parameters coming with new fork. A warm welcome her on behalf of team. I believe she will be one of the blockchain frontiers among women and definitely in Turkey. This is also good for Komodo technologies.


[01-Dec-18 02:38 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We were discussing with our main advisor @jl777c  and other founding members about the mining of Marmara coin. It will use some Verus features in new Komodo fork. It will be a Verushash mineable coin with 50 % staking and 50 % of all blocks is planned to be timelocked between 3 months and 2 years. If decided, this 50%- timelock feature will be permanent policy. What would  a mining operator say about this? How would mining community and other users react to this? We are trying to find an optimum and just solution. Opinions?


[01-Dec-18 03:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
How does mining tie into post dating cheques?


[01-Dec-18 10:48 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@polycryptoblog It is not limited to only post-dated cheques any more. It is any credit creation. 50% of blocks will be timelocked always and 50% staking. Suppose I sell furniture worth 10k lira and you have no money except MARMARA immature coins. You write a post-dated cheque or create a credit with a future date on say 1 july 2019 worth of And you have immature coins spendable only after 1 july 2019 worth of 10k liras in MARMARA. There will be names on the system but even if I don't know you, I will sell this refrigerator to you without hesitation because of your immature coins after post-date.


[02-Dec-18 12:42 AM] jorian#4555
so the timelocking of funds relates to the credit creation part of MARMARA? timelocked block reward == post-dated cheque?


[02-Dec-18 02:02 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Yes. Timelocking is to help during redemption process against defaulting. Of course, there are also other factors. This is "a decentralized self-assured credit creation system" without any bank involvement.


[02-Dec-18 03:52 AM] GlorymanRTS#0512
@B. Gültekin Çetiner How would people be sure that 10k lira of marmara coin will be worth 10k lira on the 1st july 2019?


[02-Dec-18 03:53 AM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Maybe it would be better taking the risk of the default than the coin value changing.


[02-Dec-18 06:08 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
It is a trust based linking system shifting the trust from the first issuer to endorser. Then circulates between pairs of two sides who always trust the previous ones. Names of credit issuers are known to each other. It happens in business. They stamp on papers and put slgnatures.


[02-Dec-18 06:16 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
There are more. If there is not enough fund, the second node in the link is responsible. All nodes from top to bottom are responsible. They are visited and their funds are used to redeem. There is also 5% blockage for issuing a credit. And finally the 10% fund is used to clear. If the link fails they are all blacklisted especially the first node.

That's nice of you to give me $2k USD worth of furniture on credit, but what will you have in place to stop me from putting my mature MARMARA coins in a z_addy on 1 july 2019 and you never see the coins or your furniture again?


[03-Dec-18 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the immature coins would need to be locked in a CC contract that prevents transfer if there are any checks outstanding


[03-Dec-18 04:01 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@jl777c That's what I was thinking, but was curious if he has, or will have, something in place where dear old gramma can figure out how to do that


[03-Dec-18 04:01 AM] jl777c#5810
if grandma can figure out how to send funds to an address generated by the GUI, that is all that would be needed to invoke the CC contract

[14-Dec-18 10:16 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I thank very much @jl777c on behalf of Marmara community for opening the important issue for delivering timelocked coins to miners. As you know, we will have a policy of timelocking the coins indefinitely in Marmara. Since timelocked coins are a must to solve the non-redemption problem in credit creation, we will always have coins with timelocks in coinbase ranging from 3 months to 2 years. This makes mining in pools a great problem. So the coinbase CC will solve this problem. It will be really a great innovation in Blockchain. By this way, we will be able to decentralize the credit creation of post-dated cheques and promissory notes in Turkey with at least 200 billion USD market size.

Initially this CC is specifically for MARMARA project for handling timelocked coinbase funds, which makes running a pool impractical. However, it could well be that we will extend it in the future ...

Deutsche Bank declares blockchain currencies as a failure and tries to blur the potential of blockchains. But there is one simple fact they are hiding successfully: It is creation of money by banks as credit. Majority of money is created as credit by banks out of thin air. And this may be decentralized completely and could happen in real economy as in Post-dated cheques and promissory notes example in Turkey. Credit creation by masses in a decentralized way without banks will be a real challenging thing to their surprise.

@B. Gültekin Çetiner 
Please take a look at this article: https://hackernoon.com/why-everyone-missed-the-most-mind-blowing-feature-of-cryptocurrency-860c3f25f1fb

He says: "The true power of cryptocurrencies is the power to print and distribute money without a central power." and "You see, Satoshi understood the first part of the maxim, the power to print money. What he missed was the power to distribute that money." 

I think peer to peer credit creation and settlement might be the solution to the "decentralization of creation of money" problem. In the article, he goes on to talk about ways to do it, but its all very abstract and futuristic for now.

It might be a good idea to engage him about your ideas regarding peer-peer credit creation. He has some very good ideas and has a large following. https://twitter.com/dan_jeffries1
He has a podcast episode on the same topic: http://dailyposthuman.com/why-everyone-missed-the-most-mind-blowing-feature-of-cryptocurrency-2/

@gcharang Thanks very much. I read the article. There is a common misunderstanding about the reality of money creation by banks. Many people are confused by the theory of Fractional Reserve banking (FRB)  system. I was also confused until I read the "lost century in Economics" by Professor Richard Werner. The main cause for misunderstanding is the publications made by Fed. The major one is "modern money mechanics". In reality, it is much easier to understand. FRB is fictitious and problematic to explain banks as intermediary institutions. In reality, banks just create credits when giving loans without need of any relending. And majority of money in circulation (97%)  is created as credit. In my opinion, banking could not be replaced by Blockchain unless credit function is solved in better way than banking system.

Also we can have premining for developers, visual developers, content creators etc. They will be also delivered as gift. I think no harm in doing that. There are a lot of things to do. And the only thing we can offer is the MARMARA premined. All will be delivered as gift. 


Son haber! Sevgili Arkadaşlar bildiğiniz gibi sistemi yayabilecek potansiyelde öğrenciler veya kişiler için premining yapacağız. Hepsi Armağan şeklinde dağıtılacak. Ayrıca geliştiriciler, görsel tasarımcılar, içerik geliştiriciler başta olmak üzere taşın altına elini koyanlar için de ilave premining yapmanın sakıncası yok. Yapılacak iş çok!

To Komodo community! In MARMARA CHAIN, We are testing the settlements in Marmara credit loops to see if redemption is made according to top-to-bottom approach or not. If pubkey-1 has not enough with Marmara, it should be redeemed from pubkey-2 and so on to the last holder in the credit loop. We need to test with 3 or more nodes in credit loops. Reward is 100 MARMARA for each settlement. Please make a report for each test. @everyone

Electronic cheques are to be initiated in Turkey. They are proposing through banks. They will most probably introduce insurance which means additional cost for users. I believe this decision will ease the things for MARMARA.

I went through the marmara rpc and docs.
I think the current implementation is almost clear to me.
There are some questions.
In our implementation issuers in a loop lock their money for future settlement.
But as I can see it, vadeli cheques allow to create payment means while issuer does not have money yet. He wants to create a debt and pay it when he earns some money.
But do we require he should have the money? And if holder receives the money in settlement when it matures how could he use it before?

@dimxy In Version 2.0, no need to have activated or boosted coins during issuance. It is money creation. But in Version 1.0, the issuer should have 100 % of coins locked. When the marmarabatonapproval is done, the activated/locked coins are transferred to boosted.


[25-May-19 12:01 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
In version 2.0, we will create credit as fiat currencies. It will be vadeli cheque (post-dated cheque) information on chain.


[25-May-19 12:11 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
In Version 1.0, we do not create money and no there is no fiat. Why would anyone give credit then if he/she cannot create credit? Well! We rely on the ability to generate MUCH MORE coins with boosted staking when locked in credit loops.


[25-May-19 12:13 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
25% of coins are produced with mining. The remaining is through activated and boosted.


[25-May-19 12:16 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
There are three types of coins as normal, activated and boosted ones. Boosted has three times more chance to find blocks during staking than activated coins*. Btw, staking needs activated or boosted, i.e. locked coins. 
* "three times more chance" is to be confirmed by @jl777c

@B. Gültekin Çetiner hello,
I have several more questions:

Is \'settlement\' actually a cheque redemption, that is, when cheque holder enters a bank and requests cash in exchange of the cheque?

Do I understand it right that the main purpose of the currently implemented v1.0 (aka Millenium ed) is to check how the settlement of locked coins would work and how their owner would receive some benefits from their coins being locked?
But the functionality of credit issuance itself was just very much simplified (as it does not actually send any coins to holder when credit is issued)?
So it is not the real business case but rather technology studying?

From this article https://medium.com/@cemilturun/we-had-paper-blockchains-for-decades-13ac29c4efd0
I understand that only the first cheque issuer is the payer for it. The rest cirantas just bypass it to the next holder and they do not pay anything when the cheque payment day comes. 
In our implementation all endorsers might pay when settlement is going on. I was also told actually each endorser would garantee exactly 1/N fraction from the total credit value.
So is it some new advancement for the real vadeli cheques?
(Or, maybe real vadeli endorsers also would have to pay if any previous issuer defaulted?)

Why is it needed to have endorsers at all when vadeli cheques are passed to a next holder? Why not just pass it as a usual banknote and simply allow to bearer just go to a bank and convert it to cash after the cheque has matured? (maybe, endorsers should pay if the issuer defaults)

[26-May-19 11:30 PM] dimxy#2587
The main idea is that an issuer could create a vadelie cheque not having money yet (in the hopes he will get the money later). So it seems, no need for him to lock his money.
(Also we spoke in the chat that issuers would not need to lock their money in the version 2.)
So, how is it supposed to use this locking feature in v2, who will use it? (maybe it is other roles who will be backing credits)

I have read some about lending loops in Canada where people make small deposits and this funding is used for short time loans for small businesses. We are not implementing this model (as it does not create money), yes?

(Sorry, if I missed anything in the docs)


[26-May-19 11:38 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a full spec for v2, probably that will help. with v1, it had 0% default rate and nothing very complex so it was decided to start with that to get things going


[26-May-19 11:46 PM] dimxy#2587
Oh, yes, B. Gültekin Çetiner gave it to me, studying it.
(I'm a bit confused with v1.0 as it seems the model implemented in it does not match to the concept in that medium article)


[26-May-19 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
correct, it is a millenium modification


[26-May-19 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea is that you only need 1/N capital tied up for a creditloop, where N is the number of participants. by incentivising participating in a creditloop, it shouldnt be hard to increase N.


[26-May-19 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
so you do have to start with 50% (issuer and first), it is expected that soon there will be second, third, ... thus reducing the amount that is locked


[26-May-19 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
this is indeed different, but the advantage is 0% default as all creditloops are 100% secured with locked coins


[26-May-19 11:50 PM] jl777c#5810
granted it doesnt perform the money creation that an unsecured creditloop will, but I think once we make a 100% secured creditloop system working, going to a fractional reserve system should be a matter of changing an internal parameter


[26-May-19 11:51 PM] jl777c#5810
at that point it will be money creation as described, though it opens up the possibility of default and triggers the need for multiple layers of insurance, arbitration, etc.


[27-May-19 12:02 AM] dimxy#2587
thank you for the explanation.
Is it correct to say that in v1.0 an issuer actually issues credit to himself and provides a collateral for it with time-locked funds?


[27-May-19 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty close. but there is always the first reciepient to create the creditloop, so it is being issued to another pubkey


[27-May-19 12:29 AM] dimxy#2587
remembering of vadeli concept I would say the receipient just receives IOU of the issuer


[27-May-19 12:32 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, yes you are correct, the issuer is 100% backed at this point


[27-May-19 12:41 AM] dimxy#2587
So I would say an issuer creates a credit to himself, backs it 100% with time locked coins and uses this credit as legal tender to pay for goods provided by a recipient. The recipient, in turn, receives a sort of IOU in exchange for his goods and settles it when it matures.


[27-May-19 12:51 AM] jl777c#5810
with v1 idea is to extend the credit loop

[27-May-19 01:29 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
1. Yes. Settlement is actually cheque redemption at the date which is decided during issuance.
2. It is a real business even in Millennium edition (Version 1). Suppose I issue a credit of 600 MCL. When the first endorser (which is also holder) gets the baton, I buy goods and services for the amount of 600 MCL. But it does not leave my Wallet until redemption date. Furthermore, it is boosted so I get full power of staking. It is fully collateralized. At any stage, the zero defaulting occurs. However, as you discovered, the Version 1 is more miner friendly.
3. Yes, The millennium edition is simplified. The article explains the paper based analog chain Version of existing cultural system but Version 2 is a complete solution to nonredemption problem and other problems in paper version. 
4. In all versions, it works best with transfer of goods and services. But I admit that the Version 1.0 is more miner friendly since anyone can create to accounts and issue credit to himself/herself to use boosted staking. However, we want to spread Version 1 among community for exchange of real goods and services.


[27-May-19 02:11 AM] dimxy#2587
Great! Thank you.
Now it is much more clearer to me


[27-May-19 02:15 AM] dimxy#2587
So the first task is to correct the settlement to provide equal distribution of debt payment between the issuers?


[27-May-19 02:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, and also managing the changing lock amounts as creditloop is getting bigger


[27-May-19 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure the most efficient way. moving all funds into and out of credit loop locked addresses might be too much overhead


[27-May-19 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
alternative is to track who owes how much, but it becomes hard to enforce the locked nature


[27-May-19 02:17 AM] jl777c#5810
and there are two levels of locked funds, one is the normal locked where it can only be used for staking or creditloops


[27-May-19 02:17 AM] jl777c#5810
then when it is in a creditloop, its staking power increases 3x


[27-May-19 02:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the was to implement that is to change just one function deep in the staking code, that is solved how to do, so just ask when you are doing that part

{Reactions}
👌 

[27-May-19 02:18 AM] jl777c#5810
also current code has some definite bugs with settlement as that was coded before there was any clear idea of how exactly to make settlements


[27-May-19 02:35 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes, it is what I actually was going to ask: now as I can see the marmara cc does not check if sufficient funds are locked by the issuer.
And probably it should not because it would be like the first issuer would already have the full amount backed.
From the other hand if we do not check this we could not say the credit is 100% backed.


[27-May-19 02:37 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, these are the issues that need to be solved


[27-May-19 02:37 AM] jl777c#5810
with efficient methods


[27-May-19 03:11 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We will have the third layer, i.e. the blockchain fund in Version 1.0, too. It might be used to clear the dusts with transfer fees. We should not stop transfers for small fees in credit loop operations.


[27-May-19 03:16 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@dimxy You are right. Currently it does not check if sufficient funds are locked by issuer. This is because We did not have in mind millennium features where we have collateralization. This feature might be useful in Version 2 as well since We have new improvements with community layer.

[27-May-19 03:57 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The formula for risk share is same for all steps. It is Credit/(N-1). If there are 2 nodes in credit loop, the first is issuer and the second is holder. The issuer's 600 is locked in boosted. If there are 3 nodes, then 1st is issuer, the 2nd is endorser and 3rd is holder. So the credit risk is divided b/w issuer and endorser as 300. The issuer gets 300 back as normal coin while ensorser's 300 is locked first and then boosted when batonapproval happens. At each step, there is 100% collateralization.


[27-May-19 03:58 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
All previous nodes are responsible against the holder at the end date of credit loop.


[27-May-19 04:02 AM] dimxy#2587
Aha, seems this is not implemented yet when issuer should get back 300.


[27-May-19 04:09 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Yes. When the second node transfers the baton to the third one, the issuer gets back 300 as normal.


[27-May-19 04:11 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
So no staking ability for 300. That power passes to second one and the 3rd node becomes new holder. Holder is always last node.


[27-May-19 04:14 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
For real economic case, you would not give credit to anyone unless you received goods or services since you transfer your coin to the next node at the end.


[27-May-19 04:19 AM] jl777c#5810
correct, none of this millenium mode was implemented as the current version was created first, then after testing it the millenium mode was proposed


[27-May-19 04:31 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Actually, the Millennium mode was proposed after Version 2 requirements were developed. It was very quick decision. 🙂

Okay then let's implement this fund redistribution (I mean pk1: +600, pk2: +300, 300 back, pk3: +200, 300+100 back etc)
and validation that issuer / endorsers have sufficient locked amounts.


[27-May-19 04:34 AM] dimxy#2587
(what if endorser participates in several loops - we need to check total?)


[27-May-19 04:36 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We have 3 types of coins. Normal, activated and boosted.


[27-May-19 04:37 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
In table, there are 3 steps. Marmarareceive, marmaraissue and marmarabatonapproval.


[27-May-19 04:39 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Suppose Marmarareceive is made by the endorser in second credit loop. We just need to check the activated to see there is enough. Then when baton is transferred with marmarabatonapproval, we can transfer it to boosted.


[27-May-19 04:39 AM] jl777c#5810
always the totals must be checked


[27-May-19 04:40 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I think no need to check the boosted. If there is enough in activated we just transfer that to boosted.


[27-May-19 04:40 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
When batonapproval is made


[27-May-19 04:41 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
But in the mean time, if one of credit loops is opened/settled/processed, there may not be enough activated.


[27-May-19 04:43 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
But this is perhaps rare. The blockchain fund in third layer may be utilized anyway.

[27-May-19 05:07 AM] dimxy#2587
From the point of view of a possible credit issuer:
Suppose I decided to participate in this, collected some free money and locked them. Now I probably want to do nothing and wait for staking premiums.
But in our schema as long as a new endorser enters the loop I just receive my money back and have to reinvest it again.
Maybe the system should not return the money to me but find a new request?


[27-May-19 07:24 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Then people may not find enough normal coin to transfer since activated/boosted ones cannot be transferred. The half of blocks comes out as activated/locked. Credit Loops will also require boosted coins. Since 75% of block rewards are generated through staking which requires locking, there will be scarcity with normal coins.


[27-May-19 08:56 AM] dimxy#2587
When someone receives the baton he becomes a holder.
Then when the holder passes the baton to the next one, he becomes an endorser and should lock some money to share the debt.
Could he instead just pass over the baton and remove the debt from himself (that is, could he just pay with this cheque to the third person for this person's goods)?


[27-May-19 09:33 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Do you mean he/she will only pay for half price of goods or services? Then the next endorser will pay for one third of goods and services. I could not get exactly.


[27-May-19 09:35 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The idea here is to get the ability of full power of staking when involved as another endorser.


[27-May-19 10:04 AM] dimxy#2587
From the table in the BR I understand the following:
In a loop there are an issuer and several endorsers and the last is the holder.
The issuer and endorsers share the debt and are responsible for paying it off. But the holder is not responsible for paying off.
So he holds the value. How could he use this value to pay for goods and services? 
I thought he could simply pass the baton to another person (who provides goods) and do not become an endorser


[27-May-19 10:15 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
It happens as exchange of credit with goods/services. When I issue a credit to first endorser, he/she transfers goods/services. The holder always provides goods/services but has no coin. Coins belong to earlier nodes. Therefore, all are responsible to pay debt to holder at the end. I transfer digital baton you transfer goods to me.


[27-May-19 10:58 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes I got it that holder receives baton for his goods.
When he received it he actually received a right to claim coins in future (seems I wrote inaccurately that he holds value).


[27-May-19 11:02 AM] dimxy#2587
so when he passes the baton further he always becomes an endorser and would pay the part of the debt to the next holder


[27-May-19 11:44 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Yes. And each endorser somehow gets goods/services but the holder has no goods/services at the end. Actually in the the first millenium addition, the fully-collateralized coins are used as normal money but they give them power of staking when boosted/locked in credit loops.


[27-May-19 11:44 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Yes. And each endorser as well as issuer somehow get goods/services but the holder gets no goods/services at the end. Actually in the the first millenium addition, the fully-collateralized coins are used as normal money but they give them power of staking when boosted/locked in credit loops.


[27-May-19 11:46 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
In Version 2, no money is needed until the end date of credit loop. So it has to be settled at the end with some mechanisms including community layer.


[27-May-19 11:47 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The Version 2 is based on completely money creation.


[27-May-19 11:48 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Of course, in Version 2, first the issuer is responsible. to pay debt to holder.


[27-May-19 11:50 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
If issuer's activated fund is not enough, then the nodes in credit loop is visited in a top-to-bottom approach to settle the whole debt.


[27-May-19 11:51 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
If still not settled, the funds in  community layer are used. Supporters in community layer are called avalists.

The third layer, the blockchain fund  is last resort of redemption.


[27-May-19 11:53 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
But in that case, where the third layer is used to settle, all nodes except the holder are blacklisted. Avalists who are supporting may also be blacklisted depending on their percentage for support.


[27-May-19 11:55 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
In summary, the Version 1 works on trustless nature of blockchain whereas the Version 2 is a trust based system.


[27-May-19 11:58 AM] dimxy#2587
yes I got this that in v1 participants have to fully back credit themselves mostly
and in v2 it will be special third parties who specialize on backing


[27-May-19 12:19 PM] dimxy#2587
Actually I'm a bit confused with the table in the BR, about how the value is transferred:
on steps 1,2,3  pk1  locks 600 coins and receives goods for 600 coins form pk2
on steps 4,5,6 pk2 locks 300 coins and pk1 receives normal 300 coins from his locked amount.
So now pk1 has 300 normal coins and 300 coins locked and he has goods for 600 coins 
At the end of the table pk1 has already 450 normal coins and he has only 150 coins locked and then settled to the debt (and he still has goods for 600 coins?).
So my impression is that pk1 received goods for 600 coins and payed only 150 coins.
Where am I wrong?


[27-May-19 05:04 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The earlier ones have more time to use the full staking power with more coins. The risk is reduced with each endorser added. If suppose there are 101 nodes in a credit loop, the node 100 pays only 1/100 of 600 to receive goods for 600 coins. But of course, he has very limited power for boosting since he locks very limited amount.


[27-May-19 05:06 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The node 100 just pays for 6 MCL to receive goods worthing 600 MCL. But he can only do full staking with 6 MCL.


[27-May-19 05:08 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
At 101, each except the holder will have 6 MCL boosted. And it is very easy to pay for the holder at the expiry/settlement date of credit loop.


[27-May-19 05:11 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
But as @jl777c said, the performance may be degraded in larger Credit Loops since 100 wallet needs to transfer 6 MCL to the holder during settlement.


[28-May-19 07:13 AM] dimxy#2587
Hello @B. Gültekin Çetiner ,
Thank you once more for the explanations.
I also found this your note in the dev-chat transcript:
```At the due-date, all other nodes are responsible to the holder/last node starting from the credit creator first until the node before holder. If credit creator/issuer pays for holder, the credit is destroyed. If not paid, the non-redemption process starts. Either automatic or manual. In automatic, it is easier. The 5% blockage by credit issuer (if there is one) is transferred to holder/last node, then all timelocked coins belonging to credit issuer is used to pay for holder. If there is sufficient amount that is ok. The case is settled. Otherwise, all nodes in credit loop are visited one by one in sequence, and their timelocked coins are used to pay for holder. ```
From this I assume we need 2 rpcs:
1) marmara_settlement which tries to settle the baton with only issuer's funds: blockage + all timelocking funds are used to pay for holder
2) marmara_nonredemption which is executed if the first rpc was unsuccessful or partially successful. It visits all nodes and writes off their timelocked funds in equal fractions to pay to holder the remainder


[28-May-19 08:40 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
That note is from the past discussions. The most mature document is Version 2. All needed functions are in that document.


[28-May-19 08:42 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
There is blockageamount parameter in Version 2. But we don’t need in Version 1.


[28-May-19 08:43 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We don’t need nonredemption function in Version 1, either.


[28-May-19 08:44 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Because we can do marmarasettlement at any time due to 100% collateralization.


[28-May-19 08:45 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Btw, marmarasettlement is an internal function now and that is called by miners.


[28-May-19 08:46 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The existing code of Marmara CC has marmarasettlement  as a function to be called externally


[28-May-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be simpler implementation wise to have autosettlement in 2 transactions


[28-May-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
or just 1 if the issuer has enough funds


[28-May-19 09:41 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
In Version 1, we have the credit divided by (N-1). Do you mean we can settle them in 2 transactions? Suppose we have  11 nodes and the credit is 600 MCL. Then each node before holder will have 60 MCL in boosted. Do we make all transfers from 10 accounts at 2 transactions?


[28-May-19 09:42 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Or do you mean the autosettlement in Version 2?


[28-May-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
even in version 1, unless there is a default, the issuer should make full payment, right?


[28-May-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
i think making that the first settlement tx and then another to deal with the case where the first one wasnt enough


[28-May-19 10:06 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
In millennium the risk/share is reduced with the new node. I think you meant the existing code. So it is not only the issuer. It is only valid when we have 2 nodes. But when we have new nodes, the amount is shared equally with the formula Credit/(N-1). So issuer has only his/her equal share. There is no defaulting in Version 1.


[28-May-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
then i misunderstood millenium version


[28-May-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
why would people in the credit loop want to pay 1/N?


[28-May-19 10:09 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
They will make boosted staking.


[28-May-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
but not enough to compensate for 1/N


[28-May-19 10:09 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
It is not only issuer who can make boosted staking


[28-May-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the issuer needs to pay, unless he is defaulting. then the 1/N from all are auto-collected


[28-May-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
for any large amount, there is no way extra staking will earn enough coins for largeamount/N


[28-May-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
so the 1/N amounts provide the 0% default rate, but it should only be used for whatever unpaid balance


[28-May-19 10:33 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
If we want to take from the others, too, they need to be able to do boosted staking.


[28-May-19 10:33 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
If we do it the way you say, it will be also usable in Version 2.


[28-May-19 10:34 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Since we will be trying to clear starting from top to bottom in Version 2.


[28-May-19 10:36 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Would it be problem if we take equally in Version 1? Is it problem with performance?


[28-May-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
we can do it, but it doesnt make any sense. why would anybody signup to pay for somebody elses debt?


[28-May-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
in 100% of the cases


[28-May-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont see many creditloops being made if that is the case, the first one to sign up takes the risk of 1/2 the total and for what? a bit of extra staking??


[28-May-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
wont work is the problem


[28-May-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to take from the issuer as much as he has in 1/n and normal locked funds


[28-May-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
then the rest equally from the rest of the credit loop


[28-May-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
now, it does matter to the creditloop participants the reliability of the issuer


[28-May-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
but still there is 0% default


[28-May-19 10:55 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Then we can take 100% from issuer and he/she has the power of boosting. No need then for credit/(N-1) from others


[28-May-19 10:56 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
No need to collect from others


[28-May-19 10:59 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
But wait. The same person may be using the crediting in Version 2 in future. Then when we have fiats the defaulting might happen when we have boosted coins used to support Version 2.


[28-May-19 11:01 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I think we can use credit/(N-1) but when we make redemption we can go from top to bottom to clear.


[28-May-19 11:05 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
For redemption, yours seems to be more reasonable. We try first the issuer to clear all. Then first endorser and others. But why do we need then credit/(N-1)? Also the requirement document needs to be changed ıf we make it that way. We also need to discuss in our community


[28-May-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
we need the 1/N-1 to guarantee 0% default rate


[28-May-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
usually it will be much less than 1/N-1 needed, only on total default. if the issuer had any funds at all (more than 1/N-1) the amount needed from the rest (equally) will be less than 1/N-1


[28-May-19 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
so just 2 steps, from issuer and if needed equally from the rest


[28-May-19 11:12 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
So we just need to change redemption scheme then. Why not we make the clearence from top to bottom? That will be compatible with Version 2.


[28-May-19 11:14 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We try to take from issuer first if not cleared we continue with all nodes in sequence until we redeem all?


[28-May-19 11:15 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The earlier ones will have more boosting power


[28-May-19 11:15 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The later ones will not have enough time to boost.


[28-May-19 11:16 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The same algorithm may be used in Version 2 then


[28-May-19 11:18 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
It will be the redemption scheme that we aggreed at the beginning. Responsibility decreases with the nodes increased


[28-May-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, that would work too


[28-May-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i like that it is the same as for v2


[28-May-19 11:34 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Perfect. The table is not changed but the redemption will be from top to bottom. @dimxy


[28-May-19 11:38 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@jl777c The thing is the later nodes will have boosted coins and they will not be released. If we leave the boosted coins untouched they might be used to support Version 2 trust based version. Or even in Version 1, that might promote the later nodes to issue credits in future.


[28-May-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, plz work out the details to make sure, but this seems like it will work well


[28-May-19 11:43 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I will modify the document for the redemption process. It will not be equal. Will be from top to bottom. Just few sentences.


[28-May-19 12:19 PM] dimxy#2587
looking forward for the updated document


[28-May-19 04:15 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@dimxy @jl777c I sent the modified document.


[29-May-19 03:12 AM] dimxy#2587
I can say that in the current implementation it does not differentiate if coins just locked or locked in credit loop. 
I'd say coins are simply locked on randomized height in 3 month...2 year interval. No correlation with issued amount.
And during the settlement it just draws coins from the lock 1of2 address.
So we need a special account for coins locked in a loop?

{Reactions}
👌 

[29-May-19 03:17 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, there is only 2 types of locked in v0, but we need three types


[29-May-19 03:18 AM] jl777c#5810
probably an address based on the creditloop txid

{Reactions}

[29-May-19 06:35 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
True. In new versions, there are no different timelock intervals which were 3 months to 2 years before. Starting from Version 1 to above, We will have all coins locked to maximum block height which is around 4000 years.

{Reactions}
👌 

[29-May-19 08:19 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Activated16 will be cancelled. It is not needed any more.


[29-May-19 08:20 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
It is due to 3 months to 2 years intervals.


[29-May-19 08:21 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Marmaralock function does not need blockheight, either. It will be locking all to maximum blockheight.

{Reactions}
👌 

[29-May-19 09:50 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Btw, Marmaralock will lock coins as activated ones and not as boosted.


[29-May-19 09:51 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Boosting will be automatic with marmarabatonapproval when baton is actually transferred.


[29-May-19 10:04 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, I'm just adding moving amount from locked to boosted in marmara_issue rpc


[29-May-19 11:05 AM] dimxy#2587
form the doc: `50% coins will be activated/timelocked to maximum blockheight.`
Who will do this, miners? or users first receive coins as normal then lock them to max height?


[29-May-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it is already implemented


[29-May-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
coinbase is locked half the time

{Reactions}
👍 (2) 

[29-May-19 11:16 AM] dimxy#2587
so it is not a personal but a single shared account?


[29-May-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a coinbase exception, applies to any address


[29-May-19 11:19 AM] dimxy#2587
ah yes, seems it sends coins to user cc address


[29-May-19 11:47 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Users can also lock coins as activated by using marmaralock but half of blocks comes as locked/activated.

{Reactions}
👌 

[29-May-19 04:41 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@jl777c  was coinbase exception in Marmara CC? We need to fix it to maximum blockheight instead of 3 months to 2 years intervals.


[30-May-19 12:24 AM] jl777c#5810
yes it is in v0


[30-May-19 12:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont remember the expiration height, wont be hard to change


[30-May-19 12:25 AM] jl777c#5810
also, even if you are able to unlock it, as long as you dont, it remains locked


[30-May-19 02:15 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We aggreed that the users will not be able unlock themselves. Locked/activated and boosted ones will be released to normal only by means of processes inside Marmara CC.


[30-May-19 02:18 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, in that case the actual unlock date doesnt matter so much, but it should be changed to the far future to be precise


[30-May-19 02:19 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Exactly. It might be even 777 years. 😉


[01-Jun-19 01:03 AM] dimxy#2587
What is the idea of activation (that is locking coins to the max height), isn't it simply like a bank deposit? So a user just sends his coins to 1of2 global,mypk address and would never spend them himself.
It seems we do not need to store any height in the opreturn any more. 
What do I need to change to make these new activated coins to be PoS? (Seems it is MarmaraPoScheck and it currently does not check height so maybe it should work with max height)

{Reactions}
👍 

[01-Jun-19 02:19 AM] jl777c#5810
correct about the height not needed


[01-Jun-19 02:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the PoS works with all utxos, there is special case handling for marmara to only use locked and inside there we can add a 3x multiplier for utxo locked and used in creditloop


[01-Jun-19 03:43 AM] dimxy#2587
so it needs to be done yet in komodo_stake?


[01-Jun-19 03:56 AM] jl777c#5810
everything is done other than the 3x multiplying


[01-Jun-19 04:28 AM] dimxy#2587
So we probably need to extend MarmaraPoScheck function to add support for lock-in-loop address (and it should return not just bool but different retcodes)


[01-Jun-19 04:30 AM] dimxy#2587
And as long as we make lock-in-loop address as Make1of2cond(marmarapk, createtxidpk) it becomes a shared account for all endorsers. But for staking we need to know how much each pk has in look-in-loop addresses, yes?


[01-Jun-19 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[01-Jun-19 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
actually the function is already there


[01-Jun-19 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
given a utxo, it just needs to return the multiplier


[01-Jun-19 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
let me find it


[01-Jun-19 04:39 AM] dimxy#2587
If all endorsers in a lock-in-loop account pay and spend always the equal part of the amount we might divide it by N. But the latest document states the lock-in-loop amount is spent in top to bottom order. So we probably would need to have a vector of each part stored


[01-Jun-19 04:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the staking would apply to the 1/N amount locked


[01-Jun-19 04:40 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo_txtime2 is the function you need to change


[01-Jun-19 04:40 AM] jl777c#5810
*valuep = tx.vout[n].nValue


[01-Jun-19 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
just multiply that by 3, if it turns out to be a utxo locked in a creditloop


[01-Jun-19 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
higher level code should only be staking locked utxo for marmara


[01-Jun-19 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
code is a bit confusing, sorry, it evolved


[01-Jun-19 04:52 AM] dimxy#2587
np


[01-Jun-19 03:15 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@dimxy Congratulations. You discovered the key point. It is exactly like locking deposit to bank from which you earn the power to create more credits. But of course, the key difference is there is no real bank. You are your own bank. You need to run a node in system to get power of staking. You are also right about blockheight for locking. There needs to be no lockheight since activated/boosted coins can only be opened/released based on certain conditions.

👍 

[01-Jun-19 03:42 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@jl777c I stated that during settlement process, first activated coins and then boosted coins should be utilized to pay for debt. I think, by this order, there may be more remaining coins in boosted accıunts and since we look at first amount of activated coins during issuance, there will be more chance to pay for debts especially when we use both Version 1 and Version 2 in the future used by the same person as mixed way when issuing. Do you have any comment or objection on this order?


[01-Jun-19 03:46 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
When activated or boosted staking occurs, the half blocks are produced as activated coins. Using activated coins first during settlement may release more coins to normal.


[01-Jun-19 03:48 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We can change that order if it seems better to release boosted coins first.


[01-Jun-19 03:51 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The idea of releasing boosted first might be more logical since boosted is meaningful if there is credit loop. During settlement we remove the credit loop so it might be also meaningful to start first with boosted.


[01-Jun-19 04:01 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
When issuing/endorsing credit, we will check if there is enough activated. If not enough, then we will ask the issuer/endorser to lock enough activated. All staked or mined coins will be locked to activated with 50% chance of course. Using activated first for settlement means using more funds from activated during settlement.


[01-Jun-19 04:09 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
When credit loops are issued by the same person in a combined way in future when Version 1 and Version 2 are both available, the trust based credits in Version 2 might use activated/boosted ones during settlement. Of course, using Version 2 will require that this account should not be anonymous any more and take name, Global Id etc.


[01-Jun-19 04:12 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
When both versions are used by the same person automated mode in Version 1 does not guarantee the 100 % collateralization. But as a start without Version 2 support, it will guarantee the credits.


[01-Jun-19 04:18 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
If activated are used first during settlement, the issuer/endorser needs to lock more coins to Activated funds since we check for enough activated funds during issuance/endorsement in Version 1.


[01-Jun-19 04:54 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
A parameter such as activatedfirst may be used but I do not know if it is really worth.


[01-Jun-19 04:55 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
It will add some more complexity.


[01-Jun-19 07:05 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
But of course, it has more flexibility and different communities may choose among two options.


[01-Jun-19 10:32 PM] jl777c#5810
i thought that after a creditloop is finished, all the boosted 1/N coins that are not used would revert to normal locked state

There will be remaining especially in later nodes since we clear from top-to-bottom. I think we should not touch them. Especially when thinking both modes in Version 1 and Version 2 working together in future. In trust based mode of Version 2, they will help us as special funds towards zero-nonredemption. Also latest endorsers with smaller collateralization will be accumulating in boosted which helps decentralization.


[02-Jun-19 01:36 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Yours is also another alternative for automated mode in Version 1.


[02-Jun-19 01:39 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
After the credit loop is settled, we can revert all 1/N boosted to activated. That will promote people to issue credits with more credit loops. I think that is better alternative.


[02-Jun-19 01:46 AM] jl777c#5810
makes sense


[02-Jun-19 01:51 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Dear @dimxy shall I add @jl777c 's comment to requirements document? During settlement of credit loops, when the debt is cleared first with activated and then boosted from top accounts, all the boosted 1/N coins that are not used would revert to normal locked state, i.e. activated state.


[02-Jun-19 01:53 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@jl777c would it cause performance problem?


[02-Jun-19 01:53 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
In longer credit loops?


[02-Jun-19 01:54 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We need to touch all remaining nodes in credit loop.


[02-Jun-19 02:04 AM] jl777c#5810
it depends on how it is implemented


[02-Jun-19 02:12 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
It is code optimization issue then.


[02-Jun-19 02:18 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, on how the 3x locking is implemented, maybe it can be done without moving funds, not sure


[02-Jun-19 02:31 AM] dimxy#2587
I totally support returning locked-in-loop funds to activated state as if we do not do this after the settlement  the locked -in-loop funds would become useless.
Please note how lock-in-loop fund is implemented - it is a 1of2 address in which 1st is marmara global pk and the 2nd is artificial unspendable createtxid pk. A createtxid is like an identifier which effectively binds funds to a specific credit loop.
And another moment with it is that locked-in-loop fund is a common shared account to all endorsers in the loop

👍 

[02-Jun-19 03:40 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@dimxy you are definitely right. They will be useless if they remain locked in boosted.  When we turn them into activated state, they will be used to create new credit Loops.


[02-Jun-19 03:46 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I could not get last part. If boosted in credit loop is common shared account then the later nodes will have same chance to earn. How do we separate/distribute resulting earned blocks obtained via 3x boosted staking to each endorser? And of course issuer?


[02-Jun-19 04:26 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I thought the boosted/locked in credit loop belongs to the account holder same as the activated.


[02-Jun-19 04:26 AM] jl777c#5810
once it is locked into a credit loop, it belongs to the creditloop


[02-Jun-19 04:42 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
So how do we get 3x boosted earnings for each account?


[02-Jun-19 04:44 AM] jl777c#5810
staking is a special exemption and allowed


[02-Jun-19 04:46 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Does 3x boosted staking seek the contribution of each account in credit loop?


[02-Jun-19 04:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be separated by individual (i think that is easiest)


[02-Jun-19 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
we need dimxy to answer implementation questions


[02-Jun-19 04:51 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I think testing will be difficult for boosted earnings of each account in a loop.


[02-Jun-19 04:53 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
How do we test each account has 3x boosted earning relative to their contribution in common boosted account in loop?


[02-Jun-19 05:29 AM] jl777c#5810
statistically


[02-Jun-19 11:31 AM] dimxy#2587
Actually I have a concern how to manage lock-in-loop fund.
The updated document says that in settlement the system writes off the cheque amount from issuer and endorsers' both activated and lock-in-loop addresses, from top to bottom.
I think it is of course fair that issuer is responsible with all his funds: as he issued the credit and received goods for it then he should pay for it.
But is this fair for an endorser to pay with all his money if the issuer defaults? 
An endorser just gave goods and received goods, he actually gained none in total. Why should he be responsible with his both activated and locked coins?
Isn't it fair if all the endorsers in a loop should be equaly responsible with their locked-in-loop coins if the issuer defaults? 
That is, we could treat lock-in-loop coins as insurance fund which is spent only if the issuer defaults. 
So if he defaults, all endorsers would pay in equal proportion (and it would be easy to manage lock-in-loop fund).


[02-Jun-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, take as much as possible from issuer


[02-Jun-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
the remaining is split among all the endorsers, i think that is the idea of 1/N


[02-Jun-19 05:45 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
They are all collectively responsible to pay for the debt of holder who has given given goods but received nothing. The trust based version works from top-to-bottom. The trust and responsibility decrease with each new endorser. The most responsible one is issuer and the least is holder (actually no responsibility at all). Actually all are responsible against the holder. In Version 1, the earlier nodes will earn much more with boosted staking than the later nodes. Think of the endorser just before the holder in a loop with 100 nodes. The node 99, the last endorser is last contributor joining and earned not much but pays equally with the first endorser who had gained a lot until the last contributor.


[02-Jun-19 05:48 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I think decreasing responsibility is more clear in Version 1.


[02-Jun-19 05:49 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The earlier endorsers earn more with boosted.


[02-Jun-19 05:50 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We also decided in our community to clear from top-to-bottom.


[02-Jun-19 05:53 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We need to discuss again within the community if we will change it.


[02-Jun-19 05:55 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The issuer gives the credit but with 100% collateralization at the first place.


[02-Jun-19 05:56 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Oc course, it is for Version 1.


[02-Jun-19 05:57 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
In Version 2, the most trustful (and responsible) person should be the issuer since anyone in credit loop checks the credibility of the issuer before accepting a credit.


[02-Jun-19 06:00 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
In law/culture, it says they are all responsible against the holder collectively but in  a chain manner.


[02-Jun-19 06:07 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The word used is muteselsilen which is used to show a hierarchy similar to family. First responsible person is grandfather, then father and  at the latest, the son comes.


[02-Jun-19 06:08 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The law is shaped according to culture.


[02-Jun-19 06:47 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
``` An endorser just gave goods and received goods, he actually gained none in total. Why should he be responsible ```

Do not endorsers earn with boosted? The earlier endorsers will earn more. It may not be clear in document. But this is what we intended. All participants except the holder will benefit with 3x boosted staking. Of course, earlier ones will earn more.


[02-Jun-19 08:23 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
But I admit that I liked the idea of a common shared fund. We may utilize that in trust based version 2 as well with avalists' layer. We can keep avalists' collaterals in that common fund. Therefore, even in Version 2, we can use collateralization feature. They can make 3x boosted staking in common fund in Version 2.


[02-Jun-19 08:24 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
There is avalist percentage in Version 2. If we can utilize avalist percentages for boosted staking that would be great.


[02-Jun-19 08:26 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I need to understand how you will be implementing that common fund.


[02-Jun-19 08:27 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Especially how 3x boosting is managed for every endorser.


[03-Jun-19 02:06 AM] dimxy#2587
```Do not endorsers earn with boosted? The earlier endorsers will earn more. It may not be clear in document```  This is perfectly clear. But these earnings are more like a bonus for being a guarantor of the debt and freezing money, aren't they? 
Maybe your top-to-bottom schema is perfect and conforms the country law.
I just wanted to remind other possible reasons for endorsers: 
They all have put in lock-in-loop account the part of the collateral. In total it covers the debt for 100%. 
So each of them has prepared to risk that locked amount if case of the issuer defaulting. If the issuer defaults, the risk happens and all of them pay the lock-in-loop amount.
And it seems not quite fair if the system writes off all the debt from the first endorser only, not only money that he has prepared to risk but also other his money.
(I'm not insisting on this, I'm only trying to work out reasons for the fair schema)


[03-Jun-19 03:23 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
If it is acceptable for Communities universally, it is better. It should be multilaw. I aggree that we should not depend on one country only. Did you think what happens during settlement when we integrate Version 2 later? The issuer will be able create any amount and there needs to be no collateral during issuance. If it is in common fund, will other endorsers be able to differentiate the individual sharing of each issuer/endorser in common fund when thinking an issuer can have different credit Loops simultaneously? Will The common fund work out when we have both Version 1 and 2 together in use?


[03-Jun-19 07:10 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes, this is a very good point that in v2 we will have different guarantors amounts for a lock-in-loop account.
We need a solution for this, either keep a log or a vector of all endorsers value or markers or something like this. Working on this...

{Reactions}
👍 

[03-Jun-19 07:20 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
There are also avalists. Issuer and endorser may add blockage amount and especially avalists in community layer may add collaterals with avalpercentages. The 3x boosted staking will help a lot against nonredemption in trust based version. Collective fund of collateralization with certain shares of each person will work well also in Version 2.


[03-Jun-19 08:40 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes I see that for v2 lock-in-loop funds needs to be managed more flexible.
And one more question:
Suppose we have an issuer and endorser who now owns the baton.
When this endorser passes the baton to a next holder we require that he could never refuse to lock his coins in credit loop, yes? 
(so if he does not have coins but he wants to sell goods for batons and buy goods for batons he could not do this without locking funds. And this is despite that the issuer already locked 100% collateral) 
And yet another: 
what about something like a change from a baton's amount (maybe it could be passed off-chain)?


[03-Jun-19 09:17 AM] dimxy#2587
(sorry if I'm asking what was already decided😀 )


[03-Jun-19 12:01 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Thanks for asking. It is not very clear in document. Let me clarify. The baton transfer process always starts with marmarareceive first. That is started always by endorsers. In the first case, the first endorser starts process by using marmarareceive. The issuer should lock into activated to make marmaraissue. The baton is only created after the marmaraissue is done. But the baton is not transferred yet to first endorser. When the first endorser makes marmarabatonapproval, the baton is actually transferred to the first endorser and the activated coins are transferred to boosted.


[03-Jun-19 12:01 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
But there is something herein.


[03-Jun-19 12:02 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
What happens if marmarabatonapproval is not invoked by the first endorser or later other endorsers?


[03-Jun-19 12:03 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Then the coins will stay locked in activated. The baton Remains in issuer but not transferred to the first endorser.


[03-Jun-19 12:04 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
And for later nodes, just replace the marmaraissue with marmaratransfer.


[03-Jun-19 12:07 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Please remember. These operations happen after they were sitting and drinking tea and finally making handshaking for the deal.


[03-Jun-19 12:08 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Unless baton is approved by endorser the baton is not transferred.


[03-Jun-19 12:09 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Btw, marmarabatonapproval is not available in current codes


[03-Jun-19 12:11 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We have added it with Version 2 requirements since avalist percentages and escrow details were necessary to be confirmed further with an addional step before transfer happens.


[03-Jun-19 12:17 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The coins remaining in activated is not a problem if baton is not transferred since the node can always use that later for issuing/endorsing new credits.


[03-Jun-19 12:30 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@dimxy In the original design of Version 1 , 100% collateralization is possible at any stage. You can use Credit/(N-1) share for each one to pay for the settlement at the end. No need to go from top to bottom in Version 1. I had told that top-to-bottom for Version 1 after @jl777c said it would be problem with performance when there are too many nodes in credit loop. But since there is a common fund now in each credit loop, I assume there will not be a performance issue. The only thing to take care is to make sure each contributor gets earning/bonus relative to his/her share from power of 3x boosted staking. Earnings should be arranged with each holder coming into the credit loop.


[03-Jun-19 01:35 PM] dimxy#2587
Thank you for the clarification, about marmarabatonapproval I also wanted to ask.
So in version 2 will we remove marmarareceive which now is called before marmaraissue 
and replace it with marmarabatonapproval which is called after marmaraissue?
Or am I mistaken?


[03-Jun-19 01:40 PM] dimxy#2587
And also in v2 before marmarabatonapproval there might be several more transactions with some data about avalists or escrow (that is with info about collateral)


[03-Jun-19 02:20 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
It will be same in both versions. It will be as follows for 3 nodes:-
Step 1: First endorser makes marmarareceive from issuer
Step 2: Issuer makes marmaraissue to first endorser (baton is created)
Step 3: first endorser makes marmarabatonapproval. Now baton is transferred to first endorser 
Step 4: holder makes marmarareceive from first endorser 
Step 5: first endorser makes marmaratransfer to holder
Step 6: holder makes marmarabatonapproval from first endorser. Now baton is transferred to holder.


Yes. In Version 2, there will be transactions before each marmarabatonapproval. At the initial step, the issuer might set escrow and also before every marmarabatonapproval between issuer/first endorser and endorser/holder there may be avalist transactions.


[03-Jun-19 03:06 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
There is chart for Version 2 in related requirements document. You can see that main differences are in escrow and avalist functions. There are also some additions for settlement and defaulting as well as Oracles functions.

[03-Jun-19 03:42 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The last one is always called holder. When he/she finds someone to transfer baton/credit, he/she becomes the last endorser just before the new holder.

{Reactions}

[04-Jun-19 12:27 AM] dimxy#2587
Some notes about this:
```Step 1: First endorser makes marmarareceive from issuer
Step 2: Issuer makes marmaraissue to first endorser (baton is created)```
Technically, at the Step 2 Issuer would create a transaction to self (as the baton not yet passed to the endorser)

```Step 3: first endorser makes marmarabatonapproval. Now baton is transferred to first endorser```
Baton belongs to that pubkey who owns the utxo with it
So at the beginning of this step 3 baton is still owned by the issuer.
And in order to transfer the baton to the endorser I believe we would need another rpc method which should be called by the issuer.
I'm afraid we could not transfer the baton with marmarabatonapproval as it is called by the first endorser who does not own the baton yet and therefore cannot transfer it to himself.


[04-Jun-19 12:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the way v0 did it is that the marmaraissue sends the baton to the first endorser, the marmarareceive creates the baton to the issuer, so the issuer is able to spend it to the first endorser. who after the marmaraissue has the baton. not sure why it needs to be approved after it was all started with a marmarareceive


[04-Jun-19 12:34 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe i remember some details wrong as it was a long time ago


[04-Jun-19 03:45 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I added marmarabatonapproval as additional step later. The idea is that when endorsers ask for baton with marmarareceive some parameters are not known yet. Those parameters are for functions related to escrow and avalist details. I thought If marmarabatonapproval is not added, the first endorser has to accept all parameters defined by issuer with marmaraissue. Similarly the other ensorsers and holder have to accept the baton with marmaratransfer. I tried to explain the reason for adding marmarabatonapproval in Version 2 document as well. I don't know if it is clear. I can explain in more detail if requested. If you suggest another alternative to make it technically easier, we can change. One alternative is to let enodersers/holder to define escrow and avalist parameters with marmarareceive and let the issuer/endorsers accept by means of marmaraissue and marmaratransfer. Then we need a complete rewrite for  requirements documents of both Version 1 and 2.


[04-Jun-19 03:48 AM] jl777c#5810
ah, ok, so it is for additional parameters and not the baton. in this case the first endorser would have the baton already and just send it to himself


[04-Jun-19 04:00 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I just want to understand when and how the baton is created initially and transferred in the later steps. It starts with marmarareceive first by the first endorser. Then the issuer makes marmaraissue and later the first endorser makes marmarabatonapproval. In later steps, the marmaraissue is replaced by marmaratransfer.


[04-Jun-19 04:22 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@jl777c If the baton is created with marmarareceive then it must be the first marmarareceive since other endorsers also use marmarareceive.


[04-Jun-19 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
each transaction can spend it and recreate the next baton


[04-Jun-19 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
input -> output


[04-Jun-19 04:42 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I think the additional marmarabatonapproval would not be a problem then. We can trace the credit loop.


[04-Jun-19 04:43 AM] dimxy#2587
Actually in the current implementation baton is created in the first marmaraissue

'R':  this is marmarareceive
 vins normal
 vout0 approval to senderpk (issuer or owner of baton)
 
 'I'    marmaraissue
 vin0 approval from 'R'
 vins1+ normal
 vout0 *baton* to 1st receiverpk
 vout1 marker to Marmara so all issuances can be tracked (spent when loop is closed)
 
 'T'  marmaratransfer
 vin0 approval from 'R'
 vin1 baton from 'I'/'T'
 vins2+ normal
 vout0 *baton* to next receiverpk (following the unspent baton back to original is the credit loop)


[04-Jun-19 04:45 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We can change the function name, the marmarabatonapproval  if it is misleading. It is just to make a further check by the endorser/holder to see if escrow and avalists are acceptable to him.


[04-Jun-19 04:47 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We can call it marmaracreditapproval if you want. @jl777c @dimxy


[04-Jun-19 04:47 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Or another name.


[04-Jun-19 04:49 AM] dimxy#2587
I can see an issue that if we do not send the baton to the next receiver in marmaraissue or marmaratransfer then we would need one more rpc to make baton transfer


[04-Jun-19 04:51 AM] dimxy#2587
because marmarabatonapproval is called by the receiver and he would not be able to transfer the baton from the current baton owner


[04-Jun-19 04:51 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Who will make it? The issuer?


[04-Jun-19 04:52 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, the one who owns the baton


[04-Jun-19 04:52 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
And of course, the endorsers/holder in later steps?


[04-Jun-19 04:52 AM] dimxy#2587
yes


[04-Jun-19 04:53 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
What about marmarabatontransfer?


[04-Jun-19 04:53 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
By issuer first and later by endorsers/holder.


[04-Jun-19 04:55 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
So after every marmarabatonapproval, there will be marmarabatontransfer by the prior node to the one who makes marmarareceive initially and marmarabatonapproval later.


[04-Jun-19 04:57 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
It will be like parameter approval between two nodes.


[04-Jun-19 04:58 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The parameters related to version 2.


[04-Jun-19 04:58 AM] dimxy#2587
yes it could be it, 
I just wanted to say marmarabatonapproval cannot transfer the baton as it is called by the receiver
So yet another call from the baton owner is required


[04-Jun-19 05:00 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Ok then. I can modify documents. But you can go ahead with marmarabatontransfer.


[04-Jun-19 05:01 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Actually marmarabatonapproval is needed in Version 2. That is for parameters required such as blockageamount, escrow and avalist functions.


[04-Jun-19 05:02 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
You can even check and ignore that function in version 1 if you want.


[04-Jun-19 05:03 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
In automated mode of Version 1, that is not needed.


[04-Jun-19 05:08 AM] dimxy#2587
I read again your workflow description above. Maybe I missed the idea.
Probably the idea was like this:
in marmaraissue an issuer creates baton and transfers it to a receiver. So it actually is transferred but is on hold in this step
But the receiver does not use the baton until he approves it with marmarabatonappoval. In this case he would just send it to self


[04-Jun-19 05:10 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Exactly.


[04-Jun-19 05:12 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
And marmarabatontransfer by issuer or endorser validates the marmarabatonapproval. This is for additional parameters in Version 2.

{Reactions}
👌 

[04-Jun-19 05:14 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
And if we use automated mode in Version 1, both the marmarabatonapproval and marmarabatontransfer may be omitted since we don’t need to use those additional parameters in Version 2.


[04-Jun-19 05:19 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Just to remind, to differentiate whether we are using Version 1 is autoinsurance is 1.

And autosettlement is always true in case of autoinsurance is on

If autoinsurance is 1 then both marmarabatonapproval and marmarabatontransfer are not needed.


[04-Jun-19 05:29 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
In document, there is place saying 
``` ... have 2 times more chance for staking than other activated coins. ```

It should be 3 times not 2 times for staking if coins are locked in credit loop. We changed it to 3x later.

Komodo is doing really good crisis management during these difficult days thanks to the proactive/creative decision by Komodo community with the leadership of @jl777c. Remember! After the big theft in Ethereum World, the Ethereum community was separated into two groups. And unfortunately, not only the thief but the pragmatism had won the game. The most essential law of blockchain World, i.e. the immutability was ignored. Ethereum was forked and the original Ethereum community who was saying “code is law” became Ethereum Classic but the pragmatist ones stayed with the name Ethereum to surprise of people. Of course, those days were very difficult not only for them but also for blockchain World. 

I think the attack against the Komodo was more serious, involving many of accounts. But the decision of hacking the accounts into safe wallets for benefit of investors was very creative and saved many people’s investments and reassured the trust on Komodo. 

Agama is a nice tool, and I hope there will be betterment for the product, or better products will be developed.

I firmly believe that the choice of Komodo for Marmara Chain was the best choice and still best choice with the requirements of Marmara Credit Loops which cannot be fulfilled with any of existing tools yet except Komodo.

Hello,
I think I have a working version of marmara cc (close to v1.1. I believe)
What's new:
- activated coins now locked to max height
- added lock-in-loop account which is shared equally among the issuer and all endorsers
- in the settlement the lock-in-loop account is spent from the issuer and endorsers consequently and sent to the holder normal address. State of lock-in-loop fund is shown in marmarainfo
- added support for 2x stake for multiplier and 3x for lock-in-loop funds (I have not tested this yet as I need to start a new chain for this)
- no marmarabatonapproval yet

Sorry for the delay but I needed to add some infrastructure code like support of sharing the lock-in-loop fund and designating the ownership for each share and more
(Do I understand it right we agreed for the current version that the issuer and endorsers receive the equal part of lock-in-loop account and these amounts are spent in settlement?)

@dimxy great. Congratulations. We aggreed that the settlement in the Version 1 mode is in equal between all except the holder. Shall we start the blockchain to start the tests? We need to define the parameters according to document.

I suggest starting a staked chain.
I will also deploy my own chain with PoS


[10-Jun-19 12:16 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We need to use exactly same parameters according to specifications in requirements document.


[10-Jun-19 12:16 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Btw, Version 1.1 means fiat support with gateways. Is it according to Version 1.0 or Version 1.1?


[10-Jun-19 12:18 PM] dimxy#2587
ah, then it is actually v1.0 with the latest requirement updates😀


[10-Jun-19 12:18 PM] dimxy#2587
no fiat yet


[10-Jun-19 12:19 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Ok. We would be very happy. 🙂


[10-Jun-19 12:24 PM] dimxy#2587
yes, let's improve this version and make it follow the requirements


[10-Jun-19 12:28 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Perhaps @jl777c may be helping in parameters. But unfortunately he must be busy with sorting out the recent problem. We may prepare komodod with parameters, maybe he can check them before starting chain.


[10-Jun-19 12:33 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The name will be MCL0. The block reward is 30 MCL0 per block per minute. 25% mining, the remaining is staking with activated plus boosted where boosted has 3x more chance for staking.


[10-Jun-19 12:34 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
2 million will be premined.


[10-Jun-19 12:36 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The blockchain fund is approximately 5% annualy.


[10-Jun-19 01:24 PM] dimxy#2587
for me he suggested to build a chain `with -ac_marmara=1 -ac_staked=75,
probably -ac_perc and -ac_script to pay fixed percentages to several fixed pubkeys`
As I see it, the trick is to make it staked. 
There is an instruction for -ac_staked param

[10-Jun-19 05:32 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Yes. The key is to make it staked. We used the following for the previous testchain 
```./komodod -ac_name=MTST3 -ac_staked=50 -ac_cc=27410 -ac_marmara=1 -ac_supply=100000 -ac_reward=300000000 -addnode=136.243.58.134 -reindex & ```


[10-Jun-19 05:33 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The staking was 50. Now it should be 75.


[10-Jun-19 05:40 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
For the new test chain, it can be as follows:-
```./komodod -ac_name=MCL0 -ac_staked=75 -ac_cc=??? -ac_marmara=1 -ac_perc=??? -ac_pubkey=??? -ac_supply=2000000 -ac_reward=3000000000 -addnode=? -reindex &```


[10-Jun-19 05:46 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I think -ac_pubkey should be the blockchain fund in the third layer. That will be used against nonredemption especially in Version 2 and for credit loop transfer fees required in Version 1. The -ac_perc should be something to poduce roughly 5% annually.


[10-Jun-19 05:50 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@jl777c can tell how to arrange internal parameter to make the boosted staking for coins in locked-credit loop 3x more than activated  ones,

[10-Jun-19 07:30 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I quickly checked the functions. I think the reserved keywords related to Version 2 are ignored. There is not much parameter change when compared to the most recent code that we had tested. I also saw randomization to lock between 3 months to 2 years for the coins. We don't need it since all will be locked to maximum height. Maybe it is not the most recent code that you have produced. We can test them anyway.


[10-Jun-19 10:57 PM] dimxy#2587
@B. Gültekin Çetiner  that link  above is the latest code,
the rpc signatures almost are not changed (except marmaralock for which the height param is ignored)
randomization for 3 month - 2 year is not used now and commented out.


[10-Jun-19 11:00 PM] dimxy#2587
the 3rd level fund is not implemented yet


[10-Jun-19 11:05 PM] dimxy#2587
chances for coins for staking are set in the code (we may make them as chain params, of course)
Now I set for activated 2x multiplier and for locked-in-loop 3x multiplier.
Seems this is incorrect and I should use for activated 1x and for locked-in-loop 2x values of multipliers, yes?


[10-Jun-19 11:33 PM] dimxy#2587
about the chain params I think we might use:
ac_cc=2 (as long as we do not need to migrate coins in the chain's cluster)
ac_pubkey is probably not needed (it allows for this pubkey to create more coins)
addnode is the ip address of the first chain node.
It is good to create at least 3 nodes in the chain to have an issuer, endorser and holder


[10-Jun-19 11:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if there will be a founders reward, -ac_perc=xxxx -ac_founders=1440 -ac_script=<multisig script> can be added


[11-Jun-19 12:53 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
1. Would it be difficult to change the headers for parameters compatible with Version 2? When the parameter is invoked it would just give a warning as such “not implemented yet”.

2. Yes. The activated should be 1x for activated and 3x for locked-in-loop.

3. I am not sure for -ac_cc. In the future, there might be clusters due to high traffic. Suggestion by @jl777c is ok for us.

4. We are planning to use inflation fund to use against nonredemption. I think -ac_pubkey is needed in that case. My question is whether -ac_founders and _ac_pubkey are mutually exclusive which means when we choose one the other option cannot be chosen. If that is the case, we do not need -ac_founders at all.


[11-Jun-19 12:57 AM] jl777c#5810
-ac_pubkey/-ac_script are similar. using -ac_script, it can go to any script address, including a CC vout, multisig. if we want it sent to just a single pubkey then -ac_pubkey should be used


[11-Jun-19 01:33 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I guess if we use -ac_script with ac_founders, we can have multiple accounts. And inside this script, we can have different percentages coming from -ac_perc. Suppose one address can be used as nonredemption fund Shown as in the third layer in requirements document and it can get 90% of -ac_perc while 10% can go to actual founders to have a flexibility against nonredemption. That 10 % will give a flexibility to founding team. In that case we need to write some script as well. Did I understand correctly?


[11-Jun-19 01:34 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, you can create a payments CC that allocates to N different pubkeys a set percentage and then bootstrap the chain so the -ac_perc goes to this address,but this is a bit tricky and it is best that we do it next week as all the people who have experience for it are saturated with the new release


[11-Jun-19 01:36 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
No problem. We have no hurry. Thanks.


[11-Jun-19 01:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can specify the exact percentages and pubkeys, then that can be used to create the chain


[11-Jun-19 01:37 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Ok.


[11-Jun-19 01:38 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I guess we can use barterdex to define pubkeys with any prlvkeys that we want


[11-Jun-19 01:38 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[11-Jun-19 07:26 AM] dimxy#2587
I tried my marmara code on a staked chain. It needs to be further corrected for marmara activated 1of2 address.
So for now it would work only on PoW non-staked chains...


[11-Jun-19 08:23 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
If you could give the komodod line that you used, our team members can test with existing parameters. @Paro @zeki

second and thirs nodes:
./komodod -ac_name=MARMARAXY1 -ac_supply=100000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=<ip> -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_marmara=1 -pubkey=<pubkey>

A question about staking @jl777c :
Do normal coins participate in staking or only activated (and now locked-in-loop) coins? It seems to me in komodo_staking normal coins are excluded from staking.


[12-Jun-19 05:56 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Normal coins should not stake.


[12-Jun-19 05:56 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626

I was able to run a staking chain for marmara cc.
But getlastsegidstakes rpc shows that not many blocks are staked.
It also shows that all the staked blocks are generated for the same single segid.
And indeed, I could not do sendmany64 to distribute utxos for all segids, I believe it does not support activated coins.
So should we implement a similar solution for utxo distribution for the activated coins (and even locked-i-loop)?


[13-Jun-19 06:17 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Could it be due to lack of other nodes? @jl777c was mentioning the instability of block-come-out when there are not enough miners in case of lower mining percentage than 20-25%.


[13-Jun-19 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
for a high percentage PoS chain, it is CRITICAL that in the early blocks to distributed the funds across all 64 segids


[13-Jun-19 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
distribution is very important


[13-Jun-19 06:30 AM] dimxy#2587
So seems, we need to implement a generator of 1of2 activated addresses for 64 segids.


[13-Jun-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
could be


[13-Jun-19 07:14 AM] dimxy#2587
Is this important only for early blocks (seems to stabilize the chain)?
Maybe we do not need this for lock-in-loop addresses. They are actually a 1of2 addresses consisting of marmara globalpk and createtxid pk, that is, no any part to make variations for segids

but for marmarainfo and marmaracreditloop added additional info (about locked-in-loop funds)

1. Which functions are ready from marmarareceive, marmaraissue, marmaratransfer, marmarabatonapproval, marmaraclaimautosettlements and marmarasettlement? Among these the marmarasettlement should be internal to be invoked by marmaraclaimautosettlements not to be called directly.
2. Are these functions changed according to Version 1? 
If ready we can start tests


[15-Jun-19 01:22 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@Paro @dimxy  can we start chain with similar parameters defined in document? We defined 30 MCL per block. Now it is only 0,0001.


[15-Jun-19 01:22 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The name can be MCL0.


[15-Jun-19 01:22 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The premined is 2 million.


[15-Jun-19 01:24 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We also need to define pubkeys for founders. 12 may be a good number. And one additional for the blockchain fund.


[15-Jun-19 03:39 AM] dimxy#2587
I suggest starting a new chain as I implement distribution of activated coins on segids, this chain could have the needed reward and founders parameters


[15-Jun-19 03:56 AM] dimxy#2587
Now the following functions are implemented:
marmaralock, marmarareceive, marmaraissue, marmaratransfer, marmarasettlement.
marmarasettlement is not yet called by miners (it should be by the holder for now)
marmarabatonaproval is not made yet (I believe it was suggested to ignore it for v1.0)


[15-Jun-19 04:03 AM] dimxy#2587
So, it seems autosettlement is what is missed to conform to the v1.0 specification. So let's make it.
There is a question about this: if a miner does autosettlement he probably should receive some reward for this job, isnt't it?

(maybe I presented my code a bit too early, but I had idea to begin testing the lock-in-loop account as its algorithm is not so simple)

And it is needed to add v2.0 parameters as default values yet


[19-Jun-19 06:53 AM] dimxy#2587
Update: 
I have implemented marmaraautosettlement (called by a miner)
the next is adding marmara v2 extended parameters to rpcs as default values, reserved for v2

It works as MARMARAXY1.
but does not work as MCL0.

@dimxy Thanks very much


[19-Jun-19 08:59 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@Paro You need to download and setup blockchain as MCL0 with parameters that I suggested


[19-Jun-19 05:43 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@jl777c Is something wrong with following


[19-Jun-19 05:43 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
```./komodod -ac_name=MCL0 -ac_supply=2000000 -ac_cc=2 -bind=37.148.210.158 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_marmara=1 -gen -genproclimit=2```


[19-Jun-19 05:46 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
They try to start  the chain with that parameters. They claim that the name MCL0 is not accepted.


[19-Jun-19 05:48 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
They say that it works when they write:-
```./komodod -ac_name=MARMARAXY1 -ac_supply=2000000 -ac_cc=2 -bind=37.148.210.158 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -ac_marmara=1 -gen -genproclimit=2 ```


[19-Jun-19 06:05 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@Paro Revise the parameters similar to the previous one with staking as 75, premined as 2 million and reward as 30 per block.


[19-Jun-19 06:09 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
When you use already a name it might give problem to use the same name later. You need to delete related directories from all nodes.


[19-Jun-19 06:19 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Dear Marmara Chain community members. 
You can start testing Marmara Credit Loops for Version 1.0. The new MarmaraCC may be followed from https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/commits/marmara-v1-1

[19-Jun-19 06:25 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@Paro I revised the parameters similar to the MTST3 test chain with new parameters. 
```./komodod -ac_name=MCL1 -ac_staked=75 -ac_cc=27410 -ac_marmara=1 -ac_supply=2000000 -ac_reward=3000000000 -addnode=37.148.210.158 -reindex & ```


[19-Jun-19 06:27 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I think the parameter -ac_cc=27410 should be changed .


[19-Jun-19 06:46 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@dimxy What is your parameters line? The testers need to use the same test chain. They try to establish a new test chain themselves but they cannot do with the name MCL0 or MCL1.


[20-Jun-19 12:51 AM] dimxy#2587
my chain params are:
staked node
./komodod -ac_name=MARMARAXY2 -ac_supply=100000 -ac_cc=2 -bind=172.31.5.51 -whitelist=172.31.0.0/16 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -port=14722 -ac_marmara=1 -ac_staked=75 -ac_reward=100000000 -pubkey=<pubkey1> -printtoconsole -gen -genproclimit=0 -debug=marmara-1 &

PoW node
./komodod -ac_name=MARMARAXY2 -ac_supply=100000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=172.31.5.51 -whitelist=172.31.0.0/16 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -port=14722 -ac_marmara=1 -ac_staked=75 -ac_reward=100000000 -pubkey=<pubkey2> -printtoconsole -gen -genproclimit=$(nproc) -debug=marmara-1 &

yet another node:
./komodod -ac_name=MARMARAXY2 -ac_supply=100000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=172.31.5.51 -whitelist=172.31.0.0/16 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -port=14722 -ac_marmara=1 -ac_staked=75 -ac_reward=100000000 -pubkey=<pubkey3> -printtoconsole -debug=marmara-1 &


[20-Jun-19 12:52 AM] dimxy#2587
I'll try chains with the names MCL0 or MCL1 (BTW I cant see any exceptions for these names in the code)


[20-Jun-19 06:49 AM] dimxy#2587
Do we need all parameters such amount, currency, matures etc to be repeated in each credit loop transaction opreturn?
Could we simply save most of them in the first creation transaction and just retrieve them from it (so we may exclude these parameters from the subsequent transfer/receive calls)?


[20-Jun-19 07:35 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
This is actually what I wrote in the new requirement documents for both Version 1 and Version 2. The current code repeats many parameters in marmarareceive, marmaratransfer etc unnecessarily.

{Reactions}
👍 

[20-Jun-19 08:17 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@dimxy You can propose any function parameter to be truncated in consequent functions/operations if that is to be repeated unnecessarily.


[20-Jun-19 08:20 AM] dimxy#2587
yes, I'd like to do this. 
I need yet to work out which param is needed on what loop stage.

[20-Jun-19 11:28 AM] dimxy#2587
I think you need the following steps (on a fresh chain):
1) run 2 nodes without -gen -genproclimit parameters
2) on both nodes run getnewaddress and then validateaddress to get pubkeys
3) restart both nodes with -pubkey parameters and still without  -gen -geproclimit
4) on the first node run `setgenerate true 1`
5) wait for 3-4 blocks mined
6) on the first node run `marmarainfo 0 0 0 0` and ensure that there are activated coins
7) restart both nodes with params:
staked node (first) with `-gen -geproclimit=0`
second  node `-gen -genproclimit=$(nproc)`

@Paro you have to use the same test chain with @dimxy and the same MarmaraCC. Maybe @AhmetKaplan and @Murat Uslu  may help organizing tests. Tests must be systematic.


[20-Jun-19 08:18 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Dear @dimxy There is confusion among our team members. They are trying to establish different test chains. We, all must be speaking the same language. I think it is better you suggest one test chain with the parameters.  You can call it MARMARA3. But Let it be 30 MARMARA3 per block per minute with 2 million premined. You can send @Paro  or @AhmetKaplan  enough  so that they will distribute those among our team members to make activated staking and credit loop testing.

Hello @Paro, 
either way of installation is okay. I suggest `git clone` as you will be able to receive updates


[21-Jun-19 12:01 AM] dimxy#2587
@Paro  seems there is a problem in the `bind` and `addnode` params you listed:
-bind of the first node should be set to the local address of the first node
-addnode on the second node should be set to the ipaddress of the first node
in your example both params are equal


[21-Jun-19 12:02 AM] Paro#7842

The settlement is implemented as spending only lock-in-loop funds which are allocated for full 100%  credit amount (according to B. Gültekin Çetiner's comment`No need to go from top to bottom in Version 1.`).

Did you lock enough coins before trying marmaraissue? @Paro


[24-Jun-19 11:53 PM] dimxy#2587
yes please use marmarainfo 0 0 0 0 to see activated coins amount (you probably would need to lock some coins, that is, make them activated)

@Paro I checked the document.
You should not make marmaratransfer from the pubkey1 to pubkey2. It is already done by marmaraissue. That is, after marmaraissue the baton should be already on the pubkey2.
So you should make marmaratransfer for the pubkey2 to pubkey3 only


[25-Jun-19 01:28 AM] dimxy#2587
You wrote the baton stayed on the pubkey1 after marmaraissue.
I think it might be it was not mined yet. Could you check where the baton is now - on pk1 or pk2?

Ah, sorry. I can see you called maramaraissue for the pubkey1, so the baton stayed on it
please pass the pubkey2 as the first param of marmaraissue.
(I'll update the code to check this)

ye no problem. can I do a new test?

[25-Jun-19 02:01 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes, you need to start a new test (we could not correct this)
Okay, I'll be following the test status in the doc


[25-Jun-19 02:02 AM] Paro#7842
OK ty


[25-Jun-19 02:02 AM] Paro#7842

[25-Jun-19 02:10 AM] Paro#7842
pubkey 2 will not use the "marmarareceive" parameter?


[25-Jun-19 02:24 AM] dimxy#2587
on the pubkey2 node we first-time call `marmarareceive pubkey1` and then `marmaraissue pubkey2` on the pubkey1 node
then on the pubkey3 node we call second time `marmarareceive pubkey2` and then `marmaratransfer pubkey3` on the pubkey2 node

ok, checking...


[25-Jun-19 03:49 AM] dimxy#2587
I believe, initially is was 100 coins on both of the pk1 and pk2 activated accounts.
During the test for 49 coins of credit, the pk1 and pk2 both sent 49/2=24,5 coins to the lock-in-loop address.
So after the test finished, those 24,5*2 went to the pk3 normal address.
Was it like this?
Can you see 49 coins on the pk3 normal address?


[25-Jun-19 03:50 AM] Paro#7842
sorry .. pk3  send before after w8

@dimxy 
1. Our testers  told me that when we make marmaraissue, the baton was not transferred. Do we need to use the pair of functions for batonapproval? I think you told that you had excluded the baton approval functions since they were required in Version 2. 
Is it the case? Or is this is a bug?

2. Are the unnecessary parameters removed in function headings in consequitive functions in marmarareceive, marmaratransfer?


[25-Jun-19 11:44 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
3. Do we have now the parameters required in Version 2?


[25-Jun-19 11:55 PM] dimxy#2587
1. In one of the tests the baton was not transferred in marmaraissue call because the used receiver pk parameter was equal not to the holder's pk but the issuer's pk itself. I have added a check that the receiver pk could not be equal to caller's pk. (marmarabatonapproval is not implemented yet, but we already have understanding how to make it)

2 & 3. I'm working on this right now, I estimate 1-2 days for the new version to be ready

[26-Jun-19 11:48 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Great. It is going very  well.
1. What about boosted coins? Do they get 3x staking with boosted?  
2. Do we lock boosted in common fund? In the first case, the  PK1 should have 3x boosted staking. In the second case, both PK1 and PK2 should have 3x boosted staking with half (credit/(n-1))
3. Is settlement automatic?  Or do we need to make marmarasettlement manually?


[27-Jun-19 12:05 AM] Paro#7842
hi @dimxy


[27-Jun-19 12:08 AM] dimxy#2587
@B. Gültekin Çetiner  
1. Yes, boosted coins take 3x multiplier in staking
2. We lock boosted coins on an 1of2 address that is unique to each credit loop and common (shared) for all loop's participants. But each utxo in a loop is marked by the pubkey who made this utxo. So we know what part of a loop fund belongs to which endorser and use this in the calculation of staking value. 
3. Settlement is automatic and is executed by a miner. There are some implications from this:
- anyone can now execute settlement
- it is now a problem to move the baton after the settlement (as it is stated in the requirements doc) because the baton is on the holder pubkey and anyone who does the settlement can't spend it

Did you pass the baton in marmarareceive call on pk3? 
It seems not, as this field in tx opreturn is empty (as explorer shows) In this case marmaratransfer would not work (because it is supposed to be a new loop, so maramaraissue is only possible)

Why are LCL empty in all PK1, PK2 and PK3? @Paro


[27-Jun-19 11:16 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Did you make boosted (LCL) tests? Any plan?


[27-Jun-19 11:17 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
How do you activate settlement?


[27-Jun-19 11:18 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Automatic?


[28-Jun-19 03:04 AM] dimxy#2587
LCL values are empty because they are null before the test and should be clear after the settlement (the table shows the status after the settlement). So the results are correct (as I understood the algorithm😀 )
Total credit amount was 10 coins. After the settlement those 10 coins eventually were sent to pk3 normal.
For pk1 its activated account decreased by 10 coins and normal account increased by 5 coins. These 5 coins were sent to its normal when the look-in-loop amount was redistributed between pk1 and pk2 at the moment when the baton was sent to pk3.
For pk2 its activated amount is decreased by 5 coins (which he donated to the loop).

The settlement now is automatic and is started by any miner.
(And it creates a problem: the miner who started the settlement cannot send the baton to the issuer as required by the document. The baton is on the holder's pubkey and the miner cannot spend it)


[28-Jun-19 10:15 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@jl777c may give idea on the solution of problem.


[28-Jun-19 10:16 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Could it be spent from the blockchain fund in third layer?


[28-Jun-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
i think just seeing the case of the miner completing the settlement can be the indication that the loop is done. as long as we can tell, it doesnt seem it needs to get back to the issuer


[28-Jun-19 11:27 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Do you mean we do not need to transfer the baton back to issuer during settlement?


[28-Jun-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
if it settles properly on all other aspects, why is it needed?


[28-Jun-19 11:34 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
That is right. We just need to have a flag saying the loop is settled.


[28-Jun-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
this condition can indicate this


[28-Jun-19 12:06 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@dimxy then no need to transfer the baton at the end and hence making spending.


[28-Jun-19 12:07 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
You can ignore the part in requirements document which suggests transfer of baton to issuer at the end during settlement.


[28-Jun-19 12:14 PM] dimxy#2587
We have not only a baton but also a marker, it is on the global address. It can be spend by miner (he spends it already)  and it indicates the loop is settled.


[28-Jun-19 10:51 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
What do you mean by global address? Is it blockchain fund in third layer? If it can be spent from there it is best solution. We need to start the chain with ac_perc. This is actually what we discussed. If we can spend from the blockchain fund it will solve the problem. Suppose I am a holder/issuer/endorser, I have enough activated or boosted but not enough normal to cover small fee. This should be spendable from the blockchain fund. Then this blockchain fund may be used for transferring baton to issuer as well. Is it difficult or impossible technically?


[29-Jun-19 04:58 AM] dimxy#2587
The 'global address' is a feature common for every komodo cc contract. This address might be used for various purposes. It is like a shared account. Although anyone might spend funds from this address this spending is controlled by the validation code.
Currently in marmara this address is used for storage of markers, that is, small amounts on this address which allow to enumerate the transactions which have such an utxo. By this we can find all 'marmaraissue' transactions for open credit loops.
The marmara validation code will allow to spend such markers for the settlement transactions and by this close the credit loop.
And yes we can store marmara's backup fund on this adddress too.


[29-Jun-19 05:14 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Can we start a new test chain such as MCL1 with the common blockchain fund? This is stated in requirements document as the third layer for protection against nonredemption. In case of insufficient normal funds but with enough activated/boosted, this fund may be utilized. Perhaps It may be utilized for transferring baton to issuer at the end when the credit loop expires.


[29-Jun-19 05:28 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes I think we can a new chain which would allow to use common fund to cover normal accounts with insufficient amounts on them.
To allow a miner to transfer the baton we should change the way of baton's storage: now the baton is on the holder's pubkey and no one except him can move the baton. To allow a miner to move it we should store the baton on some special address (like 1of2 address of endorser pk+global pk) which would allow both endorser and miner to move the baton. Plus we will need to write very carefully the validation code to prevent moving the baton in all cases except the settlement.


[29-Jun-19 06:19 AM] dimxy#2587
But from the previous messages I understood we may avoid returning the baton to the issuer after the settlement. How will it be used after it is returned to the issuer?
If we can avoid it I'd suggest maybe not to change this. It seems to me the storing the baton on the loop participant's pubkey is simple solution and does not involve additional transaction validation


[29-Jun-19 07:03 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Which one is easier and more efficient? You don’t need to change if it is easier to avoid transferring. Please feel free on that. But can we still use the idea of common fund to cover insufficient normal accounts with enough activated/boosted during settlement?


[29-Jun-19 07:33 AM] dimxy#2587
I'd say this is not about which one is easier. It is more like what is needed. I noticed in the chat messages that we are going to use moving the baton back to the issuer to indicate that the loop is closed. But we also have another feature for the same task - the marker. We already do spending the marker at the settlement to closed the loop. Maybe this will solve that task. 
But if not, and we need to move the baton to the issuer for some other reasons, let's do this.

Yes the common fund feature will be implemented, I cannot see any problems to do this.


[29-Jun-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
i suggest not changing the baton handling, it serves no purpose other than to match the spec. it is much easier and safer to change the spec on this detail

About testing of staking I think we could have for example two PoS nodes and provide that one of them has only activated and another one only lock-in-loop amount (by issuing a credit for all available activated), and then see how the staking multipliers work on PoS block distribution among two of them.

You mean what is 0,00015 in reward?
The value of 10000 I believe is the collected miner's fee for the mined transaction in the block.
About what is the remainder of 5000 I need to find out.

prize 30 mcl. occasionally he gets "30.00015".


[02-Jul-19 05:35 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes, please see that block content, there are 5 transactions in it:
coinbase transaction for 30,00015 MCL
then there are three transactions with 0.00005 txfee each which add those 0,00015 to 30 resulting 30,00015 MCL in the coinbase
the last transaction is staked transaction spent to self (with no txfee)

[02-Jul-19 10:03 AM] dimxy#2587
So as I can see, you had created a credit loop for 500 and then monitored how staking works on PoS nodes pk1 and pk2
And before this monitoring we had:
pk1   activated=0, locked-in-loop=250
pk2  activated=250, locked-in-loop=250
after the end of monitoring we had:
pk1 activated=150
pk2 activated=700
That is, for pk1 250 locked-in-loop coins generated 150 activated coins
and for pk2 250 locked-in-loop and 250 activated coins generated 700 activated coins


[02-Jul-19 10:05 AM] Paro#7842

It seems it works completely in reverse order. The holder seems to be doing boosted staking.


[02-Jul-19 12:05 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The first one should be producing much more TOTAL COINS.


[02-Jul-19 11:38 PM] dimxy#2587
I think we could create a temporary parameter in the program for an address where to send generated coins (outside miner's wallet) to prevent their interference with the monitored statistics.
Plus, for this staking test I think it is better to have one test node with the issuer's locked-in-loop account (and no activated) and for another test node to have only activated account. Then we could see if the actual ratio is close or not to 1:3

I assume this is a test of generating coins, yes?
And there were no any amounts of locked-in-loop coins in the test.

Yeah. coin generation test this.
500 coins were locked in all of them.

I'm starting a new test.(3x staking test)
PK3 coin without locking.


[05-Jul-19 08:23 AM] dimxy#2587
I have made a version with a special test parameter -marmara-test-pubkey where generated activated coins are sent to (in the repo).
To test staking multipliers I suggest preparing for the test 2 PoS nodes and 2 non-mining nodes.
On the 1st PoS node set up a credit loop for some amount (and lock all activated coins)
On the 2nd PoS node provide the same amount of activated coins (and no lock-in-loop)
On both the PoS nodes set -marmara-test-pubkey to pubkeys from the 2 non-mining nodes correspondingly.
on those non-mining nodes you will be able to see generated coins for staked utxos with 1x and 3x multipliers

[05-Jul-19 08:24 AM] dimxy#2587
you could see generated results on the 2 non-mining nodes with marmarainfo rpc


[05-Jul-19 11:18 AM] Paro#7842
I did not quite get it @dimxy


[05-Jul-19 11:18 AM] Paro#7842
what should we do.


[05-Jul-19 01:37 PM] dimxy#2587
The idea is to have a test environment providing results that are easy to check.
The test should show that lock-in-loop coins provide 3x chances for staking vs 1x for activated coins.
To check this it will be good if there are 2 staking nodes in the test, one with activated coins and another with lock-in-loop coins.
Both amounts should be equal, to make it possible to check the ratio easy.

As PoS nodes generate new activated coins they would interfere with initially set coins for staking.
That's why a temp parameter was added to komodod to send generated coins to other addresses.
so we could send them to any 2 non-mining nodes (for example pk1 and pk2)


[05-Jul-19 01:43 PM] dimxy#2587
so we should have 2 PoS nodes (setgenerate=0), on the first of them let's set up 500 activated coins and for the 2nd node 500 lock-in-loop 
Credit period should be long enough, for example 24 hours 
on both nodes we need add temp params:
-marmara-test-pubkey=pk1
-marmara-test-pubkey=pk2
and we could monitor generated coins on the pk1 and pk2 nodes with marmarainfo (and check the ratio)

@dimxy  says: ```normal coins do not matter as they do not participate in staking.
I'll provide on both the PoS nodes 500 coins on each, and on the one of them will issue a credit (for 24h to make fund locked for that amount)
and will see how many coins will be generated on both the nodes```

[09-Jul-19 11:13 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
lcl coins should be generating 3x times more than activated coins.


[09-Jul-19 11:13 AM] Paro#7842
sorry @dimxy my english sucks. 🤒


[09-Jul-19 11:15 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Suppose PoS1 has 500 activated and PoS2 has 500 LCL (boosted) then PoS2 should produce roughly 3x times more coins than PoS1.


[09-Jul-19 11:17 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes, we hope it will be like this.
I also will try to test this ratio on my test chain (need to restart it yet)

after the last update. The blocks come out more comfortable.


[10-Jul-19 03:04 AM] dimxy#2587
I'm trying to do staking test (with the environment I suggested: 2 PoS nodes, 1 PoW node and 2 mining node to receive coinbase rewards).
For now results are not satisfactory: generated coins are not distributed in the expected ratio, the deviation is very big.
I am now investigating what is wrong...


[10-Jul-19 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the percentages will take a few thousand blocks to stabilize


[10-Jul-19 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you are comparing 10%+ stakes against each other, it could take much longer


[10-Jul-19 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
do you have 10% of coin supply staking in each of the test cases?


[10-Jul-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
and how many blocks before you determine something is wrong?


[10-Jul-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
if the math is correct and the 3x increase is comparing against hashes divided by three, then over time, it will end up at 3x.


[10-Jul-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe for testing the 3x should be increased to 30x to exaggerate the effect


[10-Jul-19 03:08 AM] jl777c#5810
however pos64 has segments to reduce the staking advantage of a whale address and that also can affect things


[10-Jul-19 03:31 AM] dimxy#2587
My environment is following:
I have 2 PoS nodes and have on both the pubkeys by 186 coins (as activated coins)
The total supply is 100,000 and most of this amount is on the first pk as normal. I thought it was not relevant as only activated or locked-in-loop coins participate in staking.
My test chain is 333 blocks now
Actually as a first test I tried to set equal amount of activated coins on both the PoS nodes and expected to have approximately equal amounts of coinbase rewards. I waited for 30 blocks and saw that only 3 of them went to the second node rewards, the rest of them went to the first node.

I did not do coins distribution on 64 segids (as this is not implemented yet for marmara activated coins) - maybe this is the cause. If it is, it needs to be implemented first and then continue the test


[10-Jul-19 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
you can negate the effect of segids by putting both test addresses in the same segid


[10-Jul-19 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
then the segid differences wont matter


[10-Jul-19 03:37 AM] jl777c#5810
at 100,000 total coins and 333 blocks, it is not yet converged to the average blocktime and in the process of diff adjusting


[10-Jul-19 03:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so the variance will be MUCH greater


[10-Jul-19 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
186 / 100000 coins is WAY too small to get a meaningfully accurate result, you would need a week or a month


[10-Jul-19 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
put in 40,000 coins in each address, from same segid


[10-Jul-19 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
then in a day you should see things converge


[10-Jul-19 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
but it also depends on the power of PoW


[10-Jul-19 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
many, many factors


[10-Jul-19 03:49 AM] dimxy#2587
Ok, thank you very much, I'll try all this.
(maybe the staking code iterates segids and not randomizes them and might be just picking the earliest one)


[10-Jul-19 04:05 AM] jl777c#5810
staking code has logic to pick the utxo that can win a block the earliest


[10-Jul-19 04:05 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless of all the other factors


[10-Jul-19 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
you are basically trying to tell apart 0.1% from 0.3%


[10-Jul-19 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
with 300 samples


[10-Jul-19 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
during the time where the overall block generation is still calibrating itself relative to PoW strength and coins staking


[10-Jul-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
33% of the time the 0.1% will get a block before the 0.3% and then now it has more utxo that is able to stake

please note that -marmara-test-pubkey param affects only activated coinbases (for even blocks). 
Coinbases for normal rewards (odd blocks) are sent to usual addresses (that is, to a node's -pubkey param)


[10-Jul-19 12:13 PM] dimxy#2587
So on PK1 and PK2 only activated amounts are relevant

PK2 is for LCL (boosted) ones. Wasn't it?


[10-Jul-19 02:39 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I think amplifying the ratio as suggested by @jl777c between the activated and boosted will give us if the Boosted coins produce more than activated ones. The ratio might be 30x.

I have done a new version, it supports the new rpc interface from the business requirements (with additional params like avalcount, EscrowOn,...) plus duplicate parameters were removed. Help switch would show the rpc's parameters
No approvaltxid yet (I believe this will be the next step)
This version is incompatible with the previous version due to opreturn structure changes

We also want to make sure that credits locked in Loop should make 3x staking also in future Version 2. So it does not matter whether the person is issuing a credit according to Version  1 or Version 2, the coins locked in loop should have 3x staking power.


[13-Jul-19 06:25 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We made a credit loop. It seems settlement does not work. In Version 1 document, we had ```marmaraclaimautosettlements.``` I think it is not available at the moment. We checked The marmarasettlement, it is discontinued now. That part is ok now.


[13-Jul-19 06:31 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Is it made automatic within the code?


[13-Jul-19 06:57 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The settlemnt does not work. We will test with the previous version now.


[13-Jul-19 07:23 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I think when the marmarasettlement is made "discontinued", the automatic settlement process is somehow left out.


[13-Jul-19 05:34 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We started a new test chain and I was involved personally in tests for the previous codes before non-functional addition of Version 2 parameters. They seem to be working nicely with settlement. But we could not make the tests for 3x staking of boosted, i.e. LCL against activated. The first blocks are not stable. Therefore, we left the blockchain to continue growing for first 10 hours.

The point is the new parameters are added in JSON object (in apostrophes)
Also duplicated params amount, currency, mature are needed only in the first marmarareceive call


[13-Jul-19 11:09 PM] dimxy#2587
--------------
Please be aware that those new parameters (avalcount EscrowOn, BlockageAmount,... ) are not working yet
They are supposed to be implemented in V2
(I believe  we are still working on V1,  the params were added for the rpc compatibility with V2)

About checking staking multipliers:
As JL wrote we need probably several weeks to have chain staking to stabilize

Great. Thanks very much. What is the function to be called by miners for settlement?


[14-Jul-19 12:58 AM] dimxy#2587
This is MarmaraRunAutoSettlement function (it is not exposed as an rpc)

It is started automatically as the chain height reaches the check  mature height, by a miner

@dimxy i have an idea. i dont know how to tell you.


[15-Jul-19 02:12 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I was with @Paro and @zeki yesterday. They are making black box tests. I also joined in some of the tests personally. Let me try to translate our concern @dimxy and @jl777c .  We made tests with the codes before the addition of blank parameters from Version 2. I think there is a fundamental problem as far as I  see from test results. We need to clarify it. When someone has coins in LCL, he/she should be staking 3x than normal activated. Now it seems to work like this. Suppose I have 40000 activated and no coin in LCL. It works with normal staking power. But supposse I have 10 coins only in LCL and I have 40000 in activated. And someone has  40000 coins in LCL but only 10 coins as activated. He can produce more even if the other person has more in LCL. I think it currently looks at the person if he/she has coins in LCL and prodcues from the activated ones not based on the LCL. LCL wallet address is only one address common to all and actually not stakeable.  Therefore, we don't encourage the real credit creators. People just need to lock something to get full 3x power of staking. If we summarize, we just need to lock something  in LCL to have 3x staking. The 3x staking is based on activated ones and not the coins  in LCL. This is what we see from the system. I think the problem may be solved by making  a stakeable address such as  "myLCLAmount" similar to "myActivatedAmount". Both  "myLCLAmount" and "myActivatedAmount" should stake simulatenously according to their contents.  I think "myAmountOnActivatedAddress-old" may be deleted. It is not needed any more. It was used to collect the latest 16 activated ones when we were having activated coins  between 3 months to 2 years. Now all coins are activated at a maximum height. I don't know if I could explain the concern well ?@Paro


[15-Jul-19 02:34 AM] dimxy#2587
If we are concerned with that low LCL amount produces small number of blocks (and big amount of activated coins will consume most of the blocks generation) we might disable staking on activated and enable only on LCL coins. But if the total LCL amount for that whole chain is low the staking might be unstable.
Alternatively we could change the  multiplier for LCL


[15-Jul-19 02:35 AM] dimxy#2587
myAmountOnActivatedAddress-old is temp value, for developer to check if opreturn is correct and now activated coins would  be lost. It will be deleted, please dont pay attention to it


[15-Jul-19 02:41 AM] dimxy#2587
I understand you can see that seems the activated coins produce more generated blocks than locked-in-loop.
But as JL wrote we need probably several week for staking to stabilize. So it is too early to make conclusion now that LCL coins is incorrect


[15-Jul-19 02:42 AM] jl777c#5810
3x is likely too small a ratio to clearly detect in testing


[15-Jul-19 02:42 AM] jl777c#5810
40000 compared to 10 is 4000x more coins, so you would need a 4000x ratio to compensate


[15-Jul-19 02:44 AM] dimxy#2587
I 'm running another test myself to provide that the chain staking is stable:
I setup 2 nodes wth equal segid activated addresses and use equal amount of activated coins on both of them. No LCL!
I'm waiting for the chain to produce the balanced number of blocks from activated coins. Now they are still unbalanced


[15-Jul-19 03:12 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@Paro I think we need to look at the coding part to explain our concern. Black box tests are not enough.


[15-Jul-19 03:17 AM] dimxy#2587
the code is fully open. You might be concerned with LCL implementation. LCL is implemented as a shared account for the system to be able to spend it and redistribute amount between the endorsers (as the doc states). But each LCL utxo is marked with the pubkey who owns this part. So for staking only those utxo are picked up that are marked with the miner's pubkey. So this is a complete equivalent for myLCLaccount.


[15-Jul-19 03:26 AM] dimxy#2587
you could ask about any part of the code and I can clarify it.
Most of the code (rpc and helpers, opretun creation functions) is in cc/marmara.cpp.
Staking extensions are in komodo_bitcoind.h file
calling creation of miner's transactions is in miner.cpp file, 
this creation func, which calls MarmaraRunAutoSettlement, is in komodo_gateway.h

{Reactions}
👍 

[15-Jul-19 03:38 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Do the staking extensions in komodo_bitcoind.h  also include LCL part?


[15-Jul-19 03:59 AM] dimxy#2587
the algorithm of adding staking utxo is in cc/marmara.cpp, MarmaraGetStakingUtxos which is called from the komodo_bitcoind.h


[15-Jul-19 04:00 AM] dimxy#2587
it enumerates both activated utxos then LCL utxos for the mypubkey (which is miner's pk)
Applying of the multipliers is in the cc/marmara.cpp MarmaraGetStakeMultiplier function, this function is called back from komodo_bitcoind.h, func komodo_txtime2

(komodo_bitcoind is a common src file, it itself contains little app logic and provides only callbacks which extend the basic komodo functionality for specific marmara features. The logic is in marmara.cpp)


[15-Jul-19 06:45 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Is there any way to Show people how much they can earn through activated staking and boosted staking? It does not need to be precise. Just estimation. Verus has such calculation on how much people can earn through staking.

[15-Jul-19 07:05 AM] dimxy#2587
We can do such estimations, yes. 
For the present test we cannot expect solid coin generation based on LCL amount until the chain stabilizes.
As I understand JL, it might take weeks to stabilize.
Plus, it is important what amount is locked, because if I have 10 LCL but another endorser has 4000 activated, I would have too low chances even with 3x amplifier

[15-Jul-19 07:08 AM] dimxy#2587
I think for now we should reach the point when the test chain would give consistent predictable results.
I'm waiting on my test chain where I'm expecting that 2 equal activated amounts would produce equal amount of blocks


[15-Jul-19 07:09 AM] jl777c#5810
with only 2 test points, it is possible that one of them gets lucky and if the staked block amount is significant compared to the total staking, it can permanently skew things. just the way the statistics works


[15-Jul-19 07:11 AM] dimxy#2587
yes I had similar suspicions.
Maybe it is better to have at least 3 staking nodes?


[15-Jul-19 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
or 4, 2 vs 2


[15-Jul-19 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
but let current test finish and we can see how it converges


[20-Jul-19 07:44 AM] dimxy#2587
The staking test results (and also consultations with other devs) have shown that, seems, we cannot avoid splitting activated utxos into 64 addresses (matching to 64 segids).
So we need to implement this feature

What is the problem then?


[20-Jul-19 08:08 AM] dimxy#2587
We could implemented this like freezing some amount from a user's activated coins by splitting it on segids. So he would use it only for staking


[20-Jul-19 08:11 AM] dimxy#2587
But there are more problems with lock-in-loop amount - we cannot freeze it , it should be always available for returning back to users normal accounts as the BR states


[20-Jul-19 08:12 AM] Paro#7842
Plan: 300 coin loop
activated1: 100 MCL : 1xstaking
activated2: 100 MCL :  1xstaking
activated3: 100 MCL : 1xstaking

total 3x staking   ?


[20-Jul-19 08:13 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I think that would be easier.


[20-Jul-19 08:14 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The 3 activating wallet


[20-Jul-19 08:15 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We just divide the LCL coins into 3 wallets equally.


[20-Jul-19 08:15 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
But of course more transactions


[20-Jul-19 08:15 AM] Paro#7842
Is that how it is. ? I did not fully understand.


[20-Jul-19 08:16 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Maybe we misunderstood


[20-Jul-19 08:16 AM] Paro#7842
@B. Gültekin Çetiner Yeah. we may have misunderstood.


[20-Jul-19 08:18 AM] dimxy#2587
As I understand it to make staking work stable, we need to split the staking utxos inside the user wallet into 64 unique addresses.
(they will be generated by a special rpc which is to be made yet)


[20-Jul-19 08:19 AM] dimxy#2587
so after splitting a user would have 64 accounts in his wallet
Amount for staking should be split equally on these accounts


[20-Jul-19 08:20 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Not three. 64 addresses will be then.


[20-Jul-19 08:20 AM] Paro#7842
ow


[20-Jul-19 08:20 AM] dimxy#2587
So he needs to decide, what amount from his activated coins he wants to use for staking


[20-Jul-19 08:21 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Would it be easy/practical to implement?


[20-Jul-19 08:22 AM] dimxy#2587
Well, it's been done for usual coins, so it could be done for marmara activated coins too


[20-Jul-19 08:23 AM] Paro#7842
high "hashpower" may be required.


[20-Jul-19 08:27 AM] dimxy#2587
And I can see a problem with locked-in-loop amount. Seems we cannot 'lock' it once more on yet another 64 user accounts


[20-Jul-19 08:28 AM] dimxy#2587
Ideally locked-in-loop amount should be always split on 64 segid addresses


[20-Jul-19 08:33 AM] dimxy#2587
(Maybe when JL reads this he would suggest a better idea)


[20-Jul-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
just do a test with funds in all segids to smooth out the granularity of initial blocks


[20-Jul-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
statistically if staking is N times more, over time, it should end up with N times more


[20-Jul-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
to make it easier to detect, best to make it 30x for testing


[20-Jul-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
put funds in 64 different segids for each category, just do it with a script


[20-Jul-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
in normal use it wont matter

[20-Jul-19 08:54 AM] dimxy#2587
So we want to do a test with activated coins split into 64 segids.


[20-Jul-19 08:57 AM] dimxy#2587
Suppose we have  those 64 addresses, with some utxos on them, forever.
And we will not split locked-in-loop amounts into segids.
Wouldn't these activated utxos outperform locked-in-loop utxos (that are not split)?
(As I understand splitting is needed only for initial blocks. So later it does not matter, does it?)


[20-Jul-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
with many users, the splitting effect is averaged out


[20-Jul-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
but active users can get more blocks by analyzing the 64 segids and putting coins in the weakest one


[20-Jul-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a multiplayer game on 64 segids, with limited resources


[20-Jul-19 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
very complex strategy game that depends on how everybody else allocates their coins


[20-Jul-19 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is a simple bug in the boosting calc?


[20-Jul-19 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
you know for mining to make it easier you need to multiple the value


[20-Jul-19 09:08 AM] dimxy#2587
Actually I did a test for only activated coins on 2 PoS nodes. I wanted to get to the point where both equal staking utxos would generate approximately equal results.
But my chain for a weekly test duration was in unstable state (apparently because of no staking utxo spliting).
So I wondered once more if the splitting needs only for initial blocks or it is better to have it always


[20-Jul-19 09:09 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes, I 'll do splitting and provide the chain to be stable


[20-Jul-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
if you start with them split, then each one will increase the coins in that segid, overtime relatively balanced. which is fine


[20-Jul-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
number of nodes is not what matters as a single node can stake many addresses


[20-Jul-19 09:27 AM] dimxy#2587
You wrote `put funds in 64 different segids for each category'.
If we have 'activated' and 'lock-in-loop' accounts does this mean we need to split both of them?
(our current locked-in-loop account implementation does not allow splitting because of shared 1of2 address)


[20-Jul-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
need to make 64 different loops?


[20-Jul-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be there is a bug in your staking percentage multiplier. can you post the code that does the calculation


[20-Jul-19 10:07 AM] dimxy#2587
I mean suppose we have a credit loop. The issuer has locked some amount in this loop.
This amount should have 3x multiplier in staking.
The question is should this amount be split on 64 segids?


[20-Jul-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[20-Jul-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as it really has 3x the chance, that is what matters


[20-Jul-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
i think there must be some bug in the 3x calc


[20-Jul-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
how exactly do you make it 3x


[20-Jul-19 10:13 AM] dimxy#2587
this is how I calculate 3x:
```
uint32_t komodo_txtime2(uint64_t *valuep,uint256 hash,int32_t n,char *destaddr)
{
...
if ( n < tx.vout.size() )
    {
        int32_t stakemultiplier = GetStakeMultiplier(tx, n);
        *valuep = tx.vout[n].nValue * stakemultiplier; 
    ...
    }
}
```
so there is GetStakeMultiplier() func, it calls MarmaraGetStakeMultiplier() func


[20-Jul-19 10:15 AM] dimxy#2587
MarmaraGetStakeMultiplier() returns either 1 or 3:


[20-Jul-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
and you verified that the actual stake compare uses the bigger value?


[20-Jul-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
lets try a 100x boost, that should make it very clear and not need to fiddle with segids


[20-Jul-19 10:19 AM] dimxy#2587
No, I have not reached this testing progress yet.
I have been testing only how activated staking amounts work which always should have 1x multiplier. (and I had my chain unstable, as Alright yesterday explained it could have been because of lack of segids)


[20-Jul-19 10:20 AM] dimxy#2587
So I initiated this discussion about what should we do about splitting utxos on segids in marmara chains


[20-Jul-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to make sure the actual staking calc is using the bigger values


[20-Jul-19 10:35 AM] dimxy#2587
okay let's try 100x or similar value

I hope we can clearly see this time that LCL coins result in much more staking than activated ones.


[21-Jul-19 11:03 AM] dimxy#2587
BTW, what was wrong with the settlement in the version with the new rpcs?
Didn't it start at all?
Or, was it finished with an error?
(I tested a credit loop with this version, with an issuer, one endorser and one holder, and the autosettlement seemed worked)

Let s check the v2 params together
As the v2 params contain json you need to pass json objects in quotes (i wrote examples in this chat above)


[21-Jul-19 09:29 PM] Paro#7842
OK . I'm going to build a "v2" branch in a new chain.

"50000" coin lost


[24-Jul-19 08:20 AM] dimxy#2587
on which pubkey?


[24-Jul-19 08:28 AM] dimxy#2587
I could not see problems with 50,000 coins.
But I can see that the settled 100,000 amount did not go to PK3 normal account. Did you install the latest update for 'corrected pubkey for the holder in settlement' from 22 July?

Apart from the pk1,pk2 and pk3 nodes you have two more ubuntu nodes, don't you?
Could please add git log output from them too?
as settlement now is done by miners in auto mode then every node in the chain should be upgraded to the latest version because there were bugs in the settlement (and could be further as we are in active development stage)

[03-Aug-19 01:05 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Good. Going very well then. Can we definitely say that coins Locked in Credit Loops have definitely much more staking power than other activated/locked coins?


[03-Aug-19 01:07 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
That was question 1. Question 2: Would you suggest the staking power of LCL Coins  to be more than 3x in real chain?


[05-Aug-19 01:28 PM] dimxy#2587
Actually  my test chain is not very stable in sense of staking. I  believe this is segid problems which to be solved yet


[05-Aug-19 01:32 PM] dimxy#2587
About the question2 I think we could set any multiplier (which I believe depends on what business requires) as long as stacking in the marmara chain works okay


[06-Aug-19 10:49 AM] dimxy#2587
I'm rethinking about issues with staking.
Actually my 3-node marmara chain is stalling. This shows itself as blocks are generated with long delays and there are messages in log:
```640 seconds until elegible, waiting. 
600 seconds until elegible, waiting.
...```
(That is, more than 10 min waiting for an utxo.)
Our other developers suggested that this is because not enough utxos for staking.
Indeed, in non-marmara chains we usually use utxo splitting on 64 addresses (this is about normal coins of course).
In our marmara chain we have not yet implemented such splitting for activated coins, and I'm thinking why we need this.
As I understand JL correctly, in large marmara chains we would not need splitting as there will be many user addresses and segids will be filled up naturally.
In fact this splitting on 64 segids is needed for small chains, while we do not have many addresses yet.
So I am implementing this splitting of activated coins for small test chains to run stable 
(And we should understand it would affect rewards generation: of course, split activated coins will have much more advantage over non-split lock-in-loop coins). 

Seems, this feature will be used also in the production chain on its early stage to make it stable.
And it should be some transition period until enough addresses appear on chain because the initially split coins would affect new users' activated and lock-in-loop coins rewards. 
(That is, the initially split coins should be taken off as enough other addresses are on the chain)

ok i waiting.


[08-Aug-19 12:53 PM] dimxy#2587
I'm still working on the splitting (but close to finish)
And I had to improve the marmara stake transaction opreturn structure (so we would need to start a new chain)


[08-Aug-19 02:04 PM] Paro#7842
hmm ok i waitin u


[08-Aug-19 11:20 PM] dimxy#2587
I believe staking works much better with the new command marmaralock64 splitting activated coins on the segids.
The update is in in my repo.

this marmaralock64 is used only for initial marmarachain start, to fill in all 64 segids, until many user addresses appear


[09-Aug-19 01:06 AM] dimxy#2587
so it's okay to use low amounts just for PoS to be able to work


[09-Aug-19 01:06 AM] dimxy#2587
if all the segids are not covered with addresses with utxos, the PoS could be unstable


[09-Aug-19 01:07 AM] dimxy#2587
so it is temp solution to make the chain stable

My own chain was stalling for 10-20 mins until I made this marmaralock64, because staking protocol  could not find staking utxo for the lack of addresses on 64 segids (there was only 1 address then)

Create activated coins and split them on 64 segids for staking to work

Run marmaralock64 command with coins amount you want to reserve for stake. You do not need to have big amount even for production network as this is needed only for initial chain running while number of users is small and not all segids are covered by user addresses.


[09-Aug-19 01:43 AM] Paro#7842
ok i understand.


[09-Aug-19 01:43 AM] Paro#7842
"first node" & "second node" apply to these only.


[09-Aug-19 01:47 AM] dimxy#2587
I believe you have:
first and second nodes - generate coins
3 test nodes for issuer endorser and holder, do not generate coins.

So I think you could make the first node staking (setgenerate true 0) - and here marmaralock64 is needed
the second node mining (setgenerate true 1)


[09-Aug-19 01:48 AM] Paro#7842
yes. Now I have implemented the "first node" marmaralock64 command.


[09-Aug-19 01:48 AM] Paro#7842

@Paro I have published a new version in the repo.
It has a few fixes: 
marmaracreditloop output corrected for settled loops
introduced a new open/close marker in issuetx (so it has 2 markers now: 1 marker to find all loops, 2 marker to indicate the loop is closed)
Important that this version changes the stake tx structure since block height = 2000 on MCL0 chain. We need to deploy this version before ht=2000 (or we need to change height=2000 in the code if the deployment is delayed)

Dear @dimxy and @Paro  I really appreciate developing and testing patiently. I hope everything is going smoothly. The 3x boosted staking for “Locked in Loop” took a lot of time to develop and test but I think it is worth since it is the key to success in MCL to promote credit loops for zero defaulting.

@Paro How is the test for 3x boosted staking going? @dimxy


[08-Sep-19 11:12 AM] dimxy#2587
I believe the boosted staking works but I think we did not verify it mathematically. It is not easy because of segids: to make the chain stable we split activated coins on 64 segids. So if we usually create only one loop for test its boosted coins would be staked rarely (as most of staking would be coming on the activated coins that are split on 64 segids). 
I think we might develop some not very complicated rpc which would enumerate PoS generated coins and output some statistics on them, like if this is activated or boosted staking, which address, total amount. Then we probably could see overall staking results.
Probably we would need to create loops for some specified time (to get enough statistic data) and allow to set a period for the getting statistic for the rpc.
I think it might need at least 1000 PoS blocks generated (with boosted utxo in the chain) to see the expected results as all 64 segid utxos will be used for staking and we will need to wait for many blocks to see that the single boosted utxo have been picked for staking at least several times.

@dimxy We need to wait 1000 blocks. is it correct ?


[12-Sep-19 02:37 AM] Paro#7842
Guess you need 5 PoS miner. (64segid reserved)


[12-Sep-19 02:38 AM] dimxy#2587
I suggested to collect enough statistics to see how boosted work we need to create a loop that would span around 1000 blocks or similar to ensure the boosted coins were picked at least several times for staking


[12-Sep-19 02:40 AM] Paro#7842
hmm .. now understand.


[12-Sep-19 02:41 AM] Paro#7842
ok .. test new version. new chain .. min "credit loop" time :1000


[15-Sep-19 12:09 PM] dimxy#2587
Hello,
I have created a new rpc ```marmaraposstat begin-height end-height``` that returns PoS statistics: stake addresses and how much coins were generated for each of them. It is also shown if an address is boosted and how many stake txns were generated for it.
-----
Also I found and fixed a bug with normal coinbase scriptpubkey generation.
------
So I suggest the following way to research boosted coins usage:
- update all nodes with the new version from my repo
- create a long credit loop (for 5000 blocks). The loop amount should be approximately equal to the amount of activated coins on each segid. Do not add any new endorsers to the loop, just wait.
- note the height where this loop was created
Now for boosted coins a stake multiplier of 100x is set in the code.
When enough blocks are passed we can run marmaraposstat  from the height where the loop was created till the chain tip and look into the stat.
If the algo works correct we would see in the marmaraposstat output that for the boosted address there are more stake tx and coins generated than for other non-boosted addresses

[15-Sep-19 12:51 PM] dimxy#2587
(I have started a similar loop on my test chain, so in 10-20 hours I can share the stat results)


[16-Sep-19 03:16 AM] Paro#7842
@dimxy I'll do the new chain setup. then I'll do the test "5000"


[16-Sep-19 03:17 AM] Paro#7842
"marmaraposstat begin-height end-height" where will we use this parameter?


[16-Sep-19 03:19 AM] dimxy#2587
yes this is better
I have added yet another change in the code:
I now temporarily send all the generated coinbase to normal address (not to activated for even blocks as the requirement doc states)
If not to do this mypubkey address (where generated coins go to) quickly becomes the champion in staking


[16-Sep-19 03:19 AM] dimxy#2587
I'm testing this right now


[16-Sep-19 03:19 AM] dimxy#2587
I'll write you a message when the fix is okay

@Paro I updated code in my repo (https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/tree/marmara-v1-1-opret-v2), fixed some issues with staking for boosted coins.
I recommend starting a new chain to check boosted coins PoS generation.

for a new chain, to see how boosted coins generate blocks, make sure that all the segids have equal utxo values, for example make them with command 'marmaralock64 640 1', this will create 64 segids with one utxo in each of 10 coins.
Then make a loop also for 10 coins and for 5000 blocks till it matures.
Then you might periodically call `marmaraposstat 0 0` to see what address generated most of the blocks.
You may find the lock-in-loop address in marmaraposstat output with 'IsBoosted: true' tag.

(Note that I temporarily disable activated coinbases generation for even block for they do not contaminate PoS staking)

[17-Sep-19 04:29 AM] dimxy#2587
Actually for boosted coins PoS preference is done very simply: its value just multiplies by 100x (for test, actual will be 3x)
so 10 boosted coins will be accounted as 1000 coins in staking in this should be always the winner if all other segids utxos have only 10 coins

@jl777c how do you learn hashpower.

Does it have a parameter?

We see hashpower on explorer screens. There must be a function for that.

@dimxy What do you mean by “Locked in Loops coins are created only when a loop is created”? I thought current coins could only be locked into LCL and not created. Do you mean some of new block rewards come out as LCL coins and not activated coins?


[20-Sep-19 12:09 AM] dimxy#2587
No, I mean what it was supposed, that is, activated coins which are converted to locked-in-loop coins when a loop participant enters the loop

yes you need to use marmaralock64 for a new chain 
it is critical for a PoS chain to run marmaralock64 on PoS nodes for staking to work

this issuance tx could be the old version tx (I changed once tx structure to provide that any miner could settle). Could you paste output of getrawtransaction with 2 params txid and 1, like
`komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL.. getrawtransaction debb1648321e95106f78d157a6ceefddd359d670eca453e439ca071ad271b099 1`

Is everything okay with the latest test? What does 'Total Staking' column mean?


[14-Oct-19 02:33 AM] dimxy#2587
I have fixed the problem when issuance txid is not removed after the settlement in marmarainfo (the update is in the repo)


[14-Oct-19 07:30 AM] Paro#7842
coin produced by each node " total staking" .


[14-Oct-19 08:52 AM] dimxy#2587
So all the nodes produced approximately equal amount of coins, and there is no multiplication for boosted coins (as PK1 and PK2 should have had 8000 boosted coins each and PK3 only 10649 activated coins)?


[14-Oct-19 11:12 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Yes it seems so. There should be much less in PK3.


[14-Oct-19 11:12 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Maybe we need to wait for longer.


[14-Oct-19 01:54 PM] Paro#7842
ALL nodes began to "staking" at the same time.


[14-Oct-19 01:56 PM] Paro#7842
In the real process "PK3" will then enter "loop"


[14-Oct-19 01:56 PM] Paro#7842
it produces little in the "loop" that subsequently enters.


[15-Oct-19 01:30 AM] dimxy#2587
Actually I was not able yet to achieve this effect (more blocks generation for boosted coins) on my several test chains. 
I asked our test lab for help, they will be able to test in several days.
Alternatively we can just multiply coinbase value for boosted coins


[15-Oct-19 09:04 AM] Paro#7842
if you ask me. The system is currently working well.


[26-Oct-19 03:57 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
The holder should never be able to produce more or even same/similar amount of coin when compared to the issuer and other endersers who have more locked-in-loop coins. That is the case in one example. I think we need to test for longer terms such as 1 month.

I am very busy at the moment and I could not follow pegs and gateway. But as far as I understand it might solve a common problem that are happenning with post-dated cheques use. I think @jl777c will give idea since he knows very well how post-dated cheques work in Turkey. 

The problem is this. Suppose you have a post-dated cheque from someone with a long redemption date say 1.1.2021. I am holder of cheque now. I cannot wait until that date and I cannot sell it for goods. Can I exchange it for KMD, VRSC, BTC etc? What happens at the moment in Turkey? The person goes to a bank and sells it for cheaper price. Actually bank becomes holder. They call it breaking a cheque. But in reality, the cheque, i.e. the credit loop is not broken. A bank becomes holder, i.e. waits until the redemption date. It is simply using another asset/coin instead of GOODS. Can we do that with pegs and gateways? @Paro may share the case as a picture since I cannot upload the picture.

[03-Nov-19 07:24 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@Paro any idea on how you might do that with pegs and gateways?


[03-Nov-19 07:24 PM] Paro#7842
@B. Gültekin Çetiner example 

receive Post-dated Cheques
``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCLTEST marmarareceive pkendorser batontxid 55 KMD "kmd-walletaddress"```
accept endorser 
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCLTEST marmaratransfer pkholder batontxid```
in this way, "Post-dated Cheques" will be passed to a new endorser.
In order to get the check, the person needs to have a KMD coin.
I still haven't made plans about how KMD or other coins will be formed.
I guess it needs to be multi-wallet.
In this way, "Post-dated Cheques" can be swap safely and conveniently.
on foot with this thought. can be developed in different ways.


[03-Nov-19 07:26 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
So he buys the post-dated cheque for 55 KMD?


[03-Nov-19 07:27 PM] Paro#7842
yes. 55 KMD example. hypothesis


[03-Nov-19 07:27 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Instead of providing goods?


[03-Nov-19 07:28 PM] Paro#7842
Yes you pay 55 KMD (sample) instead of giving the goods. I get "Post-date Checks" worth 55 KMD


[03-Nov-19 07:29 PM] Paro#7842
varies according to the agreement between the buyer and seller.


[03-Nov-19 07:30 PM] Paro#7842
or pegs - automatic with gateways.


[03-Nov-19 07:30 PM] Paro#7842
but it is very difficult to do this automatically with pegs-gateways.


[03-Nov-19 07:32 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
So you transfer the cheque to the person giving an aggreed amount. The person becomes holder. You get 55 KMD. Does it need pegs and gateways? @jl777c may give idea.


[03-Nov-19 07:35 PM] Paro#7842
"latch gateways" play the main role.

Voucher worth opening on sale. when the other party accepts it. KMD (sample) is paid automatically.


[03-Nov-19 07:35 PM] Paro#7842
Idea for buying-selling "pegs and gateways".


[03-Nov-19 07:36 PM] Paro#7842
improved. or replaceable.


[04-Nov-19 12:13 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is done manually, this can of course be done, the KMD just being the "goods"

final loop test
```PK1 : 8700 MCL (3x staking)

[04-Nov-19 11:43 AM] dimxy#2587
I could not achieve the required results in my tests for coin generation for activated and boosted:
My test conditions were to create activated coins evenly on 64 segids and lock the same amount for a long loop. The multiplier was set to 100x. So I had the even amount of activated and boosted coins and big multiplier for test results to be easy to interpret.
Then I waited for 10K blocks and checked number of blocks generated in each segid (there is a getlastsegidstakes rpc to get PoS block count in segids). I hoped the boosted coins would generate much more blocks but it seemed the generated block number was the same on all segids (so seems the multiplier or the way how I applied it did not provide the expected staking effect).
I asked kmdlabs for help with this.
We might repeat a similar test on your chain providing very accurate test start conditions to have test results easy verifiable and observe the whole picture of PoS (maybe I did something wrong or misinterpreted the test results)


[04-Nov-19 11:53 AM] Paro#7842
To me the latest tests are successful.


[04-Nov-19 11:53 AM] Paro#7842
as requested. produces more than normal "staking" mode.


[04-Nov-19 11:54 AM] Paro#7842

[04-Nov-19 11:54 AM] Paro#7842
issuer and endorser 1 start at the same time.


[04-Nov-19 11:55 AM] Paro#7842
endorser 2, endorser 3, endorser 4.
it is not clear when they will start ..


[04-Nov-19 11:55 AM] Paro#7842
if you ask me. 3x successful.


[04-Nov-19 11:56 AM] Paro#7842
There are things I wonder.

Will the system always work as 64segid?


[04-Nov-19 11:58 AM] Paro#7842
In addition, why isn't "staking mode" shared "earned coins" ?


[04-Nov-19 11:59 AM] Paro#7842
staking mode  system earned coins
%50 normal
%50 activated


[04-Nov-19 12:00 PM] Paro#7842
Anyway 3x successful.


[04-Nov-19 12:00 PM] Paro#7842
There is only one problem. We need to do a mass-test.!


[04-Nov-19 12:00 PM] Paro#7842
that's all we don't do.


[04-Nov-19 12:10 PM] dimxy#2587
PoS enumerates 64 segid and looks for utxo for staking. On large chains where there are many addresses they will be present in each segid naturally.
For our test chains we need to generate addresses for all segids to provide PoS to work correctly (otherwise it could be stalling)
I temporarily have turned off generation of activated coins (in coinbase) in order to they do not contaminate the initial test conditions (so the initial number of utxo would persist throughout the whole test) - so we can observe how many PoS block are generated with the multiplier and without it.
Mass load tests are required I totally support this!


[04-Nov-19 12:11 PM] Paro#7842
It is difficult to reach a clear result without mass-testing.


[04-Nov-19 12:11 PM] Paro#7842
in my opinion "3x stretching" was successful.


[04-Nov-19 11:18 PM] dimxy#2587
@Paro fixed 'incorrect issuerpk output' in marmaracreditloop (the update is in my repo)


[05-Nov-19 03:54 AM] Paro#7842
ok ty. rebuild all node ?


[05-Nov-19 10:22 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
If activated coins are disabled, how do you test 3x for LCL staking against activated staking? Or do you only mean the block rewards which are 50 percent coming out as activated rewards?


[05-Nov-19 10:56 AM] dimxy#2587
Yes I disabled 50% rewards generation of activated coin so generated activated coins would not affect staking. Only the initially activated coins in 64 segids and LCL coins in one segid remain throughout the whole test (and after the end of the test we can calculate PoS blocks in each segid)

[05-Nov-19 07:46 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Good Engineering practice.


[05-Nov-19 07:49 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I think 3x staking is working. @Paro ‘s last tests seem to be ok. The ones in LCL should be compared with outsiders who have only activated coins. He would make some more tests.

@Paro I added one more check (it never existed earlier): now marmaraissue checks that the request tx has the passed receiver pubkey in tx normal inputs. This will better secure the baton transfer (it can go only to the node which issued marmarareceive). The repo updated

if a baton moves away from this PK myCCbalance will decrement

is trying to develop tipbot. He had premined 2 million but it seems 8 million. I don't know if the chain is the same he worked.
http://explorer.marmara.io/address/RRttymc5rfBXfBngr3Waa6Pu458fvyamAS
It says it received 8 million and it was only in block 304 at that time. @dimxy
Could that transaction be produced during staking? I know from Verus Coin. During staking reward, the wallet sends some amount. But this is too much, more than wallet balance. Hpw does it happen?

Can anyone send 3D printable stl files related to other projects in Komodo ecosystem such as Komodo, Verus, Pirate etc? We have Marmara Innovative Solutions (MINS) lab. They produce 3D printers. They told that they would print free 3D printed logos to distribute during Marmara Workshop.

I believe there will be much more once the chain starts. We are planning of distributing 1 million premined with credit loops.


[15-Dec-19 05:17 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Odoo is an Open Source ERP system with more than 4 million users globally and very suitable for all SMEs while it is easily scalable to large organisations.  Odoo needs to be customized in Turkey especially in accordance with financial regulations. 

We can develop trust based features in Marmara Version 2 by merging Odoo ERP with Marmara Credit Loops. When considering the users of post-dated Cheques as being mostly SME businessmen, Marmara has a good chance of penetrating into ERP market in Turkey by having a good addon/module integrating trust based features of Marmara with ERP systems. Therefore, we established “Odoo Turkey” Discord group. We invite you there, I think it will have huge effect if Komodo is involved/integrated in ERP business. Btw, before entering into Odoo, we had a thorough research for selection of best Open Source ERP system at a large institution to start with and Odoo was the best among many alternatives. 

We invite Odoo and/or Komodo Developers who can help in integration of Marmara Chain with Odoo.

Can we use boosted staking idea in Marmara for Energy production systems? Let us call it WattCoin. Suppose you have solar panel, Wind Turbine etc to produce Energy. We will measure Energy production in a device and use that as a metric for staking. Rewarding somehow will be mostly based on Energy production. Similar to Marmara, we can have 25% mining and 75% staking based on boosted staking with hardware connection to smart Energy devices. There are smart devices for measuring the Watt power from electric production units. If we can connect that to staking then we can solve problem. The coins representing Watt power can be transferred within credit Loops same as in MCL. I can transfer you some WattCoins with a post-dated value as Watt credits. We need electronic Engineers knowledgeable in Komodo blockchain to be involved in the process.


[10-Jan-20 11:11 PM] jl777c#5810
there would need to be an internet accessible API that all nodes that access to read the results of each miner. if that is possible, then make a DTO and create coins based on the results

We just remind that the credit loops work best within economy when you buy and sell goods. Please learn how post-dated cheques work. Learn first how to manage credit loop within a short maturity date (say 15 minutes) and with small numbers (1 MCL). Please remember that the system has 75% staking and 3x staking when activating in credit loops. Credit loop starters and endorsers are notaries in the system.

@everyone The beauty of Marmara Credit Loops (MCL) is this: $MCL is not only cash alternative on an online ecommerce site. But it may be used as a real alternative to credit cards and post-dated cheques. This is a challenging idea for Odoo developers. You just add Marmara Chain into an ecommerce site and you get credit card functionality without Master or Visa.

@everyone We are planning 2 workshops in April-May. The payments will be only by $MCL. The number per workshop is limited to 4 pairs. You and your partner can join together and pay only for one. Credit Loops are accepted. After workshop, you take the 3D Printer that you build. The workshop takes 2 days. It is available either as Turkish or English. You can also sponsor someone. 

P.S. Please specify your best available time and hurry since we have very limited offer.

@everyone I wish a healthy life to Komodo Community members and the humanity.

My old friend from New Zealand sent me something about protecting yourself from Corona Virus. Let me translate it.

Let me tell you a story leaked from the Chinese, they would recommend pure vitamin C to help prevent the outbreak in Italy. They say that tablet C vitamins sold in pharmacies are damaged by other chemicals in contact with air. So I went to a natural care clinic 10 years ago, they recommended me to take Ascorbic Acid (vitamin C), which was sold in white powder, because I had pain in my arm, I have been drinking two large glasses of filtered water in the mornings for a long time. I mix 4 teaspoons of this powdered ascorbic acid, I drink it by pouring water, I have not had a disease called flu for the last 10 years. Here, family doctors encourage people to get flu vaccines, especially for the elderly, for free, I have never received these vaccines, I do not. Now if I tweet this news, there may be no ascorbic acid in the market as we have seen in Cologne...

We have almost 4 seasons in Turkey in proper periods. And during winter, most of the food comes very rich in Vitamin C such as lemons, oranges, spinach etc. You can get Vitamin C naturally from these winter food.

Wish you a healthy life!

P.S. This research article also supports my friend. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/9012058_Vitamin_C_and_SARS_coronavirus

Marmara Credit Loops (MCL) 

To the contrary belief, banks are not the sole institutions for creating money based on credit. In many countries all over the world, like banks, individuals are able to create money through post-dated cheques or promissory notes in a decentralized manner.

Inspired by the paper-based blockchain nature of these promissory notes and post-dated cheques’ circulation, in the same analogy, Marmara Credit Loops Project aims to digitalize the blockchain while solving the problem of nonredemption of these tools. 

The early release of this Project, named as Version 1, solves the problem of non-redemption with 100% collateralization through trustless blockchain mechanism. 

The second version of the Project aims to solve the nonredemption problem based on a trust based blockchain system with the aid of a protective layered architecture of nodes in credit loop layer formed against defaulting.

We had written this paper after @jl777c had the initial coding himself as MVP and we had made the tests among 100 engineering students last year in May.

@everyone  ``marmaraunlock``, i.e. the sister of ``marmaralock`` is coming to Marmara Credit Loops

I am happy to inform that we are bringing ``marmaraunlock`` into life on consensus level. That will need a hard fork at a certain height. Thanks to @dimxy, the core developer of MCL. He has finished the coding for ``marmaraunlock`` and we are testing it. We tried to make marmaraunlock before the hardfork height. The error message was just fine as below.
``./komodo-cli -ac_name=MCL marmaraunlock 1
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "unlocking not available yet"
}
`` 
We will share the result after the hard fork height in test chain  is reached.

By ``marmaraunlock`` we will be getting rid of artificial credit loops in order people to take out activated coins. You will be able disactivate/unlock your active/locked coins with ``marmaraunlock``

***Dear Marmara Credit Loops (MCL) Community,***
We have good news. We have finished the tests for the new consensus changes. We will be able to hardfork at the same time with Komodo NN hard fork. The community needs to update to the new Version. 

**What are the major changes in Credit Loops?**
As you know, Marmara Credit Loops were designed to be used in real economy with a market place worthing currently more than total crypto market with a size of post-dated cheques alone and in Turkey (please check for other countries). Here are the new consensus rules to boost MCL in real economy.
**1. The holders, i.e. the bearers of credits can benefit from 3x staking without locking any single coin in a loop. That means providers of goods and services will earn when they are selling.

2. There will be no coin locks and cuts from endorsers during a credit loop.

3. Endorsers will not get any reward from 3x staking.

4. İssuers and holders will be able to do 3x staking throughout life cycle of a loop.

5. The old credit loops will work normally as before and get settled when they mature. However, you cannot transfer them.

6. ``marmaraunlock`` function will allow to unlock your activated funds without the need of creating an articial loop**


[10-Jun-20 03:20 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
@everyone 
*Marmara v.1.0.2 Hardfork*

Change log

- "marmaraunlock" was added. No need to create credit loops to open/unlock activated coins.
- No cut off and locking for endorsers
- Endorsers cannot make 3x staking.
- Both issuer and holder can make 3x staking throughout credit Loop life cycle. Holder needs no locking for 3x staking.
- Old loops will continue 3x staking until settlement but cannot get transferred.

Marmara Credit Loops, MCL is a DeFi system designed to run in real economy. We use the power of  Komodo as an independent chain. You don't need to buy a single coin to earn with 3x staking. Do you want to learn how? You can read this document. In this small document, you can learn how to create a credit loop.

**BIKE ECONOMY (RIDE ECONOMY)**
On Today's TV Show, Our guest is Mr. Murat Suyabatmaz, the president of Bike Association (Bisikletliler Derneği in Turkey) with tens of thousands of members. 

We will talk first time about the Ride Coin project which is based on the idea of credit loop based staking with Investment Pools on Marmara Chain. You can earn Ride coins which can be exchanged directly with MCL. Ride coins can be earned while you are riding your bike without setting up Marmara blockchain. It makes mining and staking invisible to bike riders. If you are a bike rider, you can join in movement. 

**BİSİKLET EKONOMİSİ**
Bugünkü TV Şovunda konuğumuz, onbinlerce üyesi bulunan Türkiye Bisiklet Derneği Başkanı Murat Suyabatmaz.

Marmara Zinciri üzerinde Yatırım Havuzları ile kredi döngüsü temelli stake etme fikrine dayanan Ride Coin projesinden ilk kez bahsedeceğiz. Doğrudan MCL ile takas edilebilen Ride jetonları kazanabilirsiniz. Ride jetonları, Marmara blok zincirini anlamadan ve kurmadan bisikletinizi sürerken kazanılabilir. Madenciliği ve stakingi bisiklet sürücüleri için görünmez kılıyor. Bisiklet sürücüsüyseniz, harekete katılabilirsiniz.

Many thanks to Komodo CTO @ca333  for interview. The Marmara community can understand now more why we preferred Komodo technologies over other blockchains to solve complex business requirements/problems in case of credit loops. We suggest all communities to consider Komodo.

This video is in Turkish. We will prepare soon a video in English. 
It explains the new GUI #marmara-connector where the main aim is to make ordinary people to setup Marmara Chain easily and conduct all necessary functions for creating and circulating credit loops and of course, staking $MCL. You can prepare shorter and much better materials.

Bu video Türkçedir. İngilizcesi yakında hazırlanacak. #marmara-connector-türkçe ana amacı sokaktaki insanların kolayca Marmara Blokzinciri kurmasını, vadeli çeklere benzer kredi döngüleri yapmasını ve tabi MCL üretmesini sağlamak. Marmara Connector ile ne kadar kolay olduğunu göreceksiniz.

You can make solo mining or staking. It is 25% PoW and 75% PoS. If you learn credit loops, you can have 3x staking. Mining is very low. For active staking, it is 1x. You can lock and unlock anytime. For staking, the coins either should be activated/locked in 1x or locked in credit loops.

One of the millennia generations has explained MCL as they understand it.. Many Thanks.
** You can grasp the MCL best when you use it in real shopping. So what is MCL? Why should we shop with MCL instead of shopping with USD? After reading the story below, replace every place you see USD with MCL and read it again.

Bob, who wants to buy a new phone, takes the path of the seller, Alice. The phone he likes is $ 1000 and he goes to the cash register to buy it. Bob will be able to pay in two ways. With the first option, he can pay $1000 in advance. In the second option, Alice tells Bob that he can pay with a 6-month credit loop. According to this system, $1000 will be locked in a reward pool between Bob and the Alice. After 6 months, $1000 will be transferred to Alice. Alice says that as long as $1000 is locked between them, both of them can generate USD from this pool.

When Bob realizes that he can pay $1000 and generate over $1000 for 6 months, he happily wants to pay with the second method and buys the phone with a 6-month credit loop.

Later Alice remembers that she had to pay her supplier of $ 1000 for a few electronic items. But Bob is the only customer who has come to his shop for a long time and there is no money left in the cash register. Remembering that the credits in the credit loop can be transferred, Alice transfers/endorses the $1000 credit in the loop to the supplier. The credit loop is no longer between Bob and the Alice, but between Bob and the supplier. Now, the supplier can generate money over $1000 with Bob.

So why do we shop with MCL, not USD? Have we ever been able to generate USD from anything we bought with USD? No. MCL makes it possible for you to generate MCL both while receiving and making payments. In this system, both the buyer and the seller earn rewards. It also allows you to shop using the credit loops of a previous purchase, even if you don't have any MCLs in your pocket. **


[23-Mar-21 08:16 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Does that mean MCL isn’t pegged to any currency per se, and that pricing will fluctuate quite a bit in regards to MCL as it seems 6 months is over 100% inflation? How does it work if you don’t mind explaining :komodopog:

[24-Mar-21 01:01 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
We are trying to peg it to goods and services. But we are not at a stage yet to put enough of goods backing. Currently it seems to be pegged partially to Komodo prices on AtomicDEX. My assumption is that it will be balanced somehow with the prices of goods and services. It will first reflect the local prices since majority of selling happens in Turkey. With @jl777c, We had discussed the fluctuation for the first year. I think the inflation rate and fluctuation is normal for first year since it is difficult to adopt first years due to lack of easy to use tools. We have Marmara Connector to make loops easily but it runs on Linux. The majority of people use Windows. Now @Aklix and @ryilmaz in the team are working on Marmara Connector for Windows version. But of course, later we definitely need mobile version since postdated cheques happen on fly. We need to conduct credit loops with mobile. It is a longterm project. We are still in an early stage.

Would be happy to talk.


[24-Mar-21 01:07 PM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
I corrected the naming. When the credit is transferred, the 3x staking happens between Bob and supplier since Alice makes the transfer.

Would using a credit loop in a gambling backgammon game work for small amounts? @B. Gültekin Çetiner ?


[24-Mar-21 09:39 PM] Mylo#8306
Is it illegal to gamble on backgammon in Turkey or is it culturally acceptable?


[24-Mar-21 09:40 PM] Mylo#8306
I like backgammon. I like to have a small bet. I enjoy the delights of being human sometimes 😁

If there is supportive group for this endeavour, I would be interested in using the tech


[25-Mar-21 08:53 AM] B. Gültekin Çetiner#0626
Backgammon is very common in cafes in Turkey and played for just fun but not for gambling. However, the looser will pay for the tea. Of course, not only for himself and the opponent. He pays for all watchers who are watching them during the game. 🙂

If people wish, they can shop with cryptocurrency if they wish with mussels. The central bank does not have any power to make laws over people. It is a semiprivate independent company. The decision may affect only the dependent institutions under the control of central bank. The payment gateways may be affected. Funny thing is that there is no impact on central exchanges. People were using some gateways to send/receive to CEXes. Those gateways will not be able to operate now. But banks may be used to send/receive to CEXes. 

MCL targets the end users who are producers and consumers without need of an official financial body. Central Bank decisions will create an informal economy which is good for cryrocurrencies in general and for MCL in specific and of course for decentralization.

We are happy that the amount of MCL coins locked in credit loops exceeded the coins locked in activated after exactly 16 months. The beauty of the coins locked in credit loops is that they can be only used in real shopping to transfer the ownership since the participation to 3x staking is transferred to new bearer/holder node during endorsement of credit.

**INTERNATIONAL ROSCA DAYS**
We will start international ROSCA days soon to start to learn the power of Credit Loops. I hope that **these ROSCAs will also promote business on international level.**

Every two weeks, you need  1000 MCL as Credit to send to the group member in queue. In one case, you will make credit loop request to all other members.

**RULES**
1. A ROSCA group is constructed first with 10 members at maximum.
2.  A draw is made to decide the order. 
3. Each person in accordance with the draw makes a Credit Loop request worth to 1000 MCL with 6 months maturity from each person getting 9000 in total. If you are first in the group, you will have a total of 9000 MCL as credit loops immediately.
4. You can simply circulate/endorse a previous credit in a loop. 
5. Since this is also a learning activity, the transactions can happen only as Credit loop.
6. We will have private dm group on Discord for each ROSCA group.

**You can just click in the channel link below  if you want to join**

This is how ROSCAs work in Turkey. Originally, the women in Turkey started the ROSCA days as GOLD days. The idea is used in many businesses from housing to buying cars without any need of credits from banks. https://yabangee.com/gold-day-recipes-delicious-eats-for-a-day-of-socializing-and-giving-gold/

Gold Day Recipes: Delicious Eats for a Day of Socializing and Givin...
There are so many fun aspects of a gold day, but my favorite is by far the food. I polled my friends and put together a list of the top five gold day recipes (for an optimum gold day menu, you should prepare at least five different dishes). You can use these when preparing to host Turkish guests, or for your own impromptu gold day. Afiyet olsun!
