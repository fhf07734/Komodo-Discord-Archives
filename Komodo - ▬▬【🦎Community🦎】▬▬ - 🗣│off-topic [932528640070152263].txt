I wonder dose anybody know what a news paper is?That films are not real? That anybody can act? That everybody acts every day of their entire lives? That Julian Assange rots in jail guilty of nothing, no charges, no conviction, no truth but not in the evil empires of China or Russia, only in the free UK by the free USA? Political science, just like any other science, wrong until proved right or right until proved wrong. No Politics is a good measure today, entertained to death anyway, all the best and good luck.

Maybe not cli lol


[30-Jan-22 07:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
everything except my feelings on the core ideology of what komodo was when I came and should continue to be


[30-Jan-22 07:59 AM] Exile13#4458
Ideas don't die


[30-Jan-22 07:59 AM] Exile13#4458
The American idea still exists


[30-Jan-22 07:59 AM] Exile13#4458
It's just the execution of the idea..


[30-Jan-22 07:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
they do when you set fire to them and destroy every fiber of their existence


[30-Jan-22 07:59 AM] Exile13#4458

Things physically must change, no?


[30-Jan-22 08:01 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I honestly don't know that it's possible to see what I mean without having been around in the Slack days 🤷🏽‍♂️


[30-Jan-22 08:01 AM] Exile13#4458
Be happy that a team is still around, when I started at thc there was 2 people there


[30-Jan-22 08:02 AM] Exile13#4458
Imagine you and smk were all that's left on kmd


[30-Jan-22 08:03 AM] Exile13#4458
Would your ideas still be valuable?


[30-Jan-22 08:03 AM] Exile13#4458
Somethings valued when it's used


[30-Jan-22 08:03 AM] Exile13#4458
And sometimes we can only ascribe this value


[30-Jan-22 08:05 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Don't confuse that I may or may not like the new thing with my feeling that the new thing shouldn't be called the old thing
My "problem" isn't the end result, in and of itself, but rather that it fundamentally changes the nature of the thing so much so that there are no remnants of the thing that brought me here.
I stand to gain no less than a small fortune from the new thing, but that doesn't mean that I don't prefer the ideology of the original thing


[30-Jan-22 08:06 AM] Exile13#4458
Can CC be made comparable to EVM in your opinion


[30-Jan-22 08:06 AM] Exile13#4458
Regardless of current team size


[30-Jan-22 08:07 AM] Exile13#4458
What if I gave you 400 smart devs


[30-Jan-22 08:08 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
take the unclaimed rewards issue, for example:
every $1 taken from dmitry's mining is a $1 better *for me* in my pocket
that doesn't change the fact that I believe *he earned that $1* and should keep it


[30-Jan-22 08:08 AM] Exile13#4458
Fek incentives


[30-Jan-22 08:08 AM] Exile13#4458
Gimme steak


[30-Jan-22 08:08 AM] Exile13#4458

[30-Jan-22 08:08 AM] Exile13#4458
C'mon


[30-Jan-22 08:09 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
see, that's where people get twisted
ideology vs "what's in it for me"
😦


[30-Jan-22 08:09 AM] Exile13#4458
☝️


[30-Jan-22 08:10 AM] Exile13#4458
Is this not answerable?


[30-Jan-22 08:10 AM] Exile13#4458
Did I phrase it incorrectly


[30-Jan-22 08:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'd actually have to look deeper in the concept of EVM to answer
but, my now answer is:
> Why do we care? If we convert Komodo into a pseudo-Ethereum then what's the "special" thing about Komodo vs Ethereum? An apple isn't different than an orange just because it's a better orange, it's an apple and *not* an orange.


[30-Jan-22 08:13 AM] Exile13#4458
It's the usability


[30-Jan-22 08:13 AM] Exile13#4458
We create tech to make our lives simpler


[30-Jan-22 08:13 AM] Exile13#4458
Some enjoy building


[30-Jan-22 08:14 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
fundamentally changing the entirety of a thing so that *part* of the thing can function like some competitor's thing is still fundamentally changing the entirety of the thing


[30-Jan-22 08:14 AM] Exile13#4458
Not all need to know how the sun works to receive its benefits


[30-Jan-22 08:15 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
true but we lose all the benefits of it being a star if we stop it from being a star and turn it into an asteroid


[30-Jan-22 08:16 AM] Exile13#4458
I don't think we could turn kmd into a plummeting rock


[30-Jan-22 08:17 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
let me put it this way:
What good is THC as THC if you scrap all notion of tracking hemp and make it all about competing with LUMBER for tracking wood?


[30-Jan-22 08:17 AM] Exile13#4458
You will be able to track many things with HempTRAC


[30-Jan-22 08:17 AM] Exile13#4458
The thing about making devices, is that you don't get to decide what they are used for


[30-Jan-22 08:18 AM] Exile13#4458
You can try, but forcing is fascism


[30-Jan-22 08:18 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the name "HempTRAC" loses all meaning when you make it specifically *not* about hemp and take all hemp stuff out of it


[30-Jan-22 08:19 AM] Exile13#4458
Is a rose still a rose regardless of moniker?


[30-Jan-22 08:19 AM] Exile13#4458
Do you have a btc tattoo?  Lol


[30-Jan-22 08:19 AM] Exile13#4458
:troll_thuglife:


[30-Jan-22 08:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, a rose sandwich still tastes like roses if you call it a "dog shit sandwich" but that doesn't mean I want to buy a "dog shit sandwich"


[30-Jan-22 08:20 AM] Exile13#4458
👍


[30-Jan-22 08:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I barely have BTC, much less a tat of it 😛

[30-Jan-22 08:20 AM] Exile13#4458
It would be great if the lumber industry used HempTRAC


[30-Jan-22 08:21 AM] Exile13#4458
Bet it would bring more awareness


[30-Jan-22 08:21 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
iirc there used to be a `lumber` asset chain for that


[30-Jan-22 08:21 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, that was my point for the example

{Reactions}
🤣 

[30-Jan-22 08:22 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
changing the thing's purpose to make it like another existing thing

I should still have a wallet in my archive with a ton of those worthless coins... You win some, you loose some...


[30-Jan-22 08:22 AM] Exile13#4458
Lol why was kmd created at all then


[30-Jan-22 08:22 AM] Exile13#4458
Others already existed


[30-Jan-22 08:23 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
to be a currency and a platform to create other coins/currencies


[30-Jan-22 08:23 AM] Exile13#4458
Which is exactly what it's doing


[30-Jan-22 08:23 AM] Exile13#4458
It must adapt to survive


[30-Jan-22 08:25 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
but none with the unique ease of process and concept
> It must adapt to survive
by destroying its unique ease of process and concept, thus making it just another thing in a line of carbon copy things


[30-Jan-22 08:25 AM] Exile13#4458
Bro. Learning to code is not ease


[30-Jan-22 08:25 AM] Exile13#4458
Not for the majority


[30-Jan-22 08:26 AM] Exile13#4458
Took me 10hrs to get a nspv server up


[30-Jan-22 08:26 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Let me flip it around this way:
If Komodo becomes a thing chasing Ethereum to be like Ethereum, then why do I not just want Ethereum?


[30-Jan-22 08:26 AM] Exile13#4458
Didn't kmd fork from zec?


[30-Jan-22 08:26 AM] Exile13#4458
Why don't I want zec?


[30-Jan-22 08:27 AM] Exile13#4458
I can't tell you what to want


[30-Jan-22 08:27 AM] Exile13#4458
That's not the reason why we make things


[30-Jan-22 08:27 AM] Exile13#4458
We make things to be used


[30-Jan-22 08:27 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
to make it different from zcash, not to follow the path of zcash


[30-Jan-22 08:27 AM] Exile13#4458
Exactly


[30-Jan-22 08:28 AM] Exile13#4458
There's no possibility that kmd can be eth or Anything like


[30-Jan-22 08:28 AM] Exile13#4458
We bridge to ETH, fek


[30-Jan-22 08:28 AM] Exile13#4458
Does eth do this?


[30-Jan-22 08:28 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
but, this isn't that
this isn't "we want a unique thing"
this is the *opposite* of that
this is "we want to be exactly like *that* thing"


[30-Jan-22 08:29 AM] Exile13#4458
No


[30-Jan-22 08:29 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes


[30-Jan-22 08:29 AM] Exile13#4458
We like their capabilities


[30-Jan-22 08:29 AM] Exile13#4458
So we take a dance move


[30-Jan-22 08:30 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
that's the dex project
I'm talking komodo (the project)


[30-Jan-22 08:30 AM] Exile13#4458
Right which is just one of the things that is unique


[30-Jan-22 08:30 AM] Exile13#4458
Also Dpow


[30-Jan-22 08:32 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Question: why would you like to see EVM functionality on Komodo?


[30-Jan-22 08:32 AM] Exile13#4458
Stablecoin


[30-Jan-22 08:32 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
bear in mind, everything (work wise) that got me to stay was bdex, so this isn't "I hate the dex" or anything like that
I'm talking about the core fundamentals of what got me to want to care about komodo as a thing
it's hard to not intertwine the projects, I know


[30-Jan-22 08:33 AM] Exile13#4458
I understand


[30-Jan-22 08:33 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
iirc there was some kind of stablecoin CC (or plans for it)


[30-Jan-22 08:33 AM] Exile13#4458
Was?


[30-Jan-22 08:33 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
No. Why?
> Stablecoin
Why?


[30-Jan-22 08:33 AM] Exile13#4458
This is my question... what's up with cc?


[30-Jan-22 08:33 AM] Exile13#4458
Can it be dev'd to be compatible with web3


[30-Jan-22 08:34 AM] Exile13#4458
Because NDA


[30-Jan-22 08:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
If we want to change CC, that's a different topic than changing the core of komodo itself and everything about it


[30-Jan-22 08:35 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
CC is a small part of a larger whole


[30-Jan-22 08:35 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
To quote Grewal: komodo tech is in CC PoC state....
In other words: it's proven to be possible, but not developed into a market...


[30-Jan-22 08:35 AM] Exile13#4458
Proof of concept


[30-Jan-22 08:35 AM] Exile13#4458
So it needs battery testing?


[30-Jan-22 08:36 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Bear in mind: I janked that quote out of context. It does not apply to all tech...


[30-Jan-22 08:36 AM] Exile13#4458
How many devs do we need


[30-Jan-22 08:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
CC didn't even start until after komodo was a thing
CC was adapted to the thing
not the other way round
and certainly not changing everything about the thing to make CC the thing


[30-Jan-22 08:38 AM] Exile13#4458
Whatever the words or functions are, what does kmd need, how many people and time are needed to dev out what the community is asking for? Web3 interaction so it's easy to use the things we make?


[30-Jan-22 08:39 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'll never disagree with adding things/functions
my issue is changing the core of the thing so that the **whole** thing is an entirely different thing


[30-Jan-22 08:40 AM] Exile13#4458
So you don't know? I've asked twice, just for your opinion on this.


[30-Jan-22 08:40 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
of the proposed things in #general, what of komodo actually remains if all are adopted?


[30-Jan-22 08:40 AM] Exile13#4458
I figured you would have a good idea


[30-Jan-22 08:40 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I do, and the answer is:
"nothing"


[30-Jan-22 08:41 AM] Exile13#4458
So nothing is needed


[30-Jan-22 08:41 AM] Exile13#4458
Kmd doesn't need any changes or updates

Growing up in a Metaverse
This metaverse meme video is about wojak who grows old in a metaverse. From the moment he is still a child and has his first school day, he already lives through his vr glasses. His school is in the metaverse, as well as his friends. Years later, he starts doubting about how “normal” living meta actually is. Didn’t people maybe have a better lif...

It may happen that you're not strong enough to do it. 🤷‍♀️

One might argue that if I am unprepared to do so then the singular government you seem to advocate for failed in training me to do so and as a whole is only useful in protecting its citizenry based on its ability to instill fear in others due to specific weaponry which can destroy the totality of humanity
🤷🏽‍♂️

tl;dr:
If I can't physically take shit from someone who spends as much time on the internet as you do then nukes are all that hold this country together

flying cars that anybody can buy = craziness of course and possible mass murder possibilities, but at the same time, it equates to the destruction of the borders that divide our countries.

They want the pipelines too.  NATO/Russia both want to supply gas to Europe and Ukraine has a lot of pipes

🤫 you're not supposed to know that the last 50 years of war was over gas/oil


[04-Mar-22 08:51 AM] JimD#9272
the way you fight Russia is to lower the price of gas to where their oil wells become unprofitable


[04-Mar-22 08:51 AM] JimD#9272
that was the cornerstone of Reagans strategy to defeat the USSR

History is history, and likely as muddy as the info we have fed into our eyes 24/7 in the modern age. It's not excuses, but it can offer insights to contributing causes. 
One thing I never understood is how RU was an ally that took massive damage helping defeat the Nazis in WW2 but rarely gets a mention in our books, and then somehow ended up how it is today.
It's far from perfect, but so are we, and sadly actions since 9/11 have slowly but surely eroded much of the moral high ground we once held. This high ground used to come in useful.
Those most damaged are never the ones making the decisions or talking tough on TV / internet.

Russia don't get recognition for ww2 in the west mainly because there were no different then nazis, Katyn massacre, Holodomor, Gulags etc... Sure they helped, to finish Nazis off, but also brought as much suffering or even more than them. Strangest part is that most of the suffering were done by their own ppl.

"War Pigs"

Generals gathered in their masses
Just like witches at black masses
Evil minds that plot destruction
Sorcerers of death's construction
In the fields the bodies burning
As the war machine keeps turning
Death and hatred to mankind
Poisoning their brainwashed minds
Oh lord yeah!

It's a shot in the foot. Inside the country, these cards will work, but there will be no more trust in the system. Russia has its own payment system "MIR" and Unionpay will be used for external purchases.


[06-Mar-22 12:36 AM] SadykovT#2123
It is also a signal to other countries that they can be disconnected from the service at any time.


[06-Mar-22 02:16 AM] Jupiter&Mars#3880
It doesn't seem to be a shot in the foot because it will not hurt western countries but at the same time it makes impossible for Russians to use their Visa or Mastercard abroad. 
You are right - it is a clear message to other dictators: do not invade other countries & do not bombard their cities & do not kill women and children.  If you do so, you will be punished.

btw, a real shot in the foot is destroying one's own country economy in just 10 days.

The Russians are always to blame by default, only other Countries are allowed to bomb Syria, Libya, Iraq, Yugoslavia with impunity.

Every country that is invading another is to blame for their crimes.
BTW, In Syria Russia is also doing their job.

I'm not happy that ordinary Russians that do not support this war will suffer just because one guy decided to start the killing.

Imagine that you, your wife and kids are just being bombarded. Do not be heartless. Maybe you will stop telling that it is about politics.


[06-Mar-22 03:44 AM] SadykovT#2123
War is not the choice of ordinary citizens. And it hurts me very much to see those killed on both sides.

Sorry, I couldn't resist 🤷

Last thing: there's no symmetry in this war - Russian cities are not being bombarded, Russian children and women are not being killed and the only Russians killed in this war are Russian troops sent to Ukraine.


[06-Mar-22 04:35 AM] SadykovT#2123
but what about Donbass ? it has been shelled for 8 years, after the coup d'etat in Ukraine. Or are their children and women not important to you ?  let's stop it. if you have something to say, write to me in private messages.

It's not a rocket science: one country invaded another (weaker & smaller) and started the killing. 
As I already said `Every country that is invading another is to blame for their crimes.`

Are you saying that the situation in the self-proclaimed “Donetsk Republic” and “Luhansk Republic" are the reason to start a full-fledged war against Ukraine? btw, Donetsk and Luhansk are really small regions in eastern Ukraine.
