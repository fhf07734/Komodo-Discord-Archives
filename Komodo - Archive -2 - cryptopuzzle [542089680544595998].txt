So ... 7 digits in each block ...


[04-Feb-19 04:48 PM] Decker#3767

Like literally reversed? Or the numbers in reverse order?


[05-Feb-19 03:21 AM] ca333#0333
i sent the riddle creator a message yesterday cuz i suspected a more visual approach in solving the riddle. i hope its okay to post this since i wont have time to test this out:

[05-Feb-19 03:22 AM] ca333#0333
so i too suspect that you have to "properly" revert the phi sequence of the 2nd chain in order to crack it


[05-Feb-19 03:22 AM] ca333#0333
plz ping me if this is it


[05-Feb-19 03:33 AM] cryptocal4#9465
hmm that's a lot clearer, thanks.


[05-Feb-19 03:34 AM] cryptocal4#9465
however I tried the reversing and got nothing. I'm sure there's something small I've missed, or a mistake I've made somewhere


[05-Feb-19 03:35 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Oh wait...


[05-Feb-19 03:35 AM] cryptocal4#9465
brb 🤔


[05-Feb-19 03:50 AM] cryptocal4#9465
I thought maybe we take the fibonacci sequence, break it into 7 blocks of 7 letters, with the φ between each, then reverse it.


[05-Feb-19 03:50 AM] cryptocal4#9465
`1567618φ1448527φ9517890φ1677333φ2441985φ5431231φ8532110`


[05-Feb-19 03:50 AM] cryptocal4#9465
But that didn't work


[05-Feb-19 03:52 AM] cryptocal4#9465
So 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 etc split into 7x7 blocks, then reversed


[05-Feb-19 05:19 AM] Decker#3767
May be i have some "translation misunderstanding", but the meaning of phrase "in the name given to the blockchains" is fade away for me.


[05-Feb-19 05:20 AM] Decker#3767
If that means reverse order of digits in each 7-digits block - i'm already tried it. Nothing.

Still too many variants ... )


[05-Feb-19 05:28 AM] Decker#3767
@sφldat hint that each block should be connected with φ symbol is still actual? i tried φ between each block and / or only at the ends of chain ... nothing ...


[05-Feb-19 05:29 AM] Decker#3767
how may φ symbols should be in passphrase? 2, 12, 14? if not possible - don't answer ... just want to say that i tried all possible variants )

6 links 6 φ
The first φ-link (related to the picture) is a point.

Now you need to find the operation to do, stay simple https://gyazo.com/9f68c051fd1b8227ba48fa5081374a6f

still feeling myself - dumb ... ok ... let's explain each φ-link is something like a mirror ... 

it this case we can have something like:

I suspect @sφldat is telling us to think more simple


[05-Feb-19 05:52 AM] cryptocal4#9465
`"The first φ-link (related to the picture) is a point."` ?? It IS a point?


[05-Feb-19 05:52 AM] Decker#3767
first φ-link i think is a place where first "mystery operation" is applied.


[05-Feb-19 05:53 AM] cryptocal4#9465
But then it would not be 6 links?


[05-Feb-19 05:54 AM] Decker#3767
b1φb2φb3φb4φb5φb6φb7 = 6 links ...

**Wen Moon Puzzle**

Wen Moon was a chinese McDonald's manager. After hard work week he got drunk ... ) And sent last 0.5 DEX from his wallet to this address https://dex.kmdexplorer.io/address/RKvq6XqCU7TwKjqkGYzbDL6cBgnhJQqo2u and forget about it. But in 2045, when 1 DEX = 500 BTC he remember about it and start trying to recover his funds ... The only one thing that he remember about "sent day" was that this is end of week and he was very drunk ))

however he is "chineese", not chinese. Is this a clue? Or a typo hahaha

Some conditions in puzzle description is important to solve, some not )

Additionally, seems he was very drunk ... https://supernet.kmdexplorer.io/address/RKvq6XqCU7TwKjqkGYzbDL6cBgnhJQqo2u ... bcz he sent not only DEX on this address )

[05-Feb-19 07:33 AM] cryptocal4#9465
"The only one thing that he remember about "sent day" was that this is end of week and he was very drunk" - that's two things, not one. Could another hint.

`"Monday is the first day of the week according to the international standard ISO 8601, but in the US, Canada, and Japan it's counted as the second day of the week." Not sure about China.`

Levels...the article references the word "levels" 2 times -
- high-level traders
- level playing field


[06-Feb-19 11:11 AM] cryptocal4#9465
@ca333 If the prize is increasing each week, does it mean we'll need more clues before it can be cracked?


[06-Feb-19 11:11 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Or is it possible to solve it with just the article and clue 1?


[06-Feb-19 11:13 AM] ca333#0333
all info needed is in the article - i estimate that a few hints will be necessary. However, it is not entirely impossible to solve it without clue from my end.
keep in mind what the first hint says.

First hint is too random ... "2 levels" can mean everything ... something in article we should look at ... or just a passphrase derivation method ... like passphrase = F(F(passphrase)) 😃 First we need to understand where is a "start point" )

Ok, let's start ) Good luck, all! )

Already tried some basic and crazy things ) I.e. each word from the article is not passphrase itself ) Some crazy guesses with time periods `10-60` seconds ... also seems wrong start point )


[06-Feb-19 12:04 PM] Decker#3767
Don't want to calc number of points or circles on the deCRED picture, bcz it should be Komodo and BarterDEX related )


[06-Feb-19 12:08 PM] Decker#3767
2 levels can also be related to "client-server architecture", but i don't know how to apply it into passphrase ) So ... currently more questions than answers ... and millions of guesses )

@Decker Are you thinking it could be something like:
`seed = SHA256 (salt value + secret password)`?

May be we should do something with Decred proposal hex string `5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a` ... )


[06-Feb-19 05:14 PM] Decker#3767
It's in article and looks very attractively to use it in puzzle ...


[07-Feb-19 12:40 AM] cryptocal4#9465
It's the master key we need to find now


[07-Feb-19 01:01 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Do you believe the final seed will be a 64 character SHA256 string?


[07-Feb-19 01:03 AM] cryptocal4#9465
I have been encrypting the Decred proposal hex string and trying things like 'DEX', 'official proposal for its own Decentralized Exchange' for the key, but again it's too vague.


[07-Feb-19 01:10 AM] cryptocal4#9465
I'm thinking that whatever value we get from applying SHA256, we then need to apply it again? So encrypt the encrypted 64 character string? Maybe that's too complicated. KISS?

I will just say it was easy and not at the same time. Cause anyone could have get the first level without any skillset but at the same time there were many possibilities.


[07-Feb-19 04:42 AM] Strob#3417
I got it in like 2 tries so that's why I can't believe I got it so fast.

I could enter it in agama by hitting only 3 keystroke on my keyboard. 😉

oh ! private key with only 3 caracters ?

So level one is required to find level 2 ?


[07-Feb-19 04:48 AM] Strob#3417
I didn't say 3 characters, 3 keystroke


[07-Feb-19 04:49 AM] Strob#3417
I guess I have to convert level 1 with some mathematical process to get level 2...

keystroke - "a single depression of a key on a keyboard."

So it was that easy, take the most important info in the text, copy and paste it in agama as a seed and you could get level 1.

Let's think like the creator...What info would I use to further encrypt level 1?


[07-Feb-19 05:43 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Or maybe it's another string of text we need to append to "Komodo is ahead of Decred"

a random password 😂


[07-Feb-19 05:44 AM] cryptocal4#9465

This is in levels. So we have to use something from level one.  Maybe the pub address or a part of the txo

`"Komodo is ahead of Decred in terms of DEX development, but it also takes a more integrated approach to working with larger centralized exchanges. This means while BarterDEX may offer more liquidity and choice as its partnerships come through, it isn’t a DEX that addresses issues around coin listing prices and potentially unfair advantages for high-level traders."`

`“By doing pseudorandom order matching in epochs — say every 10-60 seconds — it puts everyone on a much more level playing field with respect to latency. The person using satellite internet in Siberia can't be taken advantage of by traders with a fiber link at the nearest interchange point, allowing buyers and sellers to transact without the opportunity for day traders to front-run their orders.”`

I doubt it would be an epoch time for Siberia. How would we know the time zone for where the article was published?


[07-Feb-19 08:21 AM] Decker#3767
May be it's something related to level 1 tx:

`103b4cb0a5eb1650c24dde5a58fa1e85b842ef18ed4c5b4409733a2d6707fa70` - private key of address of level 1 tx in hex.
`befb1a8a5b4582852ab4f044b2c20a47f6aa8d89f46f717d5608dfb4634023c2` - level 1 txid ...

@Decker yes I thought about using the private key and even public key of the first level and concatenate it with level one phrase in many ways. It didn't work. didn't try the tix though.


[07-Feb-19 08:44 AM] Decker#3767
Also, article date in unixtimestamp is `1549278000` ...


[07-Feb-19 08:48 AM] cryptocal4#9465
@Decker I've tried that epoch timestamp - on it's own, with the text, hashed by SHA256 in every combination. Nothing so far.


[07-Feb-19 08:49 AM] Decker#3767
I think it should be more obvious / clear than just random combining something with something and SHA256 of it ...


[07-Feb-19 08:50 AM] linuxcaptain#2335
I think we need a hint.. When hint sir?😛


[07-Feb-19 08:50 AM] Decker#3767
I'm also tried various things ... even XORing level 1 txid with decred proposal in hex ))

befb1a8a5b4582852ab4f044b2c20a47f6aa8d89f46f717d5608dfb4634023c2 is ahead of 5431da8ff4eda8cdbf8f4f2e08566ffa573464b97ef6d6bae78e749f27800d3a ))


[07-Feb-19 08:57 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Or it could be something more simple like converting the phrase into some format, or getting another string of text from the second paragraph.


[07-Feb-19 08:58 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Anything you can think of doing with "By doing pseudorandom order matching in epochs — say every 10-60 seconds"?


[07-Feb-19 09:02 AM] Decker#3767
level 1 - can mean article itself
level 2 - other document, followed by link in article ...


[07-Feb-19 09:02 AM] Decker#3767
just an other idea.


[07-Feb-19 09:03 AM] Strob#3417
I thought about the link as a second level too 😉 went there and found nothing


[07-Feb-19 09:22 AM] Strob#3417
Or select the text in the article, right-click: inspect source...


[07-Feb-19 09:24 AM] cryptocal4#9465
I don't think they would have access to edit the HTML directly on Forbes. I'd say the CMS is locked down pretty tight to prevent any custom markup.


[07-Feb-19 09:31 AM] Strob#3417
I think it's really a passphrase derivation method. We need to pass "Komodo is ahead of Decred" through all derivation, translation, conversion we can think of.

{Reactions}
🎣 

[07-Feb-19 10:52 AM] cryptocal4#9465
I think @Decker may be right...level 1 transaction was created before level 2 transaction, which suggests something in level 1 transaction is required to access level 2.


[07-Feb-19 11:46 AM] Strob#3417
But I don't think so cause when he gave the hint for level 1 he gave the address. So that would have allow anyone to go to level 2 without solving level 1 which no master of puzzles would do!


[07-Feb-19 11:47 AM] Strob#3417
unless it's related to the private key


[07-Feb-19 11:47 AM] Strob#3417
I wonder why the amount in level 1 was 3.33 and not 7.77....

I improoved my article "analysis script" ) Now i can state that any sequential group of words from the article != passphrase for level 2 ) On test with level 1 - script successfully found "Komodo is ahead of Decred" passphrase. But for level 2 seems it's not there )


[07-Feb-19 12:49 PM] Decker#3767
How it works? For example we have sentense "Traders always have custody of their funds. " ... It tries:
```
1. Traders always have custody of their funds. 
2.Traders always
3. Traders always have
4.  Traders always have custody
5. Traders always have custody of
...
n: always
n+1: always have
n+2: always have custody
...```


[07-Feb-19 12:52 PM] Decker#3767
btw ... we have 2 txes on puzzle address:

2. 062030a17e04f87513fba4a86a1e84942e137133e8e0e0a1e827264ec29846dc - 0.77777777 KMD

correct question - is someone able to find level 2 passphrase without any knowledge of level 1 ...

I think that possible ways for level 2 :

2. something with hashes (proposal hash, txid hash, hash of "Komodo is ahead of Decred", etc.)

@cryptocal4 The center of the logo I thought about that too. And I played a lot with ca333 = Kadan Stadelmann (realizing that he is the one interviewed in the article! I would be surprised if he called himself "the soul of Komdo" though... I read many interviews and article learning more about Komodo in the process and found absolutel6y no mention of the word "soul" anywhere.


[08-Feb-19 05:04 AM] Strob#3417
@mazyar_lp | alphasharks Now I am starting to doubt that level 2 is in the article. ca333 said all the info is in the article, but it could be that the info was only level 1 and level 2 must be extrapolated from level 1 in some way.


[08-Feb-19 05:04 AM] cryptocal4#9465
There is the mention of "spirit" in the article though

What hashing methods should we consider?
- SHA256
- PBKDF2 (though it requires iteration and key length to be set)
- MD5 (not secure enough?)
- SHA1 (again not secure enough?)

But, even this "soul" is a big question now )


[08-Feb-19 06:41 PM] Decker#3767
Just want to remember what we have:

1. "level1" - something from level1, could be anything, like txid of level1, blockhash of level1, or just "Komodo is ahead of Decred" string.
2. "soul" of komodo ... - can be soul of Komodo ))
3. F - unknown hash function with unknown arguments ... 

So, we can act as:

1. F(level1+soul)
2. F(soul+level1)
3. F(level1)+soul
4. level1+F(soul)
5. soul+F(level1)
6. F(soul)+level1
...
and many different ways )


[08-Feb-19 06:42 PM] Decker#3767
And other thing ... if we guess that something from level1 is a txid `befb1a8a5b4582852ab4f044b2c20a47f6aa8d89f46f717d5608dfb4634023c2` don't forget that we can hash it as string itself "befb1a8a5b4582852ab4f044b2c20a47f6aa8d89f46f717d5608dfb4634023c2" (64 symbols) or binary data {0xbe, 0xfb ... } (32 symbols) ...

@mazyar_lp | alphasharks Well yes he said that but remember what he said for previous puzzle? like "yes - it can be solved just by looking on picture + first hint (brain/heart)." about the sudoku but in fact we needed to also know that we must use Agama and that we must paste the answer on 2 lines to take advantage of the bug in Agama.... There was no way I could have guess that without a hint. So that was not entirely true. So later he may come up with a hint to something we are still missing.


[09-Feb-19 04:12 AM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
Totally agreed


[09-Feb-19 04:51 AM] cryptocal4#9465
I'd like to know if it's only one level of hashing/encryption required. Do we need to hash a value to get the Salt, then use SHA256 to get a final hashed value?


[09-Feb-19 05:07 AM] cryptocal4#9465
The salt could be the level 1 address or tx


[09-Feb-19 05:07 AM] cryptocal4#9465
and the text required for SHA256 is the "soul"


[09-Feb-19 05:08 AM] cryptocal4#9465
I really hope the final seed is a SHA256 value 😑


[09-Feb-19 07:14 AM] Strob#3417
Yes I tried level 1 sentence as salt and soul as hashed text and vice versa, but none of my "soul" seems to be right. I even tried "soul" itself! lol


[09-Feb-19 07:16 AM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
Something is missing. Without hint someone could accidentally find the right pass


[09-Feb-19 07:35 AM] Strob#3417
We need to know what is the soul (and it could be almost anything, anyone and even an animal) we need to know how to enter it and where and we need to know how to enter level 1 phrase how and where too. and since we need hashing we need to know what to hash and how. So too many unknown so far leading me to think that ca333 want this to last a few weeks so hype can build up a bit with more 777 kmd added to the pot each week. 😉


[09-Feb-19 07:38 AM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
I think the opposite. They dont want the prize to be increased. They can make other puzzles for kmd promotion

Hi. Do someone know how to generate the KMD private key from passphrase? I try the passphrase of level 1 in the paperwallet generator of Komodo and I got the correct private key only if I check the "iguana compatible" option. What  does this option do on the encryption process?

@Gam_B1t : https://github.com/ca333/swingtokenGUI/blob/master/src/java/com/vaklinov/zcashui/SeedImportDialog.java#L211

this is the WIF derivation procedure from a seed/passphrase.

this java code contains all you need. if you have any issues/question just ping me again. @jl777c explained/teached it to me (on a cryptographic level) back in the day via some good C code. it is a core feature of the iguana protocol (= software layer that all our technologies are based on: komodo, dpow, jumblr, barterDEX, etc.) in https://github.com/jl777/supernet for those who are curious.

Bcz it can be person, or programming language, or algo (equihash), or hash type (blake2b) as well ...

according to modern science our brain stores the info which makes us unique as a human. it gives us a unique character, personality, etc. etc. etc. so actually - cant the brain be what basically represents our soul?


[10-Feb-19 11:07 AM] cryptocal4#9465

Now i'm preparing a file with hashes to hash almost everything from article ... let's see ...


[10-Feb-19 11:28 AM] Decker#3767
Bcz hashing of the most obvious things - seems gives nothing.


[10-Feb-19 12:12 PM] Strob#3417
@ca333 would be cool if you could put some KMD is solution that close to the answer, that way we could know if we are close! (and post the addresses too)


[10-Feb-19 12:15 PM] Strob#3417
what bugs me now is the "hashing something is involved". Cause it could be any hashing method, we could enter the hash as passphrase or WIF, combined with level 1 or has of level 1, we hash level 1 or the soul? Too many possibilities. And since I tried all the most obvious ones I think, it means it's not a obvious one!


[10-Feb-19 12:18 PM] Strob#3417
Also "http://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/address/R9JwschmLT3H6RpeiJ8QsEkfurBSY1AWd3 … - this is level 1. You can reach it by using the most important piece of info from the article."


[10-Feb-19 12:19 PM] Strob#3417
That could mean that the address itself is level 1 (the sentence "Komodo is ahead of Decred" was used to reach level 1 but was not level 1 itself...), or maybe the txid or the balance 3,33. What element of "level 1" do we need to use to get to level 2?


[10-Feb-19 12:22 PM] cryptocal4#9465
or "level I"


[10-Feb-19 12:25 PM] Strob#3417
level 1 is maybe exactly :"http://kmd.explorer.dexstats.info/address/R9JwschmLT3H6RpeiJ8QsEkfurBSY1AWd3"


[10-Feb-19 12:25 PM] Strob#3417
the whole address with http included, that would be literally what he wrote

What is the website you use in your capture @Strob ?


[10-Feb-19 12:35 PM] Decker#3767
In PHP you can simple use something like this `hash("sha256",$something)` to obtain SHA256 hash.


[10-Feb-19 12:36 PM] Decker#3767
And this `hash_hmac('sha256', $something, $salt)` for  HMAC SHA256 ...

sha256 of course ...

{Reactions}
💯 

[10-Feb-19 12:48 PM] Decker#3767
But as i'm noticed above it can be:

1. sha256(level1+soul)
2. sha256(soul+level1)
3. sha256(level1)+soul
4. level1+sha256(soul)
5. soul+sha256(level1)
6. sha256(soul)+level1
...
and many different ways )


[10-Feb-19 12:49 PM] Decker#3767
and we should be clever and fast to correctly guess what is `level1` )


[10-Feb-19 12:52 PM] Strob#3417
I think I pretty much tried all those combionations...


[10-Feb-19 12:59 PM] Decker#3767
also don't forget that we can reverse hashes and ... may be it's double sha256 as in bitcoin )


[10-Feb-19 01:13 PM] Decker#3767
Literally it should be something like:

SHA256("Komodo is ahead of Decred") + "jl777" = `143b4cb0a5eb1650c24dde5a58fa1e85b842ef18ed4c5b4409733a2d6707fa70jl777` .., but it's not correct )


[10-Feb-19 01:18 PM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
Yeah i tried them too


[10-Feb-19 01:18 PM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
The combination because of amount of prize is the key factor


[10-Feb-19 01:19 PM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
Otherwise it would be easy


[10-Feb-19 01:19 PM] Decker#3767
I am tested 1000 of variants (without any jokes) ... sha256 as string, sha256d (double hashing), sha256 as binary ...


[10-Feb-19 01:20 PM] Decker#3767
adding soul at end ... added soul before hashing ...


[10-Feb-19 01:20 PM] Decker#3767
still no luck )


[10-Feb-19 01:21 PM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
I have tried too. These puzzles are good but these random things are frustrating


[10-Feb-19 01:22 PM] Decker#3767
777 KMD is a good prize anyway to play "guess the random" )


[10-Feb-19 01:24 PM] Decker#3767
btw ... nobody said us "combine with the soul" ... it's more like "don't forget about soul" ... and this makes thing different.


[10-Feb-19 01:24 PM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
Yeah i thought about that too


[10-Feb-19 01:25 PM] Decker#3767
the length of passphrase will be a good hint )


[10-Feb-19 01:26 PM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
You know what too much hints make the puzzle bad . I think this much hint is good enough


[10-Feb-19 01:29 PM] Decker#3767
I'm always knew that is SHA256 ) even without last hint )


[10-Feb-19 01:30 PM] Decker#3767
will be very strange to use some other as hash func )


[10-Feb-19 01:31 PM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
it is only reasonable hash i think .or it is bitcoin hash

Yes, but that feature of WIF is hidden within settings. Even if it was visible within the Settings tab, but it's within Settings > Export Keys and then it doesn't show it until you enter the seed.

we tried to create something that teaches the KMD technology. if we are very precise then you actually wouldnt really need Agama - you should have used it - yes, and we wish/want you to use it... because we want to educate you on everything blockchain related and also KMD related (KMD software, etc.) 
But what i am saying is - all it takes was some very basic crypto-knowledge. (privkey derivations from seed, sha256, etc.). And I ve posted the essential detail here: https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/542089680544595998/544125519084650507

@Decker Does Agama allow for foreign characters in the seed? Like chinese symbols?

Or can you hint if there are or not in the seed/WIF? My mind will now forever over-think puzzles like this 😂

Wen Moon Puzzle

Wen Moon was a chinese McDonald's manager. After hard work week he got drunk ... ) 


And sent last 0.5 DEX from his wallet to this address https://dex.kmdexplorer.io/address/RKvq6XqCU7TwKjqkGYzbDL6cBgnhJQqo2u 
and forget about it. 

But in 2045, when 1 DEX = 500 BTC he remember about it and start trying to recover his funds ... 

The only one thing that he remember about "sent day" was that this is end of week and he was very drunk ))
Help Wen Moon became rich again )))

And I will give a very important trick for those puzzles: instead of using Agama I used the paper wallet Brain Wallet tab and Wallet details tab. with those it goes faster to try stuff instead of starting Agama at each try.

To test a passphrase, enter it in Brain Wallet with Iguana compatible ticked and if it's a wif enter it in Wallet Details. But Agama gives a different result if you paste a string on 2 lines.

But i didn't check it last time, so, i don't know if deposits / withdrawals are open or not.

In barterdex we can exchange it? Do you have tutorials?


[11-Feb-19 09:54 AM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486

Tnx anyway for the puzzle

I have few ideas for easy puzzles and one for hard puzzle ) But all need some preparations.


[11-Feb-19 10:46 AM] Decker#3767
I want my puzzles to be interesting and solveable in "one way" ... without random guesses, like "use capital letters or not", "use \n or not", etc )

For your puzzle @Decker, I tried with his address as a passphrase, stuff you could do while really drunk! And so the Wen Moon on twitter is that you?


[11-Feb-19 11:43 AM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
@Decker yeah your puzzles too . Your type of puzzles without random things are perfect


[12-Feb-19 02:26 AM] cryptocal4#9465
I'll see if I can get time to create one in the next few days. We can fit it in between the other ones.

i think i m on the right path @cryptocal4 .  Because i think you had a motive to create this puzzle. you want the people who are trying to solve this puzzle to increase their knowledge in something. to learn ... But i ll wait for the next clue before i tell what i m thinking.

@KomodoPlatform Clue 4: What is "strong" in the article?
Twitter


[15-Feb-19 04:49 AM] cryptocal4#9465
I don't want to give away too much, but I also don't want you to be frustrated 🤕 
The solution is comprised of 3 steps - 
Step 1: Get value(s)
Step 2: Convert value(s)
Step 3: Encrypt value(s)
I'll post this on twitter shortly, but you guys/gals can have a head-start with this.


[15-Feb-19 04:50 AM] cryptocal4#9465
The first clue contains everything you need for Step 1 and 2. Step 3 you should be familiar with by now 😉


[15-Feb-19 04:50 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Ok now it's easy. I'll expect it to be solved within the next 12 hours haha


[15-Feb-19 04:52 AM] cryptocal4#9465
If no one solved it then I will create an address to solve step 1 solution, so you know you are on the right path. But I don't think it is needed.

Hi cryptocal! I just grabbed some pop corn and read the article. But in this "Tech tuesday" update, there are 4 articles, not only one.  First about blockchain game, second about DEX public alpha testing, 3rd about Komodo reqward on ledger and 4th about GIN KMD DPOW. should we consider only the first article about gaming?


[15-Feb-19 08:27 AM] LeFevre#5755
hmm Convert Values :PeepoThink:    Understand encrypt values

convert it to something

then sha256 it i spose


[15-Feb-19 08:41 AM] LeFevre#5755
if we suppose to interpret "strong" as bold


[15-Feb-19 08:42 AM] Strob#3417
exactly what I tried


[15-Feb-19 08:43 AM] Strob#3417
Just missing the byzantine part....


[15-Feb-19 08:43 AM] LeFevre#5755
ya, not 100% sure what "convert" means


[15-Feb-19 08:43 AM] LeFevre#5755
in this situation


[15-Feb-19 08:43 AM] Strob#3417
related to Byzantine generals?


[15-Feb-19 08:43 AM] LeFevre#5755
encrypt I would go with sha256


[15-Feb-19 08:44 AM] LeFevre#5755
byzantine fault tolerance, which leads to dPoW

[15-Feb-19 08:45 AM] LeFevre#5755
🤷


[15-Feb-19 08:51 AM] LeFevre#5755
guess for step 2, we need to do something with this byzantine/dPoW(?)   hint


[15-Feb-19 08:51 AM] Strob#3417
So what should we convert the pillars to? Addresses, WIF, anything else?


[15-Feb-19 08:51 AM] Strob#3417
Morse code?


[15-Feb-19 08:52 AM] LeFevre#5755
would be weird if we had to make a wallet


[15-Feb-19 08:52 AM] LeFevre#5755
get the wif


[15-Feb-19 08:52 AM] LeFevre#5755
sha256 it


[15-Feb-19 08:52 AM] Strob#3417
I did that but did not work. I got the address and wif for all titles, put them together with and without spaces to convert them to sha256 and it did not work.


[15-Feb-19 08:53 AM] Strob#3417
I tried removing one of them , the second, the thrid the forth and so on, like if one is a traitor, but it was not that either


[15-Feb-19 08:54 AM] Strob#3417
So i will wwait for next clue!

hehe


[15-Feb-19 08:54 AM] LeFevre#5755
ya, think the step 2: convert might be a hang up


[15-Feb-19 08:54 AM] LeFevre#5755
atm


[15-Feb-19 08:55 AM] LeFevre#5755
assume the byzantine hint is trying to help us with that part


[15-Feb-19 09:29 AM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
If the pillars was answer ,he should just mentioned pillars


[15-Feb-19 10:03 AM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
What is strong in the article?? Besides the headings


[15-Feb-19 10:04 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Why do you think the headings are strong??


[15-Feb-19 10:05 AM] cryptocal4#9465

@cryptocal4  "Why do you think the headings are strong??" Because they use a stronger font!

[15-Feb-19 11:23 AM] LeFevre#5755
I would say he is going with the html

and if its not the <strong>


[15-Feb-19 11:23 AM] LeFevre#5755
thats a rough hint


[15-Feb-19 11:24 AM] LeFevre#5755
`Clue 1: Each pillar separates an army of strong Byzantines.`     Each header separates an army of <strong> complicated ideas


[15-Feb-19 11:24 AM] LeFevre#5755

Heach headings, so each title separates an army of strong Byzantines.....


[15-Feb-19 11:25 AM] LeFevre#5755
but only one header is <strong></strong>

yea, so I dont want to use the headers


[15-Feb-19 11:28 AM] LeFevre#5755
I want to use all the other things that are strong

the other "bold" lines are not actually <strong>.  So...idk


[15-Feb-19 11:32 AM] LeFevre#5755
hmmph


[15-Feb-19 11:38 AM] Strob#3417
So strong Byzantines means strong alphabet letters (roman alphabet)


[15-Feb-19 11:39 AM] Strob#3417
Now what do we need to do with those strong Byzantines cause entering them as a passphrase doesn't seem to open the first address


[15-Feb-19 11:40 AM] LeFevre#5755
sounds like the level 1 should be plaintext for the wallet

guess the next move would be that "strong" does not imply <strong>


[15-Feb-19 02:18 PM] LeFevre#5755
and possibly just the "most important sentence" per header piece

[15-Feb-19 03:02 PM] Strob#3417
I wonder if the strong means it has to have the strong tag in html or can it also be everything that is in bold type?


[15-Feb-19 03:05 PM] LeFevre#5755
my first assumption was only the strong tag


[15-Feb-19 03:05 PM] LeFevre#5755
but I havent gotten anything to work


[15-Feb-19 03:05 PM] LeFevre#5755
so, not sure


[16-Feb-19 12:09 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Where there is no strong, the value is empty/null/non-existent

Clue 5: Count the strong army that remains. Where there are no strong they simply don't exist.

I'm crying because puzzle is not solveable without hints. No one able to guess that he should:
1. Divide article into headers / pillars.
2. Find in each fragment from [1] <strong></strong>
3. Count "army" in each strong ) What is the army, number of capital letters or number of words with capital letters? 
It's crazy task )


[16-Feb-19 01:39 AM] Decker#3767
And, for example, this it's a header ... but it's strong too ))

And this looks like "strong army", but may be it's weak ))) bcz it's using <b> instead of <strong> ))

Too much time need for spare and end of day you realize one hint is missing

Seriously there is nothing missing. Just count the bold words between each heading. If there are none then move onto the next section...

[16-Feb-19 02:58 AM] Decker#3767
i'm always thinking that is 7 or 9 headers in article ... but last hint shown that headers number is 6 )

For step 2 consider "Byzantine". For step 3 make step 2 secure (you know what to do 😉 )


[16-Feb-19 03:25 AM] Decker#3767
@cryptocal4 1st serie of numbers in `x x xx xx x` is a 8, right? these `game engine ported to blockchain in a week` 8 words. or 1 st serie is 0, bcz between header #1 and header #2 thes is 0 strong words?


[16-Feb-19 03:26 AM] Decker#3767
and 5 series of numbers total? i'm correctly understand last hint?


[16-Feb-19 03:26 AM] cryptocal4#9465
strong/bold


[16-Feb-19 03:28 AM] cryptocal4#9465
I stated before it includes everything in the article, from top to bottom.


[16-Feb-19 03:30 AM] cryptocal4#9465
But yes, you are only missing the first number


[16-Feb-19 03:30 AM] cryptocal4#9465
and it is not 8


[16-Feb-19 03:32 AM] Decker#3767
so, 0 and 8 ? or FEBRUARY 12, 2019  MYLO     BLOCKCHAIN, KOMODO is counted too?

Maybe You should just use the article text . Many possibilities in this way .tnx btw for the puzzle


[16-Feb-19 03:40 AM] linuxcaptain#2335
+ answering your questions helps your own logic and tactic... maybe i was stuck on something else and i already realized that "FEBRUARY 12, 2019  MYLO     BLOCKCHAIN, KOMODO is counted too? " counted too....


[16-Feb-19 03:42 AM] cryptocal4#9465

Ok, guys ... as our ghost solver solved it too fast - will be additional prize 11.1 KMD for first user who post here privkey from paperwallet and full steps he used to find a solution. Even if this person will be our ghost solver again, it will be good for all to know how to solve this. So, **Catz Puzzle** is still alive - https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/542089680544595998/546334352926179373 . I will not fund the address with 11.1 KMD to prevent transfer funds without posting a solution here.

you know how many letters are missing, and you match to checksum

@ponkypink how you iterate it, manual or using some software / scripting?

script for the checksum validation but you only need to iterate 1 character position so could have been done manually

How do I check the checksum of a Bitcoin address?
I'm working on a Bitcoin ATM. We want to detect addresses that are entered incorrectly.

There's a checksum on Bitcoin addresses - but how can we check it?
https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/naoSlYvZm6Sy38PwvnIQf0cn9KFFFduQOdBcsVrOLH0/%3Fv%3D462e8b9b382b/https/cdn.sstatic.net/Sites/bitcoin/img/apple-touch-icon%402.png


[16-Feb-19 11:58 AM] Strob#3417
But how do you do it in practice?


[16-Feb-19 11:59 AM] LeFevre#5755
I dont personally have a script that does this atm, but Im sure there are py libraries that will do the checksum for you.  So you just provide it a "pk" and it will say if its valid


[16-Feb-19 11:59 AM] LeFevre#5755
just iterate through all legal characters and checksum it


[16-Feb-19 12:00 PM] Strob#3417
Ok so it's using brute force for the missing part.


[16-Feb-19 12:00 PM] LeFevre#5755
yep


[16-Feb-19 12:00 PM] LeFevre#5755
migght be a few valid ones


[16-Feb-19 12:00 PM] LeFevre#5755
but you can just check them all easily enough


[16-Feb-19 12:00 PM] LeFevre#5755

only certain combos are "real"


[16-Feb-19 12:01 PM] LeFevre#5755
cause they need to checksum properly

if you dont know the order


[16-Feb-19 12:02 PM] LeFevre#5755
WITHOUT checksumming


[16-Feb-19 12:02 PM] LeFevre#5755
its 12!


[16-Feb-19 12:02 PM] LeFevre#5755
checksumming helps this significantly


[16-Feb-19 12:03 PM] LeFevre#5755
like someone could give you all 24 of their seed words


[16-Feb-19 12:03 PM] LeFevre#5755

Thanks to this puzzle I just understood a few concepts: checksums, hash, base58 and that a bitcoin address is not really a public key but it's hash!


[16-Feb-19 12:37 PM] ponkypink#7913
So for this particular case, we have a 52 character private key in WIF format with the first part missing. But we know that for this coin a private key always starts with a U and the second character can only be from p to x. If you then look closely at the picture you can see the bottom part of the 3rd and it can only be a d or u, the 4th is also partially visible and is either an N or W

i mean, may be level 1 includes only 3 "words" / symbols from picture: key, brain, lock ... i'm already tried:
```key jl777 lock
jl777 key lock
key lock jl777
lock key jl777
jl777 lock key

[17-Feb-19 03:57 AM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
First hint how related to these numbers 🤔


[17-Feb-19 04:08 AM] Decker#3767
it's picture releated ... 4x4 = 16 (dec) = 10000 (bin) ...


[17-Feb-19 04:12 AM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
I understand the binary but 4*4 ??from  Where you got it


[17-Feb-19 04:30 AM] mazyar_lp | alphasharks#3486
This puzzle should named crypto puzzle for dev's 😅


[17-Feb-19 04:33 AM] Decker#3767
it's 4x4 ...

16 - so hexadecimal is the hot hint to solve level 2


[17-Feb-19 04:51 AM] ca333#0333
whats the key?


[17-Feb-19 05:08 AM] SHossain#0007
@Decker your image looks 3D to me eyes. red in the front and green at the back and bit of depth in between


[17-Feb-19 05:39 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Key = E?

funny the person who solved it today somehow accessed the 7.77 coqui from another puzzle

so maybe ch6ris or LeFevre

Maybe you should not put that whole prize in the wallet before someone comes here with the solution.


[17-Feb-19 06:59 AM] Strob#3417
Anyway I don't have enough programming knowledge to solve those puzzles! Maybe I should come back only when a puzzle will be calling for skills like general knowledge, komodo research, culture, history, cinema etc.

[17-Feb-19 08:13 AM] LeFevre#5755
From reading chat if I had to guess I would think the answer is 06bdef  in binary format


[17-Feb-19 08:15 AM] LeFevre#5755
000001101011110111101111


[17-Feb-19 08:26 AM] LeFevre#5755
so the solver went from both level 1 answers...straight to the end


[17-Feb-19 08:26 AM] LeFevre#5755
skipping level 2

Should we use a hex keypad layout to solve step 2 or 3??


[17-Feb-19 10:58 AM] ca333#0333
very interesting - so lvl 2 is still not solved but lvl 3 is


[17-Feb-19 10:59 AM] ca333#0333
ok - looking at it i know how it was solved.


[17-Feb-19 10:59 AM] ca333#0333
it was bruteforced.


[17-Feb-19 11:02 AM] PTYX#6840
sounds like the work of decker :troll:


[17-Feb-19 11:38 AM] LeFevre#5755
yep


[17-Feb-19 11:39 AM] LeFevre#5755
just needed to increase the range on that number count


[17-Feb-19 11:39 AM] LeFevre#5755
could even limit it to just 1s and 0s


[17-Feb-19 11:39 AM] LeFevre#5755
and you'll find level 3


[17-Feb-19 11:39 AM] LeFevre#5755
still unsure how to get level 2


[17-Feb-19 11:39 AM] LeFevre#5755
level 3 solve is strange


[17-Feb-19 11:41 AM] LeFevre#5755
best guess is something about 7*7


[17-Feb-19 11:41 AM] LeFevre#5755
that was suppose to get you to level 3


[17-Feb-19 11:41 AM] LeFevre#5755
🤷


[17-Feb-19 08:56 PM] DG#6934
not only knowledge of while loops but I imagine most of the solvers know a couple of things about cryptography


[18-Feb-19 04:51 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Doesn't that defeat the purpose of calling them "crypto" puzzles?


[18-Feb-19 04:52 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Before solving these puzzles I knew next-to-nothing about blockchain encryption (e.g. SHA256) but now I do! They are a great learning tool, with a potential reward at the end.

[18-Feb-19 06:54 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Perhaps having a few more puzzles like the first two - guessing that the answer is the last letter before a full stop, or working  out that the wave chart is 1 for above and 0 for below. They are fun too.
So more "cryptic" puzzles rather than "cryptographic" puzzles? 🤷🏼


[18-Feb-19 07:04 AM] cryptocal4#9465
That way there are more like brain teasers rather than mathematical problems. I'm a fan of both! 🤓

My question was more about how you deduce the private key from "The 100o1n 100hat" ?


[07-Mar-19 07:09 AM] ponkypink#7913
You can just enter `The 100o1n 100hat` as the "key" in the Agama wallet, for a previous puzzle the key was `16`


[07-Mar-19 07:10 AM] ponkypink#7913
it's not really the private key, the final private key is derived from that but the wallet does that for you

No idea, but it was solved by the same person who solved the big prize puzzle last month: https://twitter.com/0xca333/status/1093218694514307073

@Gam_B1t you had to know it was roman numerals, but y roman is my/the question


[07-Mar-19 07:44 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Why not?? It's a cryptic puzzle 😏


[07-Mar-19 07:46 AM] iazid#3291
@cryptocal4 maybe there as a clue ..


[07-Mar-19 08:07 AM] cryptocal4#9465
The Coin Chat guys replied with a clue in the YouTube comments, but the puzzle was solved 2 or 3 days before it was posted.


[07-Mar-19 08:07 AM] cryptocal4#9465
So I'm guessing someone just manually brute forced their way to the solution.


[07-Mar-19 08:08 AM] cryptocal4#9465
Or in other words...they were smart enough to work it out without a clue.

@PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator hi! I claimed the puzzle to my KMDLabs notary address, even after the solution has been given by you, to actually construct the redeemscript and then use it in a transaction paying to my address, it was complicated 😅 
finally was able to do it after looking at https://learnmeabitcoin.com/glossary/transaction-data
and using createrawtransaction in komodo-cli

👍🏽 

[02-May-19 05:10 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
@gcharang well done friend ! Yeah when I solved Decker's puzzle, I spent like 5 hours on it just to understand the serialized data of the raw transaction and build a new one , that site taught me a lot too 😃

[02-May-19 05:28 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
if I could come up with something more difficult  & interesting, I'll set up another puzzle


[11-May-19 08:30 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
Here's another p2sh with 10.777 kmd inside, this one is a bit more difficult than the last one but still fairly easy (I'll increase the difficulty gradually) 😃 
https://www.kmdexplorer.io/address/bX2r7KGy1QPcVZ3RB28FWKv8w21KSNrrSv
What you need to decipher in order to obtain the secret text: 
cipertext: '`PBRRVCMCZNGVSYW`, ' key: '`NNELECTION`' (the secret text is an english word so you will know right away if your solution is right)
spending condition is still ```... OP_HASH256 ... OP_EQUAL```
Good luck with building the script.
And speaking of the election, let me remind everyone that please vote for your favourite candidate before May 13th 23:59:59, and if that happens to be me, here is my voting address : `RFcGrDLnWh1cMiQqMKncFJ6b9cnt8fwKCM` , thanks for the support 😃


[11-May-19 08:31 AM] LeFevre#5755
well I got the secret text


[11-May-19 08:31 AM] LeFevre#5755
but still dont know how to build a script 😭


[11-May-19 08:33 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
which one ? the one I just posted ?


[11-May-19 08:33 AM] LeFevre#5755
ya


[11-May-19 08:34 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
that was quick, do you have komodo-cli ?


[11-May-19 08:34 AM] LeFevre#5755
i do


[11-May-19 08:34 AM] LeFevre#5755
but createrawtransaction doesnt like to do anything lol


[11-May-19 08:37 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
ok first you need to do sha256(sha256(`secrettext`)), if you do correctly it would give `7723...` (if you got it correctly don't post it here though  😃 )


[11-May-19 08:37 AM] LeFevre#5755
got it 😃


[11-May-19 08:38 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
you got the hash already ?


[11-May-19 08:38 AM] LeFevre#5755
ya

the last one you posted I tried


[11-May-19 08:38 AM] LeFevre#5755
but got lost in the tx making


[11-May-19 08:42 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
now if you use Decker's script, it should give you the equivalent hex value of the secret text too


[11-May-19 08:42 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
which starts with a 4 and ends with a 3


[12-May-19 11:05 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
I just noticed that the p2sh was redeemed yesterday https://www.kmdexplorer.io/address/bX2r7KGy1QPcVZ3RB28FWKv8w21KSNrrSv
`CONGRATULATIONS`  (this is called "Vigenère cipher" and `CONGRATULATIONS` is the secret message you need for the input).
Next puzzle will be more difficult, also I will find a way so people without komodo-cli could also participate, https://komodostats.com/api/explorer/#!/tx seems like a nice place to start with to get familiar with komodo-cli 😃


[13-May-19 02:52 AM] Malti#3948
you can only participate with pretty deep technical knowledge I guess? :p


[13-May-19 03:23 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
depends on what is your definition of *deep technical knowledge* ,  to solve my last 2 puzzles you have to know how to build bitcoin script and raw transactions in general 😛


[13-May-19 03:24 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
ofc it doesn't have to be always like that.
I'll try to make my puzzles as much "accessible" as possible, without making them too easy.

[15-Oct-19 05:54 AM] Oszy#5734
So if I understand this correctly now, I need to find the P2SH Segwit Redeem Script belonging to the `bY` address and create a tx with the unspent outputs on the multisig address to myself to solve the puzzle?


[15-Oct-19 05:56 AM] Oszy#5734
And in order to do that i'd have to come up with a "seed" that reveals an "R" address, which has a pubkey that is s going to give me the related `b` address, and with deckers tool i could see the redeem script for that `b` addy?


[15-Oct-19 07:33 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530

is the chain linear?

I tried to do a little illustration


[12-Dec-19 06:09 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
idea is to make `-------- (8 Links)
------- (7 Links)
----- (5 Links)
---- (4 Links)
--- (3 Links)
-- (2 Links)`


[12-Dec-19 06:10 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
turn into ` -----------------------------` 29 links in a row

maybe x 2 reward each day it goes unanswered


[12-Dec-19 06:13 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
maybe x2 reward each hour unanswered for other sessions

For 10 KMD!!! [SOLVED]

`A man with 6 sections of chain wants to link them together to make one single chain containing 29 links in a row:

-----------------------------

The 6 sections of chain are comprised of:

-------- (8 Links)
------- (7 Links)
----- (5 Links)
---- (4 Links)
--- (3 Links)
-- (2 Links)


His blacksmith charges $0.50 for opening a chain link and $0.75 for closing a chain link.


What is the cheapest price the job can be completed for? Briefly explain how this cheapest possible price is achieved.`

1.25*5 (6.25) with linear chain as described above assuming all links are initially closed and you need to close all of them back, 1.25 total if one link can be used to combine all sections into one forking mess

`You've lost your wallet :(

But perhaps you are in luck as a wallet has been submitted to the local lost & found!

Of course you'll need to prove you are the true owner of this wallet.

To prove the wallet is really yours, you confirm there are 6 bills totaling USD$63.00 in the wallet.

Also, none of the 6 bills is a USD$1.00.

To simplify, provide what are the 6 bills in your lost/found wallet?`

5. A photo of someone called Bill = Priceless (also, worthless)

Puzzle #4 [SOLVED]
For 10 KMD!

`We need to determine exactly how many coins are in our massive bag!

We know there is a mix of quarters (Each worth $0.25), half dollars (Each worth $0.50) and silver dollars (Each worth $1.00) in our bag.

We also know that the total dollar sum of all the coins in our bag is $700.

Lastly, we know that our bag contains the exact same number of each of the three coin denominations.

What is the number of each coin type found in our bag?`

You are given 9 segments whose lengths are 1 cm, 2cm, 3 cm, . . . , 9 cm respectively.  If you chose three segments at random, what is the probability that the three segments will be able to form a triangle.

*p.s.* Answer should be represented as float number with 2 deciamals after point. Example of valid values are: `1.56`, `0.99`, etc.

||9 segments, if we randomly chose 3 segments among these 9, then there will C(9,3) = 84 possible combinations||


[14-Dec-19 03:08 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
2nd hint :
||the 1 cm segment cannot form triangle with any other 2 segments, so it's C(8,2) = 28 combinations less||

I've been debating best way to post the questions


[18-Dec-19 08:59 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
want people to have a heads up but also want people to be around regardless


[18-Dec-19 08:59 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
If a question can come at any moment then people must stay near.. Thinking we could organize specific time/date trivia rounds with multiple questions


[18-Dec-19 08:59 AM] Dr.Terminus#3269
how many people present in here right now?? quick count

if someone wants to announce they can, we'll see who gets involved

not sure if trivia warrants announcing to 'everyone'.. maybe people would like it though, unclear

Dogma was my first full watch... then Mallrats... once I saw Clerks it was over... fan for life

Sticking to Kevin Smith then...


[18-Dec-19 12:18 PM] daemonfox#6136
In an interview, Kevin admits to doing something illegal (technically) in order to finance his first film...  two part question need to answer both... HOW was Clerks paid for, and what lie made it possible?


[18-Dec-19 12:19 PM] daemonfox#6136
i may have to step away so I am DMing @Dr.Terminus  the answers


[18-Dec-19 12:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
good question!


[18-Dec-19 12:22 PM] Oszy#5734
Hmm


[18-Dec-19 12:22 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
it was paid by credit cards and it was filmed during the night


[18-Dec-19 12:23 PM] Oszy#5734
He sold his comic books


[18-Dec-19 12:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
Not quite the lie


[18-Dec-19 12:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
Nope


[18-Dec-19 12:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
The last part may be obscure... I only ever heard him admit this part once in a podcast or audio interbiew...


[18-Dec-19 12:27 PM] daemonfox#6136
but its a super important detail nonetheless


[18-Dec-19 12:27 PM] Oszy#5734
Pass then 😁


[18-Dec-19 12:28 PM] Oszy#5734
Don't know and don't want to Google cheat 😁


[18-Dec-19 12:29 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ill once again defer to @Dr.Terminus for a time limit... if no one else answers the second part, @crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy  got the first half correct, which is public knowledge... Smith even thanked both credut cards by name via tweet the day they added Clerks to the Congressional Library last week


[18-Dec-19 12:34 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
was it the fact that he enrolled into film class to get a discount and immediately dropped out once he used the student discount to rent equipment?


[18-Dec-19 12:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
thats a good tidbit but not the one I know... where did you see that part?


[18-Dec-19 12:34 PM] daemonfox#6136
and thats so like him

So he built up a supply of ten credit cards with $2,000 limits, and maxed them all out.  Clerks grossed $3 million in theaters. Kevin Smith's low-budget film

[18-Dec-19 12:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
OK so im trying to find a link with proof but even that is not coming up... so ill say crumb has it @Dr.Terminus


[18-Dec-19 12:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
Ill find it for my own peace of mind...


[18-Dec-19 12:53 PM] daemonfox#6136
But in that interview he talks about getting all those CCs as a joke with a friend to see who could get more...


[18-Dec-19 12:54 PM] daemonfox#6136
and he admits to lying to the creditors on the apps... that at the vid store he makes 50K a year and when they called it was him answering, acting as the manager and confirming that he did indeed make $50K a year at that store

[18-Dec-19 01:00 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
more to come, try to gather a few more folks and we'll do another next few days, leading up to holidays / through new year


[18-Dec-19 01:01 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
christmas through new year season in perfect for this stuff.


[18-Dec-19 01:02 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
i think there was trivia like this last year also


[18-Dec-19 01:02 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
very nice


[18-Dec-19 01:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
Yeah def! This weekend and on should have lots of peeps here


[18-Dec-19 01:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
Isnt there a trivia Discord bot?


[18-Dec-19 01:02 PM] Oszy#5734
Lets get a trivia channel


[18-Dec-19 01:02 PM] Oszy#5734
There is


[18-Dec-19 01:03 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
we are on it are we not?


[18-Dec-19 01:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
Yeah lets make that happen


[18-Dec-19 01:03 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I almost formally requested a trivia chan, thought this cryptopuzzle was most suitable of what already existed


[18-Dec-19 01:03 PM] Oszy#5734
I'd leave this for actual crypto puzzles


[18-Dec-19 01:04 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
at times there will be puzzles / riddles


[18-Dec-19 01:04 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
others trivia


[18-Dec-19 01:04 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
will have to bounce between rooms.. not a big deal though


[18-Dec-19 01:05 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
or just make a live events/ games chan of sorts to cover all such sessions


[18-Dec-19 01:05 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
puzzles with occasional trivia would be fine. there are so many channels already


[18-Dec-19 01:05 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
leave cryptopuzzle for true long term / pinned puzzles only


[18-Dec-19 01:05 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
ok, that works also


[18-Dec-19 01:05 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550

Easy puzzle for 5 KMD! 

Imagine you own a total of 6 shoes (3 different branded matched pairs) and you also own a total of 24 socks (6 pairs are brown, 6 pairs are black) and you keep them all in a big mixed up pile in your closet.

You are terribly organized and now you are about to pay for it. Or maybe not..

Your power has gone out and your alarm clock has failed you! You are now incredibly late for work. You are so late that you only have time for one single trip to your closet.

Great, it is pitch black in your closet.. You do not have any kind of flashlight... F!

What is the minimum number of shoes and the minimum number of socks you'll need to grab on your one and only trip to your closet be certain you'll have collected a matching pair of shoes as well as a matching pair of socks to show up to work late wearing?

Only one (initial) answer will be accepted per user which must be posted right here in this channel. 

Good Luck!

Three gods A, B, and C are called, in some order, True, False, and Random. True always speaks truly, False always speaks falsely, but whether Random speaks truly or falsely is a completely random matter. Your task is to determine the identities of A, B, and C by asking three yes-no questions; each question must be put to exactly one god. The gods understand English, but will answer all questions in their own language in which the words for ‘yes’ and ‘no’ are ‘da’ and ‘ja’, in some order. You do not know which word means which

[12-Feb-20 09:10 PM] nille#9011
1. Ask god A: Does 'da' mean 'yes' if and only if you are True and if and only if B is Random? (We supposed A said, "ja," making B True or False).

2. Ask god B: Does "da" mean 'yes' if and only if the Eiffle Tower is in Paris?(We supposed B said, "da," making B True.)

3. Ask god B again: Does 'da' mean 'yes' if and only if A is Random? Since B's True, he must say "da" which means A is Random, leaving C to be False
It really doesn't matter what ja and da mean as long as you can eliminate the gods. By adding a 100% question in the middle you will eliminate your confussion about the gods. The second question doesn't really matter what is as long as it's a true question and you put the if and only if argument.

if you can stump the gang for 20 questions, the prize is all yours


[20-Feb-20 01:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you have to answer a best you can by the rules provided.


[20-Feb-20 01:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Rules:

1. One active / latest winning player will inform ONLY Dr.Terminus of their secret answer for the round. (Once confirmed the start of the round will be announced.)

2. If an active player can pose a solution which cannot be guessed after 20 cumulative individual / group questions then the active player will receive the entirety of that rounds stated reward. (A final solution posed as the 21st question/entry will be the last accepted)

3. If an active players solution is guessed within 20 questions the #cryptopuzzle channel will receive 50% Rain of that rounds stated rewards and the user who provides the correct final solution will receive the remaining 50%.

4. No consecutive questions by any one user. (One individual user can ask multiple questions on their own, but after posing a question they must wait for another user to pose a question before posting an additional one themself)

5. The active/winning player is limited to answering all questions posed with: [ yes / no / sometimes / usually / rarely ] So please only ask questions which can be answered accordingly.


[20-Feb-20 01:35 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Everyone stick around


[20-Feb-20 01:36 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
we'll get the hang of it and learn to ask best possible questions to deduce faster.. I of course will not be participating, just watching.. maybe contributing to the yes / no / maybe /sometimes / usually/ rarely answers if/when confusion comes up

ok


[20-Feb-20 01:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
worth noting here


[20-Feb-20 01:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
a common iteration of this game is 'person place or thing'


[20-Feb-20 01:48 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
it was an actual question


[20-Feb-20 01:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok


[20-Feb-20 01:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
that must be asked / answered first


[20-Feb-20 01:48 PM] mrlynch#5735
1. no


[20-Feb-20 01:48 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
things and people can be dead

so try to pose the most useful, unmistakeable questions


[20-Feb-20 01:49 PM] mrlynch#5735
next question


[20-Feb-20 01:51 PM] scubapanda#2485
2. does it move?


[20-Feb-20 01:51 PM] mrlynch#5735
2. no


[20-Feb-20 01:52 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
3. is it a man made object?


[20-Feb-20 01:53 PM] mrlynch#5735
3. yes & no


[20-Feb-20 01:53 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[20-Feb-20 01:56 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
iterations of this game..


[20-Feb-20 01:56 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
some specificities are almost entirely essential to have known early to have any success with the game


[20-Feb-20 01:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I have left things broad in this opening format, which means a few early questions probably have to get burned up to figure out some fundamental things immediately


[20-Feb-20 01:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
maybe you get lucky and get an early 'yes' to a broad question of about half a dozen which can really help kickstart this game


[20-Feb-20 01:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
or waste 6 of those broad questions to finally get to the 'yes' you need


[20-Feb-20 01:59 PM] scubapanda#2485
5. is it on earth?


[20-Feb-20 02:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
5. yes

6. was it designed by architect?


[20-Feb-20 02:03 PM] wookie#7663
7. Does it consume energy?


[20-Feb-20 02:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
6. tricky.. are you religious? either yes or no


[20-Feb-20 02:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
7. no


[20-Feb-20 02:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
@Dr.Terminus time for a hint?


[20-Feb-20 02:04 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
sure


[20-Feb-20 02:04 PM] mrlynch#5735
it doesn't consume any energy anymore


[20-Feb-20 02:04 PM] wookie#7663

there's another hint, 'cause it's hard


[20-Feb-20 02:12 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
been long awaiting a badass Tesla blockbuster movie.. It will happen


[20-Feb-20 02:12 PM] Cryptoon#3362

[20-Feb-20 02:13 PM] wookie#7663
are we supposed to give one united answer as a group?


[20-Feb-20 02:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
the group has to get to the answer together


[20-Feb-20 02:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
but only one gets the reward.. either the one that answers correctly or me 😁


[20-Feb-20 02:13 PM] wookie#7663
ok


[20-Feb-20 02:13 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Rules v0.1:

1. One active / latest winning player will inform ONLY Dr.Terminus of their secret answer for the round. (Once confirmed the start of the round will be announced.)

2. If an active player can pose a solution which cannot be guessed after 20 cumulative individual / group questions then the active player will receive the entirety of that rounds stated reward. (A final solution posed as the 21st question/entry will be the last accepted)

3. If an active players solution is guessed within 20 questions the #cryptopuzzle channel will receive 50% Rain of that rounds stated rewards and the user who provides the correct final solution will receive the remaining 50%.

4. No consecutive questions by any one user. (One individual user can ask multiple questions on their own, but after posing a question they must wait for another user to pose a question before posting an additional one themself)

5. The active/winning player is limited to answering all questions posed with: [ yes / no / sometimes / usually / rarely ] So please only ask questions which can be answered accordingly.

First at least 3 more Q’s to narrow it down

Summary so far: a dead, male scientist, not Nikola Tesla, not Edison, not Einstein, even bigger impact than Edison (that's heresy in some parts!)

[20-Feb-20 02:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
i could say he was also controversial.. a bit ahead of his time


[20-Feb-20 02:40 PM] wookie#7663
here's a thought: worked with germans, I'm thinking maybe he's a cryptographer who helped with encrypting messages, like the enigma machine


[20-Feb-20 02:40 PM] wookie#7663
mrlynch also said `obscure` which ties in wiht cryptography


[20-Feb-20 02:40 PM] mrlynch#5735
i said obscure history


[20-Feb-20 02:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
not many people know of this dude, and yet almost everyone uses/or makes use of something he started


[20-Feb-20 02:41 PM] wookie#7663
hmm, ok...ignore what I said 😅


[20-Feb-20 02:41 PM] scubapanda#2485
ok, lets hear it..


[20-Feb-20 02:41 PM] mrlynch#5735
it has to be a group decision

was that q 21?


[20-Feb-20 02:47 PM] mrlynch#5735
no


[20-Feb-20 02:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
thats why we need to agree


[20-Feb-20 02:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
if #21 comes before it


[20-Feb-20 02:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

c'mon.. someone post something with #21 so we can end this


[20-Feb-20 02:50 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
this is where I start thinking about tiered payout for faster answers


[20-Feb-20 02:50 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

unless @Dr.Terminus says it's over


[20-Feb-20 02:50 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
finishing the round in under 15 minutes means 1.5 x payout


[20-Feb-20 02:50 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
no, lets keep going


[20-Feb-20 02:50 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes, time limit for #21

we're learning good stuff about best format to use here, everyone getting a feel for it fast it seems

if no answer #21 within 1 hour of time question #1 was asked


[20-Feb-20 02:51 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

not fair to mrlynch


[20-Feb-20 02:51 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
1 hour limit per round period ?

30 min max per round might be plenty


[20-Feb-20 02:52 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[20-Feb-20 03:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
let's go


[20-Feb-20 03:14 PM] mrlynch#5735
start with #1


[20-Feb-20 03:15 PM] scubapanda#2485
1. is it a place or living thing?


[20-Feb-20 03:16 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes or no questions pls 😛


[20-Feb-20 03:16 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
you can ask only in the form, which allows yes, no answers


[20-Feb-20 03:16 PM] scubapanda#2485
???


[20-Feb-20 03:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Rules:

1. One active / latest winning player will inform ONLY Dr.Terminus of their secret answer for the round. (Once confirmed the start of the round will be announced.)

2. If an active player can pose a solution which cannot be guessed after 20 cumulative individual / group questions then the active player will receive the entirety of that rounds stated reward. (A final solution posed as the 21st question/entry will be the last accepted)

3. If an active players solution is guessed within 20 questions the #cryptopuzzle channel will receive 50% Rain of that rounds stated rewards and the user who provides the correct final solution will receive the remaining 50%.

4. No consecutive questions by any one user. (One individual user can ask multiple questions on their own, but after posing a question they must wait for another user to pose a question before posting an additional one themself)

5. The active/winning player is limited to answering all questions posed with: [ yes / no / sometimes / usually / rarely ] So please only ask questions which can be answered accordingly.


[20-Feb-20 03:16 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes, no, maybe, sometimes....


[20-Feb-20 03:17 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

So wait does my Q count or no?


[20-Feb-20 03:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
@scubapanda your question requires an open answer, not a closed one.. yes or no


[20-Feb-20 03:19 PM] mrlynch#5735

Rules v 0.2:
1. One active / latest winning player will inform ONLY Dr.Terminus of their secret answer for the round. (Once confirmed the start of the round will be announced.)

2. If an active player can pose a solution which cannot be guessed after 20 cumulative individual / group questions then the active player will receive the entirety of that rounds stated reward. (A final solution posed as the 21st question/entry will be the last accepted)

3. If an active players solution is guessed within 20 questions the #cryptopuzzle channel will receive 50% Rain of that rounds stated rewards and the user who provides the correct final solution will receive the remaining 50%.

4. No consecutive questions by any one user. (One individual user can ask multiple questions on their own, but after posing a question they must wait for another user to pose a question before posting an additional one themself)

5. The active/winning player is limited to answering all questions posed with: [ yes / no / sometimes / usually / rarely ] So please only ask questions which can be answered accordingly.

6. Final answers should be provided with the appropriate answer number preceding the answer, otherwise it will not be regarded an answer, rather open discussion.

[20-Feb-20 04:13 PM] mrlynch#5735

Nope.


[20-Feb-20 04:14 PM] mrlynch#5735

Which Countries Are in Eastern Europe?
It is difficult to exactly determine the boundary of Eastern Europe as different definitions of the region exist.

the pool just widened


[20-Feb-20 04:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
we have many famous writers, music composers, rulers


[20-Feb-20 04:22 PM] sorin90#6811
@mrlynch only questions with yes, no, sometimes, etc. So nothing I or you say beside that matters.


[20-Feb-20 04:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
but he was a political figure so maybe an aristocrat or a tzar


[20-Feb-20 04:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'm thinking out loud with the team mates 😄

Nicholas II


[20-Feb-20 04:24 PM] Martis#7710
13. He was a tzar?


[20-Feb-20 04:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
east berlin or DRG was part of USSR but we're talking about pre-1901 russia, back when the bolsheviks (soviets) weren't even an idea


[20-Feb-20 04:24 PM] sorin90#6811
13. No


[20-Feb-20 04:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
14. was he russian?

16. No


[20-Feb-20 04:28 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok.. either ukrainian or moldovan


[20-Feb-20 04:28 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
would concept of a few lifelines / 'OMITS' be worth including?


[20-Feb-20 04:29 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
if a question is simply too difficult to answer farily without misdirecting can the secret holder answer 'OMIT' ?


[20-Feb-20 04:29 PM] sorin90#6811
@Dr.Terminus but only once per game


[20-Feb-20 04:29 PM] Martis#7710
17. South from Baltic states?


[20-Feb-20 04:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
not allowed 2 questions in a row from same user

and thank god for that


[20-Feb-20 04:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
he already said he was eastern european and we ruled out romania, russia and baltic states (lithuania, latvia, estonia) which leaves us with ukraine and moldova


[20-Feb-20 04:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
unless he's misdirecting


[20-Feb-20 04:30 PM] Martis#7710
ok ok


[20-Feb-20 04:31 PM] sorin90#6811
@Martis you will have to wait for someone to ask


[20-Feb-20 04:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
oh wait.. we have that belarus thing as well.. but that's technically part of russia 🤔


[20-Feb-20 04:31 PM] sorin90#6811
Because 16th was your queation as well


[20-Feb-20 04:31 PM] sorin90#6811
So 17 needs to be another person


[20-Feb-20 04:31 PM] Martis#7710
Poland, Slovakia, etc.


[20-Feb-20 04:32 PM] sorin90#6811
So 17?


[20-Feb-20 04:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
no


[20-Feb-20 04:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
poland, slovakia are not eastern european


[20-Feb-20 04:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
central europe


[20-Feb-20 04:32 PM] mrlynch#5735
and baltic states are not technically eastern europe either.. they're baltic states :))


[20-Feb-20 04:32 PM] sorin90#6811
@mrlynch true.


[20-Feb-20 04:33 PM] sorin90#6811
And not really true


[20-Feb-20 04:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
so i guess we shot 1 question for nothing


[20-Feb-20 04:33 PM] Martis#7710
Lately, Baltic states are North europe according to UN.


[20-Feb-20 04:33 PM] sorin90#6811
Baltic states can also be eastern because their in the east of europe


[20-Feb-20 04:33 PM] mrlynch#5735
baltic, eastern, balkanic in pretty much one line as per my old political geography


[20-Feb-20 04:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
ah.. nuanced i see.. we separate politics from geography


[20-Feb-20 04:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
no


[20-Feb-20 04:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
they're in south east (southern eu by a stretch) geographically


[20-Feb-20 04:34 PM] mrlynch#5735
balkanic politically


[20-Feb-20 04:35 PM] Martis#7710
Eastern Europe, as defined by the United Nations Statistics Division, includes the countries of Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Poland, Romania, Russian Federation, and Slovakia, as well as the republics of Belarus, Moldova, and Ukraine.


[20-Feb-20 04:35 PM] mrlynch#5735

[20-Feb-20 04:35 PM] mrlynch#5735

repost of rules


[20-Feb-20 04:59 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
20 Questions (+1) Rules v 0.3:
1.One active / latest winning player will inform ONLY Dr.Terminus of their secret answer for the round. (Once confirmed the start of the round will be announced.)

2. Valid secret categories include: [People, Places, Animals, Plants , Objects, Ideas]

(Secrets can be drawn from our waking reality, as well as our pop culture movie / television / literary / music industry)

(Theories, concepts, religions, symbols, philosophies, fables, lyrics, quotes, etc. ALL fall under the broad category 'idea')

3. If the active player can pose a solution which cannot be guessed after 20 cumulative individual / group questions then the active player will receive the entirety of that rounds stated reward. (A final solution posed as the 21st question/entry will be the last accepted)

4. If an active players solution is guessed within 20 questions the #cryptopuzzle channel will receive 50% Rain of that rounds stated rewards and the user who provides the correct final solution will receive the remaining 50%.

5. No consecutive questions by any one user. (One individual user can ask multiple questions on their own, but after posing a question they must wait for another user to pose a question before posting an additional one themself)

6. The active/winning player is limited to answering all questions posed with: [ yes / no / sometimes / usually / rarely ] So please only ask questions which can be answered accordingly.

7. Final answers should be provided with the appropriate answer number preceding the answer, otherwise it will not be regarded an answer, rather open discussion.

[20-Feb-20 05:15 PM] mrlynch#5735
too many royal families before 1900 in europe to go through them


[20-Feb-20 05:16 PM] mrlynch#5735

[20-Feb-20 05:16 PM] sorin90#6811
If you keep asking like that you'll burn the questions


[20-Feb-20 05:16 PM] sorin90#6811

[20-Feb-20 05:16 PM] sorin90#6811
That's why once you know itvs royal you should stop asking what royal family

She was born before 1700


[20-Feb-20 05:23 PM] sorin90#6811
So between the neanderthals and 1700


[20-Feb-20 05:23 PM] mrlynch#5735

[20-Feb-20 05:23 PM] sorin90#6811

[20-Feb-20 05:25 PM] sorin90#6811
Come one guys.


[20-Feb-20 05:26 PM] sorin90#6811
@Martis  @AhmedDhaif @ZaferGraph (Don't DM) @peratt


[20-Feb-20 05:26 PM] sorin90#6811
I think I should have asked another question


[20-Feb-20 05:26 PM] Martis#7710
16. was she born after 1540?


[20-Feb-20 05:26 PM] sorin90#6811
16. No


[20-Feb-20 05:26 PM] AhmedDhaif#7195
@sorin90 16 Louise. Louise queen of danmark


[20-Feb-20 05:27 PM] sorin90#6811
Narrowed it @mrlynch


[20-Feb-20 05:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
so before 1540


[20-Feb-20 05:27 PM] sorin90#6811
@AhmedDhaif 16 was already asked. Pls ask another question. And don't try to guess the person


[20-Feb-20 05:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
damn


[20-Feb-20 05:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
loads of women that ruled in europe before 1540


[20-Feb-20 05:27 PM] AhmedDhaif#7195
@sorin90 so what should i geuss ?


[20-Feb-20 05:28 PM] sorin90#6811
Yup. Somewhere between 10000 BC and 1549 AD


[20-Feb-20 05:28 PM] sorin90#6811
@AhmedDhaif ask me something that can narrow it down.


[20-Feb-20 05:28 PM] AhmedDhaif#7195
@sorin90 ahe ok


[20-Feb-20 05:28 PM] sorin90#6811
Like they did. Was she born before 1540


[20-Feb-20 05:28 PM] sorin90#6811
After 1540 I mean.


[20-Feb-20 05:28 PM] sorin90#6811
And she was born before.


[20-Feb-20 05:29 PM] Martis#7710
Could be some mythical person


[20-Feb-20 05:29 PM] sorin90#6811
You can ask about a region. Like they did. Was she from europe


[20-Feb-20 05:29 PM] sorin90#6811
Try narrowing it down @Avaahnaa


[20-Feb-20 05:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
i think i know


[20-Feb-20 05:29 PM] sorin90#6811
But don't ask the name before question 21.


[20-Feb-20 05:29 PM] sorin90#6811
That will only take another shot from you and everyone @AhmedDhaif


[20-Feb-20 05:30 PM] sorin90#6811
Because you are all a team in this game. A team against me


[20-Feb-20 05:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes


[20-Feb-20 05:30 PM] sorin90#6811
So q 17


[20-Feb-20 05:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
she was most likely an ancient queen


[20-Feb-20 05:30 PM] sorin90#6811
I donvt really like the all against me  @mrlynch but what can I do


[20-Feb-20 05:30 PM] sorin90#6811
Q17?


[20-Feb-20 05:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'm inclined to believe it was a dacian queen, obscure, almost forgotten by history


[20-Feb-20 05:31 PM] sorin90#6811
😂


[20-Feb-20 05:31 PM] mrlynch#5735
but i may be very wrong :))


[20-Feb-20 05:31 PM] sorin90#6811
You gotta be careful ppl


[20-Feb-20 05:31 PM] sorin90#6811

[20-Feb-20 05:39 PM] sorin90#6811

19. No


[20-Feb-20 05:43 PM] sorin90#6811
So that narrowed it. But not as much as I would have liked.


[20-Feb-20 05:43 PM] sorin90#6811
Because english natives before 1540 where very few


[20-Feb-20 05:43 PM] AhmedDhaif#7195
20. Died in belgem ? @sorin90

@ZaferGraph (Don't DM) good point. But look at the before 1540 europe map to be sure.


[20-Feb-20 05:45 PM] sorin90#6811

6. Final answers should be provided with the appropriate answer number preceding the answer, otherwise it will not be regarded an answer, rather open discussion.

well.. if we don't have enough people to provide sufficient # of questions we can lengthen time a bit.. hopefully a few more members get involved. Once the ball is rolling new players will see how it can flow

Maybe if humans eat it y/n?


[21-Feb-20 11:53 AM] sorin90#6811
Ok. Herbivore from another continent then africa


[21-Feb-20 11:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
In a normal diet


[21-Feb-20 11:53 AM] sorin90#6811
No. How about domesric?


[21-Feb-20 11:53 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
i am looking for a very specific answer, so get creative. only half of questions left


[21-Feb-20 11:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
First eat y/n then domestic?


[21-Feb-20 11:54 AM] az#1921
i still think that there is a possibility that the animal is a character from movie or cartoon, which will be sort of "alive". Might be a good thing to exclude this no ?


[21-Feb-20 11:54 AM] sorin90#6811
If he thinks of asians that will be hard.


[21-Feb-20 11:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Good point az


[21-Feb-20 11:54 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
Since it has now claws, a predator animal is unlikely


[21-Feb-20 11:54 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
But still possible


[21-Feb-20 11:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
True


[21-Feb-20 11:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Not a carnivore either


[21-Feb-20 11:55 AM] sorin90#6811
I think itvs the animal they say coronavirus went from to humans.

50kg would have been better. Or 100.

Most mamals weight more then 10 killos


[21-Feb-20 11:58 AM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
So we're looking for a larger animal that does not eat meat


[21-Feb-20 11:58 AM] sorin90#6811
Or does.


[21-Feb-20 11:58 AM] sorin90#6811
He only said it's not carnivour.

[21-Feb-20 12:04 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
That was if it was from Africa


[21-Feb-20 12:05 PM] sorin90#6811
Not asia, not africa. No claws.land mamal. Living today.


[21-Feb-20 12:05 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
That's some rephrasing... 🤣


[21-Feb-20 12:05 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
16. yes


[21-Feb-20 12:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha


[21-Feb-20 12:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So sheep/horse/cow/pig


[21-Feb-20 12:05 PM] sorin90#6811
So what was the 10 question with answer yes?


[21-Feb-20 12:05 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But fictional yes and no


[21-Feb-20 12:05 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
That narrows things down...


[21-Feb-20 12:05 PM] az#1921
time for the cheese part, 17. DO you produce milk for cheese production


[21-Feb-20 12:05 PM] sorin90#6811
You can find all of those in asia  @Cryptoon


[21-Feb-20 12:05 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612

[21-Feb-20 12:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So it gonna be something like tornado zorros horse


[21-Feb-20 12:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Because that horse is not from asia


[21-Feb-20 12:06 PM] sorin90#6811
I think I know what the animal is.


[21-Feb-20 12:06 PM] sorin90#6811

I know they have cigarettes....


[21-Feb-20 12:10 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But with camel the answer to from afrika would have been yes immediately


[21-Feb-20 12:10 PM] sorin90#6811
I donvt think so. I was thinking cammel and kagaroo

Hmmm. So should we try periods first?


[21-Feb-20 12:33 PM] az#1921
could be nice something like "did he seen the year 2000". That will delete few names


[21-Feb-20 12:33 PM] sorin90#6811

dead man, no artist, no politician, died before 2000

How about a time frame?


[21-Feb-20 12:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe ask if he was around when electricity was around?


[21-Feb-20 12:39 PM] az#1921
to make a time selection you can go with "did you have electricity" or "was Neptune already known" 🙂

well economic is a science

It is. And wiki doesn't call it like that


[21-Feb-20 12:47 PM] sorin90#6811
So he should be something in that area.


[21-Feb-20 12:48 PM] sorin90#6811

UK on a commonwealth pov


[21-Feb-20 12:56 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612
I'm jumping to conclusions: lots of those nationals fled their country top work for the allies.


[21-Feb-20 12:57 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
perhaps narrow down where he was born?


[21-Feb-20 12:57 PM] az#1921
that will cost a lot of questions

If he fought in one of the world wars and made an invention, it's likely to think post WW2


[21-Feb-20 01:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But not a scientist per se

We could ask if we still use his invention

I'm thinking if he fought in WW (posibly WW2) he invented stuff in the 50s or 60s. A lot of those inventions are outdated now, but a few are still in use (Like the hovercraft)


[21-Feb-20 01:06 PM] az#1921
or he invented something during the war and died also during it

i asked the last question. so somebody else please


[22-Feb-20 12:12 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
also we can discuss previously as before


[22-Feb-20 12:12 PM] scubapanda#2485
8. Does it move on land?


[22-Feb-20 12:13 PM] az#1921
8. No.


[22-Feb-20 12:14 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
so it could be a plane or other aerial vehicle that does not need petrol fuel


[22-Feb-20 12:15 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
like hot air balloon or something


[22-Feb-20 12:15 PM] scubapanda#2485
Yes


[22-Feb-20 12:16 PM] scubapanda#2485
Moves in the atmosphere or underwater.


[22-Feb-20 12:17 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
yeah , underwater but then atomic power. usually submarines used petrol


[22-Feb-20 12:17 PM] sorin90#6811
9 is it a baloon type?


[22-Feb-20 12:18 PM] az#1921
9. No ! and you forget an other possibilty...


[22-Feb-20 12:18 PM] sorin90#6811
Wait. Az is this your word?


[22-Feb-20 12:18 PM] az#1921
yes


[22-Feb-20 12:18 PM] sorin90#6811
Zeppelin is included in baloons az.


[22-Feb-20 12:18 PM] scubapanda#2485
So in space


[22-Feb-20 12:19 PM] az#1921
Zeppelin is included indeed


[22-Feb-20 12:19 PM] sorin90#6811
Ok. So nothing like that


[22-Feb-20 12:19 PM] sorin90#6811
It might be a satelite.


[22-Feb-20 12:19 PM] sorin90#6811
We should ask if it's huge and if multiple nations participated in the development.


[22-Feb-20 12:19 PM] sorin90#6811
Or maybe the car misk sent into space


[22-Feb-20 12:20 PM] sorin90#6811
Musk


[22-Feb-20 12:20 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
maybe i ask it if is in space?


[22-Feb-20 12:20 PM] scubapanda#2485
10. In space


[22-Feb-20 12:20 PM] sorin90#6811
It is


[22-Feb-20 12:20 PM] sorin90#6811
Since he gave us that hint for free


[22-Feb-20 12:21 PM] az#1921
I will forget the 10 then, the hint was indeed free.


[22-Feb-20 12:21 PM] az#1921
free-10 : Yes.


[22-Feb-20 12:21 PM] scubapanda#2485
Thanks


[22-Feb-20 12:21 PM] sorin90#6811
Az seems to be a good guy and doesnvt kissslead us

Misslead

😉 

[22-Feb-20 12:22 PM] sorin90#6811
Pls ask if multiple nations participated in it's consteuction


[22-Feb-20 12:22 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
perhaps one question to ask if it is a single object or there are many of them. like constellation of satellites


[22-Feb-20 12:22 PM] scubapanda#2485
Yes


[22-Feb-20 12:23 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
sorin what do you think


[22-Feb-20 12:23 PM] sorin90#6811
I have my mind set on my question. But do what ever you want


[22-Feb-20 12:23 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
i can also ask if multiple countries contributed to development


[22-Feb-20 12:23 PM] scubapanda#2485
Ok


[22-Feb-20 12:23 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
let's do that one?


[22-Feb-20 12:24 PM] sorin90#6811
Ok. Ty


[22-Feb-20 12:24 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
10. it was developed by multiple countries?


[22-Feb-20 12:24 PM] az#1921
10. Yes, it 's a multiple countries contribution


[22-Feb-20 12:24 PM] sorin90#6811
Is it the iss?


[22-Feb-20 12:25 PM] scubapanda#2485
Satellite or space station.


[22-Feb-20 12:25 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
ok, so international space station probably


[22-Feb-20 12:25 PM] az#1921
Not the ISS !


[22-Feb-20 12:25 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
hmm


[22-Feb-20 12:25 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
what else is up there?


[22-Feb-20 12:25 PM] sorin90#6811
Os it a satelite.


[22-Feb-20 12:25 PM] sorin90#6811
?


[22-Feb-20 12:26 PM] scubapanda#2485
Perhaps ask if its in orbit


[22-Feb-20 12:26 PM] az#1921
Since you get it's a satellite, i need the name of it. Keep asking stuff to find it !


[22-Feb-20 12:26 PM] sorin90#6811
Do you know any satelites build by multiple countries


[22-Feb-20 12:26 PM] sorin90#6811
It could be the GPS


[22-Feb-20 12:26 PM] az#1921
(the secret is the name)


[22-Feb-20 12:27 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
GPS is a constellation of satellites


[22-Feb-20 12:27 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
but that is US only


[22-Feb-20 12:27 PM] scubapanda#2485
11. Is it in orbit?


[22-Feb-20 12:27 PM] sorin90#6811
Or maybe an aray of satelites that search  for planets


[22-Feb-20 12:27 PM] az#1921
11. Smart question. Not yet !


[22-Feb-20 12:27 PM] sorin90#6811
Us has the patent. But I think other countries including the EU participate


[22-Feb-20 12:28 PM] sorin90#6811
Wtf.


[22-Feb-20 12:28 PM] sorin90#6811
Not yet.


[22-Feb-20 12:28 PM] sorin90#6811
Hmm.


[22-Feb-20 12:28 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
EU has its own navigational thing afaik. galileo


[22-Feb-20 12:29 PM] sorin90#6811
I know that they plan to launch a vale satelite system. But on is already in orbit


[22-Feb-20 12:29 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
it's not in orbit, but moves. so it is something still in development


[22-Feb-20 12:30 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
meant to be launched into space

{Reactions}
💯 

[22-Feb-20 12:30 PM] sorin90#6811
Maybe it has the ability to move. But not yet launched.


[22-Feb-20 12:30 PM] scubapanda#2485
Also forgot to say EARTH  orbit..


[22-Feb-20 12:30 PM] sorin90#6811
I'm pretty sure he understood that.


[22-Feb-20 12:31 PM] sorin90#6811
Or maybe he's thinking of another planet?


[22-Feb-20 12:31 PM] sorin90#6811
Moving but not yet there.


[22-Feb-20 12:31 PM] scubapanda#2485
Could be heading to another planet.


[22-Feb-20 12:32 PM] scubapanda#2485
Ask


[22-Feb-20 12:32 PM] sorin90#6811
Letvs brainstorm a bit.


[22-Feb-20 12:32 PM] sorin90#6811
Are there any important projects to be launched into orbit?


[22-Feb-20 12:32 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
maybe i should ask it has already been test launched?


[22-Feb-20 12:33 PM] az#1921
soooooo many @sorin90  🙂


[22-Feb-20 12:33 PM] scubapanda#2485
Tesla


[22-Feb-20 12:33 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
i was thinking along those lines scubapanda


[22-Feb-20 12:33 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
they tested it


[22-Feb-20 12:34 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
but it is not international effort really, i don't think


[22-Feb-20 12:34 PM] sorin90#6811
@az😂


[22-Feb-20 12:35 PM] sorin90#6811
China plans to put another iss up there but he said itvs not that.


[22-Feb-20 12:35 PM] sorin90#6811
Also they plan to send ppl to mars. Could it be that?


[22-Feb-20 12:36 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
perhaps we could ask if it has anything to do with Mars


[22-Feb-20 12:36 PM] sorin90#6811
I'm still thinking satelite.


[22-Feb-20 12:36 PM] scubapanda#2485
Its a thingy going to another planet orbit.


[22-Feb-20 12:36 PM] sorin90#6811
I think az said so


[22-Feb-20 12:36 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

@Dr.Terminus cya


[22-Feb-20 12:37 PM] sorin90#6811
He said it's a satelite.


[22-Feb-20 12:37 PM] sorin90#6811
Check above


[22-Feb-20 12:38 PM] scubapanda#2485
Ask


[22-Feb-20 12:38 PM] sorin90#6811
So that rules out the mars colony, the rovers, shuttles and any iss


[22-Feb-20 12:38 PM] sorin90#6811
We donvt have to. He said so.


[22-Feb-20 12:38 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
perhaps one of the telescope projects?


[22-Feb-20 12:39 PM] sorin90#6811
Since you get it's a satellite, i need the name of it. Keep asking stuff to find it !


[22-Feb-20 12:39 PM] az#1921
I should have kept my keyboard shut !


[22-Feb-20 12:39 PM] az#1921
😄


[22-Feb-20 12:39 PM] sorin90#6811
Hmm. That could be.


[22-Feb-20 12:39 PM] sorin90#6811
I know. It really helped us. At least with 1 question. We saved a question.


[22-Feb-20 12:40 PM] sorin90#6811
But itvs still hard.


[22-Feb-20 12:41 PM] sorin90#6811
Could it be the satelite they want to lauch to make light on earth even at night?


[22-Feb-20 12:42 PM] sorin90#6811
Or is it the oneweb 3?


[22-Feb-20 12:42 PM] sorin90#6811
Wait az is frech, right?


[22-Feb-20 12:42 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
maybe next question could be something like: is it going to be used to look for and study new planets?


[22-Feb-20 12:43 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
then we could gauge its purpose


[22-Feb-20 12:43 PM] scubapanda#2485
I think 30 mins is up soon.


[22-Feb-20 12:44 PM] sorin90#6811
Ok. Go ahead crumb


[22-Feb-20 12:44 PM] sorin90#6811
If itvs not we should ask if it's commercial.


[22-Feb-20 12:44 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
11. is it going to be used to look for and study new planets?


[22-Feb-20 12:45 PM] az#1921
11. Yes. It's part of his job


[22-Feb-20 12:45 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
cool. we are making progress


[22-Feb-20 12:45 PM] sorin90#6811
Ok.


[22-Feb-20 12:45 PM] sorin90#6811
Now let's see what can we ask next?


[22-Feb-20 12:46 PM] az#1921
And yes i'm french.


[22-Feb-20 12:47 PM] sorin90#6811
He already conformed it's not in space yet, right?


[22-Feb-20 12:47 PM] scubapanda#2485
Telescope not in orbit yet?


[22-Feb-20 12:47 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
perhaps is it named after a famous object or person?


[22-Feb-20 12:47 PM] sorin90#6811
And we should think if France is a part of any such projects.


[22-Feb-20 12:47 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
could be a good question to ask


[22-Feb-20 12:48 PM] sorin90#6811
Do you know any such satelites to be lauched?


[22-Feb-20 12:48 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
if it is named after something famous it narrows down the possibilities


[22-Feb-20 12:48 PM] sorin90#6811
I only know a few that are already up there.


[22-Feb-20 12:48 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
there are couple not launched yet


[22-Feb-20 12:48 PM] sorin90#6811
But if you know a few that are planed for the future I can ask.


[22-Feb-20 12:49 PM] sorin90#6811
12?


[22-Feb-20 12:49 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
yes


[22-Feb-20 12:49 PM] sorin90#6811
Is it named after a famous person?


[22-Feb-20 12:49 PM] az#1921
12. Correct

hmm, that would have been my second guess


[22-Feb-20 12:50 PM] az#1921

Must be something from discord

I have no ideea. Even if I tap on thier names. The tag give me the ID as well. But it doesn't tag them.

Game


[23-Feb-20 02:58 PM] sorin90#6811
@cryptovizard 20 questions game. Check the pinned post


[23-Feb-20 03:01 PM] sorin90#6811
I think of a word. Send it to @Dr.Terminus who sponsors the game. The when we have enough players we start. You guys start asking me a question and I respond with:yes, no, sometimes, rarely, omit. When you know the solution or after 20 question you post the answer you think is my secret word. If you are right you get half of the prize and you can be the next person that asks the questions.

[24-Feb-20 12:25 PM] scubapanda#2485
This could be a very long wait..


[24-Feb-20 12:26 PM] az#1921
should we really care about this ? Players are here, that's more important


[24-Feb-20 12:26 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
he's been pinged multiple times. let's hope he will check his device soon


[24-Feb-20 12:26 PM] scubapanda#2485
Why?


[24-Feb-20 12:26 PM] sorin90#6811
I sent him a dm. He usually replies in a short time.


[24-Feb-20 12:27 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
or we could theoretically start. the players are here. @sorin90 who has the question is here


[24-Feb-20 12:27 PM] sorin90#6811

You are not playing who puts the best questions

So it's pointless to ask 100 questions.


[24-Feb-20 12:50 PM] sorin90#6811
Pls read the previous questions and answer and talk among each other.


[24-Feb-20 12:50 PM] Kaks | $ARRR Privacy Matters#6612
4- is he a football player?


[24-Feb-20 12:50 PM] az#1921

@nik normally when you have an answer you ask if you can say the answer or use it in a question.


[24-Feb-20 01:34 PM] sorin90#6811
But it's ok


[24-Feb-20 01:34 PM] nik#9841

[24-Feb-20 01:35 PM] Animal#2514

[24-Feb-20 01:35 PM] sorin90#6811
We should add that as a rule @Dr.Terminus


[24-Feb-20 01:35 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
also i repeat: always makes sense to ask the field first. and **after that** guess the name


[24-Feb-20 01:35 PM] sorin90#6811
That way there won't be a confission left


[24-Feb-20 01:35 PM] looye29#2126

[24-Feb-20 01:36 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
and answer spamming def hurst the groups chances


[24-Feb-20 01:36 PM] sorin90#6811
But if you get the answer faster you can post it as a question or ask the host if you can do it.


[24-Feb-20 01:36 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

We lost a question


[24-Feb-20 01:44 PM] figgy132#7531
I think we need more time between rounds to digest rules and discuss strategy

@figgy132 every time a new person will join, we'll have to do it again


[24-Feb-20 01:45 PM] looye29#2126
So combination wood and metal


[24-Feb-20 01:45 PM] Alexaa94#4078
It is an object with something made of wood and without connection to the internet


[24-Feb-20 01:45 PM] sorin90#6811
So a part of the object is made form wood.

@figgy132 yeah but if they join in the new game it will be the same thing.

Maybe something what we use into the house?

We can ask if itvs a fire arm?

I'll pin some 'tips for new users' which all new users will be urged to read..


[24-Feb-20 01:46 PM] sorin90#6811
Or what else can be made from wood and something else.


[24-Feb-20 01:46 PM] nik#9841
weapon would be more general


[24-Feb-20 01:46 PM] sorin90#6811
A window.


[24-Feb-20 01:46 PM] looye29#2126
But that would be the answer


[24-Feb-20 01:46 PM] Kaks | $ARRR Privacy Matters#6612
maybe a car


[24-Feb-20 01:46 PM] 𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠#3612

Partly wood and partly metal


[24-Feb-20 01:47 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
cars cannot use wood anymore for safety reasons


[24-Feb-20 01:47 PM] sorin90#6811
Letvs narrow it down. Maybe industry?


[24-Feb-20 01:47 PM] Alexaa94#4078

Ok let's try clarifing the stationary issue.


[24-Feb-20 02:02 PM] Animal#2514
8.no


[24-Feb-20 02:02 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
but this is an object which is made to be moved


[24-Feb-20 02:02 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
ok, so we can rule out modern things


[24-Feb-20 02:02 PM] Alexaa94#4078
Can I ask if it is a mechanism?


[24-Feb-20 02:02 PM] sorin90#6811
Not yet


[24-Feb-20 02:03 PM] sorin90#6811
Everyone letvs think of something that will help us with the stationary thing


[24-Feb-20 02:03 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
sorry to confuse


[24-Feb-20 02:03 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

So a old think that moves around for last 120 years made of wood

Does it need to use and engine to move, like, a horse, human traction, etc.

Or should we ask of it's a tool?


[24-Feb-20 02:05 PM] sorin90#6811
Or if itvs part of something bigger.

No kaks it is not stationary

Already asked


[24-Feb-20 02:24 PM] sorin90#6811
Mallet.


[24-Feb-20 02:24 PM] Alexaa94#4078
Mine too


[24-Feb-20 02:24 PM] looye29#2126
Yes it was before 1900


[24-Feb-20 02:24 PM] nik#9841
this not a tool thing is confusing me


[24-Feb-20 02:24 PM] sorin90#6811
What question is it now?


[24-Feb-20 02:24 PM] Alexaa94#4078
I give up


[24-Feb-20 02:24 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
some might call it a tool


[24-Feb-20 02:25 PM] looye29#2126
What


[24-Feb-20 02:25 PM] sorin90#6811
15. Do we still use it today?


[24-Feb-20 02:25 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
not all tools are for crafting


[24-Feb-20 02:25 PM] Animal#2514
15.rarely


[24-Feb-20 02:25 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you can make improvised tools out of much


[24-Feb-20 02:25 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
people can be tools


[24-Feb-20 02:25 PM] sorin90#6811
Ok guys. Let's see. Something that ppl rarely use it today.


[24-Feb-20 02:25 PM] Animal#2514
@crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy  they ask if is made after 1900


[24-Feb-20 02:26 PM] figgy132#7531
Has anyone asked if it's a weapon (primary purpose)


[24-Feb-20 02:26 PM] Animal#2514
not before


[24-Feb-20 02:26 PM] sorin90#6811
Most of the tools that where invented before 1900 are still used today.


[24-Feb-20 02:26 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
tool' is nebulous, just doesn't seem like it because it is so typically synonymous with 'hammer'


[24-Feb-20 02:26 PM] Alexaa94#4078
And is the body extension


[24-Feb-20 02:26 PM] looye29#2126
It moves on it's own and made from wood


[24-Feb-20 02:26 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
it does NOT move on its own


[24-Feb-20 02:26 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
it moves when a person makes it move


[24-Feb-20 02:26 PM] Animal#2514
they call it " body extention"


[24-Feb-20 02:26 PM] Alexaa94#4078
Prothesis


[24-Feb-20 02:27 PM] looye29#2126
Pirate leg


[24-Feb-20 02:27 PM] looye29#2126
So sorin is right


[24-Feb-20 02:27 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
that is not a terrible guess


[24-Feb-20 02:27 PM] sorin90#6811
Maybe an adze?


[24-Feb-20 02:27 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
but dont waste it


[24-Feb-20 02:27 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you guys have been close... coming from a couple angles though


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] sorin90#6811
Ok. Pirate leg it is


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
hahaha 🙂 it is not a pirate leg


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] looye29#2126
Wooden wheelchair


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
though it is interesting that you wound up there....


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] Alexaa94#4078
Can we ask if it is a prosthesis?


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] sorin90#6811
Ooo. Ok. Let's try something else.


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
dont read too much into it


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] nik#9841
could be an artist tool then?


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] PeLe | $ARRR#1096
Is it the forest Gump leg thingies


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Im not giving it away


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] sorin90#6811
No. It's not.


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] scubapanda#2485
Weapons were asked already?


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] sorin90#6811
I think itvs a tool.


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
@Animal has come up with a simple yet good one


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ok


[24-Feb-20 02:28 PM] sorin90#6811
How about we ask of it's atool?


[24-Feb-20 02:29 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
5 mins left


[24-Feb-20 02:29 PM] sorin90#6811
1 min per question


[24-Feb-20 02:29 PM] Alexaa94#4078
Also can be a prosthesis

🤔 

[24-Feb-20 02:29 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
for real.. you guys had lots of chance to come up with good questions to dig deeper


[24-Feb-20 02:29 PM] Oszy#5734
i am telling you it must be stupidly simple just overcomplicating it 😄


[24-Feb-20 02:29 PM] looye29#2126
We did ask that already


[24-Feb-20 02:29 PM] nik#9841
we already asked if it was a tool and he said no


[24-Feb-20 02:29 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ehhhhh... its not really a tool


[24-Feb-20 02:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
some jerk may argue its a kind of tool, a tool is what is needed for the job at hand


[24-Feb-20 02:30 PM] Alexaa94#4078
because what I said before is not a tool, not industry, moves, it is an extension body


[24-Feb-20 02:30 PM] sorin90#6811
So it's something you can use to craft, torture


[24-Feb-20 02:31 PM] Animal#2514
extention body used in " "


[24-Feb-20 02:31 PM] sorin90#6811
Ok go for your question  @Alexaa94


[24-Feb-20 02:31 PM] sorin90#6811
But itvs not


[24-Feb-20 02:31 PM] Alexaa94#4078
16. Is this a prosthesis?


[24-Feb-20 02:31 PM] sorin90#6811
Because he used ""


[24-Feb-20 02:31 PM] Animal#2514
16.no


[24-Feb-20 02:31 PM] Alexaa94#4078

[24-Feb-20 02:31 PM] nik#9841
i think some painters called a brush or a pencil the extencion of the body

[24-Feb-20 02:32 PM] Kaks | $ARRR Privacy Matters#6612
it might be hair brush


[24-Feb-20 02:32 PM] Kaks | $ARRR Privacy Matters#6612
it moves too


[24-Feb-20 02:32 PM] Alexaa94#4078

5 questions left.. lets plow through them..


[24-Feb-20 02:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
4 + 1 final guess


[24-Feb-20 02:32 PM] sorin90#6811
Since we don't use it anymore. Only rarely  it's hard to guess.


[24-Feb-20 02:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
someone compile what is known


[24-Feb-20 02:32 PM] sorin90#6811
Maybe ppl used it to do something with it. Like carrying something.


[24-Feb-20 02:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
and maybe @Animal or i can set any bad conceptions straight one last time

[24-Feb-20 02:34 PM] Alexaa94#4078
It is a thing made a part of wood - it is not a vehicle, a mechanism, it is used rarely nowadays and in torture, it is not a prosthesis


[24-Feb-20 02:34 PM] sorin90#6811
It's not really a tool. And it seems that ot's not really moving. Maybe when ppl carry it with them

{Reactions}
👆 

[24-Feb-20 02:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
it moves when carried.


[24-Feb-20 02:34 PM] sorin90#6811
Then it doesn't really move.


[24-Feb-20 02:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
doesnt ever move without a person making it move.. not that i can think of


[24-Feb-20 02:34 PM] nik#9841
jea to me thats a brush but a brush is a tool XD


[24-Feb-20 02:34 PM] Alexaa94#4078
It is not a toy


[24-Feb-20 02:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
its made to be moved


[24-Feb-20 02:35 PM] sorin90#6811
That wasn't a good answer.


[24-Feb-20 02:35 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
it doesnt move on its own, but almost surely will move


[24-Feb-20 02:35 PM] sorin90#6811
Normally nothing is stationarry in this world.


[24-Feb-20 02:35 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
the thing that stumps me is that it is rarely used today


[24-Feb-20 02:35 PM] scubapanda#2485
cartwheel 🙂


[24-Feb-20 02:35 PM] figgy132#7531
17 is it a weapon


[24-Feb-20 02:35 PM] Animal#2514
17.yes


[24-Feb-20 02:35 PM] sorin90#6811
Even if you leave a coin on the ground it still moves.


[24-Feb-20 02:35 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
thats why 'stationary?' is a bad question


[24-Feb-20 02:35 PM] looye29#2126
It is not only wood so there might be metal

should we make a rule?

no 'swiping' another users answer


[24-Feb-20 02:47 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
if a user suggests the final correct answer first, he should get something

No, numbered answers matter.


[24-Feb-20 02:47 PM] sorin90#6811
It was fine. Looye got the 12 kmd anyway. As he would have if he was the winner.

`. Samurai possessed many different kinds of swords, which went through many changes in their design over the years. Some of these are: chokutu, kodachi, tachi, katana, odachi, wakizashi ,tanto and uchigatana.`

Plastic objects where not created until the 1900s or so.

no we do not know whetrher it is an invention or a natural object


[24-Feb-20 03:00 PM] sorin90#6811
So it's something before 1900. Most likely not plastic


[24-Feb-20 03:00 PM] scubapanda#2485
If it's not human made it's not invented.

Hmm. That's good.. But how about we see what's it used for, first.

@Hember | $ARRR let's go with man made atm

It is invented. unlikely to be natural


[24-Feb-20 03:02 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
it can be a neuron star...the usecase is not clear with neutron stars

@𝙊𝙞𝙣𝙠 he didn't said it was invented.

I meant Oinks issue


[24-Feb-20 03:03 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
no can be "no it was never invented" or "no it was invented before 1900"

that way we would at least have some idea of how it can be used and what it is made of


[24-Feb-20 03:05 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341

He has a hard time deciding


[24-Feb-20 03:06 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
'object'


[24-Feb-20 03:06 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
we need to talk about that word


[24-Feb-20 03:06 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[24-Feb-20 03:07 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341

[24-Feb-20 03:07 PM] sorin90#6811
@Dr.Terminus he said it's an object


[24-Feb-20 03:07 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
it is a 'thing'


[24-Feb-20 03:07 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
idea is not an object


[24-Feb-20 03:07 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
a thing not an object.. that can be animal then, too


[24-Feb-20 03:07 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
just dont want you guys to go too far thinking it MUST be a physical 'object'


[24-Feb-20 03:07 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
living thing..


[24-Feb-20 03:07 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
object denotes absolute physicality does it not ?


[24-Feb-20 03:07 PM] sorin90#6811
Yes


[24-Feb-20 03:07 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341

[24-Feb-20 03:08 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
swaping out answer of yes.. its a 'thing' .. not so necessarily an 'object'


[24-Feb-20 03:08 PM] sorin90#6811
Anorher one of that kind.


[24-Feb-20 03:08 PM] sorin90#6811
Ir's a word or something like that.

last hint from me in this direction.. otherwise i may give too much


[24-Feb-20 03:10 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
is it an object: 'sometimes' would be fair / true


[24-Feb-20 03:10 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
sounds like water


[24-Feb-20 03:10 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

I don't follow. How is it sometimes and object?


[24-Feb-20 03:10 PM] Well Done#8264
Maybe It is to comunícate

[24-Feb-20 03:11 PM] sorin90#6811
@Well Done srill an object


[24-Feb-20 03:11 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

dont get too caught up.. I only interjected to clarify that it is more certainly a 'thing' than an 'object'


[24-Feb-20 03:12 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
this got weird..


[24-Feb-20 03:12 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

but it is more a thing than an object


[24-Feb-20 03:14 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
replace 'object' with 'thing'


[24-Feb-20 03:14 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
its a thing


[24-Feb-20 03:14 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
what was 4 ?


[24-Feb-20 03:14 PM] sorin90#6811
Or can it be objectified because ppl call it object insted of word or what ever it is.


[24-Feb-20 03:14 PM] PeLe | $ARRR#1096
Is it man made?

not about size / strength


[24-Feb-20 03:24 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

we do not have any idea what type of thing this is as it is not a solid thing and it seems that it is at the same time an idea and a physical thing, but it is more of an idea, i guess..

materials like skins, paper, metals


[24-Feb-20 03:34 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
can be lifted, but can be quantified not to be able to lift


[24-Feb-20 03:35 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
i mean.. you can give / argue the 'utility' to most anything.. not apparent at first but I think this is a bit nebulous


[24-Feb-20 03:35 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
does it have a monetary value?

Someone ask if it's a memory. Or something we keep in our mind.


[24-Feb-20 03:57 PM] looye29#2126
If you take away the sentences "it love" then it is a feeling


[24-Feb-20 03:57 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
you use it but not daily


[24-Feb-20 03:57 PM] sorin90#6811

[24-Feb-20 03:58 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
but not necessarily specially a feeling / emotion

yes, take away love and give harmony, that is peace


[24-Feb-20 04:05 PM] sorin90#6811
But how is peace negative


[24-Feb-20 04:05 PM] sorin90#6811
That's it. Karma.

Those are both. Good and bad. You feel them and it can be harmony

tricky 🙂 love it


[24-Feb-20 04:15 PM] sorin90#6811
That's why persons and objects are better.


[24-Feb-20 04:15 PM] Oszy#5734
Ying yang is philosophy


[24-Feb-20 04:15 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
symbols should be prohibited


[24-Feb-20 04:15 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
and can be a symbol


[24-Feb-20 04:15 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
which embodies the concept


[24-Feb-20 04:15 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
i answered right!!!


[24-Feb-20 04:15 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
and you can wear the symbol


[24-Feb-20 04:15 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
i said philosophy


[24-Feb-20 04:15 PM] looye29#2126
I choose the symbol


[24-Feb-20 04:15 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
@looye29 and I actually agreed his full technical answer is 'yin yang symbol'


[24-Feb-20 04:15 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
kys


[24-Feb-20 04:15 PM] Oszy#5734
Yea but cant guess k of something that can be many things thats bs


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] looye29#2126
Which can be written any were and mad on anything


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
this symbol can be drawn in sand


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] looye29#2126
Even a tattoo


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] sorin90#6811
It really depends on they way you look at it. That's why you can mislead people


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
and has monetary value sometimes...


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
prob first was first drawn in dirt,, impossible to pick up


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
can wear the symbol


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
but that isnät like the main idea of the symbol


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
harmony is key


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] sorin90#6811
And how does it have a monetary value?


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
it was very tough 🙂


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
it sometimes' can


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] looye29#2126
If you make a golden chain with this symbol it has value


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
stupid game...


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] sorin90#6811
How?


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
a ying yang earing costs


[24-Feb-20 04:16 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ying yang table costs


[24-Feb-20 04:17 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
also tough to pick up


[24-Feb-20 04:17 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
the symbol itself has value?


[24-Feb-20 04:17 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
monetary value


[24-Feb-20 04:17 PM] Oszy#5734
Omg


[24-Feb-20 04:17 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
no


[24-Feb-20 04:17 PM] sorin90#6811
For real? So if I think of a person I say it has value because we can make statuets of it?


[24-Feb-20 04:17 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
this was fricking confusing


[24-Feb-20 04:17 PM] looye29#2126
Symbol is put on material and material has value


[24-Feb-20 04:17 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
this will help us refine the game


[24-Feb-20 04:17 PM] PeLe | $ARRR#1096
But that symbol is always made of material


[24-Feb-20 04:17 PM] PeLe | $ARRR#1096
No?


[24-Feb-20 04:18 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
the first secret in this game was 'death star'


[24-Feb-20 04:18 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
air can have monetary value if you sell it to spacestation


[24-Feb-20 04:18 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
:DDD


[24-Feb-20 04:18 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
a thing which only exists in world of imaginary


[24-Feb-20 04:18 PM] PeLe | $ARRR#1096
And you said it's not material


[24-Feb-20 04:18 PM] sorin90#6811
No itvs not. You have to give the answer dependong on the secrret itself


[24-Feb-20 04:18 PM] Oszy#5734
It could have been a bloody swastika as well it matches all the hints


[24-Feb-20 04:18 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
it can be material


[24-Feb-20 04:18 PM] sorin90#6811
If itvs non material it has no value as a simbol


[24-Feb-20 04:18 PM] PeLe | $ARRR#1096
> Symbol is put on material and material has value
@looye29
OK?


[24-Feb-20 04:18 PM] looye29#2126
Sometimes it is material


[24-Feb-20 04:18 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
yin yang symbols are necklace pendants


[24-Feb-20 04:18 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
printed on t shirts


[24-Feb-20 04:19 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
you should make a list about the things here so people might have an idea that there could be this kind of things too...


[24-Feb-20 04:19 PM] sorin90#6811
Those are necklacea not the symbol itself


[24-Feb-20 04:19 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
a little good in all evil a little evil in all good is what the symbol conveys


[24-Feb-20 04:19 PM] sorin90#6811
The secret was ying yang not what ppl do with it.


[24-Feb-20 04:19 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
thats why 'sometimes' answers


[24-Feb-20 04:19 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
not always


[24-Feb-20 04:19 PM] Well Done#8264
Today was my yin yang not on the top😊


[24-Feb-20 04:19 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
sometimes its regarded as one thing


[24-Feb-20 04:19 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
other times, its another entirely


[24-Feb-20 04:19 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
thats why i interjected like 30 times this round


[24-Feb-20 04:20 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
i think the answer was not something that is supported by the idea of this game


[24-Feb-20 04:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
even hinted at things getting deep


[24-Feb-20 04:20 PM] sorin90#6811
That was misleading to. You have to answer only about that word. Not what ppl do with it.


[24-Feb-20 04:20 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
like think about a horse and then a symbol


[24-Feb-20 04:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
spoke of it being 'materialized' / 'objectified'


[24-Feb-20 04:20 PM] sorin90#6811
If I make a neclake with peace that doesn't mean peace is material sometimes.


[24-Feb-20 04:20 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
peace symbol' is


[24-Feb-20 04:20 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
at one point I thought i would answer Tao... when we talked about peace


[24-Feb-20 04:20 PM] PeLe | $ARRR#1096
I asked if it was made out of any material and you said forget material, but didn't say sometimes.. Hahahha


[24-Feb-20 04:21 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
'you chose yin yang symbol' the symbol which embodies its concept'


[24-Feb-20 04:21 PM] Oszy#5734
Ying yang is a philosophy regardless you put the symbol on an object that will still be just an 9bject with ying yang on it

that is from my chat with @looye29


[24-Feb-20 04:21 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
the symbol can be worn


[24-Feb-20 04:21 PM] sorin90#6811
As hember said. Even a horse can be objectived of you want and if someone asks is it an animal you can say sometimes because you can draw it.


[24-Feb-20 04:21 PM] sorin90#6811
Or make a statue of it.


[24-Feb-20 04:21 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
i feel like this was too hard and too vague


[24-Feb-20 04:21 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I tried to put people onto 'thing' rather than 'object' # 2


[24-Feb-20 04:22 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
but iut can' be an object


[24-Feb-20 04:22 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
sometimes


[24-Feb-20 04:22 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
i understand that ar you two knew the answer it doesnät feel so hard

If I talk about jesus and they ask me is it a person should I say sometimes, because you can see it it pictures or statuets?


[24-Feb-20 04:22 PM] looye29#2126
It is a thing but expressed in objects was the hint


[24-Feb-20 04:22 PM] Oszy#5734
Thing doesn't described it for me at all. Maybe i don't fully understand what a thing is. It's too broad


[24-Feb-20 04:22 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
people pose and learn through symbols


[24-Feb-20 04:22 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
'person place or thing' is a common iteration of the game

but that makes it very narrow, and immediately defined from the start


[24-Feb-20 04:23 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
why was the hint "a thing" when it should have been "a symbol"?


[24-Feb-20 04:23 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
'yin yang symbol'


[24-Feb-20 04:23 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
this was thew secret


[24-Feb-20 04:23 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
or a "shape"


[24-Feb-20 04:23 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

you would perhaps have to burn 3 to deduce

it was fair as could be made gang

"thing" is misleading and "symbol" isnt


[24-Feb-20 04:28 PM] sorin90#6811
So if the secret was yin yang symbol it can't be a feeling or state of mind.


[24-Feb-20 04:28 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
i know symbol would give out "too much"


[24-Feb-20 04:28 PM] sorin90#6811
We should do something in the rules to cross this things out.


[24-Feb-20 04:28 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
but that is the whole point of not misleading

i actually nearly hinted towards the common iteration of this game being 'person/place/thing/idea'

but didnt

in a game of person place or thing


[24-Feb-20 04:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ideas not allowed?


[24-Feb-20 04:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

Ideea is. But the idea in itvs sence.


[24-Feb-20 04:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
how did I misguide? I spent an hour trying to set you guys on the path!

and you got close!!!!


[24-Feb-20 04:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
i guided


[24-Feb-20 04:30 PM] sorin90#6811
Democracy for ex is an indeea. But it can sometimes be objectified or have value if you write a book on it.


[24-Feb-20 04:31 PM] looye29#2126
Nearly close, 5 - 10 min and you had guessed it


[24-Feb-20 04:31 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
i think the guide should use settled semantics


[24-Feb-20 04:31 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
so you neet to define the word when you use it


[24-Feb-20 04:31 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
thing does not point to symbol


[24-Feb-20 04:31 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[24-Feb-20 04:32 PM] sorin90#6811
@looye29 not really with the hints we has. Even I with nirvana and those things disregarded the value and objectification whem I said them


[24-Feb-20 04:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
if you guys wanna make it 'person place or thing' we can do that


[24-Feb-20 04:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
and forevermore


[24-Feb-20 04:32 PM] sorin90#6811
The game was ok. But we should add a few rules.


[24-Feb-20 04:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
ideas, concepts, philosophies, etc.. either all fall under 'thing'


[24-Feb-20 04:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
or are not allowed


[24-Feb-20 04:33 PM] sorin90#6811
Better not to allow them. Or make it a bit strikter.


[24-Feb-20 04:33 PM] PeLe | $ARRR#1096
> what more could i have done other than just hand over his answer
@Dr.Terminus
You could have said it's sometimes made of a material.. We wouldn't go into emotions and non material path


[24-Feb-20 04:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
or


[24-Feb-20 04:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I just start shutting down secrte holder ideas


[24-Feb-20 04:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
saying


[24-Feb-20 04:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
no


[24-Feb-20 04:33 PM] sorin90#6811
Because all ideas can be objectified or with a value.


[24-Feb-20 04:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
they will have too hard a time with that


[24-Feb-20 04:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
too challenging


[24-Feb-20 04:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[24-Feb-20 04:34 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
ideas, symbols, concepts, philosophies should be described with these words, not things. a hammer is an object... buit describe to me what a "thing" really means? what are the limits of being a thing?


[24-Feb-20 04:34 PM] sorin90#6811

We'll also have to talk to terminus and see if he will agree to add a few rules.


[24-Feb-20 04:37 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
Rules v 0.2:
1. One active / latest winning player will inform ONLY Dr.Terminus of their secret answer for the round. (Once confirmed the start of the round will be announced.)

2. If an active player can pose a solution which cannot be guessed after 20 cumulative individual / group questions then the active player will receive the entirety of that rounds stated reward. (A final solution posed as the 21st question/entry will be the last accepted)

3. If an active players solution is guessed within 20 questions the #cryptopuzzle channel will receive 50% Rain of that rounds stated rewards and the user who provides the correct final solution will receive the remaining 50%.

4. No consecutive questions by any one user. (One individual user can ask multiple questions on their own, but after posing a question they must wait for another user to pose a question before posting an additional one themself)

5. The active/winning player is limited to answering all questions posed with: [ yes / no / sometimes / usually / rarely ] So please only ask questions which can be answered accordingly.

6. Final answers should be provided with the appropriate answer number preceding the answer, otherwise it will not be regarded an answer, rather open discussion.

> 4.idea?
@Dr.Terminus
Idea and thing are different here.


[24-Feb-20 04:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
now saying


[24-Feb-20 04:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
lets name the game that


[24-Feb-20 04:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
wtf man


[24-Feb-20 04:41 PM] looye29#2126
New round


[24-Feb-20 04:41 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
it is an abstract idea in your head if it is an abstract symbol not displaying a horse or a penis


[24-Feb-20 04:41 PM] looye29#2126
Good luck


[24-Feb-20 04:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
either people are, or are not ok with letting conceptual things fall under catergory of 'things


[24-Feb-20 04:41 PM] sorin90#6811
So a word that's both it's not that good.


[24-Feb-20 04:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
i dont know how else to word that phrase without referring to them as 'things


[24-Feb-20 04:42 PM] sorin90#6811
And from that ppl can be misslead. But if you think the game is ok like it is, it's fine.


[24-Feb-20 04:42 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
1. is it a penis? kidding


[24-Feb-20 04:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
1.person?


[24-Feb-20 04:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
2. place?


[24-Feb-20 04:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
3.physical thing?


[24-Feb-20 04:42 PM] sorin90#6811
1. Is it a person?


[24-Feb-20 04:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
4.conceptual thing?


[24-Feb-20 04:42 PM] looye29#2126

[24-Feb-20 04:43 PM] sorin90#6811
Dead guy.


[24-Feb-20 04:43 PM] sorin90#6811
Should we see what he did?


[24-Feb-20 04:43 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
yeah...maybe a scientist or a religion leader


[24-Feb-20 04:43 PM] sorin90#6811
Or political person


[24-Feb-20 04:44 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
or an artist


[24-Feb-20 04:44 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
hmm...


[24-Feb-20 04:44 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
i think we can ask these. we will still have at least 10 left when e work this out


[24-Feb-20 04:44 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
(can be a singer, too)


[24-Feb-20 04:44 PM] sorin90#6811
Ok. Go woth something you want. I think he is a political person or scientist.


[24-Feb-20 04:45 PM] sorin90#6811
Singer is an artist.


[24-Feb-20 04:45 PM] sorin90#6811
King is political.


[24-Feb-20 04:45 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
true... if we ask is he an artist first. is he isnät then we can go to the other route


[24-Feb-20 04:45 PM] sorin90#6811
So with those 4 we should be able to cover all major persons


[24-Feb-20 04:45 PM] sorin90#6811
Let's go with scientist or politics


[24-Feb-20 04:46 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
4 scientist?


[24-Feb-20 04:46 PM] looye29#2126
4. No


[24-Feb-20 04:46 PM] sorin90#6811
5. Political person?


[24-Feb-20 04:46 PM] looye29#2126
5. Yes


[24-Feb-20 04:46 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
nice


[24-Feb-20 04:46 PM] sorin90#6811
Ok. A dead former leader.


[24-Feb-20 04:47 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
gandhi or caesar


[24-Feb-20 04:47 PM] sorin90#6811
Should we try finding the country?


[24-Feb-20 04:47 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
a region?


[24-Feb-20 04:47 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
like...


[24-Feb-20 04:47 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
hmm.. europe, asia...


[24-Feb-20 04:47 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
eurasia?


[24-Feb-20 04:47 PM] sorin90#6811
Gandhi was mostly religious leader.


[24-Feb-20 04:47 PM] sorin90#6811
Yeah. Europe or usa.


[24-Feb-20 04:47 PM] sorin90#6811
I think usa.


[24-Feb-20 04:47 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
where is looey from?


[24-Feb-20 04:47 PM] sorin90#6811

Idk.


[24-Feb-20 04:48 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
if he is from usa, then the answer is from usa


[24-Feb-20 04:48 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
😄


[24-Feb-20 04:48 PM] sorin90#6811
Europe


[24-Feb-20 04:48 PM] sorin90#6811
He's dutch


[24-Feb-20 04:48 PM] looye29#2126
Should be in bed


[24-Feb-20 04:48 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
ok...then it may be even hitler


[24-Feb-20 04:48 PM] looye29#2126
Haha


[24-Feb-20 04:48 PM] sorin90#6811
I remember him saying he only knows the word in dutch


[24-Feb-20 04:48 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
ok


[24-Feb-20 04:48 PM] sorin90#6811
Ok. Could be. We planted a subliminal message in him.


[24-Feb-20 04:49 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
then he is dutch, lets take this perspectice


[24-Feb-20 04:49 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
dead european politician


[24-Feb-20 04:49 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
or stalin


[24-Feb-20 04:49 PM] sorin90#6811
Q6?


[24-Feb-20 04:49 PM] sorin90#6811
Go for europe then


[24-Feb-20 04:49 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
yeah


[24-Feb-20 04:49 PM] sorin90#6811
Your turn to ask.


[24-Feb-20 04:49 PM] sorin90#6811
Or pick one.


[24-Feb-20 04:50 PM] sorin90#6811
You might be lucky


[24-Feb-20 04:50 PM] sorin90#6811
Wait


[24-Feb-20 04:50 PM] sorin90#6811
Letvs try the time frame.


[24-Feb-20 04:50 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
yes


[24-Feb-20 04:50 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
oh, true


[24-Feb-20 04:50 PM] sorin90#6811
Because of it's under 1700 is really unlikely to be usa.


[24-Feb-20 04:50 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
true


[24-Feb-20 04:50 PM] sorin90#6811
Or the 2 american continents.


[24-Feb-20 04:51 PM] sorin90#6811
Australia and africa.


[24-Feb-20 04:51 PM] sorin90#6811
So under 1700 should be europe or asia.


[24-Feb-20 04:51 PM] sorin90#6811
Should we try the time frame?


[24-Feb-20 04:51 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
we can go for that


[24-Feb-20 04:51 PM] sorin90#6811
Ok. Go ahead. Pick a nice year


[24-Feb-20 04:51 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
but if it is after that it can still be anywhere


[24-Feb-20 04:52 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
like chavez, castro, stalin, mussolini etc


[24-Feb-20 04:52 PM] sorin90#6811
True.. But we have a time frame.


[24-Feb-20 04:52 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
saddam


[24-Feb-20 04:52 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
ok


[24-Feb-20 04:53 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
this way: did he die before 1776?


[24-Feb-20 04:53 PM] sorin90#6811
Lol. That was really specific


[24-Feb-20 04:53 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
yeah, the independence of usa


[24-Feb-20 04:53 PM] sorin90#6811
But the americans where still in the usa by then.


[24-Feb-20 04:54 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
hmm...


[24-Feb-20 04:54 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
ok, can you frame this


[24-Feb-20 04:54 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
im getting really tire


[24-Feb-20 04:54 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
d


[24-Feb-20 04:54 PM] sorin90#6811
But it's a good question. Not many ppl died before 1776 that where important in the usa history


[24-Feb-20 04:54 PM] sorin90#6811
@looye29


[24-Feb-20 04:54 PM] looye29#2126
Hi


[24-Feb-20 04:55 PM] sorin90#6811
Your question was really good  @Hember | $ARRR


[24-Feb-20 04:55 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
6. did he die before 1776?


[24-Feb-20 04:55 PM] looye29#2126
6. No


[24-Feb-20 04:55 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
ok, se it is more recent and now he can be from anywhere


[24-Feb-20 04:55 PM] sorin90#6811
Ok. So not ancient. Still dead.


[24-Feb-20 04:55 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
we need a region


[24-Feb-20 04:55 PM] sorin90#6811
Should I ask about europe or usa?


[24-Feb-20 04:56 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
shall we go europe or eurasia?


[24-Feb-20 04:56 PM] sorin90#6811
Europe. Eurasia will require 2 more questions.


[24-Feb-20 04:56 PM] sorin90#6811
We could also ask of he was a president. That should rule out dictators if he was.


[24-Feb-20 04:57 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
hitler was chosen through elections


[24-Feb-20 04:57 PM] sorin90#6811
They're not technically presidents.


[24-Feb-20 04:57 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
dunno about mussolini


[24-Feb-20 04:57 PM] sorin90#6811
Yeah but a supreem leader is not a president.


[24-Feb-20 04:57 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
lets go firts with region


[24-Feb-20 04:57 PM] sorin90#6811
Ok.


[24-Feb-20 04:57 PM] sorin90#6811

[24-Feb-20 04:59 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
ok, so it will be russia or latin america


[24-Feb-20 04:59 PM] sorin90#6811
Should I ask russia or asia?


[24-Feb-20 05:00 PM] sorin90#6811
Not many important figures in asia except russia


[24-Feb-20 05:00 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341

[24-Feb-20 05:00 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
i donät know anything about like china or so...


[24-Feb-20 05:00 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341

[24-Feb-20 05:00 PM] sorin90#6811
Russia is in europe.


[24-Feb-20 05:00 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341

he is a dutch


[24-Feb-20 05:01 PM] sorin90#6811
That's why he did see it as part of europe


[24-Feb-20 05:01 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
im finnish and for me russia is not europe


[24-Feb-20 05:01 PM] looye29#2126

[24-Feb-20 05:02 PM] sorin90#6811

[24-Feb-20 05:02 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341

[24-Feb-20 05:03 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
communist might be a good one.. although marxism-leninism was quite different from stalinism :DDD


[24-Feb-20 05:03 PM] sorin90#6811
9. Communist?


[24-Feb-20 05:03 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341

[24-Feb-20 05:05 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
how should we frame this?


[24-Feb-20 05:05 PM] sorin90#6811

after 1776


[24-Feb-20 05:08 PM] sorin90#6811
Rasputin cam't be it. Because he wasn't political.


[24-Feb-20 05:09 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341

those altar boys had tough time...


[24-Feb-20 05:10 PM] sorin90#6811
Since the tsarine loved him so much.. Maybe


[24-Feb-20 05:10 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
ok, lets concentrate


[24-Feb-20 05:10 PM] sorin90#6811
Hmmm. Now. Not communist but dead.


[24-Feb-20 05:10 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
russian political figure, not a monarch nor a communist


[24-Feb-20 05:11 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
gorbatshov was still a communist, i think


[24-Feb-20 05:11 PM] sorin90#6811
Should have a time frame between 1776 and 1917. Or so


[24-Feb-20 05:11 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
but jeltsin wasnät


[24-Feb-20 05:11 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
yeah!


[24-Feb-20 05:11 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
lets rule out time


[24-Feb-20 05:11 PM] sorin90#6811
Yes. He was the dude that made the transfer from commies to dems.


[24-Feb-20 05:11 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
yeah


[24-Feb-20 05:12 PM] sorin90#6811
After 1917 toll 1990 all of them where commies. So it's a no no in that time frame


[24-Feb-20 05:12 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
shuld we ask if he dies between 1776-1917?...if we ask whether he lived, he could have lived before 1917 but carry on living


[24-Feb-20 05:12 PM] sorin90#6811
Gimme a sec.


[24-Feb-20 05:13 PM] sorin90#6811
You can. And add russia in the q


[24-Feb-20 05:14 PM] sorin90#6811
Maybe the hint wasn't a good one.


[24-Feb-20 05:14 PM] sorin90#6811
Or ask the time frame and ask if he's russian after that


[24-Feb-20 05:14 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
yeah


[24-Feb-20 05:14 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341

[24-Feb-20 05:14 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341

[24-Feb-20 05:14 PM] looye29#2126

Because he could have died after 1917. And still not be a commie


[24-Feb-20 05:15 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341

@looye29


[24-Feb-20 05:19 PM] sorin90#6811
Ok. Nvm. But don't add hint. If itvs not a hint.


[24-Feb-20 05:20 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
we lost at least 2-3 questions because of that "hint"


[24-Feb-20 05:20 PM] Hember | $ARRR#5341

@Hember | $ARRR have a good night


[24-Feb-20 05:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I thought I had good idea


[24-Feb-20 05:30 PM] looye29#2126
Sorin was earlier but didn't had a number


[24-Feb-20 05:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
1 designated person to submit answers


[24-Feb-20 05:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
that person too can suggest answers


[24-Feb-20 05:30 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
whoever suggested the officially submitted answer (first in this chat) gets the reward


[24-Feb-20 05:30 PM] looye29#2126
Than Sorin, sorry


[24-Feb-20 05:31 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550

[24-Feb-20 05:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
one person gets the 12.5


[24-Feb-20 05:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
another gets the next secret


[24-Feb-20 05:32 PM] sorin90#6811
Cuz you only posted a question not an answer. 😂


[24-Feb-20 05:32 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[24-Feb-20 05:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[24-Feb-20 05:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[24-Feb-20 05:33 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550

[24-Feb-20 05:33 PM] sorin90#6811
I don't but. Last time he did the secred he missleaded us 2 timez. And that wasn't fair.


[24-Feb-20 05:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
where was the mislead last time?


[24-Feb-20 05:33 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[24-Feb-20 05:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you guys figured it out though.. just shenanigans at the end


[24-Feb-20 05:34 PM] sorin90#6811
He said yes to a question the after we asked 5 more he said he meant no. And then again.


[24-Feb-20 05:34 PM] sorin90#6811
Not looye. I'm talking about crumb.


[24-Feb-20 05:34 PM] sorin90#6811
And then did it the same. Once again.


[24-Feb-20 05:34 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
that was my mistake yes, i apologize for that


[24-Feb-20 05:34 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
i was not intentional


[24-Feb-20 05:34 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
so mistakes can be made ?!


[24-Feb-20 05:34 PM] sorin90#6811
2 times and we lost about 8 questions.


[24-Feb-20 05:35 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
your feelings hurt when something similar happens


[24-Feb-20 05:35 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[24-Feb-20 05:35 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550

[24-Feb-20 05:35 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550

[24-Feb-20 05:35 PM] sorin90#6811
And last time I hosted a secret ahmead said does he have a tesla and crumb imediatley stepped in to take the word.


[24-Feb-20 05:36 PM] sorin90#6811
Now today he yeald that he gave the sword word and it's not fair.


[24-Feb-20 05:36 PM] sorin90#6811
Ivm out. Have a gn.


[24-Feb-20 05:36 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
Ahmed worded his questions poorly


[24-Feb-20 05:36 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
not my fault

I don't think I can play with ppl like crumb


[24-Feb-20 05:38 PM] sorin90#6811
I hate when ppl only want to take advantage and then cry their the victims.


[24-Feb-20 05:39 PM] sorin90#6811
That's a real shitty move


[24-Feb-20 05:39 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

lets all cool out


[24-Feb-20 05:39 PM] sorin90#6811
Fk the money if it's fking my day.


[24-Feb-20 05:39 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
rules get refined a bit, but long run, this kind of attitude stops or the game stops


[24-Feb-20 05:39 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
i am apologizing and saying i do not meant to be a dick


[24-Feb-20 05:39 PM] sorin90#6811
Ivm better without that money if my day is peacefull


[24-Feb-20 05:39 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
what more do you want me to do?


[24-Feb-20 05:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
sniping the answer was mean


[24-Feb-20 05:40 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
i can stop playing too , actually


[24-Feb-20 05:40 PM] sorin90#6811
You don't wanna be a dick?


[24-Feb-20 05:40 PM] sorin90#6811
> sniping the answer was mean
@Dr.Terminus that was a rule for 2 games now


[24-Feb-20 05:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you didnt even ever say 'KATANA'


[24-Feb-20 05:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
which was the precie answer


[24-Feb-20 05:40 PM] sorin90#6811
Nah man. You can keep playing.


[24-Feb-20 05:40 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
not samurai sword


[24-Feb-20 05:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
still you got 1 kmd


[24-Feb-20 05:41 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
katana is a samurai sword


[24-Feb-20 05:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you didnt say katana


[24-Feb-20 05:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
which is specific type


[24-Feb-20 05:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you narrowed it


[24-Feb-20 05:41 PM] sorin90#6811
You already took 2 wins fromnother player. How is that not being a dick?


[24-Feb-20 05:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
but did not isolate


[24-Feb-20 05:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
like saying sandwich


[24-Feb-20 05:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
not rueben


[24-Feb-20 05:41 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
ok, lets do it like this. i will not play anymore


[24-Feb-20 05:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
or just play fair


[24-Feb-20 05:42 PM] sorin90#6811
Wtf. Ahmed said does he own tesla and you still got the win. And now you say katana is the same with samurai sword.


[24-Feb-20 05:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
and not spitefully


[24-Feb-20 05:42 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
i do not want to cause all kinds of drama


[24-Feb-20 05:42 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
anymore at least


[24-Feb-20 05:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
and not opportunistically or manipulatively


[24-Feb-20 05:42 PM] sorin90#6811
You're the drama. You started all this.


[24-Feb-20 05:42 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I had no problem until you sniped answer


[24-Feb-20 05:42 PM] sorin90#6811
We wanted to iron the rules and you started crying it was not fair.


[24-Feb-20 05:43 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
stil la bit confused why you feel so screwed out of NOT getting the final correct secret answer to prior round


[24-Feb-20 05:43 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
KATANA ws answer


[24-Feb-20 05:43 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
not samurai


[24-Feb-20 05:43 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
and this last game is going to be my **last**, everybody happy now


[24-Feb-20 05:43 PM] sorin90#6811
And now you're still crying about not getting the win with katana. 🤦


[24-Feb-20 05:43 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
i am not taking part of this game anymore


[24-Feb-20 05:43 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I suggested we cool it.


[24-Feb-20 05:43 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
do what you gotta do


[24-Feb-20 05:44 PM] sorin90#6811
You gotta learn that human is not just a word. You gotta be honest and fair.


[24-Feb-20 05:44 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
no more blame


[24-Feb-20 05:44 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
i apologized for my behaviour, and i meant it


[24-Feb-20 05:45 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
no more accusation


[24-Feb-20 05:45 PM] sorin90#6811
Tmterminus is trying to do someting nice with his own money. And ppl are trying to enjoy it.


[24-Feb-20 05:45 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
the game is what it is when active secret holder and me as moderator join forces


[24-Feb-20 05:45 PM] sorin90#6811
I really donvt think you do. A person that does it. Doesn't act like you.


[24-Feb-20 05:46 PM] sorin90#6811
I'm done now. Have a gn. Thx for the game.


[24-Feb-20 05:46 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I make it as fair as I can. If initial rule specificity is all that needs tweaking then fine, it'll get worked out

@Dr.Terminus First of all, thank you for arranging the games & everyone for playing - it has been fun! Also, your game and your rules Dr.T! I'm happy with your decisions, which ever way you decide. 
Regarding requiring a number in the beginning of an actual answer.. I think that would be good because otherwise we can't distinguish 'team' talk and real answer attempts? Anyway, I hope we can have more fun & games in  the coming weeks and everyone comes back to play!

20 Questions (+1) Rules v 0.3:
1.One active / latest winning player will inform ONLY Dr.Terminus of their secret answer for the round. (Once confirmed the start of the round will be announced.)

2. Valid secret categories include: [People, Places, Animals, Plants , Objects, Ideas]

(Secrets can be drawn from our waking reality, as well as our pop culture movie / television / literary / music industry)

(Theories, concepts, religions, symbols, philosophies, fables, lyrics, quotes, etc. ALL fall under the broad category 'idea')

3. If the active player can pose a solution which cannot be guessed after 20 cumulative individual / group questions then the active player will receive the entirety of that rounds stated reward. (A final solution posed as the 21st question/entry will be the last accepted)

4. If an active players solution is guessed within 20 questions the #cryptopuzzle channel will receive 50% Rain of that rounds stated rewards and the user who provides the correct final solution will receive the remaining 50%.

5. No consecutive questions by any one user. (One individual user can ask multiple questions on their own, but after posing a question they must wait for another user to pose a question before posting an additional one themself)

6. The active/winning player is limited to answering all questions posed with: [ yes / no / sometimes / usually / rarely ] So please only ask questions which can be answered accordingly.

7. Final answers should be provided with the appropriate answer number preceding the answer, otherwise it will not be regarded an answer, rather open discussion.

Go go... Need 9....now!😅


[11-Apr-20 05:54 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
chat, this game requires collaboration to guess the secret within 20 questions


[11-Apr-20 05:55 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you must agree with one another which things you will pose as official questions


[11-Apr-20 05:55 PM] Excommunicado#5736
Ok


[11-Apr-20 05:55 PM] Bico#7646
Ok


[11-Apr-20 05:55 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you do this by specifying '#1 is it a person?'


[11-Apr-20 05:55 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
simple chatting 'is it a person?'


[11-Apr-20 05:55 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
will not be counted as a question


[11-Apr-20 05:56 PM] Bico#7646
Is it a person? @Excommunicado


[11-Apr-20 05:56 PM] Excommunicado#5736
Ok noted


[11-Apr-20 05:56 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
so it is safe to suggest that among other members in the chat to see if they all agree that it is a worthy question


[11-Apr-20 05:56 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
if the chat can figure out the secret within 20 questions +1 extra 'final guess, I will rain 20 kmd to chat


[11-Apr-20 05:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
if chat cannot guess the secret within 20 + 1 questions, then the 20 KMD goes to the person who posed the secret


[11-Apr-20 05:57 PM] Excommunicado#5736
#1 is it a person  @Bico


[11-Apr-20 05:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
hahahahahah


[11-Apr-20 05:57 PM] Bico#7646
Yes..


[11-Apr-20 05:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you guys still dont quite get it


[11-Apr-20 05:57 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
I pick who will select the secret


[11-Apr-20 05:58 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
@Excommunicado you tell me your secret in a private chat so I know you will answer the questions honetly


[11-Apr-20 05:58 PM] Bico#7646
He is a person...  @Excommunicado


[11-Apr-20 05:58 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
then the chat will ask you queations


[11-Apr-20 05:58 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
@Bico nobody knows your secret


[11-Apr-20 05:58 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
how can we trust you??


[11-Apr-20 05:58 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
see?


[11-Apr-20 05:58 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
not your turn


[11-Apr-20 05:58 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you must win a round to get to pick a secret


[11-Apr-20 05:58 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
read pinned rules carefully

everyone understand rules?


[16-Apr-20 06:41 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
20 Questions (+1) Rules v 0.3:
1.One active / latest winning player will inform ONLY Dr.Terminus of their secret answer for the round. (Once confirmed the start of the round will be announced.)

2. Valid secret categories include: [People, Places, Animals, Plants , Objects, Ideas]

(Secrets can be drawn from our waking reality, as well as our pop culture movie / television / literary / music industry)

(Theories, concepts, religions, symbols, philosophies, fables, lyrics, quotes, etc. ALL fall under the broad category 'idea')

3. If the active player can pose a solution which cannot be guessed after 20 cumulative individual / group questions then the active player will receive the entirety of that rounds stated reward. (A final solution posed as the 21st question/entry will be the last accepted)

4. If an active players solution is guessed within 20 questions the #cryptopuzzle channel will receive 50% Rain of that rounds stated rewards and the user who provides the correct final solution will receive the remaining 50%.

5. No consecutive questions by any one user. (One individual user can ask multiple questions on their own, but after posing a question they must wait for another user to pose a question before posting an additional one themself)

6. The active/winning player is limited to answering all questions posed with: [ yes / no / sometimes / usually / rarely ] So please only ask questions which can be answered accordingly.

7. Final answers should be provided with the appropriate answer number preceding the answer, otherwise it will not be regarded an answer, rather open discussion.

[16-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
they have to guess what it is by asking you questions


[16-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you answer their questions honestly


[16-Apr-20 07:00 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
taking random guesses is pointless


[16-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

[16-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
you only get 20


[16-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
asking 'is it a person?' would make a good first question


[16-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269
the official #1 question was 'Moviestar?'


[16-Apr-20 07:01 PM] Dr.Terminus#3269

20 Questions (+1) Rules v 0.3:
1.One active / latest winning player will inform ONLY Dr.Terminus of their secret answer for the round. (Once confirmed the start of the round will be announced.)

2. Valid secret categories include: [People, Places, Animals, Plants , Objects, Ideas]

(Secrets can be drawn from our waking reality, as well as our pop culture movie / television / literary / music industry)

(Theories, concepts, religions, symbols, philosophies, fables, lyrics, quotes, etc. ALL fall under the broad category 'idea')

3. If the active player can pose a solution which cannot be guessed after 20 cumulative individual / group questions then the active player will receive the entirety of that rounds stated reward. (A final solution posed as the 21st question/entry will be the last accepted)

4. If an active players solution is guessed within 20 questions the #cryptopuzzle channel will receive 50% Rain of that rounds stated rewards and the user who provides the correct final solution will receive the remaining 50%.

5. No consecutive questions by any one user. (One individual user can ask multiple questions on their own, but after posing a question they must wait for another user to pose a question before posting an additional one themself)

6. The active/winning player is limited to answering all questions posed with: [ yes / no / sometimes / usually / rarely ] So please only ask questions which can be answered accordingly.

7. Final answers should be provided with the appropriate answer number preceding the answer, otherwise it will not be regarded an answer, rather open discussion.

thanks, can we get a hint? Is it a single word? or multiple words? and is the word in the section of video before you actually talked about the puzzle? or can the word be anywhere in the entire video?

if we find puzzle how we can get funds

the puzzle is a seed, you restore the seed to a wallet and you have access to send the funds to your own address

[03-Jan-21 06:04 PM] Jcharming#2693
@erav3n 
The wallet has been emptied and somebody picked up the treasure chest about 8 minutes after the last post was made.

whoever was actually left a prize behind for somebody else to find and that was picked up about 32 minutes after.

[05-Jan-21 11:47 AM] Jcharming#2693
You're good - I'm not sure if completed seed is published.

@delton are you planning a wrap up ANNC piece or leaving it off so other people can find it on their own if they want to go through the process just for the exploration of it.  

@erav3n we're def going to be doing more of these 'treasure chests' and crypto puzzles


[09-Jan-21 08:21 PM] saskboy#5198
I figured it out second-ish, and sent a smaller prize for someone else after me to claim, but the first person to figure it out saw it and took that too hahahaha, which I guessed might happen, but is okay. If they want to reignite the fun, they could send a couple KMD back to it and start the fuse again so someone else keeps trying.


[09-Jan-21 08:21 PM] saskboy#5198
Had you figured it out? I can share the solution if not.


[09-Jan-21 08:58 PM] Jcharming#2693
Please share away in this channel I'll pin it.  

We have another and more devious treasure chest in the plan for February


[10-Jan-21 03:19 PM] erav3n#9290
No, please share the solution. Still very interested to find where is my own mistake. Thanks in advance.


[10-Jan-21 09:38 PM] saskboy#5198 (pinned)
I'd figured it would be odd words in the text of each webpage and I'd have to experiment a lot to figure it out, but many of the blog posts explicitly stated the words. The complicated ones were the 5-8 words. Those were in a Thursday Town Hall video. I went to it, expecting to have to listen to it, since the blog post related had some odd words I identified, but more than 4 of them, so I needed the extra hint. Then I saw the description and it had random words at the bottom of the video!
Still, there was a twist after that point, as the first word in the video contradicted another hint. The video hint first word was off by a few letters, then I was in.

where x1, x2, x3, x4 - deleted words in the description of Thursday Town Hall video from 17 Dec. Right? Or i'm wrong somewhere?

[12-Jan-21 08:06 AM] Delton#2644
Kitten is in the seed phrase twice, which added a bit of difficulty. Words 5-8 were the most challenging to find.


[13-Jan-21 03:45 PM] saskboy#5198
5-8 is where I was stuck too, until I opened the video, saw the words, got confused about the first word, tried the wrong way first, then the correct way.


[13-Jan-21 03:46 PM] saskboy#5198
PS. put the words back on the video so people of the future can solve it if they go hunting.

cool! when will you post the rest of the words?


[31-Jul-21 06:29 AM] smkhound#7640
there's probably enough info in that image to break the seed. 
A couple more hints will be added this week


[31-Jul-21 06:40 AM] galto#0864
oh ok. I got 7 words and couldn't make anything from the colors. unless it's a custom seed and doesn't need more


[31-Jul-21 06:40 AM] smkhound#7640
it's a bip39 compliant 24 word seed :2561_feelsevilman:

I tried moving the overlay around but it doesnt fit the text


[17-Aug-21 10:04 PM] smkhound#7640
perhaps there's a clue in the metadata


[19-Aug-21 11:06 PM] somdrad#8352
I saw the video, but still cant find the specific stego tool to use

Are you on windows? Might need to use Ubuntu terminal - https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview


[25-Aug-21 12:14 AM] somdrad#8352
Tried every command line tool I could find (linux)


[25-Aug-21 12:14 AM] somdrad#8352
I think some dont work on png file


[25-Aug-21 12:15 AM] somdrad#8352
Maybe I'm missing the correct password


[27-Aug-21 05:39 AM] smkhound#7640
you can DM me to confirm if you want


[29-Aug-21 06:53 AM] somdrad#8352
Nvm, found the map 👀


[29-Aug-21 06:53 AM] somdrad#8352
But now it seems the order of the seed words is missing


[29-Aug-21 07:09 AM] smkhound#7640
it's in there somewhere


[29-Aug-21 07:10 AM] smkhound#7640
if you have all the words, well done, you are close 🐠


[04-Sep-21 03:32 PM] somdrad#8352
Now I see how it could be solved without the map, only 11 bits are enough to encode the wordlist and 13 bits remain the same


[04-Sep-21 03:33 PM] somdrad#8352
With the black squares maybe hinting at RGB -> RBG


[04-Sep-21 03:33 PM] somdrad#8352
But still no sign of the correct order


[05-Sep-21 06:19 PM] smkhound#7640
it's in there somewhere... hints incoming.
August prize stands at 200 KMD
September puzzle will be released this week.
