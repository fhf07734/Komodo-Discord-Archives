Had a discussion with my friend last night about an idea for a game. Its free to play and paid for by product placment, you can so silly things like use your ingame earned crypto to buy a voucher for pizza which allows you to order an actual real life pizza to be delivered. It would be super cool. Not sure how viable it is to create, but we are going to brainstorm it out before I head home.

@siu look in #komodo-pioneers i posted some links to the unity assetstore (game dev) there might be a "fighting" style game template already where you'd only need to supply graphics for your animals.
otherwise, there are html5 frameworks that might have samples of a fighting game that could be modded.
check that channel - i'll keep an eye out as well for something that could fit your purpose, otherwise reddit gamedev and related subreddits might be able to source something to help

We are happy to announce that on block 200,000 COQUI Cash will do a fork to add Crypto Conditions Smart Contracts capability. This fork will add a fully functional Decentralized Token Exchange, capability to create you own token, a decentralized dice game, capability to create rewards programs and a decentralized faucet. 

Please, if you are running a COQUI full node, update your node as soon as possible to evade a fork on your node. 

The new COQUI Cash execution command looks like this: ./komodod -ac_name=COQUI -ac_supply=72000000 -ac_ccactivate=200000
Questions or suggestions are welcomed,

have a nice day everyone.

Hey guys, I just want to let you know I have had a KMD tipbot made for KMD discord.  
If you have your own discord, it will work there for KMD and you are free to use it.

Hi here :).
Barterlly is now open on BETA mode, and will provide tools for users and CoinOwners to perform OTC trades in a safe way.
Any KMD assetchain dPowed will be listed, and supported, for free.
Other coins not already listed can submit a listing application at : https://barterlly.typeform.com/to/iqpS1H
During the BETA, Barterlly won't charge any fee other than the transaction ones. after the release we will charge 1% on top of every transaction.
Our goal is to provide premium tools for coins listed on the platform. (Discord swapbot, twitter integration, public orders, wallet integration, API, custom templating, and many more).
Feel free to join us on our Discord.
https://discord.gg/RHc95zw

Hello everyone! Just wanted to let everyone know that there is a hackathon going on right now at UPR Mayaguez where a total of 10,000 coquis will be given out amongst the top three teams. We will be making a push as a community to grow this network locally and organically amongst students in Puerto Rico.

Check out the devpost here. Will be posting more info as time goes on. Thank you.
