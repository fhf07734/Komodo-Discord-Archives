ADD THIS AMA TO YOUR CALENDAR - https://evt.mx/MxFL58Ly 

A few weeks ago, we've launched one of two new flagship products, the AtomicDEX. Because the feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, we‚Äôve decided to hold an AMA. You can ask the team anything regarding more information about the development, timelines, future plans for AtomicDEX and so on.

We are asking our community to post their questions in this channel, and we'll choose the most popular ones based on how many Ôøº‚¨Ü  each question receives. We will also answer questions live, if time permits.

Ok mate , probably not the most priority request , but have y thought about costum layouts of the Dex? Many trade often and would it be nice to can costomize the Dex ? Darkmode , light mode ok , am talking I upload any picture for background .

A quick suggestion: it would be nice to have market rate for the swap. And also how much the bid price is off the market price. Say for eg, 1 kmd is 1.0 usdc. So if my bid 1,10, I'm +10%.

How quickly can new ERC20 tokens for swapping be added?


[31-Jul-19 03:52 PM] yorklab#7270
The DEX fee is about .13% for takers. Those DEX fees are used to buy KMD. If 5 different projects are using the AtomicDEX back-end software (MM2), do they all have the same basic DEX fee, and are the DEX fees from all those projects used to purchase KMD?

Will you incentive traders for making many trades ? I am thinking a lottery where your amount of trades are entry tickets for some kind of pricepool , example taken from the fees ? Or even more cheap trading fees , like for owning bnb on binance ?


[01-Aug-19 02:49 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Sunshine in my ass with the market maker bot the team is making that connects to CEX, traders will get a bot that will do arb at whatever the user sets as their profit margin

Free money is a good incentive üòÉ

Wow


[01-Aug-19 04:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Now think about someone that sets profit at 5%. So whatever they can buy on the centralized exchanges (market buy), on the dex it will be market price +5%


[01-Aug-19 04:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This guys starts to make money


[01-Aug-19 04:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Now i see this guy making money without doing much, set and forget and re-balance funds when needed.


[01-Aug-19 04:12 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Now i like free money and i set my bot to do price + 4.9% instead


[01-Aug-19 04:13 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Now i am the guy making 5% and i see this guy under cutting me, i either find another pair that the 4.9 guy is not doing or  i under cut him 4.8%


[01-Aug-19 04:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Now image we have instead of 2 people we have 200 people under cutting each other to get the free money


[01-Aug-19 04:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The market will then figure out who will keep providing the liquidity at the lowest fee  and there will be a balance


[01-Aug-19 04:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
This is like the bitcoin hash rate going up. For a period of time when the hash is too high and profits not enough to justify it, some miners back off so the remaining miners get more, then when it is profitable again they jump back in. Market will self regulate


[01-Aug-19 04:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But at the end of the day, we will be the most liquid DEX ever.

@DmitriyIvanov2405, Ask in #ü§ù‚îÇdex-mobile .


[02-Aug-19 01:32 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
are there specific plans in place to have good liquidity for when AtomicDEX is out and usable for everyone? i read that there are plans to use CEX API-s to enable more liquidity. is that for some more distant future or will this be ready once AtomicDEX is launched?
so basically what i'm asking is: what specific steps are being taken to provide as much liquidity as possible?


[02-Aug-19 04:54 PM] yorklab#7270
If 5 different projects are using the AtomicDEX backend for their own DEX, is KMD given the same 10% discount automatically or can they choose not to use the discount?


[03-Aug-19 03:37 AM] smkhound#7640
@crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy afaik, marketmakers via CLI can already integrate CEX APIs if they code in the neccessary calls to replenish their funds after an order has matched. I'll be testing this myself using python next week.
@yorklab I guess certain 3rd party projects may decide to not pass on the discount, but that would meke them less competitive so it would be a silly thing to do.


[03-Aug-19 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
discounted fee is part of the protocol


[03-Aug-19 03:46 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
@smkhound my question was not **if** those things could be done, but more about if there are arrangements/deals with parties in place to provide more liquidity


[03-Aug-19 03:47 AM] jl777c#5810
we are creating automated marketmakers anybody can use


[03-Aug-19 03:49 AM] jl777c#5810
not involved on the deal side, but i heard some potential deals are also in the works, but of course that relies on third parties. when everybody can be a marketmaker and make relatively risk free 5% arbitrage, i think that since people like money, we will get people to do that


[03-Aug-19 03:51 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550

will atomic dex be able to include large corporate  coins like "libra" this would bring in volume on a large scale

if they can do atomic swaps


[03-Aug-19 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810
but they can freeze any transaction or even undo it right? so that seems not a good idea as it breaks the "atomic" property

so if it possible still .a no?

Do we have access to our private keys from the wallet?


[07-Aug-19 10:05 AM] Audo#5667
yes, the seed you use can be transformed into a privatekey format. The seed is also compatible with Verus Agama (for example)


[07-Aug-19 10:06 AM] ca333#0333
and it is accessible from within atomicDEX mobile - visit Settings->View Seed


[07-Aug-19 10:08 AM] cyrelb#6993
But for BTC for example? Do we have to install Verus Agam and the PK is derived from the seed?


[07-Aug-19 10:08 AM] Camilo Lopez#8651
Can you do offchain swaps orders? Because you need internet access to executed the swap. What about be able to open an order offline and execute after been online.


[07-Aug-19 10:12 AM] Smedley#8094
Will coin communities that have a big userbase but lack being a base trading pair on exchanges be contacted to possibly create their own version of atomicdex with their coin as a base pairing? Coins such as dash or dogecoin. This could set the Komodo atomic swap protocol as the baseline of atomic swaps bringing more people into the komodo ecosystem.


[07-Aug-19 10:13 AM] moneystacks#7758
@cyrelb so you asking if you can access your key for a specific coin ?


[07-Aug-19 10:16 AM] ca333#0333
There are many options to transform the Seed to any coins private key in the wallet import format. I believe Verus Agama has this feature. There are many other tools available (like https://github.com/iancoleman/bip39) for this task since we follow the BIP39 standard @cyrelb -  https://github.com/DeckerSU/address_gen is an option which is trusted and Agama seed compatible.

[07-Aug-19 10:17 AM] phm87#7395
I have 3 questions/topics:
1 - if a group of persons wants to add one coin (BTC clone or Dash clone), should the group ask the KMD team to add the coin ? What if the team disagree to add the coin on atomicDEX ?
2 - I heard that the whole backend would be opensource, can you tell me where the repo is ? (maybe code will be released in the future)
3 - (similar question/topic to @Camilo Lopez ) websites such as zigzag.io allows to do trading between offchain (LN) and onchain (BTC, Dash, ...), do you plan to make this happen also on atomicDEX ?

@Smedley yes, additionally - like the komodo community will learn how to become marketmakers, other coin communities will learn how to do it so they can effectively use the dex network.   e.g. run the makerbot which is being developed.  an answer in the linked document explains the CEX/DEX liquidity pool

Hi,
Will direct private trading be possible with Atomicdex through private netids created on private nodes (not created on AtomicDEX), or will this feature only be available on the cli version?


[07-Aug-19 10:21 AM] ca333#0333
@phm87 
1 - are you referring to the mobile application or to an official config integration on the API (mm2) repo?
2 - yes it is available under https://github.com/komodoplatform/atomicdex-api
3 - we are actively exploring other protocols and integration possibilities to improve our DEX technology - there is a prioritisation based on the github issue tickets. I want to invite you to submit this ideas as feature requests and to open the active dev discussion around this topic. We do want to support as many technologies and protocols in atomicDEX as possible.

@ca333  
1 - the question can apply to each one I think (I though it was the same backend for both)
2 - thank you
3 - the problem here is that jl777 have some concerns about LN security (in theory he is right, in reality, it was not exploited yet I heard) and I'm not sure that there is a way to do atomic swap securely between LN and KMD (in theory, it is possible but I'm not 100% sure). One idea can be to restrict topology (as jl777 did for CHIPS) to avoid long routes with possible stealers. I'll put some infos on github


[07-Aug-19 10:25 AM] ca333#0333
there are few options to achieve the "private trade" functionality. Using isolated/custom netIDs on UI side or using a pubkey whitelisting logic on the protocol side. The latter is the goal and more clean implementation.

At the moment dex doesn‚Äôt look good from the ux/ui, design point of view + there are bugs and errors in place which are to be fixed i assume.  Looking at dex now i don‚Äôt see many users using it + i am sure we will face liquidity issues (remember first dex which was used by few ppl only and was not popular at all). What is the plan? When are you planning to polish product and make it public? Will the community see marketing plan?

At what stage in the development process would Komodo like to see interested projects join in?

1 - yes the backend is technically the same but the mobile application has the additional GUI layer. 
Adding a new coin to the atomicDEX API repository is trivial for any external party and consists of a simple set of git PRs. This gives any compatible coin native DEX support. For the mobile application listing projects have to reach out to us since this is considered a enduser application/product and being distribution through our official software distribution channels. i.e. we have to validate things and make sure that everything is good. 
3 - technically it is certainly possible to integrate it and to bridge LN<->atomicDEX. However, I do fully share James security concerns.

@CrisF actually now is the right time - it is an official beta which means we still fix and optimize things. This is the stage where we are still able to modify fundamental layers in the DEX core/protocol but also on the UI/UX side and general system architecture and design. If you are around in other coin communities plz do suggest them to join this beta program and to sign up for the beta. The user feedback is the most valuable thing that devs get from a beta program.

you re very welcome @phm87

@acidbird We are currently in phase 1 of our testing. UX/UI and final feature testing and requests will be the focus of phase 3 of testing.

I showed the beta to a wallet dev and a few others this evening.  They had some very good things to say.

@n2okpride and what about timelines? How long phase 1 will last, phase 2 and 3?


[07-Aug-19 10:42 AM] n2okpride#1967
The goal is to release for general availability once we've met all our testing targets and we have a production ready product with a strong liquidity strategy in place.

I like the question asked by someone about private trades, i think it could be a really nice feature for OTC deals. Like lets say u create a "private order" and get a order ID which u then send to the trade taker which then searsh for the order ID


[07-Aug-19 10:47 AM] moneystacks#7758
Any other questions ? Last chance to get your questions in!


[07-Aug-19 10:48 AM] Markus#5464
Are u looking for potential exchanges to be partnered with to implement MM2?


[07-Aug-19 10:49 AM] Seko#7408
No question from me. I would like to wish Komodo much success with the DEX and say thank you. Thank you for your tireless efforts.

Hi @Markus , the private trade feature was in MM1.  It's quite a useful feature for sure.  Glad to hear it'll be back in MM2.
