Can anyone please validate (or fix) the accuracy of this statement? - "Komodo is testing the limits of payment processing per second, and has already achieved rates faster than Visa and Mastercard. This is achieved through "Grandmother of Merkle" notarisation via linked assetchains, with atomic swap capability allowing parallel chains to act as a single cryptocurrency."


[26-May-18 09:51 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I don't think atomic swaps have anything to do with this system.


[26-May-18 09:51 PM] emmanux#0000
more related to crypto-conditions, i think


[26-May-18 09:51 PM] blackjok3r#0000
yes, crypto conditions and MoMoM .


[26-May-18 09:51 PM] smk762#0000
yeah, thought so. sounds cool but üòõ


[26-May-18 09:53 PM] smk762#0000
anyone got linkage to a good explanation of crypto-conditions?


[26-May-18 09:54 PM] emmanux#0000
there will be a "burning protocol" that will allow crosschain transactions.


[26-May-18 09:54 PM] blackjok3r#0000
https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-04


[26-May-18 09:55 PM] smk762#0000
burn protocol also sounds cool


[26-May-18 09:56 PM] smk762#0000
Better? 
"Komodo is testing the limits of payment processing per second, and has already achieved rates faster than Visa and Mastercard.
This is achieved through "Grandmother of Merkle" notarisation via linked assetchains, with crypto-conditions (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-04) instituting a burn protocol, allowing parallel chains to act as a single cryptocurrency."


[26-May-18 09:57 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Sounds pretty good to my understanding of it. üôÇ


[26-May-18 09:59 PM] smk762#0000
Awse. Finally cleaned up my vis code on git and added a readme - https://github.com/smk762/txscl_vis/


[26-May-18 09:59 PM] smk762#0000
Still on random, will begin linking to the AWS data @Mylo is working on.


[26-May-18 10:02 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Yeah if you want any specific data to be pushed to the DB let me or @Mylo know. I have all the new blaster code running from `-blocknotify` so I can run any cli call you want directly after a block is mined.


[26-May-18 10:04 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I was thinking to just calculate the number of payments (and grab number of TX) in each block and push that plus assetchain name and timestamp to the DB. Otherwise the DB may need to do all the calculations from the RAW blocks and end up becoming a bottleneck.


[26-May-18 10:06 PM] smk762#0000
I had a list somewhere. What you just mentioned is enough for the majors. Beyond that, it's just a "last 5 min" sum or average of those values which I can do on my side.


[26-May-18 10:06 PM] smk762#0000
How are you calculating payments?


[27-May-18 02:05 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I am not yet lol. Need to test the fastest way to get the TX. I think something like what james proposed is the best way.


[27-May-18 02:33 AM] smk762#0000
If you include blocksize in the stats emitted I have a basic method. Will need more data from different payment per tx test runs to refine it more but it's good with 20s and 100s from the lst test we ran


[27-May-18 02:51 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I think we dont really need to measure anything between 1 and 100. I can test a few diffrent ones though. I need the docker files, as the scripts will change a little bit when its all put into containers. After that then we cna start chains and test different things very easily. Once we have 2 docker images that work perfectly for a single chain, its just a matter of starting X of them.


[27-May-18 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#0000
The blaster nodes dont use very much resource as it is, so stats gathering there is the best solution.


[27-May-18 02:52 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Should have these ready tomorrow. I think any calculations should be made on the blaster nodes, just to distribute load for endless scale.


[27-May-18 03:29 AM] smk762#0000
sounds good. If broadcast from blaster nodes does it need to be calculated or is it already available as a blast variable?


[27-May-18 03:29 AM] smk762#0000
Guess it's just a matter of finding the most efficient payments per tx value then?


[27-May-18 03:40 AM] blackjok3r#0000
There is an output from blaster at the end of each loop that gives a TX/s value that it sent to the mempool. The blasters run a fair bit faster than the miners can clear them, so there is a condition after each blast loop that checks if the mempool is under 5mb before running the next loop. I dont have an optimal setup for this yet either, but as long as the mempool is always full thats all that matters really. It took quite a while before it got to a 5MB mempool using 1payment TX/s.


[27-May-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Larger TX (100p) will fill the mempool a lot faster, than small ones (1p). But a single blast node is able to saturate a mempool of a single chain without issues for any TX size. The hardest thing will be starting all the chains at the same time. I might be able to change the block height condition to check for a timestamp instead. That might not be as fool proof though. I dont think it will matter too much if if it slowly ramps up to the maximum, it can pretty much run indefinatly as long as we have disk space for the chains to fit into.


[27-May-18 05:44 AM] imylomylo#0000
this is why it's good to get a cloud provider onboard for testing.  aws, redhat, canonical, ibm, azure any of them - they'll have the bandwidth and processing power to provide explorer-like services in the future and for individual businesses - to have an explorer-like api to talk to other chains to verify blockhash - save doing it manually - have oracles, like with MoMoM data... shrug...


[28-May-18 05:58 PM] imylomylo#0000
resync with `txindex=1` takes a while!  blackjok3r that paris test box is at 18% from 10 hours ago - if you can let it do it's thing that would be ace so i can get txdata out of it later in the week for aws explorer.


[28-May-18 07:47 PM] blackjok3r#0000
No worries, havent even touched it since putting LTC/DASH on there mate.


[29-May-18 07:05 AM] libscott#0000
Hi all


[29-May-18 07:05 AM] libscott#0000
is anyone running chains with the momo branch?


[29-May-18 07:06 AM] jl777#0000
all the TXSCL chains use -ac_cc=1


[29-May-18 07:08 AM] libscott#0000
I see


[29-May-18 07:08 AM] libscott#0000
are they running momo branch


[29-May-18 07:08 AM] jl777#0000
no, just normal


[29-May-18 07:09 AM] jl777#0000
but do all nodes need to run the momo branch? maybe for now test in a non-forking way?


[29-May-18 07:09 AM] libscott#0000
the burn tx will work but import tx wont


[29-May-18 07:10 AM] libscott#0000
also import tx will only work if ac_cc >= 2, the way I made it


[29-May-18 07:10 AM] libscott#0000
ie 1 is not a valid fungibility group


[29-May-18 07:12 AM] shossain#0000
i've kept them running as -ac_cc=3


[29-May-18 07:12 AM] jl777#0000
the ac_cc val cant change without changing the chain, so they started at ac_cc=3?


[29-May-18 07:12 AM] jl777#0000
if so it is ready to test

[29-May-18 07:15 AM] blackjok3r#0000
No. I created 4 new chains running the momo branch for @SHossain


[29-May-18 07:16 AM] jl777#0000
ok, as long as we are on the same page


[29-May-18 07:17 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I think we can just use the seed node for any test you need. 4 chains is enough? 
I have not genereated new chains for now test yet, we are working with just 2 local chains until we have the 2 docker images working. I started on the TxBlaster image today but got caught up. Will finish it tomorrow unless I run into any problems.


[29-May-18 07:19 AM] libscott#0000
Awesome üëç


[29-May-18 07:20 AM] libscott#0000
Do all chains have different symbols?


[29-May-18 07:20 AM] libscott#0000
How can i see how to sync with them?


[29-May-18 07:20 AM] shossain#0000

[29-May-18 07:20 AM] libscott#0000
Nice


[29-May-18 07:21 AM] blackjok3r#0000
as long as you use the seed ip @SHossain has you will sync with those chains.


[29-May-18 07:21 AM] blackjok3r#0000

ah ok, not yet then.


[29-May-18 12:55 PM] jl777#0000

[29-May-18 01:08 PM] jl777#0000
both nodes need to have the same values


[29-May-18 01:08 PM] jl777#0000
i dont have time now to troubleshoot this, bit it sounds like notarizations are started but not happening as there are not 2 nodes in agreement


[29-May-18 01:08 PM] jl777#0000
also myind.2 indicates there are at least 3 testnet notary nodes?


[29-May-18 01:10 PM] shossain#0000
i kept your node in there `"0_jl777_testA":"03b7621b44118017a16043f19b30cc8a4cfe068ac4e42417bae16ba460c80f3828"`


[29-May-18 01:10 PM] shossain#0000
as 0


[29-May-18 01:10 PM] shossain#0000
the first one


[29-May-18 01:10 PM] shossain#0000
i can remove that and try only 2 chains


[29-May-18 01:12 PM] jl777#0000
no its ok


[29-May-18 01:12 PM] jl777#0000
no problem to have some idle nodes, just making sure the data was sane


[29-May-18 01:12 PM] libscott#0000
i only need one chain notarising to KMD to test


[29-May-18 01:15 PM] shossain#0000
@libscott started with 1 chain only. let's see what happens


[29-May-18 01:15 PM] libscott#0000
so I'll wait for a notarisation hash to appear? `./assets-cli getinfo | grep notarized`


[29-May-18 01:16 PM] shossain#0000
yes


[29-May-18 01:17 PM] shossain#0000
doing only `TXSCL` chain now


[29-May-18 01:17 PM] libscott#0000
thats fine... I can test by doing an export from TXSCL to TXSCL üôÇ


[29-May-18 01:18 PM] shossain#0000
only KMD and TXSCL chains are running in the nodes with balance and UTXO for each. BTC not running.


[29-May-18 01:18 PM] libscott#0000
that's fine


[29-May-18 01:19 PM] libscott#0000
still not seeing any notarizedtxid though


[29-May-18 01:28 PM] shossain#0000
these are the console printouts happening


[29-May-18 01:30 PM] shossain#0000
@libscott do you have any funds in your wallet for TXSCL chains?


[29-May-18 01:31 PM] shossain#0000
probably, you could setup a cronjob to send funds to yourself every minute?


[29-May-18 01:35 PM] libscott#0000
No i dont


[29-May-18 01:35 PM] libscott#0000
hm, so stll not notarising?


[29-May-18 01:35 PM] shossain#0000
ok. i started a tx generator as well


[29-May-18 01:39 PM] jl777#0000
it needs to be mined of course, and it gets the MoM data from the komodod


[29-May-18 01:39 PM] jl777#0000
so if there is any mismatch between the MoM values on the two nodes, for some reason the komodod is returning different calc_MoM values


[29-May-18 01:40 PM] jl777#0000
the notarization is just passing through what it gets from komodod


[29-May-18 01:40 PM] jl777#0000
-> any mismatches, non-notarizing is likely due to issues in the momo branch


[29-May-18 02:18 PM] shossain#0000
@libscott KMD chain gets stuck from your `momo` branch


[29-May-18 02:20 PM] libscott#0000
can I help?


[29-May-18 02:20 PM] shossain#0000
i just had KMD chain stuck in one node.


[29-May-18 02:20 PM] shossain#0000
resolved now


[29-May-18 02:21 PM] libscott#0000
i still dont see a notarisaiton


[29-May-18 02:21 PM] jl777#0000
but you resolved it by switching to my dev branch and switching back?


[29-May-18 02:21 PM] shossain#0000
earlier, it was the other node that was stuckj


[29-May-18 02:21 PM] jl777#0000
seems some bugs in momo branch regarding syncing


[29-May-18 02:21 PM] jl777#0000
and calcMoM


[29-May-18 02:22 PM] libscott#0000
there was a bug in syncing, which was easy to reproduce and I fixed it


[29-May-18 02:22 PM] libscott#0000
KMD synced fine here


[29-May-18 02:23 PM] jl777#0000
ok, so it was fixed? @@SHossain


[29-May-18 02:23 PM] libscott#0000
have we observed different nodes returning different MoMs?


[29-May-18 02:23 PM] jl777#0000
if so, the issue seems that the MoM values on the two notarizing nodes are different


[29-May-18 02:23 PM] shossain#0000
i fixed it by re-syncing


[29-May-18 02:23 PM] jl777#0000
at least from the printouts that were posted they seemed different


[29-May-18 02:24 PM] shossain#0000
the earlier issue that i reported couple of days ago, libsoctt fixed that


[29-May-18 02:24 PM] libscott#0000
the issue was caused by me returning 1 from `komodo_checkPOW`, in order to make assetchain mining work in regtest mode


[29-May-18 02:24 PM] libscott#0000
i had to add a different workaround, but that was the problem


[29-May-18 02:24 PM] jl777#0000
it shouldnt get stuck in the first place though so this is a new bug captured in the backup of the ~/.komodo dir, right?


[29-May-18 02:25 PM] jl777#0000
so there is that and getting the MoM values to match on the two notarizing nodes. plz post the notarizing message from both nodes


[29-May-18 02:25 PM] shossain#0000
yes, i have backed up the `.komodo` dir


[29-May-18 02:26 PM] jl777#0000
ok, lets get a way for @libscott to duplicate that stuck condition


[29-May-18 02:26 PM] jl777#0000
and we can push forward on the notarization, first step is for both nodes to submit identical data


[29-May-18 02:27 PM] shossain#0000
they are displaying identical data now


[29-May-18 02:28 PM] shossain#0000
@libscott do you want the komodo data dir as zip?


[29-May-18 02:29 PM] libscott#0000
would I need that? is there a bug?


[29-May-18 02:29 PM] jl777#0000
it got stuck syncing the chain, seems a bug in momo


[29-May-18 02:30 PM] shossain#0000
i found a node was stuck for some time in the 2nd node, it caught up later on


[29-May-18 02:30 PM] jl777#0000
separately if the notaries are using the same data, it should get the 2 sigs and notarize


[29-May-18 02:30 PM] jl777#0000
so it would have fixed itself?


[29-May-18 02:31 PM] shossain#0000
yes, that is what happened on the 2nd node

oh, that is the stuck node print?

is there any way I can work around needing to have notary vins in CreateNewBlock?

tests are broked üòû


[29-May-18 02:58 PM] libscott#0000
in test mode I dont have any other way to get inputs other than mining blocks so it appears to be a chicken and egg problem


[29-May-18 02:58 PM] shossain#0000
what went wrong?


[29-May-18 02:59 PM] libscott#0000
more recent version of the code automatically generates a notary transaction, though im not exactly sure what it's doing. but it requires that the wallet be populated with vins


[29-May-18 02:59 PM] libscott#0000
which in my test case it isnt


[29-May-18 02:59 PM] jl777#0000
yes, populate them with 0.0001 vins


[29-May-18 02:59 PM] jl777#0000
or dont notary mine


[29-May-18 02:59 PM] shossain#0000
i'm not mining


[29-May-18 03:00 PM] jl777#0000
pwallet being null seems to be if you disabled wallet


[29-May-18 03:00 PM] shossain#0000
this is my KMD start script
```
cd komodo
./src/komodod -notary -pubkey="0239b39630f71b5ef4e145ab9bd9daaf0871fa59904cf9c216619609d2d6ed5ee0" &
```


[29-May-18 03:01 PM] jl777#0000
for notary that is the way


[29-May-18 03:02 PM] libscott#0000
the thing is, in my test cases I'm creating a blockchain and generating blocks on the fly. And I'm spending the block rewards


[29-May-18 03:02 PM] libscott#0000
In order to be able to get block rewards to spend I had to do the following:


[29-May-18 03:03 PM] jl777#0000
if you arent notary mining it shouldnt require notaryvin


[29-May-18 03:03 PM] libscott#0000
Ok so I need to stop using NOTARY_PUBKEY


[29-May-18 03:04 PM] libscott#0000
and use the wallet for block rewards


[29-May-18 03:04 PM] jl777#0000
yes


[29-May-18 03:04 PM] jl777#0000
with pubkey it believes it is a notary and will try to notary mine

I merged dev into momo and pushed, will fix tests meanwhile

[29-May-18 03:14 PM] jl777#0000
the current mystery is why there is no notarization

[30-May-18 03:27 AM] shossain#0000
if you want more chains notarized, either blackjok3r has to change all chains to `-ac_cc=3` or i have to use the default `-ac_cc=1` and i will also have to rent better server than my current 2nd server.


[30-May-18 03:33 AM] shossain#0000
TXSCL000 has notarization

TXSCL0001 has notartization


[30-May-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I have 2 servers we can use, with the chains at 0 blocks you can run an immense amount of them on a single server, once they get large then RAM and TPC ports becomes a huge issue.


[30-May-18 03:44 AM] shossain#0000
i have tx machine on for all the chains at 5 min interval


[30-May-18 03:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
They are actually satinders, but I have access, and they are not doing much right now.


[30-May-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Thee chains dont need TX, they have a block reward and will keep mining every minute.


[30-May-18 03:46 AM] shossain#0000
i see. i will stop it then

I managed to add 1024 coins to iguana, but did not call dPoW on them.


[30-May-18 03:47 AM] blackjok3r#0000
With anything oer about 128, I think TCP TIME_WAITS will be an issue. I have done some research on that, so that iguana can keep a persistent TCP connection on the RPC port, then we cna probably scale to much higher chain numbers.

[30-May-18 04:55 AM] shossain#0000
are we doing 64 first, then 128?


[30-May-18 04:56 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah try 64, mining that many chains is hard. We will need more CPU's or deploy some docker miners in the cloud.


[30-May-18 04:57 AM] blackjok3r#0000
see what the TIME_WAIT's are like with 64 on dPoW and we cna estimate how many more to add from that.


[30-May-18 04:57 AM] shossain#0000
Please send some funds for all the chains to 
`RSUMqZFwz7yPzTmyzEtH9VzH7LBoD7twSB`
`RFUN8XezmmZt47pzVmoz7aN5LtFNV9pyuj`


[30-May-18 04:58 AM] blackjok3r#0000
ok


[30-May-18 05:01 AM] blackjok3r#0000
sent, you have first 4 chains already right?

i'm setting up the second server.


[30-May-18 08:45 AM] shossain#0000
for 64 chains notarizing


[30-May-18 08:45 AM] jl777#0000
komodo-cli -ac_name=TXSCL getinfo should display the notarized info


[30-May-18 08:45 AM] jl777#0000
assuming you are running the right one. @SHossain plz make sure @libscott is onthe right chain, there was some confusion over seed nodes


[30-May-18 08:46 AM] libscott#0000
for this test we dont need alot of nodes

[30-May-18 08:47 AM] shossain#0000
nope. i will use 2. current 2nd node is not capable of notarizing 64 chains


[30-May-18 08:56 AM] libscott#0000
any idea why my instance isnt showing the notarisation?


[30-May-18 08:57 AM] jl777#0000
are you in sync ?


[30-May-18 08:57 AM] jl777#0000
if not, then it needs to be troubleshot, hopefully you can get the txid on the TXSCL chain to get the OP_RETURN data


[30-May-18 08:57 AM] shossain#0000
currently i stopped notarizing, as i'm setting up both node for more chains. it was working with the first 4 chains earlier


[30-May-18 08:57 AM] jl777#0000
plz get the relevant txids, chain heights/hash so @libscott can fix the notarzation not being seen on his node


[30-May-18 08:57 AM] jl777#0000
one the first notarization is done, the others will hopefully be seen


[30-May-18 08:57 AM] libscott#0000
I am in sync... I don't know why the notarisation txid isnt appearing


[30-May-18 08:57 AM] jl777#0000
i guess need to resync the chain to see what it does when it processes that block?


[30-May-18 08:58 AM] jl777#0000
i make a backup some blocks before the critical in cases where it takes a long time to sync up


[30-May-18 08:59 AM] shossain#0000
@libscott please let me know if you want me to perform any specific command.


[30-May-18 08:59 AM] libscott#0000
ok I'm syncing again


[30-May-18 08:59 AM] shossain#0000
yes, deleted the chain data and sync from scratch, that should help


[30-May-18 09:01 AM] libscott#0000
got one!!


[30-May-18 09:01 AM] libscott#0000

[30-May-18 09:01 AM] libscott#0000
can someone send some test funds on TXSCL to RLog6T7dPoDqdVV5N3PWXQLTQM3aGWmkwG?

<!channel> we have 60 TXSCL chains notarizing üéâ. without mining & BTC running, seems like it uses very low resources. i'm waiting on the other 4 cahins to get their first notarization as well.


[30-May-18 11:51 AM] shossain#0000
with a lot of chains notarizing at high frequency, it consumes KMD UTXOs very fast.


[30-May-18 11:51 AM] shossain#0000
1 more chain for the first time. 3 more to go

but if I calculate it using the block merkle roots 4406-4399, I get a different result

do you calculate it going backwards?

in any case height_MoM is technically in your domain


[30-May-18 12:56 PM] shossain#0000
3 still didn't notarize.


[30-May-18 01:14 PM] libscott#0000
i dont know, i have a list of leaf hashes and I can't reproduce the result from iguana_merkle


[30-May-18 01:15 PM] libscott#0000
is it possible that previously that calculation was being done inside Iguana and then it got moved to KMD?


[30-May-18 01:42 PM] jl777#0000
yes


[30-May-18 01:42 PM] jl777#0000
it is being done inside KMD now, but using code from iguana. maybe I botched the port?


[30-May-18 01:42 PM] jl777#0000
it could be endian reversed in iguana_merkle internal values? not setup to debug it, but you can basically change iguana_merkle to something that is your MoM calc

[30-May-18 02:55 PM] libscott#0000
dat no good


[30-May-18 02:55 PM] libscott#0000
but there's also no MoMs?


[30-May-18 02:59 PM] shossain#0000
nope


[30-May-18 03:00 PM] libscott#0000
In this case there's 2 notary sigs right?


[30-May-18 03:00 PM] shossain#0000
also, now all 64 chains notarizing


[30-May-18 03:00 PM] shossain#0000
yes


[30-May-18 03:03 PM] libscott#0000
i wonder why there's no moms.. I see TXSCL004.ht.628 repeated


[30-May-18 03:03 PM] libscott#0000
does that mean its notarising multiple times for a block?


[30-May-18 03:03 PM] jl777#0000
what happens with a height_MoM call?


[30-May-18 03:03 PM] jl777#0000
the same call that iguana would make


[30-May-18 03:04 PM] jl777#0000
or i guess calc_MoM


[30-May-18 03:33 PM] libscott#0000
if it's calling MoMoMdata maybe my rpc call is messed up


[30-May-18 03:33 PM] libscott#0000
probably actually


[30-May-18 03:34 PM] jl777#0000
it should call to get the getinfo to get the prevMoMheight, then calcMoM then MoMoMdata


[30-May-18 03:36 PM] libscott#0000
MoMoMdata accepts any height


[30-May-18 03:39 PM] jl777#0000
ok, i think you need to run a testnet notarizing node to troubleshoot this


[30-May-18 03:50 PM] libscott#0000
at what point does the assetchain report it's ccid for a notarisation to KMD?


[30-May-18 04:00 PM] jl777#0000
in the MoM data of the notarization, the CCid is the first integer


[30-May-18 04:02 PM] libscott#0000
i understand that in MoMoMdata the `data` key contains "{ccid}{MoMoM}"


[30-May-18 04:02 PM] libscott#0000
so the backnotarisation contains the ccid


[30-May-18 04:04 PM] libscott#0000
but how does iguana put the ccid into the forward notarisation?


[30-May-18 04:05 PM] jl777#0000
let me check


[30-May-18 04:06 PM] jl777#0000
sorry, it gets it from the MoMoM data!


[30-May-18 04:07 PM] jl777#0000
it wont be in the forward notarization... I guess we need to change that?


[30-May-18 04:07 PM] libscott#0000
Yea, otherwise it can't select the notarisations for the MoMoMdata


[30-May-18 04:07 PM] libscott#0000
also MoMoMdata needs to be called with the ccid


[30-May-18 04:08 PM] jl777#0000
MoMdepth is 32 bits, but really it cant go beyond 16bits. is 16 bits enough for CCid?


[30-May-18 04:09 PM] libscott#0000
yes... but... ccid is the next 4 bytes after MoMdepth


[30-May-18 04:10 PM] libscott#0000
so it could go there?


[30-May-18 04:12 PM] jl777#0000
i think that would mess up the existing parsing...


[30-May-18 04:13 PM] jl777#0000
the full CCid can be in the MoMoMdata


[30-May-18 04:14 PM] jl777#0000
i know its a bit redundant and maybe we can streamline it after it works


[30-May-18 04:14 PM] jl777#0000
almost done with changes


[30-May-18 04:14 PM] libscott#0000

@SHossain: updated jl777 branch to pass in the CCid in the upper 16 bits of MoMdepth, changes need to be made for anything parsing the OP_RETURN data, but nothing else should need to be changed


[30-May-18 04:21 PM] jl777#0000
also the CCid for a chain will be printed when notarizing starts and for each round


[30-May-18 04:22 PM] shossain#0000
testing


[30-May-18 04:23 PM] jl777#0000
I think I need to update komodod too, but it should at least get the CCid data to libscott's code now


[30-May-18 04:24 PM] libscott#0000
I think you are still missing a call to get the ccid from the assetchain no?


[30-May-18 04:25 PM] libscott#0000
Unless you have another way to get it


[30-May-18 04:32 PM] jl777#0000
getinfo call to the assetchain has non-zero CCid


[30-May-18 04:32 PM] jl777#0000
when notarizing assetchain, the notary just calls getinfo to get the CCid


[30-May-18 04:34 PM] jl777#0000
it is all encoded and komodo dev branch should properly support the encoded CCid in the upper part of MoMdepth. you might need to rebase for it to properly parse the non-zero CCid notarizations

[30-May-18 04:36 PM] jl777#0000
on startup of notarizing when doing dpow call, what was printed?


[30-May-18 04:40 PM] libscott#0000
so, if it's a forward notarisation, ccid is upper 16 bits of MoMdepth, but if its a backnotarisation it's separate


[30-May-18 04:40 PM] libscott#0000
?


[30-May-18 04:41 PM] jl777#0000
you need to update komodod for proper parsing of the new notarization data, but for now we are not getting the CCid passed through. I see it in the getinfo posts you did before CCid:3, so it should appear in the dpow prints and at the start of each notrizaton round


[30-May-18 04:42 PM] jl777#0000
sorry, MoMdepth


[30-May-18 04:42 PM] jl777#0000
yes I used the previously all 0's of the upper 16 bits of MoMoMdepth


[30-May-18 04:43 PM] jl777#0000
so it goes into the forward notarization


[30-May-18 04:43 PM] jl777#0000
the back notarization can have the full 32bits


[30-May-18 04:44 PM] jl777#0000
it would also provide an additional error check to make sure the back notarization data is valid


[30-May-18 04:44 PM] libscott#0000
does backnotarisation have MoM?


[30-May-18 04:45 PM] jl777#0000
backnotarization will have whatever you put in the MoMoMdata


[30-May-18 04:45 PM] libscott#0000
but prior to MoMoMdata does it have MoM after symbol


[30-May-18 04:45 PM] jl777#0000
oh, but yes, it will have the MoMdata that was put in the forward notarization


[30-May-18 04:45 PM] jl777#0000
MoMdepth

[30-May-18 04:46 PM] jl777#0000
for historical reasons the name of the function to create the notarization extra data is: int32_t dpow_paxpending(uint8_t *hex,int32_t hexsize,uint32_t *paxwdcrcp,bits256 MoM,uint32_t MoMdepth,uint16_t CCid,int32_t src_or_dest,struct dpow_block *bp)

there should be no mysteries for you about this data flow


[30-May-18 04:47 PM] jl777#0000
you can check that function in dpow_rpc.c to see exactly what its doing

so doesnt matter which is used


[30-May-18 04:51 PM] jl777#0000
you should update komodod also as if you dont it could get confused with the new MoMdepth that will be around 200,000


[30-May-18 04:52 PM] libscott#0000
uh... I'm a bit dumb, that means I can sequence two R/Ws of uint16_t right? ie, `READWRITE((uint16_t)MoMdepth); READWRITE((uint16_t)CCid)`

not 100% sure about endianness of READWRITE, but I think so

Morning guys. Do mining/seed nodes need update. Also @libscott the seednode list you are using is wrong, but none of those nodes are up anymore so should not affect things.


[30-May-18 04:55 PM] libscott#0000
hi blackjok3r, thank you, yea sometimes it's getting stuck since there's not alot of seeds up


[30-May-18 04:56 PM] blackjok3r#0000
one sec, I have 2 seeds, its mining like 2.5chains per core, so it could be struggling a little bit.


[30-May-18 04:56 PM] libscott#0000
does this mean that trying to generate a proof for an old block will make a merkle branch with 200k nodes?

@@SHossain it could be you need to wait for @libscott to rebase, not sure if it will create compatible notarizations using my branch, but at least we can verify that it notarizes properly with the CCid.3 detected and that the getinfo call updates with the right notarization data without crashing

üòû still not working...


[31-May-18 12:24 AM] webworker#0000
Does the final part need to be done in jq?


[31-May-18 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#0000
no


[31-May-18 12:24 AM] blackjok3r#0000
as long as it gives a single JSON.


[31-May-18 12:26 AM] blackjok3r#0000
the last line just hangs, if anyone can make that work it would be a lot of help. üôÇ

i didn't test it


[31-May-18 12:31 AM] blackjok3r#0000
ok thanks will try it out


[31-May-18 12:31 AM] webworker#0000
but should be something like that


[31-May-18 12:36 AM] blackjok3r#0000
`jq: error (at <stdin>:1): Cannot index object with number`


[31-May-18 12:39 AM] imylomylo#0000
Gonna feed the cat, make a coffee and get onto something scaling related

thanks man üòÑ


[31-May-18 12:47 AM] webworker#0000
np, you can add the ac name as an arg in the same way


[31-May-18 12:48 AM] webworker#0000
add `|tonumber` ^^


[31-May-18 12:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
already did the assetname üòÑ


[31-May-18 12:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
its done, adding it to script now and starting another blast. for now it just appends the JSON to a stats.txt every block


[31-May-18 12:56 AM] blackjok3r#0000
had to create another docker volume, hope it all works.


[31-May-18 01:15 AM] smk762#0000
I have a function to derive payments from tx and blocksize, but it's only tuned to 20 or 100. Could tweak it with some more txblast tests.


[31-May-18 01:16 AM] jl777#0000
estimates dont need to be perfect


[31-May-18 01:17 AM] jl777#0000
can always do a bruteforce scan to fill in the actuals


[31-May-18 01:17 AM] jl777#0000
after the blast


[31-May-18 01:17 AM] smk762#0000
it should be pretty accurate if all chains are sending the same payments per tx. Gets a bit tricker with mixed blocks.


[31-May-18 01:19 AM] smk762#0000
to slim down the data / calc load, are any stat bars I'm currently tracking that are not worth the effort?


[31-May-18 01:20 AM] smk762#0000
or any missing worth adding in?

You should be ok with those, except the API's connected... not sure how you would calculate this?


[31-May-18 01:30 AM] jl777#0000
seems sufficient to gauge overall status


[31-May-18 01:30 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Also the way the TxBlaster is made, its pretty much totally imposible to mix up the diffrent transactions


[31-May-18 01:31 AM] blackjok3r#0000
You pass the docker-compose file the outputs array for the TX that is sent, and after its run long enough you kill it.


[31-May-18 01:31 AM] blackjok3r#0000
To change the TX size you need to start a new container. The miner node keeps all the blockchain data.


[31-May-18 01:32 AM] blackjok3r#0000
It would basically be 1 test with 1 payment. and one test with 100. They are totally seperate things.


[31-May-18 01:33 AM] blackjok3r#0000
they would actually even be totally seperate chains.


[31-May-18 01:34 AM] smk762#0000
yeah apis connected is superflous with AWS db. Can derive active chains from there which is a better metric showing pretty much the same anyways.

Its pretty slow inside virtualbox and docker on laptop. Pretty much ready to push this onto a server.


[31-May-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#0000
But I need to know what to do with that JSON. üôÇ


[31-May-18 01:37 AM] smk762#0000
got a url for the json for me to tap in to?


[31-May-18 01:37 AM] blackjok3r#0000
It just pushes it to a text file on a shared volume right now.

@Mylo


[31-May-18 01:38 AM] imylomylo#0000
ok i'll modify REST - won't be long


[31-May-18 01:59 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Building the docker images on a 2 core vultr should be fast enough to saturate mempool.


[31-May-18 02:00 AM] blackjok3r#0000
single chain


[31-May-18 02:19 AM] imylomylo#0000
put this in `config.sh`
```
#!/bin/bash
BLOCKNOTIFYURL="https://njeitldkqc.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/v0/blocknotify"
```
put your JSON as `${RESULT}` for this script
and put this as `blocknotify` script in your AC.conf
```
#!/bin/bash
source config.sh
curl \
--verbose \
--request OPTIONS \
${BLOCKNOTIFYURL} \
--header 'Origin: http://localhost:8000' \
--header 'Access-Control-Request-Headers: Origin, Accept, Content-Type' \
--header 'Access-Control-Request-Method: POST'

[31-May-18 02:20 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I am already using blocknotify so this will just have to go into that script I guess.


[31-May-18 02:21 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I got in trouble for using a heap of `source` lol.. so I will pass that URL as a docker ENV var üôÇ


[31-May-18 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#0000
can I do that?


[31-May-18 02:22 AM] imylomylo#0000
yeah no probs with that.


[31-May-18 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#0000
cool. That way we can change it without rebuilding image. I put nearly everything as ENV var. Pretty pleased how it turned out. üòÑ


[31-May-18 02:23 AM] imylomylo#0000
because of CORS enabled (which i can disable) you have to send an OPTIONS http method first, if it causes a problem, i can disable CORS and we can just try POST.
having CORS enabled will allow us to lockdown from which hosts can send data into the REST service, in case some dickheads want to inject stuff üôÇ


[31-May-18 02:30 AM] imylomylo#0000
currently set up that URL for 1 tx / s of writes.  if you're going to fire up 60 ACs, I'll probably have to increase the DB throughput. lmk how many chains.  if you're doing 60, 10 writes/s should be fine ... _shrug_


[31-May-18 02:30 AM] blackjok3r#0000
just waiting on the image to build. Takes a little while.


[31-May-18 02:30 AM] imylomylo#0000
no probs mate


[31-May-18 02:30 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Just using 1 chain


[31-May-18 02:30 AM] blackjok3r#0000
We havent generated the docker-compose


[31-May-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#0000
its just 1 manul chain for now


[31-May-18 02:31 AM] imylomylo#0000
ok, what's the plan for this evening?


[31-May-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#0000
until we have it working 100% perfectly.


[31-May-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I guess run a blast and see if smk762 can get the required data?


[31-May-18 02:31 AM] blackjok3r#0000
once we have 1 chain wokring, then its just a matter of scaling up a few at a time to see how it all reacts.

[31-May-18 02:34 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Timed it well then. Its been a bit of a battle on my side with docker, but patchkez was a great help as always.


[31-May-18 02:35 AM] imylomylo#0000
`https://njeitldkqc.execute-api.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/v0/blocknotify` that's your URL smk762


[31-May-18 02:35 AM] smk762#0000
thanks!


[31-May-18 02:35 AM] imylomylo#0000
that will return ALL the stuff blackjok3r sends into it.


[31-May-18 02:37 AM] imylomylo#0000
if you want specific records, needs some work üò¨ 
you will receive what blackjok3r sends in with additional JSON attributes `createdAt` `updatedAt` and `id`

the blast can actually run indefinitely so if we have enough data it can just keep going until it spends all 77 million coins LOL


[31-May-18 02:37 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I am doing this test with 1payment TX


[31-May-18 02:37 AM] pondsea#0000
My understanding was that any action was a transaction? So a payment = a transaction


[31-May-18 02:38 AM] blackjok3r#0000
no


[31-May-18 02:38 AM] pondsea#0000
I guess im mistaken?


[31-May-18 02:38 AM] blackjok3r#0000
payment is payment. I knew this would be a problem, but the last test failed before the 1 payment TX test could be run.


[31-May-18 02:38 AM] blackjok3r#0000
We got avout 20,000TX/s


[31-May-18 02:38 AM] blackjok3r#0000
verified


[31-May-18 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Still have all the blockchains and there are explorers up at 88.99.57.78:7128


[31-May-18 02:39 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Increase the port number by 2, for the next chain.


[31-May-18 02:45 AM] blackjok3r#0000
@Mylo is it working?


[31-May-18 02:45 AM] imylomylo#0000
nothing there yet


[31-May-18 02:45 AM] imylomylo#0000
checking logs


[31-May-18 02:47 AM] gcharang#0000
In a single blockchain transaction, we can do a traditional payment to many people.


[31-May-18 02:47 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I have JSON being output from the stats script, I just added the code you gave me to that.


[31-May-18 02:48 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I cant really check logs as marketmaker floods thousands of lines.


[31-May-18 02:48 AM] blackjok3r#0000
and its in the same place.


[31-May-18 02:48 AM] imylomylo#0000
yeah no probs, i'm c+p your sample json


[31-May-18 02:49 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I think its safe to say we will need 2 TxBlaster containers to saturate at 1 payment TX. Its still not full even on a straight VPS.


[31-May-18 02:49 AM] imylomylo#0000
you have to escape your quote marks
e.g.
```
RESULT="{ \"size\": 696770, \"height\": 10, \"time\": 1527755479, \"totaltx\": \"3084\", \"ac\": \"TXSCL220\" }"

Can you point me to some doc showing why a payment isnt a tx?


[31-May-18 02:59 AM] imylomylo#0000
cos in a tx you can have multiple payments.


[31-May-18 02:59 AM] pondsea#0000
Ah and you were doing 100x right?


[31-May-18 02:59 AM] imylomylo#0000
we were doing both 1 payment per 1 tx, and another 100 payments per 1 tx.


[31-May-18 02:59 AM] imylomylo#0000
separate tests.


[31-May-18 03:00 AM] pondsea#0000
Ok i will wait till you do the 1tx test then i will shit on that sys devs face

"how about you give the number of signature verifications per second instead which is the real benchmark."


[31-May-18 03:04 AM] smk762#0000
only difference between a payment and a tx is the number of senders being 1:many instead of 1:1


[31-May-18 03:04 AM] smk762#0000
it's a pretty pissweak limitation that would constrain realworl use cases beyond reasonable limits


[31-May-18 03:05 AM] imylomylo#0000
two separate tests, the 100 payments were done at 2pm, the 1 payments were done at 3pm.
we'll get better documentation of the event next time
and keep a journal,
Dear Diary,
:trollface:


[31-May-18 03:07 AM] jl777#0000
we can get 10x the tx/sec using small 1 payment tx, but it loses 10x the payments


[31-May-18 03:16 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Generating enough 1 payment TX to fill mempool is proving harder than larger ones. But we can just spawn more TxBlaster nodes. Its literally no diffrence to start 2 or a million containers. Limited by the cloud power we can get only.


[31-May-18 03:28 AM] manfromaus#0000
Is there an eta at current on the next test?

if so, then it will be up to @libscott to get the MoMoM validated


[31-May-18 03:44 AM] imylomylo#0000
ummmm don't worry.  what are you asking?


[31-May-18 03:44 AM] imylomylo#0000
it's cool either way, if something needs to change, i can massage your data into DB anyways üòõ


[31-May-18 03:45 AM] blackjok3r#0000
The JSON being pushed from blocknotify you said it needs the '\' added, but 'jq' built it its not made with bash so I cant just manually add all the '\'


[31-May-18 03:45 AM] imylomylo#0000
oh..... can you do a sed on it within your script to e.g. `s/\"/\\\"/` or somethign like that


[31-May-18 03:45 AM] imylomylo#0000
might need extra \\\\

i had only one notarization after starting.


[31-May-18 03:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Worked perfectly, starting it up again now.


[31-May-18 04:05 AM] smk762#0000
any chance you can change the json for total tx from string to int serverside?


[31-May-18 04:05 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I think so. So its working then?


[31-May-18 04:07 AM] smk762#0000
I saw a block event value, so copied it to get the formatting, though the value has not changed in a while or had other events added for a while


[31-May-18 04:07 AM] smk762#0000
got this though for the graph - https://www.highcharts.com/errors/14


[31-May-18 04:08 AM] smk762#0000
could type convert on client end, but would prefer not to


[31-May-18 04:08 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Its written in BASH so normally the variables are untyped. But maybe I can just do `let $totaltx = $totaltx`

are there quotes around the totaltx value on generation?


[31-May-18 04:09 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah thats the sample @Mylo put up. I just changed the JSON format to what he wanted.


[31-May-18 04:10 AM] blackjok3r#0000
ahhh... yeah I can easily remove the quotes I think. give me a few mins to try it.

for some reason, no new notarizations yet. will start iguana again

now its just 5


[31-May-18 04:42 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Are we ready to test it again?


[31-May-18 04:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Interesting that it misses block 3. ü§î Thats when marketmaker starts and importpriv key happen. Guess its not important as its an empty block.


[31-May-18 04:46 AM] blackjok3r#0000
and block 8, which is when blaster is tiriggered.


[31-May-18 04:46 AM] blackjok3r#0000
might need to put a sleep of 10s after these coneditions


[31-May-18 04:46 AM] imylomylo#0000
is this `blocknotify` not being triggered?


[31-May-18 04:46 AM] blackjok3r#0000
its triggered


[31-May-18 04:46 AM] blackjok3r#0000

[31-May-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I mean its designed so the stats can go somewhere else, I can just change the miner node to `STATS = 1`


[31-May-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#0000
might avoid it


[31-May-18 04:49 AM] blackjok3r#0000

[31-May-18 05:48 AM] blackjok3r#0000
not working from container?

[31-May-18 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I just added a pipe to my stats.txt from the curl to see if there is any error


[31-May-18 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#0000
started again


[31-May-18 05:59 AM] imylomylo#0000

nothing is printing from the curl lol


[31-May-18 05:59 AM] blackjok3r#0000
weird


[31-May-18 06:03 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Disabled blaster, so I can check logs. maybe curl isnt installed in the container... its there in earlier layers, but maybe not the last one.

[31-May-18 06:05 AM] jl777#0000
you need the curl with SSL


[31-May-18 06:05 AM] imylomylo#0000
k one sec.  the note about -X is ignorable


[31-May-18 06:06 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah wrong curl. wont take long to change it.


[31-May-18 06:06 AM] imylomylo#0000
```libcurl4-gnutls-dev```


[31-May-18 06:06 AM] imylomylo#0000
on deb/ubuntu


[31-May-18 06:06 AM] imylomylo#0000
well, ubuntu 16.04


[31-May-18 06:07 AM] imylomylo#0000

marketmaker needs libcurl4-openssl-dev


[31-May-18 06:08 AM] blackjok3r#0000
which uninstalls libcurl4-gnutls-dev


[31-May-18 06:08 AM] imylomylo#0000
ah shit a brick.


[31-May-18 06:08 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I guess I need to compile marketmaker from source in docker build ?


[31-May-18 06:09 AM] blackjok3r#0000
where ever this executable came from its compiled with the wrong libcurl

ok, I got an idea. I will compile a marketmaker on empty ubuntu 16.04 using  libcurl4-gnutls-dev


[31-May-18 06:13 AM] imylomylo#0000
use the paris box


[31-May-18 06:13 AM] blackjok3r#0000
the vultr VPS is fine,


[31-May-18 06:14 AM] blackjok3r#0000
where the docker containers are hosted. all I installed was docker


[31-May-18 06:14 AM] blackjok3r#0000
tbh not sure if marketmaker will compile with that ssl but its worth a try.


[31-May-18 06:16 AM] blackjok3r#0000
nope üòû


[31-May-18 06:17 AM] blackjok3r#0000
guess this is why I was told to use 2 containers lol


[31-May-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I will figure it out, at least we know its working apart from this. üôÇ


[31-May-18 06:19 AM] imylomylo#0000
compile curl?

How to build curl with the latest openssl?
So I build openssl

./config
make
sudo make install
sudo ln -sf /usr/local/ssl/bin/openssl `which openssl`
I build curl

./configure --with-ssl 
make
make install
OpenSSL looks installed correctl...

[31-May-18 06:19 AM] blackjok3r#0000
thats what I am going to try


[31-May-18 06:29 AM] blackjok3r#0000
just changing the ssl in the dockerfile from earlier on. it seems curl works with that openssl on normal ubuntu


[31-May-18 06:55 AM] imylomylo#0000
worst case, can setup a reverse proxy with http ->apache-> https

hey blackjok3r i've gotta zzzzz soon.  wanna just write to file and i'll import it at 5am?  i've got work at 8am tomorrow.


[31-May-18 07:19 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I dont think its a curl missing https problem


[31-May-18 07:19 AM] blackjok3r#0000
go ahead and sleep I am rebuilding the whole docker image


[31-May-18 07:20 AM] blackjok3r#0000
with the openssl-dev package instead of gnutils right from the start.


[31-May-18 07:20 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Google tells me it can be possibly the URL format that can throw this error too. The only difference from the script I used locally and the docker is that dock was ENV var.


[31-May-18 07:21 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I will work it out, probably something stupid


[31-May-18 07:22 AM] jl777#0000
you need the curl lib with ssl in it


[31-May-18 07:22 AM] jl777#0000
i said this already


[31-May-18 07:22 AM] jl777#0000
libssl-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev


[31-May-18 07:23 AM] blackjok3r#0000
you cant install `libcurl4-gnutls-dev` and libcurl4-openssl-dev` at the same time


[31-May-18 07:24 AM] blackjok3r#0000
so that can't be the problem. I used curl with no ssl installed on the same URL not inside docker and it worked fine


[31-May-18 07:24 AM] jl777#0000
libcurl4-gnutls-dev should be the one


[31-May-18 07:24 AM] blackjok3r#0000
marketmaker wont compile with that


[31-May-18 07:24 AM] blackjok3r#0000
tired it


[31-May-18 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#0000
quotes around URL


[31-May-18 07:29 AM] blackjok3r#0000

blackjok3r do you need help with curl/docker or it was sorted out?

no it wasnt even that lol


[31-May-18 07:33 AM] blackjok3r#0000
it gave an SSL error because there was "" around the URL

haha, ok


[31-May-18 07:35 AM] patchkez#0000
I will review your changes in that PR you opened. So the container works fine now, or any other issues to be solved?


[31-May-18 07:35 AM] blackjok3r#0000
We need 2 TxBlaster nodes for 1 payment TX. So I need to change some things.


[31-May-18 07:35 AM] blackjok3r#0000
1 blaster is not filling mempool for all blocks


[31-May-18 07:37 AM] patchkez#0000
I see, can you run 2 txblaster processes from one container?


[31-May-18 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#0000
ü§î


[31-May-18 07:37 AM] blackjok3r#0000
maybe, it would require running 2 marketmakers, but he issues is not maxed out CPU


[31-May-18 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#0000
the problem is you also need 2x passphrase etc


[31-May-18 07:38 AM] blackjok3r#0000
the list of ENV vars on the image is already huge lol


[31-May-18 07:39 AM] patchkez#0000
high number of vars should not be a problem


[31-May-18 07:39 AM] patchkez#0000
what do you mean by _maxed out CPU_?


[31-May-18 07:39 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah thats ok, just hard to track. I think I can use `sendmany` to fund 2 address at the same time.


[31-May-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#0000
The generation of transactions does not appear to be limited by CPU power


[31-May-18 07:40 AM] blackjok3r#0000
it is bottlenecked by something else


[31-May-18 07:40 AM] patchkez#0000
did you check # of TIME_WAIT connections?


[31-May-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#0000
no not yet. one sec,


[31-May-18 07:41 AM] blackjok3r#0000
it was over 20,000 on local tests


[31-May-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#0000
netstat not found


[31-May-18 07:42 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Guess I need to isntall it and rebuild conftainer?


[31-May-18 07:42 AM] patchkez#0000
yeah, there are no tools installed üòû


[31-May-18 07:43 AM] patchkez#0000
yes, somewhere near the end of Dockerfile you can add `RUN apt-get update && apt-get install net-tools`


[31-May-18 07:43 AM] patchkez#0000
maybe `ss` tool is installed?


[31-May-18 07:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
ss is there but ss on its own does not shot TIME_WAIT?


[31-May-18 07:45 AM] patchkez#0000
`ss -a`


[31-May-18 07:46 AM] blackjok3r#0000
16700


[31-May-18 07:47 AM] patchkez#0000
blackjok3r may I have access to that node and see what is happening there?


[31-May-18 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#0000
sure, I dont think on y local tests that it was saturating mempool with 1 blaster either.


[31-May-18 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#0000
before I used docker


[31-May-18 07:47 AM] smk762#0000
how many records per sec are we anticipating to be added to the json?


[31-May-18 07:47 AM] blackjok3r#0000
but it did actually get to 5mb in size eventually


[31-May-18 07:52 AM] smk762#0000
i heard rumours of 8192 chains?


[31-May-18 07:52 AM] blackjok3r#0000
we should be able to do unlimited once 1 is working perfectly


[31-May-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#0000
limited by TCP ports, but we can even reuse them and put them in seperate clusters


[31-May-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#0000
could do 1 million chains


[31-May-18 07:53 AM] smk762#0000
just thinking in terms of handling the stream, will need to talk to mylo to see what the possibilities via aws are.


[31-May-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah I think the DB should get all the data and add it together then push it your way, seems its amazon it should handle the load


[31-May-18 07:53 AM] patchkez#0000
so marketmaker process has ~33% CPU utilization


[31-May-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#0000
üëç


[31-May-18 07:53 AM] blackjok3r#0000
and its connected to barterdex, maybe we can firewall it and see if that speeds it up


[31-May-18 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I think I did that on the first test and it seemed to make a diffrence


[31-May-18 07:54 AM] imylomylo#0000
ah....removed quote marks.


[31-May-18 07:54 AM] imylomylo#0000
damn....


[31-May-18 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#0000
because it wasnt a bash script var


[31-May-18 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#0000
they were in the variable still


[31-May-18 07:54 AM] imylomylo#0000
damn....


[31-May-18 07:54 AM] imylomylo#0000
so how many chains are you gonna run tonight/


[31-May-18 07:54 AM] blackjok3r#0000
just the 1.


[31-May-18 07:55 AM] imylomylo#0000
ok - i'll leave it at 1 write per second.


[31-May-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
hte mempool isnt even full.. no point going further than this until 1 chain is runnign at max


[31-May-18 07:55 AM] imylomylo#0000
sweet....good night üôÇ


[31-May-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
catch ya


[31-May-18 07:55 AM] patchkez#0000
blackjok3r why there are 2 marketmaker processes running?


[31-May-18 07:55 AM] smk762#0000
cya


[31-May-18 07:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
there shouldnt be lol


[31-May-18 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#0000
let me restart, maybe I didnt clear the blockchain before starting it


[31-May-18 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#0000
and it got blockheight 3 twice.


[31-May-18 07:57 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I have never seen it start 2 before


[31-May-18 07:58 AM] blackjok3r#0000
for real test the blocks will be further apart, I just got sick of waiting to test it


[31-May-18 08:01 AM] blackjok3r#0000
restarted


[31-May-18 08:04 AM] blackjok3r#0000
single marketmaker this time, only 35% CPU used. I think maybe we try a 100 payment TX and see if that fills mempool?


[31-May-18 08:04 AM] patchkez#0000
sure


[31-May-18 08:12 AM] blackjok3r#0000
started with 50 payments TX


[31-May-18 08:16 AM] patchkez#0000
blackjok3r where in the script do you change amount of payments within TX?


[31-May-18 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#0000
its an ENV var


[31-May-18 08:16 AM] blackjok3r#0000
OUTPUTS=


[31-May-18 08:17 AM] patchkez#0000
ah I see it now


[31-May-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I did it wrong


[31-May-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#0000
no quotes lol


[31-May-18 08:17 AM] blackjok3r#0000
and the URL quotes I only changed locally before, fixing


[31-May-18 08:22 AM] audo#0000
Hey guys, here are few questions from our marketing team that would need answering. I hope you guys can help.

http://pad.supernet.org/Scaling_questions_May312018


[31-May-18 08:28 AM] patchkez#0000
blackjok3r are you restarting containers once again?


[31-May-18 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I'm not sure how to pass the array in the ENV var, its not working


[31-May-18 08:28 AM] blackjok3r#0000
had to kill them


[31-May-18 08:29 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I will kill all quotes


[31-May-18 08:30 AM] patchkez#0000
do you mean OUTPUTS var?


[31-May-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yes


[31-May-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#0000
its a JSON array,


[31-May-18 08:30 AM] blackjok3r#0000
`[{"RKV4MzePkH8H9N6K3RdC1JDDWBLbCE4H5p":0.0001}, {"RSzuS5dT5WYLxZekMwcoGXQjtcD9FufPaq":0.0001}, {"RA9aBVW2aDTyZn........`


[31-May-18 08:31 AM] patchkez#0000
isn't there extra `}` at the end?


[31-May-18 08:31 AM] blackjok3r#0000
shouldnt be.. for one it was exactly liek this `[{"RKV4MzePkH8H9N6K3RdC1JDDWBLbCE4H5p":0.0001}]`


[31-May-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#0000
but for more its like the example above, but because it has spaces does it need quotes? I tried '' but that didnt work.


[31-May-18 08:32 AM] blackjok3r#0000
maybe I need to store the arrays inside a file in the container and just pass it an index number for what transaction to use?


[31-May-18 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#0000
it works with no quotes or anything


[31-May-18 08:38 AM] blackjok3r#0000
guess because its all one a singe line


[31-May-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#0000
all blocks are full now


[31-May-18 08:40 AM] blackjok3r#0000
855 payments/s single chain


[31-May-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#0000
guess for 1 payment TX we just need more blasters


[31-May-18 08:41 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I have an idea on how to code this, I will try to do it from a single container first time.


[31-May-18 08:41 AM] patchkez#0000
i have to take care of my kids now, will have a look on it later today


[31-May-18 08:43 AM] patchkez#0000
we might also try to lower cpu shares for txblast container


[31-May-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah we can just see what it needs and calibrate it.


[31-May-18 08:43 AM] blackjok3r#0000
for multi payment TX we only need one,


[31-May-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
its just all these people who demand this single payment TX, I guess I should figure out how to make them happy.


[31-May-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
üòÜ


[31-May-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
mempool on 50 payment went almost directly to 5mb, and the blaster stopped.


[31-May-18 08:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
working just as its supposed to

or not actually, when it dropped under 60s wasnt enough. I need to calibrate that better aswell.

[31-May-18 10:36 AM] mark81#0000
Hmmm. I have been wondering that how TXSCL chains can be used as a payments channel? Or is it just s proof of consept?


[31-May-18 10:36 AM] mark81#0000
jl777


[31-May-18 10:39 AM] jl777#0000
they are just a testnet, but once a real cluster of chains are made, it can be used for whatever crypto can be used for


[31-May-18 10:45 AM] mark81#0000
Okay so those are different chains and technology out of komodo itself. Is there any way that komodo can use scaling chains to get boost to transaction scaling? Lets say all of those chains are payments channel and are settled in komodo after some time period wouldnt that in theory boosts komodos ability to do transactions through them?


[31-May-18 10:46 AM] mark81#0000
They would act in this sameway like lightning network in bitcoin are if i have understood it correctly.


[31-May-18 10:49 AM] jl777#0000
the next hardfork we can enable this for KMD itself, yes


[31-May-18 11:04 AM] libscott#0000
mark81 it doesn't have the same scalability characteristic as lightning. Creating assetchains is more expensive than creating channels.


[31-May-18 11:05 AM] libscott#0000
but I can see what you mean


[31-May-18 11:32 AM] shossain#0000
we have MoMoM working üôÇ
```
TXSCL002 kmdheight.858718 CCid.3 MoMoM.["TXSCL002", "858718", "3"] -> {"coin":"TXSCL002","kmdheight":858718,"ccid":3,"MoMs":["ed0c93cedc473830391409defd9ff3d3d47ae583c748ffb6d8c5a9419449be53"],"notarization_hash":"e3f250ff2a8a076f7850575ebf2e0d65f84a5f1ca7149530841d8320d2e7fcd6","MoMoM":"ed0c93cedc473830391409defd9ff3d3d47ae583c748ffb6d8c5a9419449be53","data":"53be499441a9c5d8b6ff48c783e57ad4d3f39ffdde091439303847dcce930ced00000000"}
```


[31-May-18 11:34 AM] jl777#0000
well the first one yes, but 100% of them have to work, so a ways to go before we know it is working, as in 100% of the time


[31-May-18 07:00 PM] maegus#0000
So MoMoM is being recognized by the different chains

I think this should do for stats unless there is anything else you can think of we need?


[31-May-18 08:42 PM] imylomylo#0000
`mempoolMB` & `mempooltx` - looks like two to me.


[31-May-18 08:43 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Do you think there is anything else we need?


[31-May-18 08:43 PM] imylomylo#0000
not for stats.  as long as we have the blockchains available for inspection by 3rd party to verify


[31-May-18 08:43 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Otherwise I'm commiting this repo and starting on getting 2xTxBlasters for single payment Tx working.


[31-May-18 08:43 PM] blackjok3r#0000
yes they are saved into a shared data volume


[31-May-18 08:44 PM] blackjok3r#0000
the stats JSON is also saved there inside the .komodo folder incase anything goes wrong on the DB side


[31-May-18 08:44 PM] imylomylo#0000
ok - good idea

The CPU/RAM use of this method is really low hey, It goes in blasts, we can likley fit 2-3 chains PER CPU lol.

i'll clear the DB of existing records


[31-May-18 08:46 PM] libscott#0000
what about memory? doesnt each instance consume 1 gig of ram?


[31-May-18 08:46 PM] blackjok3r#0000
memory will be the main issue yes


[31-May-18 08:47 PM] libscott#0000
I wonder what's using all that ram ü§î any ideas?


[31-May-18 08:47 PM] blackjok3r#0000
But starting the chains from block 0 and blasting for 1H each komodod is liek 400mb ran.


[31-May-18 08:47 PM] blackjok3r#0000
once its over like 1000 blocks ram is much higher


[31-May-18 08:48 PM] blackjok3r#0000
My best guess is some kind of index.


[31-May-18 08:48 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I think assetchains use txindex=1 by default


[31-May-18 08:48 PM] blackjok3r#0000
maybe I should run some tests later with that on/off and see how much diffrence it makes.


[31-May-18 08:49 PM] blackjok3r#0000
the less resource we can use per chain, the more chains we can rnu.


[31-May-18 08:49 PM] libscott#0000
leveldb cache size is adjustable


[31-May-18 08:50 PM] libscott#0000
getting to 1000 chains will be hard tho thats for sure


[31-May-18 08:50 PM] blackjok3r#0000
for iguana?


[31-May-18 08:50 PM] libscott#0000
what about if someone wants to write their own contract code? reckon the notaries will run it?


[31-May-18 08:50 PM] libscott#0000
no, for a notary... the notaries are the bottleneck, right? each new chain needs to be run by all notaries


[31-May-18 08:50 PM] libscott#0000
(in theory)


[31-May-18 08:51 PM] libscott#0000
notaries*chains... it's not the same as quadratic scalability but it's similar


[31-May-18 08:51 PM] blackjok3r#0000
bbs.


[31-May-18 09:02 PM] blackjok3r#0000
We can deploy more notary networks for more chains. Just scale up the iguana instances.


[31-May-18 09:03 PM] blackjok3r#0000
The same as you have m_notary_testnet.... you just make elected_1 elected_2 etc


[31-May-18 09:29 PM] maegus#0000
I kind of thought with the advent of containerizing chains within iguana would you not be able to offload chains and still keep the same pubkey?


[31-May-18 09:29 PM] maegus#0000
I could be completely offbase, but I kind of thought that was the whole point.

[01-Jun-18 12:30 AM] blackjok3r#0000
soo very close... I think this will ahve to do. Hopefully if we run the test for 1 payment long enough we wil get a good run at maximum capacity.


[01-Jun-18 12:31 AM] blackjok3r#0000
even chainging to 2 payments would make the test a lot easier. Filling mempool with 1 payment TX is not easy. I think its even less "real world" than using a heap of reasonable size multi payment TX's too.


[01-Jun-18 12:31 AM] imylomylo#0000

pgsql failed though with too much incoming and not enough spreading of load or cores to play with


[01-Jun-18 02:11 AM] smk762#0000
could maybe drop one or two of the timestamps too if space / bandwidth and issue. updatedAt/createdAt looks like a duplicate


[01-Jun-18 02:22 AM] smk762#0000
*thinking out loud* possible to add k/v pair for timespan?


[01-Jun-18 02:22 AM] blackjok3r#0000
bandwidth shouldnt be an issue for 8196 chains its like 700kb per minute lol... raw JSON data.


[01-Jun-18 02:23 AM] smk762#0000
üò£ maybe I need to think a bit longer !


[01-Jun-18 02:25 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I think for now we should just get it working with 1 chain and test 1 payment and 100 payment to calibrate stuff.


[01-Jun-18 02:26 AM] blackjok3r#0000
But yeah, can't the DB take the data and send a total of X chains to the stats instead of the stats site having to do all the math?


[01-Jun-18 02:26 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I thaught thats why we used AWS DB, for its scalability?


[01-Jun-18 02:27 AM] smk762#0000
I'm all for it, but I guess you need me to let you know what all the math is

will read up a bit on dynamodb so I can request effectively.


[01-Jun-18 02:30 AM] smk762#0000
current json is raw blocknotify?


[01-Jun-18 02:42 AM] imylomylo#0000
if dynamodb too complicated, sql backend no dramas with rest api to fetch
but if we're doing that, may as well just send txt files to servers directly üôÇ

point of having aws involved is to begin the integration process, and another scaling factor to grow along with for dApp developers to have blockchain template backend


[01-Jun-18 02:42 AM] smk762#0000
happy to learn towards the fastest way. no need to go backwards for convenience. Just trying to get my head around the schema etc


[01-Jun-18 02:43 AM] imylomylo#0000
on submission of block data, can just add it to another table with one record fetched, last block height, tx count, ts
e.g.
height 1, tx 8000, timestamp
height 2, tx 15888, ts
height 3, tx 20100, ts
height 4, tx 25999, ts

or something like that


[01-Jun-18 02:44 AM] smk762#0000
so, blocknotify populates main table, and from there slimmer aggregate tables can be produced?

I got a good story of forgetting about aws. During last round of scaletesting, I setup kinesis, and wandered through aws reading up on things. Somehow, I setup a whole bunch of sharding while looking into capacity and cost. Can't remember hitting "buy" or "apply" though. The instance they offered with the Alooma trial was using amazon linux as the OS, which didn't play nice when I tried to build komodo, so I logged out and went back to doing work on the collector hosted with vultr.


[01-Jun-18 08:37 PM] smk762#0000
About a week later, went back to aws to see if I could link up.

[02-Jun-18 05:26 AM] shossain#0000
i even tested notarization only with 2 CPU threads for these 64 chains couple of days ago. it went smooth


[02-Jun-18 05:30 AM] blackjok3r#0000
There is almost no situation where all chains will have full blocks, like we are doing with these chains. So a single server may be able to notarize 256 chains even. The only thing is starting that many chains at once, requires the system to be firewalled otherwise you get port conflicts. This would be a PITA in a real world situation. Managing notary node having to do that would be annoying.


[02-Jun-18 05:51 AM] shossain#0000
though, i didn't have any blocks synced


[02-Jun-18 05:51 AM] shossain#0000
with these ccid and MoMoM printouts, we almost don't see normal notarization printouts. and, they run very fast üòõ


[02-Jun-18 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#0000
It becomes a problem only when chains you first start have TCP connections, and use up ports


[02-Jun-18 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#0000
yeah 64 chains must be intense on the prints lol


[02-Jun-18 05:51 AM] shossain#0000
yes, no notarizations yet on those chains


[02-Jun-18 05:51 AM] blackjok3r#0000
few 0's in there? is that just because not enough notarizations on those chains I guess?


[02-Jun-18 05:52 AM] shossain#0000
i mean, since i started about 30 minutes ago. it can take some time for all chains to start notarizing after iguana started


[02-Jun-18 05:52 AM] shossain#0000
12 chains remaining


[02-Jun-18 05:52 AM] blackjok3r#0000
For sure. We have already found and fixed a lot of bottlenecks.

I need to make sure its 100% working for a few tests but its safe to say I think its good. By the end of tomorrow it will defiantly be finished. There is only the stats end left now. Currently all the data is pushed to that AWS dynamoDB its just up to @Mylo and smk762 to work out what to do with it.


[03-Jun-18 01:08 AM] jl777#0000
have we verified the data is good


[03-Jun-18 01:18 AM] blackjok3r#0000
It should be fine. All i am doing is taking the length of the .tx in `getblock` rather than pushing all the transaction hashes. the code is all commented if anyone wants to check it.

batching: "Batching accounts for roughly 12% of all transactions, 40% of all outputs, and 30‚Äì60% of all raw BTC output value. Not bad."


[03-Jun-18 09:22 PM] jl777#0000
maybe we need to do more education about the benefits of batching. For most businesses that are not time sensitive in payments, they can batch 100 tx into a single one and save 90% of space

payroll is common and an obvious use case.


[03-Jun-18 09:31 PM] jl777#0000
yes for that it can even become a 1000 payment tx


[03-Jun-18 09:32 PM] jl777#0000
but also payables, i can see an automate payments batching system that companies use that combines multisig approvals to save costs for BTC txfees, and once this is available it would work with any bitcoin protocol coin


[03-Jun-18 09:37 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Yes. We strongly encourage any analysts, investors, journalists, and developers to look past mere transaction count from now on. *The default measure of Bitcoin‚Äôs performance should be ‚Äúpayments per day‚Äù rather than transaction count.* This also makes Bitcoin more comparable with other UTXO chains. They generally have significantly variable payments-per-transaction ratios, so just using payments standardizes that. (Stay tuned: Coinmetrics will be rolling out tools to facilitate this very soon.)

percentage levies on payment processing (visa, mastercard), plus potential interest on the debt incurred, and inflation caused, all while giving up trade privacy and being subject to profiling based on purchase item/time/locatation
vs.
low flat rate fee for batch payment processing + opt-in methodology for sharing private metadata

not sure this will be much of an issue either way


[04-Jun-18 06:07 AM] jl777#0000
yes at first the blocks come faster


[04-Jun-18 06:07 AM] blackjok3r#0000
ok. its just that the blocks for 1 payment are not totally full 100% of the time, when blocks are that fast.


[04-Jun-18 06:08 AM] blackjok3r#0000
but the TX/s will be much higher than expected in that time.


[04-Jun-18 06:25 AM] jl777#0000
currently average BTC is still less than 3 payments, but this will change over time

i think 15 minutes for each test is good


[04-Jun-18 08:08 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Also going to test a version that uses timestamp to calculate starting time. I think polling a webserver 16000 times a minute might be a bottleneck.

Also going to test a version that uses timestamp to calculate starting time. I think polling a webserver 32000 times a minute might be a bottleneck.


[04-Jun-18 08:21 AM] jl777#0000
polling even 100 times a minute seems overkill


[04-Jun-18 08:21 AM] blackjok3r#0000
The script checks on each block for a file of a webserver to tell it to start


[04-Jun-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#0000
because there is 16000+ continers, and block time is 30s


[04-Jun-18 08:22 AM] blackjok3r#0000
it could get overloaded. Going to test timestamp condition just so we have a backup plan.


[04-Jun-18 09:04 AM] imylomylo#0000
sounds like a fun challenge.  what's the trigger?


[04-Jun-18 09:05 AM] blackjok3r#0000

for time stamp


[04-Jun-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#0000
for using website. Currently pulls from git, but I am not sure that will work. We like the website version better as we can manually start it whenever we are ready. but using a timestamp, we dont know exactly what time all the chains will be ready, so it will likley cost more $$$, because everything will need to be runnign for quite a long time, before blast is started.


[04-Jun-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#0000
if we miss time the blast... it will require starting everything from the start again.


[04-Jun-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#0000
```#fetch the start variable, if we have a start block height then the blaster will start
if [ $start -eq 0 ] && [ $startblockheight -eq 0 ]; then
  curl $STARTURL -o start
  sleep 1
  exit
elif [ $start -eq 1 ] && [ $startblockheight -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "startblockheight=$HEIGHT" > startblockheight
  sleep 1
  exit
fi```


[04-Jun-18 09:06 AM] blackjok3r#0000
```#check the time, if we have a start block height then the blaster will start
if [ $start -eq 0 ] && [ $startblockheight -eq 0 ]; then
  #block=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=$chain getblock $HEIGHT)
  time=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=$chain getblock $HEIGHT | jq -r .time)
  if [ $time -ge $STARTTIME ]; then
    echo "start=1" > start
  fi
  sleep 1
  exit
elif [ $start -eq 1 ] && [ $startblockheight -eq 0 ]; then
  echo "startblockheight=$HEIGHT" > startblockheight
  sleep 1
  exit
fi```


[04-Jun-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#0000
getting 8196 chains to do the same thing at the same time, is going to be the hardest part of the process.


[04-Jun-18 09:07 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Hopefully everything can be bactched up so we can test a small verison with say 1024 chains then just x8 that for full test.

blackjok3r - could you set a condition to start 4 times as many needed to ensure a perfect blast condition? Duplicates would get ignored... and then sync the timestamps for the usable nodes in the background? .... stager the times out to optimal running conditions for the hardware - dupliucate sync and adjust with scripts ....redundancy ...

if you wanted to stagger chain start up into clusters of 64, e.g. group1, 2, 3, 4 to start at different blockheights, just adjust the activation json object accordingly with your own key/value scheme

I would stager according to CPU/RAM usage / im sure there is going to be a wavelength yet to be disvovered..  - break it down to rediculas - 8 chains every 1 second for 8 seconds - would be an example - keep peak usage at 60-70% ish.  Then multiply it out from there- and im not sure how hes d


[04-Jun-18 05:55 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Yes, I thaught about something like this, because the CPU use doesn't actaully stay flat, each chain has bursts of CPU use then sits basically idle for a while. I was going to just cram as many chains onto a single vCPU as I could that kept the mempool full. I don't think staggering them by much will be needed, because using blocktime as a the condition of when events are called, they will already be randomly selected over a few minutes.


[04-Jun-18 05:55 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Sweet I will have a look at that. if we can basically Ddoss it from every node, fetching a 7 byte file this is the perfect solution.


[04-Jun-18 05:57 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Also I don't think having 2x the amount of chains is really feasible.


[04-Jun-18 05:57 PM] kmdkrazy#0000
Its random with the conditions beung used


[04-Jun-18 05:57 PM] blackjok3r#0000
The system is so simple, it should not have any errors. As long as they can al be told to "start" at the same time, the blocktime's will ensure all chains are staggered out.


[04-Jun-18 05:57 PM] kmdkrazy#0000
Im just thinking 2 gatlung guns aimed at thge sane target 'nay" have less errors


[04-Jun-18 05:57 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Also if 2 chains happen to call "block mine" and "blast loop" on the exact same second, I assume one will gain priotity and finish first, and the next time these events are called, they will be at differing times.


[04-Jun-18 05:58 PM] blackjok3r#0000
There is already 2 blasters for singel payment TX


[04-Jun-18 05:58 PM] blackjok3r#0000
but for 100paymetn TX I removed the second one, because it was causing mempool to get blasted to 50MB in some cases.

I just imagined your situatiin and tried to remove that probkem.

have you got an aws account, that way you can manage the whole thing.  if not, i can create an IAM role (sub-account) for you to deploy and make changes as needed without needing me in the path to restarts etc.  first option is quicker, i'm not familiar with IAM roles so much.

can use it, though probably stuff to add outside what I see from my side. form Lionel Richie onward, it's not AWS. Could migrate, but it'd mean a bit of time installing node modules, db etc.

the biggest thing is getting all that data at once so you can use it. AWS seems close to the only solution to this.

When can we be ready for arbitary number of chains test?

as soon as I have AWS access to test how mnay chains per vCPU. Not sure of machine power compared to VULTR.


[05-Jun-18 12:36 AM] blackjok3r#0000
the meeting is on thursday, early morning my time.


[05-Jun-18 12:37 AM] blackjok3r#0000
and @Mylo needs to get the DB to submit the correct stats query to smk762


[05-Jun-18 12:39 AM] jl777#0000
ok, so lets get everything ready and validated, thursday we get approved and do the tests as soon after as we can. already we are notarizing so that is good


[05-Jun-18 12:39 AM] jl777#0000
also we have many hertzner dedicated servers that have RAM and SSD but not much available CPU cores. if you need such nodes, we can make them available


[05-Jun-18 12:43 AM] blackjok3r#0000
ok cool. those would be good for notary network if you want to expand that. I think some notaries wanted to run the testnet also. are we sticking with 64 chains for notarization? and do these chains have the be the same chains as the load test. 

If so we can do this, just need the seed IP containers IP pushed to somewhere for a seed node list.


[05-Jun-18 12:44 AM] jl777#0000
i would like to verify we can notarize during the blast, but no need to notarize more than 64 chains


[05-Jun-18 12:44 AM] blackjok3r#0000
ok no problem, I will make it so.

jl777 I am working on parser which can generate docker-compose yaml definition file for scale test. Sometimes ago there was discussion about generation of magic file taking too long and that you would be able to generate this for us. Such JSON structure (example) works for me and I can parse that with python:
```
[
  {
    "assetname": "TXSCL001",
    "p2p": 12345,
    "rpc": 12346,
    "supply": 1700000,
    "ac_cc": 1,
    "ac_reward": 100000000,
    "notarize": true
  },
  {
    "assetname": "TXSCL002",
    "p2p": 12347,
    "rpc": 12348,
    "supply": 1700000,
    "ac_cc": 1,
    "ac_reward": 100000000,
    "notarize": false
  }
]
```
`"notarize": true` should be set for assetchains which should be notarized (first 64 chains?), these containers must be deployed differently (with ingress controller). Can you please generate such JSON file for us?


[05-Jun-18 12:16 PM] jl777#0000
yes, will have it done tomorrow


[05-Jun-18 12:18 PM] patchkez#0000

[05-Jun-18 12:34 PM] shossain#0000
the first 64 chains are already being notarized


[05-Jun-18 04:58 PM] blackjok3r#0000
Those chains will not be able to be used for the full stress test as they are too long


[05-Jun-18 04:58 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I need to start them again.


[05-Jun-18 04:59 PM] blackjok3r#0000
We will change the supply, so that they dont go on a fork.


[05-Jun-18 05:22 PM] blackjok3r#0000
The first 64 will be started maybe half a day or a day in advance of the rest and we will get them notarizing empty blocks well before the TxBlast is activated.

jl777 ok, do I need to set also:
```
-ac_cc=
-ac_end=
-ac_reward= 
-ac_halving= 
-ac_decay=```
? otherwise values are set to `0`


[06-Jun-18 08:50 AM] jl777#0000
if not set it is 0, ac_cc should be 3

patchkez do you know what the estimated cost would be?


[07-Jun-18 02:34 PM] patchkez#0000
@n2okpride for first 64 chains, we need 3 x m4.16xlarge (3 x 64vCPUs, ) instances. Pricing for one instance is $3.84 per Hour, this makes 11.52$/hour for 3 instances. I am not sure how long we need to make this notarization test. @SHossain do you know? Then for this 8192 chains scale test - `16384 virtual CPUS = 256 x m4.16xlarge instances` are needed. But we will try to make this 8192 chains test short within 1 hour. For one chain we count with 2 vCPUs, maybe we will be able to limit it to less cores without loosing much performance.


[07-Jun-18 02:37 PM] shossain#0000
We don't need AWS for notary nodes. we have servers for this.


[07-Jun-18 02:39 PM] shossain#0000
the first 64 chains, i can manage them myself. jl777 told me we have enough servers to use for notarization. and, i can put 1 of my alien tech server for txblasting many chains


[07-Jun-18 02:40 PM] jl777#0000
notarization we can use the existing 2 nodes, its just a proof of concept


[07-Jun-18 02:40 PM] jl777#0000
for blasting i think it is best to use instances as that would need to scale up with the number of chains


[07-Jun-18 02:40 PM] patchkez#0000
ok


[07-Jun-18 02:41 PM] jl777#0000
of course more blasting from fixed servers would be fine but I dont think that works much beyond saturating a few chains per server, so best to make them instances


[07-Jun-18 02:58 PM] n2okpride#0000
patchkez i'm talking with AWS about getting some credits if we can wait


[07-Jun-18 02:58 PM] n2okpride#0000
if we need it quickly to get sizing and configuration prework done then we can expense now


[07-Jun-18 02:58 PM] n2okpride#0000
just let me know


[07-Jun-18 06:34 PM] blackjok3r#0000
The balsters and miners are the same docker image. You cannot seperate them out, unless I start all over again, and waste 2 weeks of work. They need to be deployed as docker image pairs. The first 64 will have ports open for 2-4 external servers to connect to. I was supplied with 4x4core servers yesterday to get all this working as a test. If a 4 core server can notarize 64 chains then we are set except for AWS credit for the mining/blasting nodes.


[07-Jun-18 06:35 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I cant see why a 4 core server cant do 64 chains, but maybe 16gb ram wont be enough, but I have a feeling extrapolating what my NN uses that it will be perfectly fine.


[07-Jun-18 07:22 PM] imylomylo#0000
is it just a matter of running up an AWS image and testing?  i can run one up for a cpl hour no probs


[07-Jun-18 07:42 PM] blackjok3r#0000
it uses kubernetes


[07-Jun-18 07:43 PM] blackjok3r#0000
But I gues for the 64 chain test I can just load it into a single AWS instance and do `docker-compose up -d`


[07-Jun-18 07:44 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I need to fix the docker-compose.yml patchkex made, as its a few versions old. I used a hacky workaround to pass and SSH tunnel for the p2p port from the mining node to the host to make the available to the outside world for my NN's to connect to it.


[07-Jun-18 07:45 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I am doing some other stuff for now and will come back to this, there is no use editing the file by hand for a few hours, when patch can probably just change the template and generate a new one in a few minutes.

for the big test it depends on how many chains they want

#of chains * 2 cores * 1 hour

I think I can fit more chains than 1 on 2 cores, but this is something I need to test.


[11-Jun-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
8196 chains gets us to 1.2Million TX/s


[11-Jun-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
and that is what I have generated configs for.


[11-Jun-18 10:55 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Quick calculation comes out at about $50,000 per hour at 2 core per chain. and I am not sure you can even start 16392 containers and run the test withing a single hour


[11-Jun-18 10:55 AM] jl777#0000
so enough for 20,000 core hours should be enough to achieve the million tx/s


[11-Jun-18 10:56 AM] blackjok3r#0000
Its hard to say without actaully testing on AWS itself.


[11-Jun-18 10:58 AM] jl777#0000
yes, that is why we need the credits, so we can verify things


[11-Jun-18 11:00 AM] blackjok3r#0000
mining can be limited to 1/4 core on VULTR without issue. If we can do this on AWS, it will save a lot of money.


[11-Jun-18 11:02 AM] n2okpride#0000
can you provide a document i can present later today so i'm prepared to make the right funding request?


[11-Jun-18 11:02 AM] n2okpride#0000
i know there needs to be some initial testing to get the sizing correct, so let's split that project cost from the wider stress test requirements


[11-Jun-18 11:08 AM] n2okpride#0000
partner manager also indicated we'd need to identify which AWS products will be in use


[11-Jun-18 11:09 AM] n2okpride#0000
On our call last week they did mention the use of spot instances. let's try and factor that as an option in the proposal if it makes sense and meets our req


[11-Jun-18 11:10 AM] blackjok3r#0000
I tried to use spot for my tests on EC2, but that is not what will be used for full scale test.


[11-Jun-18 11:17 AM] patchkez#0000
for initial testing, I think we are good with 3 x `c5.2xlarge` instances which is 3 x 0.34$ per hour. we need to deploy these instances in one of these regions: 
`US West (Oregon) (us-west-2)` or `US East (N. Virginia) (us-east-1)` where EKS service is available.
So it is like 1$ per hour for 3 instances, maybe we need to test 7 days (not full 24 hours per day, once we are done with testing for the day we can stop instance in order to not be charged). So it is like 84$ for instances. 
We will use Amazon EKS (managed Kubernetes Service), Amazon Elastic Block store.
It is hard to predict exact cost because they charge you almost for everything e.g. network traffic.


[11-Jun-18 12:13 PM] patchkez#0000
@n2okpride ah and I forgot, we will use also DynamoDB


[11-Jun-18 10:00 PM] Mylo#8306
what's the fastest way i can load up a docker image just to fire off a curl command?
i want to "DoS" the api for blocknotify to hit and simulate the load for dynamodb.

doing 1000 writes/s, the 'monthly' cost is $483. ($17/day)
doing 5000 writes/s, monthly cost is $2420 ($80/day)


Reads cost only 20% of writes, wouldn't need more than 10 reads/s tbh....so $2/month

If a docker image can be created and 8192 containers fired up over a few servers to fire off a curl command all within 10 seconds or so (passing in an env variable to POST to DynamoDB) should be able to work out DynamoDB costs.


[11-Jun-18 10:02 PM] Mylo#8306
env variable will just be the incremental instance number, fetching this from AWS to make sure it got written and to inspect the logs of any failures.

need to know when it breaks


[13-Jun-18 06:01 PM] Mylo#8306
so if i need to give you an updated URL, do you need to rebuild docker or can you do it at runtime?


[13-Jun-18 06:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
ok cool. this test uses 64 chains, so it should scale linearly to X.


[13-Jun-18 06:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Its goes in the docker-compose.yml.... so the docker image does not need to be rebuilt. but it cannot change mid test.


[13-Jun-18 06:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
Unless I make it pull the url from shared data dir ü§î

sorted by time.  looks like you tested with TXSCL220 for a bit before the blast started


[13-Jun-18 07:00 PM] Mylo#8306
so i'm gonna have to update what you send to that blocknotify url when i need to process stuff, every 5 seconds or something, set a colum `postprocessing` or any arbitrary name.

anything with no value (fresh block info) i'll update with 0 as in postprocessing=0, it's ready to be processed.
after bing processed postprocessing=1 
at this stage, it has been aggregated into some other table for @smkhound to chuck into cartography


[13-Jun-18 07:02 PM] Mylo#8306
found some limits AWS puts on stuff - like lambda functions limited to 1000 iterations, retrieval of DB stuff 1MB of data otherwise multiple queries etc.

Yeah I think he wanted to fetch everything for last 2000  entries then filter out what he already had... but if you can do that on the DB via that method you just said, then thats even better.

if we find we hit limits, then to split up URL for each 64 chains in the docker-compose file will be no probs, because i can aggregate the data for smk across any number of urls


[13-Jun-18 09:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hmm... I think maybe the variance I was getting too might have been the stats failing to submit.... for now I just put `&` at the end of the curl commands so the script can just continue if anything fails.


[13-Jun-18 09:11 PM] Deleted User#0000

and the pause mining will be calculated from that time, so all blasters start with a full mempool within  1 minute of each other they all start mining blocks.

Does anyone know if this is a reasonable assumption about AWS?
64 vCPU instance is $3 per hour, so thats ~$0.047 (4.7c per hour) Per CPU.
If we need 8196 vCPU's  it would only be $385 per hour? 
If this is about right, then this will be no worries to run for a few hours?

[slack] <patchkez> @Mylo(KomodoPioneers) this is the curl Docker image you requested for testing requests against DynamoDB
https://github.com/patchkez/scaletest_containers/tree/master/dynamodb_requests_testing
you can start 8196 containers, or you can modify docker-compose and leave there only few chains. Curl is executed with 0.1s delay in the loop. If you need to deploy it on some faster HW, let me know, I will be glad to help.

you can connect as many "nodes" to it as your like if you have the money/resources to deploy them all.

[matrix] <jl777:matrix.org> if anybody claims that a blockchain with nodes on AWS  wont work with normal nodes, I would like to know what their basis for this claim is? AWS nodes are like normal nodes as far as blockchain goes

New trigger is working great.. there is still some variation between the two tests due to block time variations... but we can just increase the amount of blocks in the first test by some more.. the Stats website can tell the difference between  1 payment and 100 payment blocks anyway so it shouldn't really matter if we get a little bit of crossover. 

if it proves to be an issue once I can test with the stats site, I can adjust the gaps between the tests. Main thing is I managed to get single payment to run for 15 minutes with full blocks for 20 blocks, using just a singel CPU per chain. üòÑ


[14-Jun-18 02:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <CrypToon> Hey, not really sure what you mean by this question and why it is relevant, there was one vCPU per chain. You can connect as many nodes to is as you like if you have the money/resources to deploy them all. The bandwidth is approx 2mb per minute per chain, so it‚Äôs not really an issue.

[slack] <CrypToon> Something like this?


[14-Jun-18 05:29 AM] smkhound#7640
payments per tx calc could be better, just based on a couple of reference values at the moment. It can detect where all tx in block are 100 or all tx in block are 20, but mixed payment/tx blocks are less relaiable.


[14-Jun-18 05:30 AM] smkhound#7640
if some chains are on 20 and others are on 100, it's all good

hey @patchkez would i be able to use a python threadpool to issue curl requests to load test my amz rest api pretty easily? e.g. https://www.codementor.io/lance/simple-parallelism-in-python-du107klle

[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> @mylo5ha5:matrix.org: did not try any python multithreaded app in container, but I assune it will work. containers are just isolated processes. did you try docker images + docker-compose I prepared for you?


[15-Jun-18 01:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
You can spawn multiple process inside a container no problem. I did it for the TxBlaster, it uses komodod + blocknotify and and pre-compiled marketmaker.


[15-Jun-18 10:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <smk762> any explorers for the asset chains at the moment? want to review a few reference blocks to confirm logic for blocksize  => payment per tx detction.


[15-Jun-18 10:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <smk762> @Mylo(KomodoPioneers) in the json / csv, is the `mempooltx` value equivalent to sum of payment counts within `totaltx` value? if so I'll use that rather than calc on my end.


[15-Jun-18 11:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
```block=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=$chain getblock $HEIGHT)
    mempool=$(komodo-cli -ac_name=$chain getmempoolinfo)
    blockinfo=$(echo $block | jq '{size, height, time}')
    totaltx=$(echo $block | jq '.tx | length')
    mempooltx=$(echo $mempool | jq -r .size)

Thats the JSON being pushed to the DB.


[15-Jun-18 11:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
If you need anything else please let me know and I can calculate it on this end, as this node has very low load as it is, and there is one for every chain, it will keep everything nice and distributed.


[15-Jun-18 11:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think you want to totally ignore mempool info, as I only put that in there for my own debuging of TxBlaster.


[15-Jun-18 11:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
And  unless you put something to show mempool size on stats website, that info is redundant and I will remove it for real test.


[16-Jun-18 12:02 AM] smkhound#7640
yeah looks like mempool stuff not needed on my end. can calc payment per tx from block size, or simply from `totaltx`.


[16-Jun-18 12:02 AM] smkhound#7640
8859 means singles


[16-Jun-18 12:03 AM] smkhound#7640
557 means hundreds

a little fuzzy inbetween, but when we're at capacity it is pretty straight forward

[matrix] <jl777:matrix.org> bytes per tx, calculate this and it will be easy to differentiate. dont just use total tx per block

THe is no possible way that a single chain can mix blocks of 1 payment and 100 payment.


[16-Jun-18 12:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
but there could be some chains on 1 and some one 100, but it is not much crossover.


[16-Jun-18 12:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <jl777:matrix.org> yes but it is possible to not have a full block


[16-Jun-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763

Yes towards the end of the single payment there will be blocks that are not full. 100 payment, I am yet to see a block that is not full.

But calculating it per byte or pre TX is the way to go.

sweet, so all we need now is a way for the DB to push the required data to you. The last test I ran with 64 chains I lef the AWS on stopped, so its no issue to load it up and run another test any time. No need to rebuild docker image.

I have a call with AWS tomorrow morning regarding funding and securing enough infrastructure. I have a working set of containers that use 1 vCPU per chain, to fill blocks with 1 payment and 100 payment Transactions. 
The last thing needed is the DynamoDB to aggregate data.  Mylo(KomodoPioneers) started on this, and its a great solution, but he hasnt got the time right now to work on it. 
I started on this today, and think I have got a solution that will work just fine but I need to check with AWS tomorrow I am understanding how the DynamoDB works.

@SHossain the tx_stream repo is outdated, it uses the insight apis which is no longer how we get the info. We now use blocknotify. 
I've left tx_stream as is because it might be useful for other things involving insight apis which many coins offer. 
I'll push the updated script once DynamoDB is feeding out data (set to random at the moment).

Not 100% on how you fetch it, but it sorts the chain by timestamp so it should be only a matter of fetching the last 1000 entries with a trigger and lambda API

just need to put in a few more entries to my table to verify it works correctly though. I have only pushed a single chain, and manually changed the timestamp to verify it sorts properly

It sorts by chain name... darn it... cant make timestamp main key, because that would need a single shard of hte DB would gett hammered every second there is multiple blocks. üò¶


[19-Jun-18 11:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ok... If I can figure out how to issue a scan call, you can sort and retrieve anything greater than or equal to a timestamp.


[19-Jun-18 11:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can get it to work on AWS console... Just dunno how to issue that call in node.js..


[20-Jun-18 12:18 AM] Mylo#8306
nice work getting rid of `id`.  yeah the `hash` just needs to be `chain name` and the `range key` is the timestamp or block üòÑ


[20-Jun-18 12:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah its just fetching it... I think using scan, will be very costly


[20-Jun-18 12:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
as it will eat up a lot of write units fetching the entire table every3s


[20-Jun-18 12:19 AM] Mylo#8306
is `query` cheaper?


[20-Jun-18 12:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
There is a way to use a fetch trigger


[20-Jun-18 12:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
query simply does not work, you need to query each chain seperatly


[20-Jun-18 12:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
thats even worse than pushing all the data directly to SMK's DB


[20-Jun-18 12:20 AM] Mylo#8306
ok cool.


[20-Jun-18 12:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
chain name was the only key we have that fits the description of what the main krey value needs to be. Otherwie the DB is designed badly and will throttle and break


[20-Jun-18 12:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
If I can figure out these stupid role things, I can make a trigger/stream where he can just fetch the last 1000 entries


[20-Jun-18 12:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
and filter out what every he already has


[20-Jun-18 12:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
then we only have to pay for writes üòÑ


[20-Jun-18 12:23 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah dynamodb (nosql) design is different to relational.  chain name as hash/key is cool.


[20-Jun-18 12:23 AM] Mylo#8306
scanning a whole table shouldn't be too costly.

Yeah I guess we just try it, and see what it costs for 64 chains

if thats no good we can look at a data stream.


[20-Jun-18 01:42 AM] smkhound#7640
we can change 3 sec to 5 sec to reduce number of queries


[20-Jun-18 01:43 AM] smkhound#7640
just need to find the optimum balance between write units and payload size


[20-Jun-18 01:45 AM] smkhound#7640
136.5 records per sec is the average for 8192 chains. say 500 for 3 sec and 1000 for 5 sec with a bit of wiggle room.


[20-Jun-18 01:47 AM] smkhound#7640
if timestamp defines records returned, num of records will vary, so shouldnt lose any blocks. just need to handle  anticipated edge cases in payload size.


[20-Jun-18 02:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
I am not sure how many read "credits" are used on a scan. We will have to test it on 64 chains over say 10 minutes and then see. tbh I dont think we are going to hit any crazy numbers, this DB is designed to handle TB's of data, and we are dealing with bytes lol.


[20-Jun-18 02:45 AM] smkhound#7640
at a glance, if json records (following format in mylos csv)  for each scan have to be less than 1mb, we can handle at least 5000.


[20-Jun-18 02:46 AM] smkhound#7640
odds of 5/8ths of the chains reporting completed blocks over the 3 second  window is slim.


[20-Jun-18 02:50 AM] smkhound#7640
if read credits become the limiting factor, we can stretch time interval. it'll increase chances of excessive block completion during interval, but error rate should still be marginal.

Well a 64 chain test run up to about 350 blocks filled 97gb of the AWS ssd. But this includeed all docker stuff and the host os, I will get better metrics of data use and data created in next test now the shared data volume is fixed. 
If you mean the size of the transactions, they vary in size a lot, blocks just under 2mb, 1 payment fits 8859 transactions but 100payment fits 557.

we may start again shortly, as we had a few issues again.


[24-Jun-18 04:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
There is now a countdown timer, I might also add a small random delay to the start timer, as the DB gets flooded when all chains start at the exact  same time.

ok added 30s random delay to start, should stop the initial burst of blocks. and lowered time to live on Dynamo DB to 5 mins so we use less read capacity.

[24-Jun-18 05:39 AM] smkhound#7640
had issue where if I restarted the aggregation script after a change during a test run, it would re-read the history in dynamo table and possibly count them twice in the json which is output for the graph history. values stored in db were ok though.

DynamoDB and Lambda are awesome... the start trigger is actally only using free teir, and even with 8196 chains I doubt it will get over free tier useage... Dynamo DB even for 8196 chains is like max $200 USD per month, and we only need it for a day.

how expensive are the competing proposed scaling solutions?


[24-Jun-18 05:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yet to confirm costs for Kubernetes though, for chains above 64. The first 64 are a separate test and will have 4 NotaryNodes preforming notatizations during blast.  The costs for 64 chains for a 3h test with NotaryNodes and everything would be less than $50.


[24-Jun-18 05:47 AM] CrisF#3405
That's an amazingly cheap investment to showcase the tech.


[24-Jun-18 05:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
one chain per vCPU is pretty amazing in itself... and I was able to preform notarizations with 4 core servers, but they were hitting their limits so for big test I will use 8 core and 32gb ram.


[24-Jun-18 05:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
that is to notarize 64 chains on each server. Bear in mind though in real world, the notary nodes would number 64 not 4. So this would increase costs a fair bit.

the only point of failure was the place where all the stats are pushed to. and Lambda and DynamoDB can scale to some absolutly crazy numbers... we are at like 0.1% of its capacity even with 8196 chains... technically if this test goes well... someone could for the repos and deploy 32,000 chains or even 100,000 if they can get enough vCPU's from AWS/Google lol

We would only need to put the blocknotify script onto a single NotaryNode or seed node for all KMD assetchains, and we could adapt this site for a KMD Tx/s easily. Saves only using it this once.... Considering the amount of man hours gone into making it.

yep, just used dynamoDB to handle aggregation of data... it could scale out to hundreds of thousands of chains I think, but you would need to move more code to a lambda function at that scale, rather than on smks VPS.,


[25-Jun-18 08:20 PM] Deleted User#0000

[25-Jun-18 08:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah... I will set it up for sure, after all whats the use of making a system like this to use it for a few hours... seems a bit of a waste, even if its a world record.

[25-Jun-18 11:49 PM] Gateway#3763

[26-Jun-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Gives time to get AWS to sort it out.


[26-Jun-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Yes everything now uses a single docker image... for all chains, however the first 64 are a separate YAML launched on an EC2 instance so I can connect Notary Nodes hosted in Hetzner I think they are.


[26-Jun-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> ok


[26-Jun-18 12:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> it is single docker image, but we still need to start 2 containers right?


[26-Jun-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Yes there is -ac and -miner in YAML but both start from same image.


[26-Jun-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> blackjok3r: ok, that should not cause any issues


[26-Jun-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Everything is passed as ENV var, Just need to create template for your script to place all the chains in to the YAML for chains over 64.


[26-Jun-18 12:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> it works... So I imagine it should not lol.


[26-Jun-18 12:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> the next test needs to be at least 256 chains to test the stats website back end to make sure it scales linear or less than linear (?) or to see how big a server will be required for the full test.


[26-Jun-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> I think smk702 and i might need to run another 64 chain test tonight to make sure changes from last night are correct as we spent a long time squashing bugs to get everything to display correctly.


[26-Jun-18 12:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> why we do not scale also stats website?


[26-Jun-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> stats servers is puling the data from dynamodb right?


[26-Jun-18 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Its desgin should let it scale to very large numbers, but we just want check and make 100% sure... the last thing we want is to start 16000 containers and have it fail.


[26-Jun-18 12:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Yes, the dynamoDB receives the stats from each chain, they stay there for 4 minutes, every 5s the stats site scans everything in the DB from X timestamp, then filters out anything it already has and averages the TX/s over 5s.


[26-Jun-18 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> If I have understood correctly... smk702 will have better info than me though.


[26-Jun-18 12:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Main issues were converting the back ned from using sockets from explorers to using a JSON input and then smoothing the data so it didnt jump up and down like a rollercoaster.


[26-Jun-18 12:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> blackjok3r: can we keep the data in DynamoDB longer than 4 minutes? My concern is if there is problem with stats server and it cannot pull the data, we loose data in DynamoDB.


[26-Jun-18 12:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> No keeping it there longer than even 5minutes creates ridiculous scan times... we will overload it and slow it down so much it will fail. There is an option to back up the data before it expires, but I was unable to figure out how to make it work.


[26-Jun-18 12:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Each chain saves its own stats into the .komodo folder inside the shared volume. if Live data feed goes down we can run analysis on this after the fact.


[26-Jun-18 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> blackjok3r: ok


[26-Jun-18 12:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> however simply testing a few multiples of 64 chain clusters and electroplating the trend will tell us everything we need to know for this... we can always have 2 satats servers a backup, it will just require 2x the amount of DB reads...


[26-Jun-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> smk will be finished work in a few more hours and he can explain better the design, its quite modular and works in stages.

[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> sure, btw. everyone should document his part and put it next to his GH repo. I am documenting Kubernetes part. Will create also detailed AWS diagram when I have more time.


[26-Jun-18 12:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> nice, I have commented and documented everything on my end aswell. It would be best to have others review it for accuracy before we run a very large test. From simply working out expected TX/s for full blocks at 1 block per minute, it looks like the data its spitting out is exactly correct, but better safe than sorry.


[26-Jun-18 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> Maybe I should get dwy's script and run that on 64 chains after a test and compare its output to the data smk's site generates aswell.


[26-Jun-18 12:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <blackjok3r:matrix.org> that script was 100% accurate from all accounts in last test.


[26-Jun-18 12:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <patchkez:matrix.org> blackjok3r: yeah it is good idea.

After comparing source data from the asset chain blocks to the data the vis aggreagted, I can confirm it was under reporting on the front end during the last test on tuesday. 
Found the bug I suspect that caused it, and made a fix (yet to push to git tho).
I got random stats active on the vis this morning without being tooo late for the day job.  Left it running for about 10 hours, and it seems to be reporting true. 
Will continue to to monitor and tweak until black3joker gets back, and once we switch back from random to real hopefully it will stay that way. 
Noticed my PC at work still failing to load graph due to CORS error despite accessing data on same domain, but added headers to nginx which fixed that over lunch.

Thinking about how to add a simple validation process to be run alongside the main stream to identify issues  (and thier origin) in real time rather than make joker and me lose sleep trying to figure out wtf is going on when it doesnt look right.

Other updates pending (in order of priority) 
-Extra links to more detailed info about the testing (send me links if you have something) - done
-Restoring validated data from previous test runs into graph history
-Aesthitic tweaks after feedback from marketing - ongoing
-"all time high" tx / pt text (or graph labels)
-video capture of live graph and/or a replay button between user input timeframes
-A review of the 'effects' and metric being used front end

Potential extras down the track
-Something to keep the audience entertained while the timer counts down to the next blast.
-Subtle audio indicator to communicate imminent live blast
-ITTT to push out social media alerts prior to blasts to get more eyes on.

Anyone decent with docker able to help me with something? I created this repo that creates 64 separate containers running komodod. Problem is that each container's volume is ~900mb. Need to figure out how to trim that down if possible

dockersegid - The purpose of this is to semi-automate the process of staking coins on all 64 segids on a komodod ac_staked chain. This process is neccesary to secure a newly created ac_staked chain.

[30-Jun-18 12:58 AM] patchkez#5349
@Alright I am not sure if multiple komodod instances can share one komodod data directory. You can try to symlink ~/.komodo/blocks directory, but I have no idea if the data will be consistent


[30-Jun-18 01:01 AM] patchkez#5349
other option would be to use ZFS or BTRFS filesystems with enabled deduplication for .komodo directories

@Alright are we talking here  about docker image size or data volume mounted to each container on startup?

If you want to use verified data use the first test with 1024/chains. There were some errors with the data in the last few tests. Next week we will be testing the new stuff and once it has been verified from 2 sources and the expected result we will post here.

http://cryptocartography.io/txscl_vis/ data on the 24 was from a live data run, and I am confident of the results though they have not been validated against source data (between the green background bands on the graph). 
Live tests on 25/26th went wrong somehow, vis was under-reporting, but Web's data for the 26th is 100% confirmed valid.


[06-Jul-18 02:07 AM] smkhound#7640
data on vis without green bg band is random generated, with parameters to simulate live 64 chains, and purged periodically

Yes, the blockchains will be available on an AWS storage for anyone who has the ability to actually process that much data.

We figured out from the first test, that capturing it in real time was going to be very hard, and devised a system to do it, it wasn't easy, but this appears to be the best way to measure whats happening as is happens. You can use the script that Dwy made to get about 1024 chains at once, and then merge the SQL DB's together etc, but it becomes quite tedious and difficult. specifically since we are running everything in containers now. However the blockchain data and the JSON generated on each block, containing its timestamp, size and number of transactions, are all saved in the cloud for anyone to check.

Our most important priority this week, will be to make sure the live data is 99% accurate and documenting how it works etc. I think being transparent about how we did it, and showing the results should be enough for most people. I understand  that people will be sceptical with such a vast number of TX/s, and the estimated size of the blockchains for the test is 6.4TB! üòÆ

I'm sure it's tough to keep track of all the data for such massive tests. It's just hard for us from a marketing stand point. These tests are epic and groundbreaking but it's so easy for other projects to dismiss us or basically say we're making shit up. It's easy for them to do for 2 reasons: first, because there are lots of crypto projects that are, in fact, completely full of shit, and second, because even if they know we're telling the truth they have incentive to publicly deny our results for the sake of promoting their own projects as "the best" or "the most scalable" or whatever

didn't check this chan for a few time, in fact the script can be ran on any server / instance, the only tricky part would be just to extract each chain own table, and just run the counting for the global table. Assuming it has been done with hundreds of chains without harm, as long as we're able to get each chain's table, it's only a few commands to import em on same db instance


[08-Jul-18 02:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
and just launch the "globalizing" method


[08-Jul-18 02:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
the db for tech users just wouldn't be a proof, I think, launching the chains and verifying blocks would be a solution, to see peaks, it can also be combined with the db/webinterface to query automagically the corresponding blocks (for example just a little script with the db at a timestamp could return the exact block involved in the peak, then could be used in a loop to check on every chain the number of transactions)


[08-Jul-18 02:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
that PoV would require being on CLI. The only method for users not using CLI to check it would be explorers, but I think it was said that it was a pain in term of hardware required. Just in case it is needed, it's the same as the CLI : It's totally possible to "link" the peak to each specific explorer URL to count via GUI

Say I'm concerned the recent 51% attacks on zencash and BTG will be repeated on lots of cryptocurrencies that share common mining algorithms. I figure Komodo's dPOW is intended to protect against that, but can anyone tell me what it would look like if someone rented 51% of the KMD hashpower and tried to perform a double spend or otherwise mess with the chain?


[11-Jul-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
notaries mine 75% of blocks


[11-Jul-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
so 51% of 25% is about 13% of effective hashrate


[11-Jul-18 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD has some unique defenses against 51%


[11-Jul-18 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
in addition to dPoW notarization


[11-Jul-18 04:29 PM] jl777c#5810
which stops cold any attempt at double spends (up to the notarized height)


[11-Jul-18 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
in other words, you cant rent 51% of KMD hashpower as 75% of the effective hashrate is with the notaries

The TX and Payments per second reported live and confirmed to be 90% or more accurate. No mean feat I assure you. This is still only 64 chains and will be one of the last "real" tests we run, before moving to a "block simulator" to test the site at very large scales of chains. 

The TxBlaster itself is proving very reliable and there is no longer a reason to suck up AWS credits to run full blockchain tests. So we will move to a randomly generated stats model, and keep doubling the number of chains until the site breaks. We can separate out the back end of the website into multiple streams to scale to any number. Just like the TxBlaster's which can scale to infinity given enough CPU's .


[12-Jul-18 03:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
If anyone is around to watch the site in the next hour or so please let us know if there is anything weird going on. 
known issues:
1) the Blocks per minute number jumps around a bit, we might need to apply a soothing functon to this data, blocks come in chunks, and then breaks with no blocks. Its just how blockchains work.
2) Refreshing the website, which moves it to 'historical data' causes the reported data to be incorrect. This is being worked on, and is not anything major. Live data is correct.

That is another data source from out test last night that we used to verify the site is right. Approx 9000 - 10,000 TX/s peak and 7500 Tx/s sustained.
61,000 payments per second. peak... 
55,000 PPS sustained.

[13-Jul-18 08:22 PM] smkhound#7640
Vis history smoothing has been fixed. Had a small issue where some blocks were not being captured on the vis, leading to underreporting of transactions/payments.The fix that made sure no blocks were dropping involved recording values in 5 second increments, with increments aligned to be a unix timestamp which is a factor of 5.
It wasn't really the smoothing algo that was the problem, it was the way history was being recorded and populating the graph.


[13-Jul-18 08:25 PM] smkhound#7640
The fix to make sure all data was being recieved live resulted in blocks that were arriving late being recorded, but created potentially 3 or 4 database entries with the same timestamp. Instead of the sum of these being emitted, only the first recieved was, meaning even though blocks were being recieved and recorded, and reporting true with live data, the history data from after the initial fix wasn't passing all the info on to the highcharts graph.


[13-Jul-18 08:27 PM] smkhound#7640

*Values represented in this visualisation are plotted at 5 second increments, at intervals of 1 and 5 minutes. The finer resolution of graph points per minute, and the slight delay in recieving and processing block data, results in minor variations to values compared to the source block data graph at komodostats.com, whick are plotted at 1 and 5 minute resolution. The source block data has been stored for verification, and is normally plotted at komodostats.com within 24hrs after each test.*
*Comparison between source block data and aggregate data used for this visualisation are reviewed after each test, with validated test periods highlighted with a light green background.*
*Random data which has been used for testing is purged periodically.*

Simulating works by sending the JSON with a the data of a full block at random intervals between 30-90s to the AWS DynamoDB. Saves a huge amount of CPU's and  storage space... but really is not much different to using a real blockchain to generate the data.

once the stats are verified to work with X chains, then we are ready. All we need is AWS to allow out accout to launch X vCPU's at once. We can even use multiple regions if need be.

That's not known at this stage, I await patchkez to return from vacation to help me with the last of the docker stuff, need to create a kubernetes template, and also Steve has to sort the last things out with AWS, so we have an account big enough to launch the full test. Some time in the next week I will run a full block chain test with real data that aims for 45k tx/s minimum to test out my docker containers running in kubernetes to verify everything works. Also need to get some notary nodes and explorer's for the first 64 chains ready. Maybe I can just run these in AWS as well, but in a different region. Not sure yet.

[14-Jul-18 09:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think the blockchains will be saved in an AWS S3 data store, however running 8192 deamons to extract it would be difficult. I will work with dwy to adapt his script that dumps the data to a mysql DB. Maybe that can be put out to public for reads?


[14-Jul-18 10:01 PM] smkhound#7640
Third party verification from an independent, trusted person/group is probably most valuable marketing-wise, but opening it to the public also shows good faith. Most wouldn't bother to check, but availability speaks volumes. Not sure what format is best. Database tables are easily populated with whatever, but a full copy of all chains blk.dat etc is closer to source, though a significant amount of data to review. Probably a few random samples would suffice.
The scripts which are used to run the tests being open source also helps, at least for those that understand it. I don't think we'll have issues with burden of proof if the right people with no vested interest confirm it's valididty.


[14-Jul-18 10:02 PM] smkhound#7640
sql dumps are small enough for public consumption and a good indicator of valididty. Official validation would likely want access to more


[14-Jul-18 10:03 PM] smkhound#7640
I think that expanding the notes link on the vis site to be a pop-up onclick with links to sql and all relevant github repos isnt a bad idea


[14-Jul-18 10:06 PM] smkhound#7640
something like this, if it allows importing blk.dat files, would be handy - http://yogh.io/#block:last

Yeah that would a good, if we can set up something like that. We are looking at an estimated 6-7TB of blockchain data generated in the test, but depending on cost, it could be much larger as I would prefer to make the test run longer than that if possible.

Btw, thanks @Deleted User  I signed up for that OVH Alpha test, doubtful they have anything near the needed amount of CPU's but the way the test works, we can spread over loads of providers if need be.

From the last test @Deleted User @webworker01 @smkhound - is it true to say:
```
 - Live test to optimize using a smaller load
 - 6k tx/s for 15 mins
 - 4k tx/s for 30 mins
 - 2k tx/s for 60 mins
 - details: https://komodostats.com/scaling/index2.php?all
```
?


[17-Jul-18 01:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
It depends what you are trying to say... I can launch a test with 256 chains that cna run for 24H if thats a better meteric to use?


[17-Jul-18 01:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe we should run some smaller scale tests for extended time periods, then a really large amount of chains for short time?


[17-Jul-18 01:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
then we can prove that its technically possible to sustain very large numbers at scale... Its only a cost factor that limits the time.


[17-Jul-18 01:07 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes, can we run a small scale for 12 hours doing 2k tx/s with stats working the whole time?
What is the cost difference between 2k, 4k, 8k tx/s for the purpose of this test?


[17-Jul-18 01:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
64 chains seems to cap out at about 7000tx/s of single payment, but sustaining that for long periods is difficult... if you increase it out to 3-4 payment TX's it should be possible to run indefinitely.


[17-Jul-18 01:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or I can go back to an earlier iteration, that uses 2 TxBlasters to blast for unlimited time.


[17-Jul-18 01:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
It was just not possible to use that version at very large scale of chains, dude to limits of hardware available.


[17-Jul-18 01:10 AM] Mylo#8306
Is there a bottleneck with the single payment/


[17-Jul-18 01:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes on the transaction generating side... it requires 2 marketmakers/komodods to broadcast enough transactions to fill the mempool.


[17-Jul-18 01:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
When you are using one wallet to simulate over 1000 wallets, its a little hard.


[17-Jul-18 01:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
If we had 1000 wallets to send TX from.... then it would not matter


[17-Jul-18 01:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
Once again, limited by hardware.


[17-Jul-18 01:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
Short of actually using it for a national currency, its all but impossible to get that many users.


[17-Jul-18 01:17 AM] Mylo#8306
so 64 chains doing single payment ~= 7k tx/s
doing 5 payments  allows for marketmaker to keep up with blasting to fill mempool quick enough by sending transctions containing more bytes but sustainable for longer.  Load testing endurance rather than throughput.
?

Users will be machines and dApps.


[17-Jul-18 01:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, I have not actually tested a threshold for payments per TX that allows sustained full blocks, but 100 needs nothing, 10 chains will be blasting at any one time over 64 chains. but 1 payment is not really possible to keep mempool saturated. For this I used a mining pause at the start to fill all the mempools up.


[17-Jul-18 01:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
I can definatly do that, although like I said there is an older version, that can sustain single payments, it just needs an extra CPU per chain.


[17-Jul-18 01:20 AM] Mylo#8306
Nah let's not use older version imo.  Endurance is another metric that will need to be known once throughput is grokked.


[17-Jul-18 01:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
Not really, because the transactions being generated in this way do not apply to any real world use... they are a simulation.


[17-Jul-18 01:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
What is being tested is the amount of confirmed TX that is possible.


[17-Jul-18 01:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
Testing the TxBlaster API over endurance is pointless, and I think this is why James said a 15 minute window of all chains with full blocks was all that was required.. I did have a single chain locally runnign for over 5H with full blocks though, so it can be run for a long time


[17-Jul-18 01:25 AM] Mylo#8306
OK - very specific goal.  Got it.


[17-Jul-18 01:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
However if you just want data to say a blockchain can run at full block capacity, you could just point to BTC at the end of last year...  every block was full for months straight.


[17-Jul-18 01:27 AM] Deleted User#0000

What has been the largest scale test tx/s to date?


[17-Jul-18 01:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
The 1024 chain test.


[17-Jul-18 01:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
but they were 100 pyamnt TX's so the 20,000 number is far lower than theortically possible.


[17-Jul-18 01:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
The 256 chain test, to test kubernetes should eclipse that number easily... theoretical maximum is ~37k tx/s.


[17-Jul-18 01:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
If we need higher than that we can use 512 chains to double it.


[17-Jul-18 01:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Either size will give us the data we need.


[17-Jul-18 01:50 AM] Mylo#8306
It's pretty much processing bytes of tx data across a decentralized chain cluster.  Correct?

100 chains ~= 200MB/min
1000 chains = ~=2000MB/min
10000 chains = ~=20000MB/min

for a single payment TX.... which is 1 vin to 2 vouts (your payment and the change returned to the first address) you can fit 8859 TX's into a 2MB block.
For a 100 payment TX, (1 vin to 101 vouts) you can fit 557 TX into a block. Anything inbwteeen should follow a fixed ratio, you can check this by creating some TX's and seeing how big the raw hex generated is. 
Each chain can process on average 2MB per minute,


[17-Jul-18 02:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
The transaction size also would work the other way, ie, combining 100 vins to 1 vout, to "join" the UTXO's back together.


[17-Jul-18 02:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
With this data you can do math to work out how many chains is required to achieve any required amount and size of transactions.


[17-Jul-18 02:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
My repo's would need some updating and some more docs for others to start at square 1, with no chains, and generate the JSON with the chain cluster parameters. But its not really that hard, with some updates to my scipts and docs, you can generate any number of chains in a cluster and all required scripts automatically to launch a notary node network to notarize them to KMD.


[17-Jul-18 02:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
It took me about 2H from zero notary network to a network of 4, and min sigs for a notarization of 2.


[17-Jul-18 02:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
In real world, I think min sigs would need to be more than 2 and notary nodes would need to be more than 4, however the compute resource required for these is pretty small. Biggest requirement is RAM and network bandwidth.


[17-Jul-18 02:49 AM] Mylo#8306
This is great, thanks heaps üôè 
So, with your engineers hat on - in case it wasn't üòõ , a "real world" use case would have multiple vin:vout combos and there'd be many more addresses.


[17-Jul-18 02:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes.


[17-Jul-18 02:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
Which is why I think we should describe it as maximum payments, however even then, the size of the transactions  will still vary and the amount of payments in a block will also vary. It totally depends on use case. Designing your cluster to run at capacity is also not clever, likey you would use 50-100% more chains than you 'need'.


[17-Jul-18 02:54 AM] Mylo#8306
Pretty much bytes processing throughput, with a handful of variables that us clever humans use to measure these concepts as payments and transactions.

@patchkez  When you have some free time, whats the status on the kubernetes stuff? I noticed yesterday there are 3 small 8 core instances left running on the KomodoPlatform account, doesn't seem like they cost a huge amount, just wondering if you got them working or just forgot to shut them down. 
My Internet changes over (to FTTN) on the 27th of July, so I would say if we dont get the next stage up and running by then, it would be best to leave the 256 chain test until next month when @smkhound 2 is back from holidays and hopefully both our Internet connections are up and running. This also leaves plenty of time for marketing to work out their end. 
Of course we need to test a small 24 chain test on kubernetes first to make sure your YAML etc is correct and everything is working with my recent changes. I have ported the dockerfile and all scripts so its the same for all chains, and everything is set in the docker-compose.yml so set-up should be trivial in that regard.

@Soldat - latest news is a category - not all blog posts go into, so some articles are just for reference.  I've asked the marketing guys if this is intentional.  thanks for highlighting

Hi guys


[26-Jul-18 11:06 AM] DG#6934
Question from a Telegram User:

45,000 TPS means you can handle 45,000 transactions per second.
transaction means one smartcontract.

However, Komodo's block generation cycle is one minute.
Does that mean that 45,000 X 60 = 2,700,000 tx/min is possible every minute?
Or is it possible to contract every second?


[26-Jul-18 04:14 PM] Mylo#8306
45k tx/s but if you waiting for a confirmation, then yes 2,700,000 tx/min (with testing due soon to 60,000,000 tx/min 1st confirmation) & per contract if required when it get released, because contracts run in their own blockchain and implement cross-blockchain interoperability as per the crypto-conditions standard published by the IETF (internet engineering task force), that manage internet standards like IP addresses, DNS, email protocols etc.

Ok... We finally found the problem with skipped blocks in the website live display today.  Using AWS has is drawbacks, but the advantage of not needing a webserver that can handle 8000+ connections per minute outweights them, once we figured out what was happening that is. 
Also what branch of komodo should I be using now, it was on `momo` but I changed it to `dev` when CC were merged in. Is this still the one I need to use? @jl777c


[29-Jul-18 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810

Just waiting on AWS support to help @patchkez  with kubernetes deployment, also looking at out account limits, there is no way we can launch 8192vcpu's at this stage, so someone needs to talk to them about that.

I am very close to launching a fully notarized test though. Could do mayb 256 chains, with first 64 notarized in a couple of weeks. Depends on what marketing wants, I would rather use that test to run kubernetes and kill two birds with one stone, after we confirm its working with a very small cluster.

changed everything to `ac_cc=1001` and pushed to repos.


[29-Jul-18 04:59 AM] Mylo#8306
if you run 64 chains and all 64 are notarized, that's about 6k tx/s isn't it?  i can use that info for dApp develop HOWTO documentation.  64 chains notarized @ 100KMD per year is 6k KMD.  @300KMD it's 19k KMD.

[30-Jul-18 08:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
You can try it, but I doubt it will work, the miner need to push exactly 1.3s per second to be able to make 60s blocks and the market maker and komodod needs 2/3 of a pretty decent core to generate the txs. As it was I needed to put in the mining pause to fill the mempool for single payment tx, if your not going for full blocks, then it will work fine, you can start a shit load of containers on a very small system, until the chains are of decent length they don't even need much ram.

@Deleted User  Hi man, sorry I was out,  still have some health problems. AWS support came to us and provided some ideas how to fix the problem I was facing. Unfortunately I could not make it working. Partial problem was old kubectl binary I was using. But I still cannot authenticate with new kubectl  against K8N cluster. I assume IAM roles are set correctly, but cluster does not let me in.

you can try to create your won cluster  in N. Virginia or Oregon. In N. Virginia, only these 2 subnets (2 regions only) can be used for creating cluster subnet-07a313961d6219c7e, subnet-0f627de46941059c0.

I tried to create clusters with 3 nodes only and smalles possible instances


[02-Aug-18 03:29 AM] patchkez#5349
but this is not needed yet, once you create cluster (without worker nodes) you should be able authenticate against it with kubectl which is not the case for me


[02-Aug-18 03:29 AM] patchkez#5349

We had some issue with DynamoDB locking us out one time aswell... It only happened the one time, like it was a bug or something. Sure. I will have a play with it. So the only issue is that you create the cluster, but cannot "talk" to it?

Yes currently, there are 2 stores but they both save to the same place. one container saves a backup of all the JSON that AWS returns, so we can see if anything was missed/errored out (so far, seen 0 fails which is crazy with that much data) and the other one saves blockchains to the same local folder. Hopefully its just changing the folder from local to remote in the YAML.

[07-Aug-18 04:12 AM] patchkez#5349
@Deleted User  hey hey! I was working on configuring storage for our K8N cluster and found few limitations. First one is that EBS volume can be mounted only to EC2 instances in the same region and AZ. Which can cause us some problems if the cluster is spread across 2 zones. The other limitation is that AWSElasticBlockStore can mount volume  with read/write permissionsonly to one ec2 instance. See the table in Access Mode chapter: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistent-volumes

[07-Aug-18 04:13 AM] patchkez#5349
as a workaround we could create 1 volume per ec2 node. But this seem to complicate things


[07-Aug-18 04:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
Could we `rsync` it all to a single isntance with a huge HDD storage volume after the test?


[07-Aug-18 04:14 AM] patchkez#5349
other option is to deploy NFS/Ceph/Glusterfs and use volumes exported from there


[07-Aug-18 04:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
Its *only* 7TB


[07-Aug-18 04:16 AM] patchkez#5349
hmm, the thing is that without any volume attached to container/pod,  data are lost once the container is removed or restarted on another node.  Maybe we could implement some kind of trigger which would run rsync from inside the container after we are done with testing.


[07-Aug-18 04:16 AM] patchkez#5349
but I am not sure how this would be reliable


[07-Aug-18 04:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
thats what i was thinking yes


[07-Aug-18 04:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
The same as the start trigger


[07-Aug-18 04:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
I have found this 100% reliable so far for triggering start,  However, trying to push that much data in parallel with rsync all at once, might not be so reliable.


[07-Aug-18 04:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
We still have the issue that the longer the test needs to run, the more cost adds up very fast. Maybe we could seperate the chains into clusters of 2048 and push to a few intances with rsync.


[07-Aug-18 04:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
then combine it from there as the cost on a few instance is much less.


[07-Aug-18 04:20 AM] Mylo#8306
can you set up a machine that has all blockchains syncing on a physical host with 20TB HDD?

[07-Aug-18 04:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
the amount of CPU/network bandwidth required for that would be insane


[07-Aug-18 04:21 AM] Mylo#8306
what about in same AZ so all network bandwidth is within datacentre?


[07-Aug-18 04:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
rsync will the best way to send the chains. as I did in the first test, as you dont have to validate all TX's that way.


[07-Aug-18 04:21 AM] Mylo#8306
cool


[07-Aug-18 04:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
even with 1024 chains, it was basically impossible to sync them in real time usign the komodod deamon.


[07-Aug-18 04:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
I guess I can play with this in the next few days, this might be better than one giant shared data store anyway...  we want to avoind any centralised points that could bottleneck.


[07-Aug-18 04:23 AM] patchkez#5349
@Deleted User  I think we would need to stop komodod before starting rsync process. But if you stop komodod, container will exit


[07-Aug-18 04:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, I am not 100% sure... I need to test that, because hte blocknitory script is a thread of komodod


[07-Aug-18 04:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
it might be able to call a stop rpc call then loop for ever until the start trigger is activated.


[07-Aug-18 04:24 AM] Mylo#8306
```curl -v --user user   --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "stop", "params": []}' -H 'content-type: text/plain' http://127.0.0.1:7771```
will stop docker running?


[07-Aug-18 04:24 AM] Mylo#8306
harsh


[07-Aug-18 04:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think so yes, but if the call is called from a blocknotify it might not stop it


[07-Aug-18 04:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
because there is still a job running that is a child process of komodod


[07-Aug-18 04:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
might not work, but it might... can only try it.


[07-Aug-18 04:26 AM] patchkez#5349
stopping main process will stop also container


[07-Aug-18 04:27 AM] patchkez#5349
so if there is some parent process responsible for starting subprocesses it should work


[07-Aug-18 04:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
also on my notary node... I was using rsync to save the ramdisk to SSD with all the demons running and never ad an issue


[07-Aug-18 04:27 AM] Mylo#8306
ok . i'm not using fancy entrypoints etc. for my docker testing.  gotta get back to my stff.  (wow, rsync whilst running...)

ok


[07-Aug-18 04:34 AM] patchkez#5349
ideally the rsync is running continuously in the background from the very first second when container is started


[07-Aug-18 04:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
hmm thats interesting... I was thinking to wait at least until empty blocks are being  pushed out because of SSH overhead, I moved to NFS on notary node, because of CPU overhead using SSH.

[07-Aug-18 05:05 AM] patchkez#5349
yeah it should work, or CEPH which is IMO better. It can  also scale by adding nodes to the cluster


[07-Aug-18 05:05 AM] patchkez#5349
but it is extra overhead for us, we have to take care of that storage cluster


[07-Aug-18 05:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes... Ideally we should keep the storage on AWS at  lease for when the test is running, to make sure there are no networking bottlenecks, we can then move them to a cheaper Hetzner server or something later on. 10TB of HDD space isn't going to be a huge amount of cash.


[07-Aug-18 05:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
Saving it all on real time into shared storage, isnt exactly needed, although it would be much simpler to implement.


[07-Aug-18 06:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
Its far from anything I know about, but this CEPH looks like a good way to go. Although it adds a whole extra layer of infrastructure,  we can deploy it on AWS instances, and its not limited by region.

I had a read through a few docs, playbook seems like an easy way to go, I think deployment should be pretty easy, for me it will be configuring the containers to use it as storage.  I can defiantly give it a try, as I know I will have more time than you in the next few days.

@patchkez  do the kubernetes EC2 instances need to be running all the time? can we shut them down when not in use because it burns through a fair bit of credits. For my EC2's I just `sudo shutdown now` when finished and then it doesn't charge us anything, until I start them again.  No big deal over a few days, but it starts to add up fast.


[07-Aug-18 09:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Got a little bit done, will hit it agian tomorrow. I *think* it made one instance on AWS and started to deploy at least one node of Ceph. The guide I found seems to use much older versions, so its not as straight forward as I had hoped.


[07-Aug-18 10:42 AM] patchkez#5349
@Deleted User  not sure about stopping instances. when you delete them, they will be re-created again, most probably because they were deployed by cloudformation stack and there is some rule to keep them up. Maybe we should automate creation of K8N cluster and everytime we are done with testing, we delete whole stack (worker nodes - ec2 instances). When we would need to test again we just automagically re-create the cluster.


[07-Aug-18 10:43 AM] patchkez#5349

@grewalsatinder the 3 hetzner servers are not really being used, haven't touched them in quite some time. One is serving the explorers from the first test but as far as I know there is no URL for them üòÇ 

The other 2 were being used for MoMoM testing but once that was tested I *think* those 2 servers don't need to be running any more, haven't upgraded them in months. @SHossain  might know more about this. I might use one of these to host explorers for the first 64 chains in the next test if they are no longer needed for the MoMoM test chains.

Oh, also if project can help with funds then can use my amazon account too. I specifically made a separate account for scaling test, to keep accounting fine.


[07-Aug-18 04:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
We will be in touch if it is needed, the account we have should be large enough, as we had to have meetings with AWS people about it, although I am yet to try and provision the required resources. If we require more than the one account, funding will need to be sorted out somehow. For us we just need to complete a scalable test that can be replicated into whatever avalible recourse we can get our hands on, which is almost done, just left with a shared storage to save all block chains onto. Which is what I am starting on today, more new stuff to learn, but seems pretty I interesting.

@patchkez  Giving up on this... AWS does not report the correct IP address for public access inside iteself. So ceph-ansible is not working, nothing can communicate. 
I will put off my other work that I had lined up for tomorrow another day and try to start again using GlusterFS, as I have found more up to date docs for that and hopefully wont have to keep going in circles.

Ceph looks great for deploying on physical servers, but on AWS its just not playing ball.


[08-Aug-18 05:50 AM] patchkez#5349
@Deleted User ok, thanks for update.  I still need to investigate if we can use any combination of AWS services instead of building dedicated shared storage.


[08-Aug-18 05:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
doesn't look like we can, unless we have a heap of separate EBS volumes and then copy all th data to one place aftrerwards, to me this seems like far too much effort to set up. I would rather deploy a shared volume and just push all data directly to that, it has to be easier in the long run. If I knew what I was doing today, I would have realised what I was doing wasn't goig to work, earlier on, but meh. Another day of learning more stuff.

```The maximum throughput you can drive for each Amazon EC2 instance is 250 MB/s.
Up to 128 active user accounts for each instance can have files open at the same time. Each user account represents one local user logged in to the instance.
Up to 32,768 files open at the same time on the instance.```
According to these, if each EC2 instance, is a cluster of 64 chains, we are well inside all limits. 
If we need to spread over the 2 regions with Kubernetes available, we might need to have 2 EFS in total each with 4096 chains. then sync these together after the test. Using this all the Containers can use the same data store, as they already place their stuff in their own folder, we wont get any issues. I can even mount it as the Data Store for the first 64 chains.

I have created a new Kubernetes cluster on AWS with EFS connected to it. This should do it for the last of the issues, unless Patchkez runs into some more.

hey guys, we are not sleeping! here is short update to those reading this channel.  We were working with @Deleted User  during weekend on AWS Kubernetes cluster. I managed to create POD which contains 2 containers - assetchain container and miner container. This test suppose to give us working K8N definition yaml file, which we can now templatize in order to create X chains. @Deleted User  was trying to setup EFS provisioner which allows us to mount EFS storage as a persistent volume into Kubernetes cluster. The idea is that every POD/container will have EFS volume attached and blockchain data will be stored there. These data can be used as a proof after the scaling test is finished. We had some troubles with EFS, it could not create PV/PVC. @Deleted User  I managed to fix it, it was issue with RBAC which was needed to be setup for our cluster. I can now mount EFS volume to both containers and write data there. Next step is to create more PODs (3?) to test they are writing its blockchain to correct place. In the meantime I am going to create script for  generating Kubernetes definition yaml files for all chains participating in scaling test.

EC2 instances: 
128 x m4.x16large : $409.60 per hour
Test goes for approx 2H, but it is unknown how long it takes to start all containers at this stage.
I think its safe to bank on a 6-8H peroid, but it will hopefully be much less than this.
We will have a better idea once we run the 256 chain test on EKS.
Maximum: $3280

DynamoDB:
150 Writes / 1500 Reads: Approx $23 per 24/h 

Lambda + API's: For our application this is free or under $1 for entire test and all testing so far.

EKS: 20c per hour for cluster, all chains should run in a single cluster, unless we need to split over 2 regions.
Most of the cost here will be running this cluster in the weeks leading up to the test, although once it is working we can destroy it and redeploy at a later date to save money.
2 regions for an entire week is: $135

EFS: $102 per day with 10TB of data. It would be silly to leave the data on here long term, we would move it to a dedicated HDD server to save vast sums of money, after the test is run.
I guess bank on $400 here as a total maximum, depending on how long it takes to transfer 7-10TB of data to a permenant server, and also data bandwidth could be a factor to move out of AWS if we do that.
-----------------------------
Maximum worst case cost of AWS: $3839 ‚Äì I think there is still $2000 credit on the account, but we will use up some of this in the final tests and the 256 chain test.


[13-Aug-18 08:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
Notarization Servers:
We need 4 servers for notarization, I would prefer to host them outside of AWS as proof the chains work over long distances and the internet in general, not just in a closed AWS environment. 
Maybe some cheap hetzner servers, or something we already have access too. I ran this on four 4 Core 16GB VPS's on my first try months ago, but they were a little small. 
Four of 6 core 32Gb will be the minimum requred here, either VPS or dedicated server from any provider with good network speed.
I would also like these up at least 2 days in advance and possibly a server with explorers for the first 64 chains only so people can inspect the notarization TX's.
Need some clarification on this part of it, I.e do we need/want explorers, which hosting do we use etc?

noashh might have some hertzner servers, there is also satinder's hertzners if we need those, he needs to keep them alive a bit longer


[14-Aug-18 12:46 AM] Mylo#8306
hetzner also has a "storage box" service for hosting 10TB data which might be useful for independent verification as the servers would only have 1-2TB and have 5TB data transfer.   data tx is limited to 20TB though - this may be a more cost effective method of holding data for a month or two?

OK cool.
For the notarization I think the 3 servers Satinder already has will be absolutly fine, there is no need to use 4, thats just the number I chose to use in my first test, 3 is enough with freq.2 to make sure MoMoM is being notarized over 64 chains. So that covers that.

The only thing left is to figure out where we can store the approx 7-10TB of data that is generated in th test, it will be very expensive to leave it on EFS. I can look at another AWS option and check prices if we dont already have access to something to store this on?

What about some explorers for the first 64 chains? Do we need/want those?

would be good to have explorers so skeptics can just look up the chain data on them

maybe the satinder nodes can do exploreres too?

They probably can if I spread the explorers over the 3 servers. I can run a 64 chain test on this and test load.

for companies who only need transactional tokens, a simplest assertchain would be more than enough.


[16-Aug-18 09:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
`8859 / 60 = 147 `
We have 2MB blocks, each can fit 8859 TX of single payment inside, and we have 60s block time.
Each assetchain can do just under 150 TX/s
But if you batch the TX's and do more payments per TX, you can get much bigger numbers.
If every TX is 100 payments for example the calcuation is:
`557 * 100 /60 = 928` Payments per second.

You can use as many assetchains as you like for unlimited transacion capacity. It scales linear.

The script is fine, as the generated yaml may change, I think I will change the private keys I am using just before the test just in case some one wants to play games with the test.

Iran Finalizes National Cryptocurrency Draft Document, Regulations...
Iran has reportedly finalized a draft document on the matter of cryptocurrency in the country. This move comes as the government plans to create a state-issue virtual currency to circumvent U.S. sanctions.

guys, talking about scalability, do you think that on-chain scaling by increasing blocksize (basically what Bitcoin Cash does) will be limited by storage & bandwidth thus making it centralized ?


[30-Aug-18 01:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
Not really, a VPS that can run pretty large blocks (or in this case lots of chains) is quite cheap. If you need a full node, you use a server.

@CHMEX What is the fastest way to deploy some exporers for AC? I need to load up 64 of them on AWS , I made a single instance for all of them, because thats the easiest way to get all chains loaded in one place

[30-Aug-18 02:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes I did use his stuff the first time to deploy a heap, but I think there was more progress made on that to make it easier since then. I will start with this and then see how we go, I think having a nice URL will be needed.

no worries... ran into some unexpected problems here.... I forgot james made us change the ac_cc= to 1001 ... I didnt realise this would change AC ports, and just did search replace on the repo... turns out that didnt work... Had to change some `C` code and regen all chains with `ac_cc=1001`

Hey quick question about the scaling test, do we know where the testing results/data will be stored yet (or how big this will be, I'm thinking in the multiple TB size?) and will we be able to get it in CSV format so people can verify/graph/work with the data in things like R or anything?


[30-Aug-18 07:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
Its raw blockchains


[30-Aug-18 07:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
5-10Tb


[30-Aug-18 07:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
There is also the JSON format of the summery of each block, that we use for the stats website.


[30-Aug-18 07:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
that could be exprted to CSV for each chain without issue.


[30-Aug-18 07:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
but a spreadsheet with that much data would be insane to work with


[30-Aug-18 07:57 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea I figured it'd be a lot, but I'm looking at coinmetrics csv data as well and it'd be cool (for marketing and proof purposes) to be able to offer a single (though massive) CSV file for download if someone wanted it haha


[30-Aug-18 07:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
I can easily add another line to push the JSON as CSV format instead to the text file.


[30-Aug-18 08:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
then afterwards we can script this to merge them all together


[30-Aug-18 08:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
but tbh, all you need is 1 chain.. its easy to see that all chains are the same.

z9 miner of innosillicon ist sold out. the minimal amount order was very high. not aiming for small private miners.

ok we have three vendors for equihash asic miner.



Innosillicon - sold out. minimal buyorder very high buyprice very high (ripoff)

Asicminer.co ASICminer Zeon a big fat piece of garbage for 20k! LOL (ripoff)

Bittmain Z9 and Z9 Mini. What i have to say about bitmain?! now you have to make KYC to buy hardware LOL!


everyone can go in a store and buy a gpu and be part of the network. i think you guys need the big amout of hashes. or payed by these companys.

nowadays decentralised is not important anymore. hope you guys didnt get burned by a 51% attack by these nice asics machines.

During that ASIC resistant movement a group of scammers realized they can profit from it. You had coins being released claiming ASIC resistant which can only be mined using their software. That software was a trojan to steal coins or key log your sign in info with coinbase. One of the "mining software" even embedded itself into the users router.

Main net for your own blockchain already exists.  We just need to document it so there‚Äôs a turnkey solution for business.  Also we need to test it more to see how much further it goes and how many resources it takes.
Main net for KMD coin is still ~120 tx/s.  No need to increase throughput yet.  But for dapps built on kmd tech, it‚Äôs independent.  Your dapp my dapp anyone‚Äôs dapp- all independent so they can each run many tx/s

kind of, there are some loose ends to tie up, but I have been horribly side tracked on STAKED getting the actual cross chain transfers working properly... its one thing to do 1 million TX/s (actually not that hard) but to make all the chains "talk" to each other is a lot harder.

Can you tell me more about this cross chain transfers @Deleted User ?


[11-Sep-18 05:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Its how the scaling works.... each chain can send coins to another chain. It burns on the first chain, and then the other chain uses MoMoM tech to prove that the burn happened, and allows coins to be "created" on that chain. So a bunch of chains act as a single chain. So far we have run into quite  a few issues, but we have done a few hundred transfers in testing before trying to launch our actual cluster. I dont think its an issue with the MoMoM stuff as such, just how we implemented it.

@Deleted User, the work you‚Äôre doing , which I assume is in part automating a lot of the deployment of chains. Do you expect these tools you‚Äôve developed will be directly used by komodo platform users (whoever has the need for this type of throughput) or do you see these efforts as primarily prototyping with the intent to rebuilt it all after successfully testing?


[11-Sep-18 07:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
The STAKED repo can be used to deploy your own cluster  of chains with your own notary nodes. Although its still far from easy as the last day has shown us.


[11-Sep-18 07:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
By the time we have run it for a few weeks I would say it will be improved enough for others to have a go at it... I see it mostly being used by dAPP developers who might want to build a multi chain dAPP but cannot use KMD notary nodes due to practcal reasons of having them update every few hours testing etc.


[11-Sep-18 07:51 AM] tolken#2655

@Seko apologies, I added some CSP to nginx last night which was blocking some of the vis data from allowing load. back online now. 
recent tweaks seem to have slightly lowered the average over 1min/5min spans - yet to confirm if this is valid, but I think it is and better to underestimate than overestimate.
Vis does not have all test data. Some earlier tests with more than 64 chains I didn't have access to block source to validate afterwards, and those timespans were purged - they would have higher values. With 64 chains, as the validated sections on vis are, we'd expect about 9500tx/s and 60,000payments/sec on average, with some variation depending on how fast blocks were being solved.
We did a test with 256 cahins which is not on vis. That test pulled about 45k tx/s at peak

@Deleted User see how budget goes.   There are a cpl of naysayers about public testing - using AWS for infrastructure is good for somewhat public controlled engineering environment.
I‚Äôd like to have a community scaling project next because for raw tx it will be a completed task.  With enough documentation for anyone to participate it spreads the load, education, awareness and simplicity/accessibility out.
If community testing is possible, I‚Äôd like to use some of the experts to do other scaling tests like smart contract, consensus extending scalability and look into cross chain scaling factors.
If again this is doable, then get community participation. If community smart contracts or cross chain can be done in 12 months, be awesome.

yeah i got the "not real transactions" on my blog.   so if there's publicly deployable by anyone can participate in being a node, not just a game playing participant, it'll just be the "notaries are centralised" one to un-fud.  which is easy with some stats, pie charts, and comparisons....maybe....

I dont understand the "not real transactions" a transaction is a transaction... yes we are using a crazy trick to be able to send that many transactions, but the test is not sending transactions, its filling blocks with transactions, we are counting confirmed transactions.


[21-Sep-18 01:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
the sending of transactions is totally irreleavent to what we are trying to measure.

AWS is locked in and funded, the website and stats is complete just needs a few tests and verification. Notary nodes are done, but in the process of building staked I made a better system, and found some problems with the old one, so decided to move to that while we wait for AWS funding to come through. This has taken a little longer than I wanted but, extremely good progress has been made.

that will be trivial. I had to fix MoMoM first. 5% of the time there is a mismatch of MoMoM hash on target chain, and the sent coins from the target are lost. Finding this error was not easy, and it likley could have been missed by most people. But because I activly tried to break it like I usually do i was able to track it down, and tabulate the data so it cna be fixed. Just got it done tonight, and its mostly automated so we can collect as much data as we need. Took a few weeks this one. Lost a LOT of sleep over it.

Hello everyone, I have a few questions regarding the Merkle Trees in Komodo. Trying to understand everything in the whitepaper is quite daunting and I would like to be as accurate as possible for the infographic I'm working on. Anyways here goes. 
```
Question 1

From the website

"Komodo‚Äôs notary nodes create a new Merkle Tree out of all the Merkle Roots that have been generated since the previous notarization. This happens for each assetchain in the Komodo ecosystem utilising the Federated Multi-Chain Syncing feature.‚Äù


Question: Is the main KMD chain considered an assetchain in this case, thus creating and including its own MoM with the rest of the Assetchain MoMs? (as part of the syncing and MoMoM creation)
```


[27-Sep-18 10:15 AM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
```
IF THE ANSWER IS NO (I'm beginning to think the answer¬†will be no)


Question 2-A


From the website

"Once all the MoMs have been synced with the KMD chain, they are organized into yet another Merkle Tree."


If the KMD chain is¬†not¬†considered an assetchain and does¬†not¬†create its own MoM as part of the syncing process, is it safe to say that ultimately, the MoMoM is¬†the Merkel Root of the KMD block itself,¬†every 10 minutes

```


[27-Sep-18 10:16 AM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
```IF THE ANSWER IS YES


Question 2-B


From the website

"Next, Komodo‚Äôs notary nodes take the MoM from each assetchain and sync them all with the KMD chain."


If the KMD chain does create its own MoM, does it do so¬†before¬†or¬†after¬†the assetchain MoMs sync to the KMD chain?


Clarification 1: If KMD creates its MoM¬†before¬†the sync, does this mean it stores its own save-state into itself?

Clarification 2: if KMD creates its MoM¬†after¬†the sync, does this mean this particular MoM includes all all the other assetchain MoMs within it?

```


[27-Sep-18 10:17 AM] MoldyLunchbox#5734
```Question 3


From the website

"The fourth and final step in Komodo‚Äôs scaling solution process is to notarize the MoMoM back onto every assetchain in the ecosystem."


Is the MoMoM sent to the very next block of every assetchain right after the last snapshot?



Question 4


From the website

"Every ten minutes, a snapshot is taken of the entire Komodo ecosystem. Then, this snapshot is written into a block on the Bitcoin blockchain."


Is it safe to say that this snapshot is the MoMoM?



Question 5


From the website

"Re-Notarize Back Onto The Komodo Blockchain ‚Äì After the backup has been created on the secondary blockchain, the location of the backup is then written back into Komodo‚Äôs main blockchain."


Is the "location of the backup" sent to the very next block in the KMD chain right after the last snapshot (the block with the MoMoM)?

```
   @MoldyLunchbox thanks for your interest.  I think here is an answer to Q3,4,5.

This üëÜ output is from an assetchain that notarizes to KMD.
NN's do this:
AC -> KMD 
KMD -> AC
Whether it is the "very next block" or not,  doesn't sound likely because it's not something that can be guaranteed.  From the output of `getinfo` you can see there is the last notarization and last MoM info in there.

From the notarized block, to the current block is the "lag" or _number of blocks since notarization_

KMD notarizes to BTC.  That's where the checkpoint/save-state is.  I don't think KMD does a MoM of itself, it has the BTC notarization and lag of it's own.    (Someone will correct me if i'm wrong soon no doubt) üòÉ

We have a good idea on how to get MoMoM working, good news is with out changing any code, and making keeping blocktimes steady and as optimal as pssoible its less than a 2% fail rate. By slowing down just a little bit it should be perfect, just awating libscott to return.

is it correct that a single blockchain can do ~100 tx/s ? And batching up to 100 payments per tx?


[04-Oct-18 10:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
931.66 payments per second per assetchain at 100 payments a TX

guys, sorry for stupid question, but am i right that komodo basically has the same block time/block size as zcash (so same throughput) but because komodo has a multichain system, it can scale lineraly with the number of chains?


[07-Oct-18 12:27 AM] jl777c#5810
almost


[07-Oct-18 12:27 AM] jl777c#5810
1 minute vs 2.5 minutes for ZEC, so actually 2.5x per chain

waiting on @libscott  to come back from holidays... the scaletest is essentially finished. We are just waiting to the AWS partnership to be finished and some bugs to be fixed in the MoMoM, as in testing we found somethimes coins can be lost, and we cannot run the scaletest with a limitation like that.

technically they're not allowed to announce anything, but it seems they know local chinese AWS reps who are giving them quote

not execs or business leaders, these are more like an account rep

i guess having AWS do the press release would be much more impactful

yes, we could just announce approval, then use the scaling test for the joint release

and if we are really the first, maybe it can be clarified without saying bad things about the other projects

First results back from new MoMoM test ... 
using freq=5 chain to migrate to freq=15 chains is producing results with 0 fails after 24H of sending 1 migrate TX every 120s.

Using 2 chains in their own cluster with freq=15 on both, transfering 1 TX each 120s there is also 0 failed migrate TXs. These chains are both sending back and fourth to each other 1 coin each 120s. 

I will leave this test running for a few more days, to make sure, but this seems to confirm @jl777c's theory that MoMoM issues are due to too fast notarisation frequecny. This has implications, but if this makes it work, we will next try a freq of 10, as this is the default for KMD chains. Also we need to try and see how many chains can be added to a cluster before the issue appears. My guess is that it probably wont, cause any issues adding more chains,as it seems to be an issue with the freq on the receiving chain only.

Question about scalability and block explorers. Are current block explorers set up to show scaling chains and their transactions along side one another?


[17-Nov-18 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
would need an explorer for each chain


[17-Nov-18 07:26 AM] Regnar#6164
Thanks jl777. I'm not too familiar about how the explorers work exactly, but is it possible to design the block explorers to group blocks from multiple chains as a single "block" and just have field to indicate which chain the transaction happened on?


[17-Nov-18 07:27 AM] Regnar#6164
It seems like a custom solution imo


[17-Nov-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
since the blocks are synchronized, it would be an arbitrary grouping


[17-Nov-18 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
but anything is possible if you can make custom explorer


[17-Nov-18 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
realistically aggregating all the chains into a single dataset would require incredible amounts of bandwidth


[17-Nov-18 07:28 AM] Regnar#6164
So in example, the explorers are synced, but as a regular user, could you not see your transaction information on an explorer itself?


[17-Nov-18 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
you could look up your txid in the corresponding explorer, as normal


[17-Nov-18 07:30 AM] Regnar#6164
corresponding, as in N chain specific explorer?


[17-Nov-18 07:30 AM] Regnar#6164
or any old explorer.


[17-Nov-18 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
as in you would know which specific chain the txid is for and you would use that chains explorer


[17-Nov-18 07:38 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm wondering if there's a way to aggregate the chains, even delayed or after blocks have been confirmed, in order to show results of total transactions among all chains for N block. Or if there is a way to make checking txid not reliant on knowing which chain/explorer to check. I could see that being a problem with 2 chains and even more so with 64 or more. What is our current method for providing proof of scaling capabilities?


[17-Nov-18 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
they are independent blockchains


[17-Nov-18 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
how would you prove that 64 blockchains exist and did the transactions they did?


[17-Nov-18 07:41 AM] Regnar#6164
I would assume through 64 different explorers.


[17-Nov-18 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[17-Nov-18 07:43 AM] Regnar#6164
My concern is for an individual user who doesn't really know/care/understand they are separate chains, but sees it all as just KMD. What does that mean for someone checking an explorer for their txid if there are 64 explorers, how do they know which chain they are on?


[17-Nov-18 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it does seem we would need to have some enhancements to agama to display the specific chain


[17-Nov-18 07:45 AM] Regnar#6164
Even then though, other wallets would have to do the same, wouldn't it be simpler to enhance the explorer itself, so all wallets that use them would be immediately on the same page?


[17-Nov-18 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
explorers are separate from wallets


[17-Nov-18 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
likely we would need to enhance both


[17-Nov-18 07:48 AM] Regnar#6164
I understand, I'm thinking of lite wallets and how they would know which chain they're on, which explorer to check etc. I assume exchanges are running their own nodes (at least I'd hope) but that is another thing, does multiple explorers affect how exchanges spot/verify incoming deposits?


[17-Nov-18 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
practically speaking there should be just one coin of the cluster that is used for external things, like exchanges


[17-Nov-18 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so you use the single main explorer for exchange usage


[17-Nov-18 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
basically there is another coordinate added to txid, the chain id


[17-Nov-18 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
this directly indicates the type of GUI/explorer things that are needed


[17-Nov-18 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the stats aggregation site can also provide some sort of txid lookup


[17-Nov-18 07:51 AM] Regnar#6164
yea that extra coordinate would make sense. So if I'm using a lite wallet on X chain and exchanges are using Y chain, I assume when I send to the exchange it performs the burn protocol to swap chains, but the exchange doesn't need to view X, just Y for the confirmations?


[17-Nov-18 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
the exchange shouldnt have to know about any other than the chain0 of the cluster


[17-Nov-18 07:52 AM] Regnar#6164
right


[17-Nov-18 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
that way there is no extra work needed and we know they dont like to do extra work


[17-Nov-18 07:54 AM] Regnar#6164
Okay so then any wallet viewing any chain shouldn't have to worry about any other chain because the burn protocol swaps the coin to their chain anyway.


[17-Nov-18 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
well. that would mean the chain id needs to be added to a user address, so there is no escaping the chainid for cross cluster transacting


[17-Nov-18 07:58 AM] Regnar#6164
So does that mean each chain has identical addresses, and then needs the chainid to clarify which address on which chain a transaction is going to?


[17-Nov-18 07:58 AM] Regnar#6164
or unique addresses, lol


[17-Nov-18 08:01 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm thinking they are unique. An address (123) on chain X, doesn't exist on chain Y, otherwise I wouldn't need to burn coins on chain Y when sending to 123.


[17-Nov-18 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
one privkey for all chains, the same address


[17-Nov-18 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
but they are different chains


[17-Nov-18 08:02 AM] Regnar#6164
haha definitely a learning curve


[17-Nov-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
until the coins are transferred to the other chain, they arent in the other chain


[17-Nov-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
just think about how it would work if the chains are independent chains


[17-Nov-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
since they are independent chains


[17-Nov-18 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
with independent blocks, independent tx,


[17-Nov-18 08:03 AM] Regnar#6164
but the same addresses


[17-Nov-18 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
yes and address doesnt actually exist in the real blockchain


[17-Nov-18 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
just scriptPubKey vout that can be spent by specific privkeys, whose pubkeys encode into addresses

[17-Nov-18 08:05 AM] Regnar#6164
Owner of address 123 would own 123 on all chains, but if they are an exchange and only looking at chain X (their balance syncs up with the other chains) but for someone sending coins to the exchange from chain Y, they would convert their coins to the X chain? or simply send to 123 on Y?


[17-Nov-18 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
exchange looks at chain0 (lets use that instead of X. Y)

{Reactions}
üëå (2) 

[17-Nov-18 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
that means you need to send coins on chain0 for the coins to be sent on chain0


[17-Nov-18 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
if you send coins on LTC, do they appear in BTC?


[17-Nov-18 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
dont try to imagine any new magics


[17-Nov-18 08:06 AM] Regnar#6164
but LTC and BTC aren't syncing with each other


[17-Nov-18 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
neither are these chains


[17-Nov-18 08:06 AM] Regnar#6164
okay


[17-Nov-18 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
they are not syncing to each other


[17-Nov-18 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
how can they? they are indpendent chains


[17-Nov-18 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
they are able to burn coins on one chain and have them recreated on another. like the transporter in star trek


[17-Nov-18 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
so there are all these different chains, each with their own coins, blocks, current blockhash. one of the tx you can do is transport coins to any other chain


[17-Nov-18 08:16 AM] Regnar#6164
Okay. So there's chain0 and then chain1 spawns up, it is an independent chain (blocks, hash etc) that can have KMD sent to it (via burning it from chain0) and can send KMD from it to chain0 (by burning it from chain1) the same coin can only exist on chain1 or chain0.


[17-Nov-18 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the total coins across the entire cluster is kept constant

{Reactions}
üëå 

[17-Nov-18 08:18 AM] Regnar#6164
But the same address *could* exist on both chain0 and chain1, by using the same keys. But because they are independent chains when chain1 spawns up it doesn't include all the information from chain0 (like a fork)


[17-Nov-18 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt include ANY information from chain0


[17-Nov-18 08:19 AM] Regnar#6164
right


[17-Nov-18 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it is an independent chain


[17-Nov-18 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
dont forget independent chains are independent


[17-Nov-18 08:19 AM] Regnar#6164
except that it is KMD and how to do the basic underlying protocols


[17-Nov-18 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the only "magic" is that coins can be sent from one chain to the other


[17-Nov-18 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
there is KMD and there is komodod


[17-Nov-18 08:21 AM] Regnar#6164
Can you elaborate on that? (I'm likely going to post this as a reddit scaling discussion)


[17-Nov-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD instance of komodod is needed to be able to create the burn protocol coin transfers


[17-Nov-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
komodod is the single executable that can run thousands of different chains, without any code changes


[17-Nov-18 08:27 AM] Regnar#6164
Okay got it.


[17-Nov-18 08:37 AM] Regnar#6164
So a clarifying point. An address on chain0 wants to send to chain1 (two independent but fungible chains) it would burn chain0 coins to send to chain1, but it seems a chain designation for each transaction might be necessary


[17-Nov-18 08:39 AM] Regnar#6164
For example, assuming cross chain takes longer than a transaction on a single chain, someone could use the same keys on each chain to make duplicate addresses on each chain to avoid users having to burn when they want to send to funds (for example a high volume retailer wants quicker transactions). That retailer would then have multiple duplicate addresses on different chains (using same keys) and if they wanted to consolidate it for whatever reason on the same chain same address, the transaction from chain0 to chain1 would need the chain designation in it otherwise it would just send transactions to itself on it's own chain.


[17-Nov-18 08:42 AM] Regnar#6164
Though it seems like they could just use a new address (on one chain) to send all the duplicate address balances to, it still seems to indicate a chain designation is needed in a transaction?


[17-Nov-18 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
are you confusing utxo system that KMD chains are, with a balance based system?


[17-Nov-18 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
just because there is balance at an address on one chain, it needs to be having the same utxo to be able to do what you talk about. but there is nothing in common between the INDEPENDENT chains, so the utxo are not compatible


[17-Nov-18 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
each chain needs to be used as a chain, ie. properly signed transactions


[17-Nov-18 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
I think you are trying to make it have some extra magical properties that it doesnt


[17-Nov-18 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
they are simply independent chains


[17-Nov-18 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
that happen to be able to implement a burn/recreate protocol between them


[17-Nov-18 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
everything works as normal, other than the burn protocol


[17-Nov-18 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing else is differnt


[17-Nov-18 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing else is magical


[17-Nov-18 09:05 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea no magic. I'm thinking as a business would. If my customers are on multiple different chains and I want to accept their payments, my options are they burn their coins from their chains when sending to the chain I'm on (which I'm assuming is slower than same chain transactions, correct me if I'm wrong about this), or if I need faster times, I treat each chain as the independent chain they are, and create an address on each chain, simplest way is to use the same keys to make the same address I have posted at my shop. 

Now I have the same address on multiple different independent chains, and need to pay my employees or buy things, if I have my sales spread out on different chains and need to make a single payment that requires me to combine them, for example sending to an employee, supplier, etc who is only on one chain. Is the method I use to do this burning the coins from the multiple chains to get it to the address that's only on one chain? 

I'm not sure if that clarifies what I'm asking?


[17-Nov-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
just accept funds on any chain, using same address


[17-Nov-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
the chainid is needed to quickly find incoming payments


[17-Nov-18 09:23 AM] Regnar#6164
and then use the burn to combine as needed?


[17-Nov-18 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[17-Nov-18 09:36 AM] Regnar#6164
Okay, that's all I was asking about consolidating to a single chain. Needs the chainid.


[17-Nov-18 09:36 AM] Regnar#6164
Okay thanks for the info!

@Regnar We have been testing coin migrations between chains in the KMDLabs test cluster #kmdlabs.
You are  welcome to find out more about it there.  You can even give it a try if you'd like.
We will be shutting down the test cluster shortly as we will be moving from testing to the live KMDLabs cluster.

i am familiar with komodos approach in that chains can run independently, but the only reason it would make sense is because there is a burn protocol that jl777 mentioned above. i am curious about how that works


[23-Nov-18 09:13 PM] nuttycoin#5982
specifically this line:


[23-Nov-18 09:13 PM] nuttycoin#5982
It makes extensive use of Merkle Trees to notarize transactions that take place on one chain onto every other chain in the Komodo ecosystem.


[23-Nov-18 09:14 PM] nuttycoin#5982
i know what merkle trees are but i am curious as to how they can enable bob to verify that alice has enough funds to pay him, without bob keeping track of any of alice's actions previously


[23-Nov-18 09:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
its actaully quite simple, at least in my understadngin of it ...

thenKMD tracks all these, and takes a Merkle root, of all the merkle roots


[23-Nov-18 09:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
and then that merkleroot is notarised back to each assetchain


[23-Nov-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
using an SPV proof you can chekc if a TX is valid against any of these merkelroots to verify it happened.


[23-Nov-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
then to burnr coins, you just burn the,m


[23-Nov-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
and waiut until the valid merkle root is on the input chain (taks a whiel 15-20misn usually, someitmes much longer os chain stalls or something)


[23-Nov-18 09:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
then when that chain can prove the burn on another chain happened.


[23-Nov-18 09:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
it lets you create the coins in that chain as a "coinbase" but, its an import, rathe than a coinabse but hey look much the same.


[23-Nov-18 09:42 PM] nuttycoin#5982
so if i understand correctly, the input chain looks to the KMD main chain for a merkle root to validate that the address in the output chain had enough funds?


[23-Nov-18 09:43 PM] nuttycoin#5982
how does KMD sync all of the txs going on in many side chains and form them into merkle roots? seems like there would be a bottleneck there no?


[23-Nov-18 09:52 PM] Deleted User#0000

@n2okpride  @Mylo  
What is the status with AWS, I have found a use for the service in the short term. We can use an AWS end point, to do one of the steps for migrate transactions. Currently for testing all our test nodes require, the source chain, target chain and hte whole KMD chain synced. We can make the KMD part a centralised service, accessed via an AWS API... This will make it also much much easier for me to carry out a mass scale migrate test without requireing crazy crazy amounts of hardware and $$$.

Hi. How can I send some KMD using komodo-cli? Which command should I use?

@Deleted User  finally got a meeting yesterday with them. they've been quiet for the past few weeks due to the Reinvent conference where they launched QLDB and their managed service offerings.


[06-Dec-18 03:29 PM] n2okpride#1967
I'm setting up a meeting with their blockchain segment to discuss the joint testing and other GTM strategy


[06-Dec-18 03:30 PM] n2okpride#1967
can we explore  if we can integrate AWS autoscaling with AC deployment?


[06-Dec-18 03:31 PM] n2okpride#1967
so a solution where if TX hit a certain threshold an additional asset chain is deployed. James indicated this should be technically possible. would be something of interest to AWS, and the two people I spoke to about it were really interested in exploring that solution.


[06-Dec-18 03:32 PM] n2okpride#1967
tying it into the overall scaling solution test would also be a neat showcase if possible


[06-Dec-18 05:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
That isn't technically impossible... A lot of the things we have been working on with #kmdlabs  will enable just this type of thing.


[06-Dec-18 05:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can  say that once I have finished getting that launched and bug free we can make a PoC using AWS hosting.


[06-Dec-18 05:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Which should be a matter of weeks away. The full MoMoM tech was upstreamed to KMD yesterday, and while it will need to be tested there to make sure everythign required was merged up is right and all of it is there, seems like we can use AWS to both test this and an autoscaleing solution at once.

The entire process is pretty safe and fine, butthe export tx is made incorrectly allowing you to import more coins than you burn. The coins are sent to the miner on the target chain.


[29-Dec-18 07:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
those are cool though !


[29-Dec-18 07:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
I had to just trial and error this crap until i understood what it was doing.


[29-Dec-18 07:21 PM] Deleted User#0000
To solve this, its easy enough to require the tx to be funded before creating it... but anyone canjust change that... it needs to be consensus absed.


[29-Dec-18 07:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
We need an extra check of txs that are burnt in the Transacion validation code I think.

haha... well I force the tx though on another node and all is well


[29-Dec-18 08:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
It breaks consensus rules... so currenlty some one can burn coins but not retreive them, and as doing so makes no sense, all it should need is a sanity chekc when creating the burn.

Yep.   It only does the comments that are in the format the tool knows.   So none of the cryptoconditions are complete, but looking at file view, you can go to cc folder and look at faucet.cpp to see flow

Things seem to just take far longer than they were supposed to... The MoMoM fixes took 8 months to iron out... We are in planning stages of a migrate stress test in #kmdlabs  There will be bounties up for the person who can do the most migrates ... IMO this test is more important than the tx spam test of the scaletest, although we definatly shoudl still run that, as its been ready to go for a very long time.

hi, what consensus mechanism do side chains in KMD use? is it the same dPoW that the KMD main chain uses?


[18-Jan-19 04:19 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes apart from Verus which got its own VerusHash algo. I believe you can already set your aglo for new chains now equihash or verushash where default is equihash

[19-Jan-19 12:06 AM] Alright#0419
but yes, all based on merkle roots, allows chains to verify transactions happened on other chains


[19-Jan-19 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
only the merkle roots involved in a specific crosschain tx needs to be validated


[19-Jan-19 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it is really a very efficient process to "bind" all the chains in a cluster


[19-Jan-19 07:54 PM] nuttycoin#5982
@jl777c that makes sense, but how does the validation take place on the tx receiving side? how do i know that the KMD node i am connected to isn't giving me a fake merkle root?


[19-Jan-19 10:31 PM] jl777c#5810
because you are getting MoMoM as part of the notarizations


[19-Jan-19 10:31 PM] jl777c#5810
so the raw tx -> txid -> validated in merkleroot -> validated in MoM -> validated in MoMoM


[19-Jan-19 10:32 PM] jl777c#5810
like a recursive SPV validation


[19-Jan-19 10:33 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to understand how SPV validation works before you can understand MoMoM


[19-Jan-19 11:09 PM] nuttycoin#5982
my understanding is that SPV is not totally trustless, as its security requires the light node to rely on the full nodes that it connects to. correct or no?


[19-Jan-19 11:09 PM] nuttycoin#5982
```While network nodes can verify
transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network.```


[19-Jan-19 11:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, in this case the notaries are the nodes that need to be trusted to be making valid MoMoM


[19-Jan-19 11:14 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no overpowering of the notaries


[19-Jan-19 11:25 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is like making SPV secure and then iterating on it


[19-Jan-19 11:38 PM] nuttycoin#5982
ok gotcha. so the assumption is that every notary is honest.


[19-Jan-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
no


[19-Jan-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
the assumption is that the majority of notaries are not dishonest


[19-Jan-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
all the notaries must come to consensus on every notarization. a minority dishonest wont get any notarizations


[19-Jan-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so to get any fake MoMoM the majority of notaries need to be dishonest and collude with each other


[19-Jan-19 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a fatal flaw in the game theory for these evil notaries.


[19-Jan-19 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
who holds the privkey to whatever SPV games they will do? all the evil notaries would need to trust their leader to share the wealth and as any collusion is immediately apparent on the blockchain, this is a onetime thing for any of the colluders, who are then identified as the culprits. and only the evil leader gets any money from it. this is assuming there is success in their shenanigans, which there isnt any guarantee


[20-Jan-19 12:05 AM] nuttycoin#5982
i'd say bribe-based attacks are slightly more dangerous though. because the theoretical profit-maximizing equation for a notary would be 
`act malicious if (bribe_reward > (annual_kmd_reward - annual_resource_costs)  * (1 + ‚àë[i=1,‚àû] ip(1‚àíp) ^ (i‚àí1)))` , 
where p = probability of earning a top 30 spot


[20-Jan-19 12:09 AM] nuttycoin#5982
whereas some PoS-based threat models require some kind of slashing, in which dishonest nodes not only miss out on potential revenue but also lose assets instantly


[20-Jan-19 12:09 AM] nuttycoin#5982
(that notation is kinda unclear also, sorry about that lol)


[20-Jan-19 12:21 AM] jl777c#5810
except the notaries would be specifically identified


[20-Jan-19 12:22 AM] jl777c#5810
factor in the risk costs, changes the equation


[20-Jan-19 12:23 AM] jl777c#5810
so not only would any top 30 spot is forfeit, there would be prosecution risks


[20-Jan-19 12:25 AM] jl777c#5810
another factor is that a false MoMoM attack is order of magnitude(s) more difficult to conduct than a 51% attack. but at scale this factor becomes small


[20-Jan-19 12:38 AM] nuttycoin#5982
true, illegality is a significant cost as well albeit hard to estimate

@jl777c  - So Sharding vs manychains  - scrambling/unscrambling vs crosschain merkleroot magic - unless your transactions have high chain affinity, how are you better off ? What makes extreme chain affinity any different to payment relationships vis-√†-vis payment channels  - is it just a matter of granularity of sharding. The more parallel chains you use the more you will have to maintain locally, and if your affinity does not match the chains native affinity you will be little better off than with a single chain and a larger block size. Sharding requires coordination protocols for cross-shard transactions, you use merkleroot magic

How are they fundamentally different ?


[26-May-19 05:17 PM] Ian#3705
(The comment re "you will be little better off than with a single chain" only applies when you have transaction counts that compare with how many shards/chains you interact with - obviously 1 trade a week is going to be much tighter)

The main point is whether your proposal is just a specific sharding implementation where you have more control over chain affinity ?


[26-May-19 05:26 PM] Ian#3705
And how does it compare with Cosmos, Polkadot, Kadena, Harmony, ...


[26-May-19 05:43 PM] jl777c#5810
in the extreme cases, I am sure you can specify a scenario where sharding vs many chains devolve to being approx the same.
however, let us deal with reality
a single cryptokitties dapp basically saturated the ETH chain. this cannot be denied. Let us now assume there is a second dapp cryptodoggies from a different vendor. I claim that the overlap between cryptokitties and cryptodoggies will be VERY small. How likely is it that they have to share state? they are different dapps from different vendors.

Now, what if there are hundreds of dapps from hundreds of vendors. just how much overlap is there between all these dapps?
doing payments is about the only thing where it is shared globally for all things and your logic could apply, even then it is very likely to be ways to automatically have locality of payments.

However, anybody can see without any formal maths that forcing all cryptokitties, cryptodoggies, cryptobirdies,... into a single chain and then sharding it cannot be anywhere as efficient as simply having independent chains for each one.

The big difference of komodo versus all the other many chains solutions is that komodo doesnt require vendor lockin. maximum independence and each chain is literally its own independent chain that has the option to add dPoW, but not the obligation. there is no per tx fee to pay to a master chain, no deposit needed to be able to make a chain, etc. i argue that the komodo approach is the most decentralized. What happens in all the other systems if the mainchain goes down?

54 independent chains, the total capacity is well in excess of 10,000 tx/sec. and there is not much crosstalk between chains, in fact, atomic swaps can be done for the times where that is needed.


[26-May-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
now imagine a single chain that is the combination of all 54 chains. If any chain comes close to saturating the single chain, 53 other chains suffer. Not to mention that the txfee for everyone goes up. Sharding is basically that. combine all things into a single chain, then somehow split it apart and make it all work. I have no idea how they will achieve this, seems very difficult problem to me.


[26-May-19 06:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe with a magical sharding solution you can have a single virtual chain that is composed of many shards, but what have you achieved? A way for all to pay higher txfees


[26-May-19 06:08 PM] jl777c#5810
sharding is an attempt to extend the mainchain taxation onto all transactions. komodo is a tax free zone and we dont do contortions to be able to enforce a tax on all usage in the ecosystem


[26-May-19 06:37 PM] Ian#3705
What you are describing is affinity - and it exists in general computing as well - a typical CPU has L1, L2, L3 cache and maintaining the majority of access to a single cache segment within a layer is the answer to orders of magnitude in performance. By implementing multiple chains you have manually specified domains where affinity is strong. This is good, where you can manage it. It works really well when you have a defined community of interaction and hence well defined strong domains but is not so easy with a general payment system such as Bitcoin where the domains are not so easy to define.


[26-May-19 06:53 PM] Ian#3705
Perhaps it is because my understanding of the term sharding pre-dates blockchain tech and i assume that the algorithm for splitting shards is configurable.  

An example - BarterDEX . Having it's own chain separate from others will segregate DEX traffic from other chain traffic in the Komodo ecosystem. How might you speed that up beyond what is feasible on Layer 1 using more frequent and larger blocks.  You could implement Layer 2 but defining useful networks of payment channels is non-trivial. You could shard by pair, but again the spread of activity is usually not evenly spread as trading on BTC/USD and a few major crosses probably swamp all the rest combined. If you define any manual sharding criteria (or multichains) what happens when that changes?


[26-May-19 06:56 PM] Ian#3705
Perhaps the system could look for strongly correlated activity, assign groupings and attempt to minimise cross group activity - it could then shard the traffic according to that grouping, gaining the advantages of affinity whilst not needing to define that grouping in advance


[26-May-19 07:00 PM] Ian#3705
Over time the pattern of activity could change - the grouping of activity perhaps changeing with it, and the layout of the shards with it as well. The consensus mechanism could exchange that sharding criteria  so each node could work out which shard it should use at any given time


[26-May-19 10:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
BarterDEX doesn't have any blockchain.
It is only a p2p network.


[26-May-19 11:30 PM] jl777c#5810
lets look into the one global shared case of simple payments, lets say a national currency to handle all transactions by everyone. I can see creating chains based on geography, regions, cities, towns, where there is a lot of cache effects. Also to create currencies by type of usage, ie. around product types.


[26-May-19 11:31 PM] jl777c#5810
in such a case, we can envision thousands of chains for the entire economy, but a single user would only care about a handful. in the event he will be traveling, he would convert to the blockchains in the region he is going. This is similar to converting your fiat into different fiat when you travel.


[26-May-19 11:32 PM] jl777c#5810
by allowing users to migrate their coins to the chains they use, it automatically creates the caching effect. I highly doubt you can design an allocation of chains ahead of time (as nobody can predict things as complex as economies), so just spawn more chains if there are not enough in certain areas


[26-May-19 11:33 PM] jl777c#5810
independent chains are like building more roads if the traffic congestion is too bad


[26-May-19 11:33 PM] jl777c#5810
sharding is making some magical road that all cars can use, with near infinite capacity


[26-May-19 11:34 PM] jl777c#5810
our approach is proven and requires no magical tech, the sharding requires tech from the future, just we dont know how far in the future yet

[29-May-19 12:45 AM] Ian#3705
@Alright I am not part of the team, just part of the community. The team are pushing towards going live in early July and it will not be using any scaling features other than on the main chain to start with - and i agree with that - you need to walk before you can run. Unfortunately, because i am not part of the team, i don't have access to ongoing development plans until they roll out the development plan for community involvement so i don't know what/if scalability features they plan.

I am just looking for my own inerest at the moment although it might be possible that i have more influence as the community gets involved. The main chain is involved in some on the Instant Swap tech so it might become an issue in the future but am sure that it is "fast enough" for the launch - i just think there should be plans for scalability and it is difficult to hard partition as Komodo are planning


[29-May-19 12:47 AM] Alright#0419

Scaled Layer 1 (sharding, multichains) could work but Layer 2 also - more complex as would have to setup a network of suitably funded nodes but might also be able to add Lightning/future Liquid support which would be interesting (Liquid a bit ahead i think) Am not entirely sure on pros/cons of a custom Layer 2 or public Lightning/BOLT - its not yet clear enough without access to the real thing which i don't yet

[05-Jun-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
with our fast action, we rescued about 8 million KMD and over 100 BTC, but as of now it seems about a million KMD has been stolen. I am working on a plan that I hope will be an acceptable outcome to most. Please be aware that even if your funds got swept, there are others that have nothing left and i would like to come up with a plan where nobody is wiped out. in order to do this, we need as accurate of a damage assessment as possible. So please make sure to file a claim with your details as soon as possible so we can get a handle on what actually happened.

once we quantify the actual problem at hand, then we can make a specific plan. I would like to make all the smaller accounts 100% whole, but there isnt enough funds for all accounts to be 100%. I think if the big amounts ends up around 80% to 90%. As long as the damage is less than a million KMD, then I will be able to find the funds to cover it, but if it is more than a million, well we will cross that path if it turns out that way.

So for now, we need to be able to assess the scope of the damage, it could be that we wont have 100% of people claiming and the 5% rewards (400,000 per year) can end up covering most of the claims if they are coming in over time. What does it mean to be a small account? A big account? I dont know yet. I am without sleep for over 30+ hours and I dont want to make any decisions in this state.

Please be patient and file your claims, that is what will help the most. The general plan is to protect the smaller accounts fully, make sure nobody is wiped out, use 5% rewards to cover some of the costs and I will also personally put in half a million KMD. Until we have the accurate numbers, we can only guess as to the specific plan.

Can i give you as new wallet  (3^question)  a ledger wallet or bittrex wallet ?


[05-Jun-19 07:44 AM] gcharang#6833
if you have a ledger wallet, that is better
make sure the ledger seed/privkeys weren't used in agama previously @istante


[05-Jun-19 09:22 AM] javita#1621
Was going to send to Bittrex, but it says temporarily off line. If our funds are still in the wallet, can we send directly out of the Agama wallet, or are there steps and precautions we have to take?

Hello.  I have some feed back on the mobile DEX.  Very good so far.  I have done 11 swaps.  6 Timeout failures.  For some reason, the tactile feedback on entering my pin could be more sensitive.  For the 6 number password, it often only registers 5 numbers. Not sure why, but it happens more often than not.  Also, when a atomic swap fails, it would be better to have the error message stay up until you confirm OK.  Many times I am trying to read the error message but it dissapears before I finish reading it.  Overall, the mobile DEX is impressive and I am excited for Komodo's future.  Keep up the great work. üëå

What features does POW have and where can it be applied


[09-Dec-19 02:01 AM] gcharang#6833
POW means proof of work and is used by most Cryptocurrencies to secure their network
