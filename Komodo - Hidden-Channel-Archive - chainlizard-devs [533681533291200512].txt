Hello, the convermation emails are not comming in. Do you guys know the problem?


[14-Jun-19 04:37 AM] Diesmaster#5068
recieved some emails but their link expired


[14-Jun-19 07:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Hello @Diesmaster There pressists an issue with emails delivery speed which will be resolved when @naezith change mail sending software


[14-Jun-19 07:14 AM] TonyL#3577
We're aware of it


[14-Jun-19 07:29 AM] naezith#9757
I was using a random Outlook email account to send those


[14-Jun-19 07:29 AM] naezith#9757
Outlook blocked the account, that was why it was not working


[14-Jun-19 07:29 AM] naezith#9757
last night I implemented SendGrid, now it should be working fine


[14-Jun-19 07:29 AM] naezith#9757
though make sure you check the spam folder


[14-Jun-19 07:59 AM] naezith#9757
by the way, please @ me every time you need me, I have the server muted. I added this channel as notification exception but I don't know if it works.

very cool will conetinue the testing


[19-Jun-19 09:09 AM] Diesmaster#5068
@naezith little problem. Chainlizzard is not accepting my public key. Do you know what I can do about it?


[19-Jun-19 09:10 AM] Diesmaster#5068
the error is: make sure the formating is right (but in dutch so this is a lose translation).


[19-Jun-19 09:14 AM] Diesmaster#5068
fixed it, my thing was returned in caps, and it only takes un-capitalized pkeys


[19-Jun-19 11:11 AM] naezith#9757
hmm yes, should I make it allow A-Z too?


[19-Jun-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
pubkey hex, so at most A-F


[19-Jun-19 11:03 PM] naezith#9757
okay, I will cast it to lowercase at serverside


[19-Jun-19 11:03 PM] naezith#9757
it would look more elegant in komodod launch line


[20-Jun-19 02:48 AM] naezith#9757

very rarely it says `ERROR: No 'merchant' set in the button!` in a blank white page, when our site redirects to CoinPayments


[20-Jun-19 03:01 AM] naezith#9757
yet I could not find a way to get this error consistently, so can't fix


[20-Jun-19 03:02 AM] naezith#9757
it's a huge problem because cart is being cleared just before that redirect


[20-Jun-19 03:02 AM] naezith#9757
cart is gone, payment site gives error. means user needs to start all over again


[20-Jun-19 03:02 AM] naezith#9757
would be nice if someone can find a way to get it consistently, or the reason it happens


[20-Jun-19 03:04 AM] naezith#9757
that's the merchant it complains about

Couple things I noticed while testing and getting basics on guide ready - 
- Some panels dont have save button visible until modified
- pressing back button from coinpayments goes back to empty cart. Order listed as "awaiting payment" in order history page, but cant see how to load it back into cart.

@naezith


[20-Jun-19 04:17 AM] naezith#9757
save button is hidden because there is nothing to save


[20-Jun-19 04:19 AM] naezith#9757
yes cart is cleared in the moment you get into coinpayments page

got it again


[20-Jun-19 05:42 AM] naezith#9757
dammit


[20-Jun-19 05:45 AM] smkhound#7640
@naezith noting to save, but default selected. so to save, have to select something else, save then select default and save again.
On Privacy panel, default it both types of addresses. Cant get green tick without save, cant save default without saving someting else first

Can we add small anchorlink from consensus pael to rewards panel if PoS acitve?


[20-Jun-19 05:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, not able to catch such error so far - bought 4 chains today without issues


[20-Jun-19 05:56 AM] naezith#9757
if it's default selected, then you don't need to save it


[20-Jun-19 05:56 AM] naezith#9757
that's what it will use anyways


[20-Jun-19 05:57 AM] naezith#9757
@ca333 the gray default icon is confusing everyone, should we make them green?


[20-Jun-19 05:58 AM] naezith#9757
that was the reason we made consensus look green by default


[20-Jun-19 06:06 AM] naezith#9757
but then it will look like this

[20-Jun-19 06:06 AM] ca333#0333
grey means it hasnt been set.
green means its set or saved (or defaulted = preset and presaved)

whats the problem exactly other than individual interpretation issues? Is there any technical problem related to that?

no we dont set them all green since its a indicator of missing configs.


[20-Jun-19 06:06 AM] naezith#9757
no technical issues

[20-Jun-19 06:07 AM] ca333#0333
so if all is green while its not set and not saved - how will it make things more clear? i am afraid it will become more irritating if we change it to "all green by default".


[20-Jun-19 06:07 AM] naezith#9757
this is how it looks right now

[20-Jun-19 06:07 AM] naezith#9757
I'd suggest setting consensus to grey too though


[20-Jun-19 06:07 AM] naezith#9757
but it's up to you


[20-Jun-19 06:07 AM] ca333#0333
ok - that would be fine. Setting all grey by default.


[20-Jun-19 06:08 AM] ca333#0333
and turning green as soon as set/saved - so logic stays the same.


[20-Jun-19 06:08 AM] ca333#0333
@smkhound would that prevent the irritation on your end?

[20-Jun-19 06:08 AM] naezith#9757
very elegant imo


[20-Jun-19 06:11 AM] smkhound#7640
yeah lacking green piques OCD tendancies. Guess I like to confirm default. Starting grey is good too or else maybe user skips a section by accident and gets default unintentionally

about the topic in #antara-composer-beta


[20-Jun-19 06:11 AM] naezith#9757
Awaiting payment state is when you click that `Pay with CoinPayments` button


[20-Jun-19 06:11 AM] naezith#9757
coinpayments page opens


[20-Jun-19 06:12 AM] naezith#9757
basically


[20-Jun-19 06:12 AM] smkhound#7640
I think I went back with browser button, not page button, so I understand the outcome


[20-Jun-19 06:12 AM] naezith#9757
I save the order to database, then coinpayments opens with that order id


[20-Jun-19 06:13 AM] smkhound#7640
just wondering if we can revive from awaiting payment order history, else it just sits until timed out


[20-Jun-19 06:13 AM] naezith#9757
in that coinpayments page, if you click to cancel, then order gets removed


[20-Jun-19 06:13 AM] naezith#9757
though I don't know how to make a custom URL which would act the same


[20-Jun-19 06:13 AM] naezith#9757
I'll check


[20-Jun-19 06:15 AM] smkhound#7640
I was being a stupid user, lie when  you use browser back button on bank site, have to log in again. Its how payemnet pages should work. I though I lost it and was going to start again, then I saw on orders page, but couldnt revive


[20-Jun-19 06:15 AM] naezith#9757
lemme see


[20-Jun-19 06:16 AM] naezith#9757
I'll try to make a button
