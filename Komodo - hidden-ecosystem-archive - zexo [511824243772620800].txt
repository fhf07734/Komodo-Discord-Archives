first founders chain hey ... 😃


[13-Nov-18 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
ZEX needs a pool


[13-Nov-18 01:47 AM] jorian#4555
when hashrate more than KMD?


[13-Nov-18 01:47 AM] jorian#4555
what is ZEX?


[13-Nov-18 01:48 AM] jorian#4555
no connection here either


[13-Nov-18 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
ANN should come out today


[13-Nov-18 01:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
I can do a pool for these chains 😃


[13-Nov-18 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
I am connecting to it without any issues from any nodes


[13-Nov-18 01:48 AM] Deleted User#0000

[13-Nov-18 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
I have a stratum pool that works with these


[13-Nov-18 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
if you want to use it web


[13-Nov-18 01:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
It passes the coinbase directly to the stratum


[13-Nov-18 01:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
so there cant be a pool fee


[13-Nov-18 01:54 AM] Deleted User#0000
othereeise ive been minign with it on CFEKED for a couple days no issue now


[13-Nov-18 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
The suggested way for the pool to get a fee was to spoof some free shares 😃


[13-Nov-18 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
either case I will do a pool right now for this 😄


[13-Nov-18 01:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Or someone could build a stratum for it that isn't a nomp fork...
#JustSayin


[13-Nov-18 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
as an example ... it wont be staying up long term... im not a good pool operator,


[13-Nov-18 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
Why would you bother to do that ... when you can just do what I did ?


[13-Nov-18 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
its like 10 lines of extra code 😂


[13-Nov-18 01:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
although the deamon needs a patch .. so I will use stakedchain komodo fork to run the pool so it cna actually work.


[13-Nov-18 01:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`Why would you bother to do that ...`
Yes, why would we the people of the Komodo ecosystem want something new that isn't 9th generation fekery?


[13-Nov-18 01:59 AM] jl777c#5810
has anyone been able to connect to the network?


[13-Nov-18 01:59 AM] jl777c#5810
might need to change the seed node


[13-Nov-18 01:59 AM] jorian#4555
no it's working now. very latest is needed


[13-Nov-18 01:59 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is what i meant when i say use the latest version


[13-Nov-18 02:00 AM] jl777c#5810

[13-Nov-18 02:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
hmm just merged FSM down to staked.. I assume that will also work ?


[13-Nov-18 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810

@CMaurice did you use FSM branch?

I am using staked branch mastertest with the very tip of FSM merged in .. already have a few blocks


[13-Nov-18 02:29 AM] CMaurice#1685
nope, master.


[13-Nov-18 02:30 AM] jorian#4555
about the ANN: the chain parameters say that there is a halving every 525600 blocks. that is 365 days, so yearly. with a block reward of 130 ZEX per block, and if my math is right, we come at a MAX supply of 136,656,000 approximately after 35 years.


[13-Nov-18 02:30 AM] jorian#4555
oh wait


[13-Nov-18 02:30 AM] jorian#4555

its in that ... I added an extra "mode" which were all disabled before


[13-Nov-18 04:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
it instead just submits the coinbase as tx 0

isntead of a seperate json object


[13-Nov-18 04:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
the pool reads the config bool, and if true

it uses that mode instead of the normal one

You need this pool:

it is the first chain that uses -ac_founders option

which invokes the -ac_perc/-ac_pubkey

combined with -ac_script, we can make chains that fund a CC contract from the blockreward

`Was more focused on making sure the feature worked properly than documenting it` And you get how it's had to make something to go with it when there's nothing saying what *it* is, right?

@webworker01 
cant just do this and use daemon coinbase ?
```// get reward for newly generated blocks
 if (round.category === 'generate' || round.category === 'immature') {
          round.reward = coinsRound(parseFloat(generationTx.amount * 0.99 || generationTx.value * 0.99 ));
 }```


[13-Nov-18 06:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
obviously the 99% needs to be from config files


[13-Nov-18 06:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
but if this works that should be easy


[13-Nov-18 06:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
if the chain is cc avtivated


[13-Nov-18 06:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
all the txs  in the mempool on block receive are sent to a seperate mempool if they are not z tx's then added back to the real mempool


[13-Nov-18 06:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
make it thing the coinbase is 1% less


[13-Nov-18 06:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
leaving a fee in the pool address


[13-Nov-18 06:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
when they are added back, if they are invalid that mesage will show up

thats how we fixed dice forking


[13-Nov-18 06:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
you could send that balance to a rewards address by adding that address and the opposite amount to the sendmany


[13-Nov-18 06:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
but float rounding might be a little tricky


[13-Nov-18 06:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
but its so very miuch more complicated

The development of the exchange has been underway for a very long time. We had no way of realising a hybrid DEX the way we visioned, until we saw CC. The centralised part will be ready ahead of schedule and is well under way. The DEX can still be built several ways. As we cater to traders and respect privacy, we will build this properly and the right way. The plan has been there for a long time  @grewalsatinder


[13-Nov-18 06:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Machgielis nice to hear back quick mate. Happy to see your project. 🙂


[13-Nov-18 06:59 AM] Machgielis#2406
A fair launch is a much better way of doing things in our minds. Going back to more grass roots. This raising 50 million to build something that costs a fraction of that is not how we want to operate. We would rather build based on what we have to work with and add more features as we go and we see the tech develop


[13-Nov-18 07:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I yet to read the whitepaper linked on website, the centralized part, would that require the devs or the project to have the license and stuff for trading?


[13-Nov-18 07:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
just like EtherDelta got in trouble, could you get into trouble for such things?


[13-Nov-18 07:05 AM] Machgielis#2406
The idea is to have centralised support but you keep your keys. Thats the longer term. The initial will be very much centralised. We will ensure we do everything to comply with legislation but we are also working very hard to ensure we operate in the confines of protecting privacy. It may well be that we have both in operation side by side. So the end user may choose. But we take the right to privacy very seriously.

To sell one would either need to mine to a DP deposit address (frowned upon), or use CLI to send the mined coins directly. Until Agama GUI has ZEX.

i guess ZEX requires a very new komodod? Is `dev` branch ok?

200/130 -> 1.538461538461538

there's these new things, invented yesterday, they are called "transaction fees"....


[13-Nov-18 12:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
my pool ahs a fee ... but its a flat percentage of the block reward, yo ucan inverse fee of you like to pay extra coins


[13-Nov-18 12:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
as long as there is balance in the pool address


[13-Nov-18 01:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
you cant do that with the stratum coinbase


[13-Nov-18 01:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
you would need to use my method anyway adding even more double and tripple handling of code 😛

`you cant do that with the stratum coinbase`
the fact that *you* can't doesn't mean *I* can't 😉

@Decker how did you do your pool? It seems forkwitch pool does not work am I still the only pool, I'd rather not have 100% or close to that of the hash rate... If someone else needs help doing a pool I can help them, it's really not hard.

@BL0ckchain  what do you mean, you need a higher diff port than 3031? Do you know exactly the numbers I need to set it too? Restarting the pool is not a good idea tbh and I'd rather not have to do that, but given exact settings I can add or change nh port at next restart

@Machgielis 


Read Zaddex whitepaper. Have few questions:

1. Will your centralised exchange engine be open soruce code?
2. Since the team decided to be anonymouse, which I respect the decision, what points you have to build trust on your team?
3. How many team members there are in Zaddex project? Can you please share their usernames and their roles?
4. I assume you will use the Assets Crypto-Conditions Smart Contract for decentralised exchange part. Please confirm if that's correct.
5. Which developer will be improving Assets CC?
6. The whitepaper doesn't cover Z address useage with Hybrid Exchange. Please clear how it will use Z tx for DEX.
7. There is not really enough details in the whitepaper for Hybrid Exchange, other than much it clears that it will be a Centralised Exchange. When can you provide more technical details on your project?

I'll probably have more questions once I get answers of these above.


[13-Nov-18 08:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
So far I don't have confidence on the project by reading the whitepaper and looking at the website and bitcointalk annoucement.


[13-Nov-18 08:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I thought of going to exchange and buying some ZEX, but after reading whitepaper, I felt it's dangerous decision to put money on ZEX.


[13-Nov-18 08:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
will wait for the answers before thinking of doing anything with ZEX project.


[13-Nov-18 08:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Since the whitepaper mentions that team claims to have **"Collective"** 30 years around of experience with customer service, please give me something which makes me believe that it is actually these much years. Anonymous team + the experience years doesn't make sense.
Since the team decided to be anonymous, basically it starts with the no credibility on the past.
The only trust it can build is by providing the output, by giving the working project or showing the working code on the developer network, which I'm looking forward to.


[13-Nov-18 08:40 PM] Machgielis#2406
Really appreciate the questions and fully understand your view. The code will be open source code.  2. The team of devs are anon. We will be adding more devs as time goes on and we will offer community members the chance to fill those roles. We will build trust with increasing transaprency. 3. There are the anon devs and two business facing people. Myself and one other who will introduce themselves shortly. We are responsible for strategy, planning and also delivery. 4. Our core team is learning more about the CC smart contracts each and every day and will look for as much assistance as required. 5. Our devs will be doing this. 6. We already have the tech for this to occur in a centralised fashion and are now building this for DEX and will update with a more technical white paper soon. 7. Yes, as stated these will follow. As CC smart contracts are new, we are fortunate to have a number of alternatives and are just deciding the most practical way now, without sacrificing user experience and will include in the more technical whitepaper.


[13-Nov-18 08:42 PM] Machgielis#2406
Relating to the Customer Experience part one member has 15 years plus one has 12 years and one member with 4 years experience. Means we have more than 30 years in total.


[13-Nov-18 08:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Is your core developer here on this discord?


[13-Nov-18 08:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

[13-Nov-18 08:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

More than marketing and customer facing team members, I'd be much more interested to interact with the core developer who will be working on the backend core project.


[13-Nov-18 08:49 PM] Machgielis#2406
@grewalsatinder will ask for some technical presence yes.


[13-Nov-18 08:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Okay, so far what I understand, just to be clear:
1.  Zaddex team is about 3 people. 2 customer facing, 1 core dev.
2. Claims to have centralised exchange engine done, which will be open sourced? When?
3. Do you have any expected timeline to provide technical details on Both Centralised Exchange and Decentralised Exchange?
4. Since no username provided for core developer, the core developer is not here on this discord? How is this developer learning CC tech then? Since this dev is anonymous already, and in case the dev is here on this discord, can you please give the dev's username?


[13-Nov-18 08:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
5. What is the Github repository to check on the source code or even the developer's github profile? or any developer network profile?


[13-Nov-18 09:03 PM] Machgielis#2406
1. We have 3 devs. 2 customer facing. 2. We have stated Q1 in the whitepaper and are tracking ahead of schedule so far. Updates to follow. 3. Centralised very soon. DEX is dependent on exact route as there are technical and legal considerations so we will build with both in mind. 4. The priority at the moment is the centralised exchange and we will absolutely make this available. 5. All of the Github information is being worked on over the next 48 hours and will be updated shortly. We thank you for your patience and understanding.

[13-Nov-18 09:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Thank you for your answers.
I have to be honest here @Machgielis 

I still don't have any confidence on Zaddex project.

1. I don't know ANYTHING about team.
2. I don't know What code history the developers has made to assess by checking on the code quality and how well things work in developer side.
3. I don't know ANYTHING other than the *"soon"* for technical details.

To me it is *VERY DANGEROUS* to do any exchange (buy/sell) of $ZEX token on current or any Centralised Exchange until the team provides technical details on the project, and also shows the in-progress source code or working source code, along with the core developer to answer further questions.

@Deleted User it's not 35% ... let's apply simple math:
- Block Reward: 130 ZEX
- Founders Reward: 70.0000002 ZEX
- Total Coinbase: 200.0000002 ZEX
So, founders reward is: 53,846154% 😃


[13-Nov-18 09:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
so something is very wrong with the math inside the daemon then, as it flat says its 35%


[13-Nov-18 09:24 PM] Decker#3767
But 200 * 0.35 = 70 ... )

But CoinBase Amount = BlockReward + FoundersReward.

yes it seems backwards to me ...


[13-Nov-18 09:26 PM] Deleted User#0000
unless the coinabse is meant to be 200 coins ... which is far too much IMO

[13-Nov-18 09:28 PM] Decker#3767
Seems when we talk about 35%, we should mean 35% of coinbase. Where coinbase = BlockReward + FoundersReward.


[13-Nov-18 09:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes so in that case its right... 😃

we will be using something similar for staked... to pay % of BR to either a multisig address OR a contract.

no reason it wouldnt work, agama is just a front end to the daemon.. rpc calls are the same... that said, until its tested as working its much safer to just mine to KMD address, or leave on exchange a few days.

Is there a way to use the command line to communicate with the KMD daemon started by Agama to start & sync the ZEX chain? Then one could send coins etc 'fairly easily' without having to compile/use test builds? (I know, anything is still a 'test build' technically at this point...

STAKED will mine its "founders reward" to a crypto condition contract to be distrbuted farily and decentralised... rather than to a single key.


[14-Nov-18 04:18 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@ph03nix   If it does take it off,  can't get much cheaper than the low hashrate coins now.   Before nicehash kicked in on blackjokers pool,  was able to mine 3500  with a mini .  Not going too hard in it but worth pointing the machines at it.  Fee tokens tend to do well and always have a market

Genie ... I have confirmed my pool is working with fee, but it eave the fee in the pool address, there are two options to "fix" this:
1) try to calculate the inverse of the amount perfactly down to the sat, and speiify the reward address in the sendmany to send the fee to the reward address
2) make a script that rus on blocknotify that grabs all tx sent from coinbase to the pool address and sends that to the reward address.


[14-Nov-18 05:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
Do yo uthink the second is a problem, its faster an easier to make ... but I think would be more reliable too


[14-Nov-18 05:19 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Deleted User why do you persist on telling me about a "workaround" for something I don't care about? I'm 100% against adding more halfassed shit to znomp rather than doing it right for KomodoPlatform

I guess I will try to make it work exactrly as the coinbase fee and take a reward address in the pool config file.

but my way is making ithave komodo things .. .whatever the daemon calcualtes as a valid coinbase (which is has a reverse function usually in the checkblock that uses the same data and math ) is just used, rather than being calcualted a second time in javascript.... I dont see why you need to do it a second time when it exists in a perfect state that will always be accepted at conenct block as valid. 😕

`that isnt relavent` @Deleted User it's 100% relevant; you keep missing the point....
I don't care about patches and changes to ZCL products to pretend they are komodo products
`Putting a Holden seat inside a Ford truck doesn't make the truck a Holden truck`
Putting a Komodo format inside a ZCL pool doesn't make the pool a Komodo pool


[14-Nov-18 05:32 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Personally i like the idea behind zex so i have punted on it. I think this is better than taking millions of $ and handing out "tokens". This way they have to build something or the money drys up for them. No product no one will mine it. I like the model myself

I just read above conversation. As a miner I never have a problem with projects keeping a dev fund or "founders fee". Especially for an exchange. The developers need money for the project to succeed. I need the developers to succeed so I make money. It's win win. Or lose lose.

[14-Nov-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
at worst, a new KMD assetchain is net neutral as there will be as much funds buying the KMD to buy the new coin as being sold after selling for KMD


[14-Nov-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, NXT devs looked at all the selling of NXT that happened with assets that raised NXT. They only looked at half the equation, they didnt look at the funds used to buy the NXT in the first place

and if someone is selling, someone has to be buying


[14-Nov-18 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so anything that creates buying/selling is good for a currency

if you ignore positive effects and only look at negative effects, then i guess you can conclude something negative has happened. but that is not the correct way to assess things


[14-Nov-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the net effect that matters, positive - negative


[14-Nov-18 09:54 AM] Flexatron#8809

Just gonna throw this here... Pirate started marketing the first week of October.   Not sure what else KMD dropped last month that would cause this kind of volume pressure but I agree with JL that Any action is good action.

You can't honestly argue that Gas fees are the reason ETH has purpose and value.

It would hold true IF a currency's main purpose is to store value


[14-Nov-18 10:07 AM] jansako#3330
cause then you want as much value 'stored', e.g not moving

i wan't to add the pool setup for assetchains guide in the wiki as well. once we have all these fixes done 😃


[14-Nov-18 11:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
and you need the -pubkey set as the pool address ... the pool *should* set the pubkey with `setpubkey` RPC if the pirivate key is imported, but maybe that sometimes fails im not sure... if it was just something I did wrong. although I tested that change heaps of times and it was working properly before.


[14-Nov-18 11:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
so its likely a something ive done trying to get fees working that made it break ...


[14-Nov-18 11:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
If I just make it so that "disablecb" option can only have a single rewards address (for pool fee) this would eb very easy ... but to keep it backwards compattible is proving difficult...

My solution was to pass the coibase fromt he daemon directly to the block... and take the pool fee out in the payment processor

Seems the simplest solution, and I dont see another working solution, your pool is live but seems to have not mined any blocks.

Einsteinium example was super for me learning quick changes then you can play with VOUT structure and everything like you want. Manipulation of coinbase transaction with the nomp code is exciting.

thanks for getting it going @That_Guy8 ...appreciate your hard work
but i would have to agree with oszy...the blue is very tough onthe eyes
maybe make it a softer blue...powder or sky blue perhaps?

They said Agama was real close. Havnt heard anything yet though.


[15-Nov-18 11:57 AM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
Is it easy to do on the cli or not worth trying if you don't no what to do


[15-Nov-18 11:58 AM] Nagol#1866
for me it was easy. but depends what operating system and how familiar you are with cli and what not.


[15-Nov-18 11:58 AM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
Windows 10 and not at all familiar 😂


[15-Nov-18 11:59 AM] Nagol#1866
if you run linux I can help walk you through it but if your on windows I wont be much help.

😂 I'm stuck then


[15-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Nagol#1866
well if you have some time to put towards it I am sure you can figure it out. All you got to do is clone the dev repo of komodo. Then install build time dependencies. then compile. then run.


[15-Nov-18 12:02 PM] Nagol#1866
they got good instructions on the git hub. hang on a sec


[15-Nov-18 12:05 PM] Nagol#1866
ok just checked the git hub windows instructions and you got to crosscompile with mingw so not so simple as I thought for windows users.


[15-Nov-18 12:07 PM] Nagol#1866
if you have ever ran a virtual machine like virtualbox or someithing id be glad to help you if you want. just get a vm going with ubuntu 16.04 or 18.04. And you will be close. If you dont feel like messing with it no prob. Agama shouldnt be much longer.


[15-Nov-18 12:09 PM] stephenleeholmes118#1884
Do I download the windows host on virtualbox


[15-Nov-18 12:10 PM] Nagol#1866
yeah


[15-Nov-18 12:11 PM] Nagol#1866
install virtualbox create your first guest wich will be ubuntu. then once you get ubuntu going you just follow the instructions here: https://github.com/jl777/komodo

mining to an exchange wallet is bad for a bajillion reasons


[15-Nov-18 02:55 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@KSanJuan


[15-Nov-18 02:58 PM] KSanJuan#9608
I’ve been looking for the wallet, or where to activate the coin inside of Agama generating an off exchange address..but until that happens.


[15-Nov-18 02:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It uses the same address scheme as komodo


[15-Nov-18 02:59 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
👆🏽 that
and "the wallet" is komodod (just like every other assetchain)


[15-Nov-18 03:02 PM] KSanJuan#9608
So the mining proceeds from the ZEX can just be deposited right into my Agama KMd address and that alone will generate/activate the ZEX coin.  Stupid simple then.


[15-Nov-18 03:05 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
nothing "activates" an address, it's either valid or it's not and you either have a key for it or you don't


[15-Nov-18 03:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@KSanJuan  when you can access it in Agama you will just use the same passphrase/key .  If you want earlier access you need to run it via commandline

does this version have Pirate and Verus native?


[15-Nov-18 09:50 PM] That_Guy8#4893
Ginasis Mining is going to move back to the 1% fee, I hope the miners currently with us enjoy the 0% blocks and I hope this does not deter you from joining or continuing your mining with us! Thanks for the support


[15-Nov-18 09:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Very close here to a working fee model for the pool...


[15-Nov-18 09:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
Its weird though, it only pays every second payment, sometimes even less, so somehting is not right still... I think maybe the amount paid is slightly more than the total block rewards by a few sats... but the reported balance is like hundreds of coins less... so its counting unconfirmed coinbases somehow..

{Reactions}
👌 

[15-Nov-18 09:54 PM] DG#6934
@wookie  This version has Verus in lite with Sapling already implemented and Pirate in native mode  as always.


[15-Nov-18 09:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Appears to be working though... just doesnt pay out exactly every 300s, mor liek 1/3 of the time, so average eveyr 900s for payouts... accepts multiple address for pools, and can do 0.1% and higher fee. As far as I can tell its exactly the same as the normal pool fee, uses the same rewardsRecipents as usual, and pays the correct %


[15-Nov-18 09:57 PM] That_Guy8#4893
nice work mate


[15-Nov-18 09:59 PM] wookie#7663
@DG thanks. It's just that I'm using agama 40f on a separate computer to get native verus so that I can stake, but I'm using agama.43c for all other kmd assetchains


[15-Nov-18 10:01 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
At what point do you stop trying to reinvent the wheel in order to avoid properly creating a single tx?


[15-Nov-18 10:12 PM] That_Guy8#4893
Also price box has been updated and is now working. Granted it is tied to ZEX-BTC on Digitalprice so hopefully some more trades get going there that will properly reflect the value 😃


[15-Nov-18 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
Im not listening to you anymore genie... I cannot make a pool for the staked CC contract with the old method and Ihave no choice but to do it this way, and it works.


[15-Nov-18 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
which is all that matters


[15-Nov-18 10:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
if it was not working

then that would be a problem

but it does... so what the fuck does it matter how it works, as long as it works.


[15-Nov-18 10:22 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
you literally repeated it doesn't work and then turned around and repeatedly repeated that it does
make up our minds
either your pool works as a proper pool or it's halfassed and doesn't actually work...


[15-Nov-18 10:23 PM] Deleted User#0000
it works perfectly ... just that payments seem to sit around... I don know why its like that, it might even be like that normally I dont know.


[15-Nov-18 10:23 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`it only pays every second payment, sometimes even less` = "it doesn't feken work"

[15-Nov-18 10:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
I guess I cna try to decrease the time between payments


[15-Nov-18 10:24 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
increase min confirms

{Reactions}
👍 

[15-Nov-18 10:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
also with min confirms, on a notarised chain, it will wait for a notarisation before confirms becomes 2 ..


[15-Nov-18 10:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
so setting it at just 2 would be enough I think... on test chain min confs might need to be more.


[15-Nov-18 10:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
will try thanks


[15-Nov-18 10:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Still does it with minConf set at 10 .. but it does eventually work... might just try incresing the frewuency of payments


[15-Nov-18 10:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
🤷


[15-Nov-18 10:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
It works... I think this issue is normal behaviour tbh ... doesnt seem that anythign I changed can cause it at all...


[15-Nov-18 10:44 PM] Deleted User#0000
if the amount is wrong, it would be out by a few sats not hundreds of coins

@Laviathon -bcmonster.com  pool is now working


[15-Nov-18 11:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
The reward recipients is also working...


[15-Nov-18 11:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
You can set any amount of address and percents, it can handle them. It adds the reward address to the sendmany with a for loop. Was quite simple to fix once I figured out how to code it in javascript lol.

I dont like it excatly, as it calcualtes things multiple times for no reason, but it works and is accurate enough that its paying out starting from a clean pool wallet with zero balance and keeps paying out. Will need to update ZEX pool soon, will increase NH mindiff too, 50 is too low.


[16-Nov-18 12:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
Also changed the gencfg.sh script, to take a $1 of a specific coin, and updated the coins.json template to use disablecb by  default, and also enabled payments by default in poolcongifs.template.


[16-Nov-18 12:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
Will update readme.md and then the pool is done. 😄

my pool uses a new mode of operation `disablecb`


[16-Nov-18 12:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
this makes the pool directly just use the coinbase tx created by the daemon

@webworker01 are you adding fee before or after tax?


[16-Nov-18 06:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
Why do you need to do that ... I still fully dont understand why you guys are set on creating the coinbase again, when a vild tx is already made by the daemon ?

[16-Nov-18 06:10 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
` I still fully dont understand why you guys are set on creating the coinbase again`
Because your shit doesn't work with the real daemon....
if the feken guy that's spent the last 6 months working with the daemon would work on the feken bits that create the tx (bitcoinjs-lib) and leave the rest to us, this would be done and properly already and everyone would be satisfied

[16-Nov-18 06:18 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`The issue is in the merkle root calculation btw`
What if the calculation in the lib matched the calculation in the daemon, instead of altering the daemon and changing the entire process back to 2009?

@Deleted User we've reached a point, imo, where backward-compatibility is moot and we need a Komodo-based stratum and can work on how to add outside coins later

the other zcoins would be easy(ish) to readd if we have the lib functioning properly


[16-Nov-18 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the other quirk is that for assetchains if the coinbase is used to distribute payments, it cant include any txfees, just the blockreward


[16-Nov-18 06:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
There is no chance of my change breaking anything existing it is an extra option. But do what you want, pool ops can choose which one they want.


[16-Nov-18 06:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
Its really NOT complicated... Use the coinbase from the daemon, as the validation function is an exact inverse of the function that created it it cannot fail this way

So I restarted the wallet and imported the seed that I generated a few days ago, using a KMD address. The coins that I mined is now appearing in the wallet. However it will not allow me to send the coins, it’s giving me this error:

Best bet is to try both ports. Check the regular one and if it’s smashing shares too fast after 10 mins try the high diff.

going back to 📺 now; wake me when you've actually read what you posted (including the actual underlying concepts)....


[17-Nov-18 04:56 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie how can they hash a block and calculate the shares for it at the same time


[17-Nov-18 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
the block they'd be hashing would be changing constantly


[17-Nov-18 04:58 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
because 1+1=2 and 1+1+1=3
It's on a 5N base, not literally *every* share up to the second, but recalculated every scrape (just like the node stratums rescrape every 55 seconds by default)


[17-Nov-18 04:59 PM] Alright#0419
seems like you could game it


[17-Nov-18 05:00 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
personally, I think the "wind down" calc is off, but everyone tells me I'm mistaken every time I say something about it


[17-Nov-18 05:00 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
and some just don't care


[17-Nov-18 05:00 PM] Alright#0419
wind down?


[17-Nov-18 05:03 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
with "5N", your paid shares are based on 5 times a given *N* value (usually *N* is set at the current diff)
so, you have a period where you're not getting "paid in full" while "ramping up" and a period where you're still getting paid after you stop hashing "winding/ramping down"

Is ZEX using  BarterDEX in anyway?


[18-Nov-18 05:16 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
It is if you place an offer there


[18-Nov-18 05:16 PM] Alright#0419
I believe the plan is to use the gateways contract alongside the CEX


[18-Nov-18 05:17 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@blubbi the alternative is that you could try for not making 336% the cost of mining....


[18-Nov-18 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
gateways contract is very similar concept to MGW from NXT days


[18-Nov-18 05:17 PM] Alright#0419
can find some good reading material on that if you're interested


[18-Nov-18 05:18 PM] Alright#0419
could be wrong about that tbh, that's just an assumption


[18-Nov-18 05:18 PM] 9oklp#8901
So will ZEX tx pay any fees to BarterDEX asset DEX,  like hyperdex will?


[18-Nov-18 05:20 PM] 9oklp#8901
Is ZEX using BarterDEX software under the hood?


[18-Nov-18 05:23 PM] 9oklp#8901
If ZEX is using CC gateway, then maybe BarterDEX isn't used at all, more like MGW 2.0 like @Alright suggested


[18-Nov-18 05:24 PM] blubbi#0643

Hi everyone, it's been an eventful week for Zaddex. 

This past week:
- Zaddex blockchain launched
- Digital Price exchange lists $ZEX (within 24 hrs)
- Blockexplorer live 
- dPOW notarization deployed
- Blockfolio listed Zaddex $ZEX
- Agama wallet integration - pre release 0.2.44c

Komodo's support has been fantastic and enabled us to achieve many things in a short space of time.  Thank you to Komodo and everyone in this channel for showing an interest and supporting the project. 

Our development team is working diligently behind the scenes on the Zaddex exchange and we look forward to publishing an update on the progress soon. 

This week we will work on getting miners on the network and continue the process of getting listed on exchanges.

[20-Nov-18 04:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@📢Alex📢 I'll ask you the same thing I've asked thousands of other folks that can't come up with a legitimate answer:
Why should any coin choose a less secure method just to pacify the least common denominator of the mining populous?


[20-Nov-18 04:41 AM] 📢Alex📢#0774
any investor invests in promising projects, and not in those in which the price is falling all the time. In this project will fall due to the sale of coins miners  ASICs


[20-Nov-18 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so GPU miners never sell? that is your position?


[20-Nov-18 04:44 AM] 📢Alex📢#0774
ASICs more power, will get more coins, and this number will sell, which will lead to a drop in price


[20-Nov-18 04:45 AM] jl777c#5810
your math makes no sense. if a coin only had GPU miners, then they . would get more coins and this number will sell


[20-Nov-18 04:46 AM] jl777c#5810
if anything, the electricity cost for ASIC miners is much less, so if we assume that all miners need to sell coins to cover electric costs, ASIC mined coins would have less selling


[20-Nov-18 04:46 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`ASICs more power, will get more coins, and this number will sell, which will lead to a drop in price`
As an example, BTC has a much lower market price than when it was GPU only, right?


[20-Nov-18 04:48 AM] jl777c#5810
not having a lot of miners using built in GPU with no incremental cost leads to higher mining cost per coin, and a higher price than a bunch of gamers mining and selling for their $5 profits


[20-Nov-18 04:49 AM] 📢Alex📢#0774
@ComputerGeniethat you have fashions to compare Btc

[20-Nov-18 04:50 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@📢Alex📢 also, the key thing that you're missing out of your nostalgia equation: top-end ASICs are both cheaper to purchase and operate than top-end GPUs


[20-Nov-18 04:50 AM] 📢Alex📢#0774

in the volume view)) and then compare with Btc😂


[20-Nov-18 04:53 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
200 vs 50 as far as block rewards will impact coin per block volume, yes; however, that has nothing to do with hw choice of mining


[20-Nov-18 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
with nicehash and other rentals, the entire premise about accessibilty is refuted


[20-Nov-18 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
and what percentage of mined coins that are sold immediate seems really a function of the miner and electric costs and not ASIC vs GPU. Unless there is some unknown hodl force that emanates from GPU

That is **literally** false, and silly


[20-Nov-18 04:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Any coin that blindly changed K & N values is merely praying that some ASIC manufacture doesn't add RAM and 3 variables to cgminer


[20-Nov-18 05:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
ASIC manufactures can, quite literally, add 10x more RAM to ASICs than any consumer GPU on the market (or even any GPU in the foreseeable future)


[20-Nov-18 05:02 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I promise you that if ZEC changes K, N, and the var string, ASIC manufactures will be prepared and current lack of demand is the only reason such ASICs aren't already being produced

Hi. We will be launching the Telegram channel soon. It is up and running but just in set up stage. We will have some designs to share with you shortly. The exchange is well ahead of schedule. We will finalise this set up before beginning a media ramp up and also further listings.


[21-Nov-18 07:26 PM] Machgielis#2406
We have also been nominated in a Twitter Gems tournament and been slated for an upcoming coinmarketcap.com listing. We need to finalise current exchange deals before this goes live.


[21-Nov-18 07:27 PM] Machgielis#2406
Thank you for following us early and pointing your miners to us. I think this could very well be a good decision in the very near future.

Thanks house, yes we will definitely be supporting Pirate. We plan to list all projects launched with Komodo before Zaddex exchange goes live.

Hi All. We want to start with a big thank you for believing in us early. Its been an amazing few weeks. We have been in contact with 3 of the top 10 exchanges relating to listing and we have an agreement already in place. However, this isnt a cheap process by any means, so we are determining how to raise the funds over the next 48 hours. This is testament that others see the value this project can bring and we have begun discussions with a number of other industry partners too. Please stay tuned for further updates.

There isnt enough liquidity in the coin yet.  There will be a partial payment in treasury coins from the founders fee but there is a substantial BTC requirement too. This is what we are working on now.

Hi Hossain, there are a few pools for ZEX including @That_Guy8 @Deleted User @Laviathon -bcmonster.com and @forkwitch I believe.


[12-Dec-18 07:06 AM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
We are on the new wallet.


[12-Dec-18 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to make sure all are updated with sapling support very soon


[12-Dec-18 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise not only will they go on a fork, they will keep the old chain alive


[12-Dec-18 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
and having a competing chain is always a bit messy

[12-Dec-18 08:38 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`I don’t know about the stratum protocol.`
It's not really the "protocol" that needs changed, but since nomp and all forks of it incorporate a transaction library into the stratum module, all such forks did/do need a stratum *module* update

As of right now I’m using black jokers 🃏.   I  don’t know if he is working on an update.   Would love to get the coin Merged into s-nomp get some more publicity.


[12-Dec-18 10:43 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
afaik, jokers "shouldn't" need any major update because of his work-around in how it creates blocks
as for putting it into s-nomp (rather than his implementation of z-nomp), I think that's a non-starter because of the reworking of payouts due to that same workaround

@ComputerGenie   I think we would need to set the config file like zen for example and it should in theory work....   for example.....   https://github.com/s-nomp/s-nomp/blob/master/coins/zen.json

I think it would do away with the mods he has implemented bypassing the Coinbase.


[12-Dec-18 12:15 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Laviathon -bcmonster.com for joker's version it's far more than just config (his has the ability to take pool % from the coinbase tx removed)


[12-Dec-18 12:16 PM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
Yea it just stops him from breaking the block on discovery.


[12-Dec-18 12:16 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
it needs a new payment system to store and account for the difference


[12-Dec-18 12:16 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
which also involves redis db changes


[12-Dec-18 12:23 PM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
@ComputerGenie I’m talking about making it an s-nomp coin.


[12-Dec-18 12:27 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
oh, I thought that your comment tagging me was in reference to my comment immediately above it
-----
I'm not sure about the "official" s-nomp, but I know that miketout's fork of it does work and the only config change off the top of my head is setting sapling height


[12-Dec-18 12:29 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
--------
My earlier comment about s-nomp was in relation to merging joker's cb format with s-nomp and that's where my head was at in the responses


[12-Dec-18 12:32 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
joker's format of implementing a usage of the daemon blocktemplate is because there isn't currently a transaction library that supports many of the assetchain features available and his is the current best public method for supporting the most assetchains in total


[12-Dec-18 12:42 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie I believe joker has pool fee working with his implementation


[12-Dec-18 12:42 PM] Alright#0419
just in a very different way than typical nomp payment processing


[12-Dec-18 12:43 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I thought he said he had, but my point was that afaik he used z-nomp as the base, which would create a ton of work to port into s-nomp


[12-Dec-18 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
really just boils down to whether or not we support s-nomp or knomp


[12-Dec-18 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
or both?


[12-Dec-18 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
not sure s-nomp would accept the changes


[12-Dec-18 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
well, it's no secret that my answer is "neither" 😛


[12-Dec-18 12:45 PM] Alright#0419
it's backwards compatible, but is a drastic change from typical stratum


[12-Dec-18 12:45 PM] Alright#0419
@ComputerGenie and what do you suggest?


[12-Dec-18 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
the same as I've said for a yr now:
"we need to start from the ground up and make a Komodo product for Komodo"


[12-Dec-18 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
since I'm alone in that voice, it's at least 6 months out


[12-Dec-18 03:33 PM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
S-nomp and its dependencies will work. It’s sapling enabled already.   Just need the coin config right I believe.


[12-Dec-18 03:51 PM] Alright#0419
@Laviathon -bcmonster.com just needs a bit of a tweak for the founder's reward


[12-Dec-18 07:28 PM] Laviathon -bcmonster.com#0462
@Alright besides just getting the coin config ironed out for the founders reward?


[12-Dec-18 07:29 PM] Alright#0419
should work if that does P2PKH at the exact amount in last coinbase vout


[12-Dec-18 07:29 PM] Alright#0419
I've been using joker's work around to make the daemon produce the coinbase, haven't tested existing founder's reward setups


[12-Dec-18 07:30 PM] Alright#0419
you can also edit transactions.js to make it pay the exact amount

Hi, when I try to send ZEX from my transparent address to my zs sapling address, I get error: invalid ZEX address. (agama 0.3.2a, windows) also when sending from a transparent addres to another transparent one, it creates a new address and leaves some zex there. I have 1 zex in suc address and it seems impossible to send it.

[21-Mar-19 10:33 AM] zaddex#2546
to answer few questions:
Here are some communication about where we are at.
The PLAN:
Zaddex will have its license in Estonia to operate its crypto to crypto and it crypto to fiat
we will list valuable and meaningful crypto projects with a priority to the komodo ecosystem asset chains
the fiat gateway will include mostly e wallet, instant disbursement (canada/us/australia); classic international wire and domestic wire (ach and sepa)
Zaddex will start support in beta SME launch via Launchpad in West AFrica - official release count down by official <10days
About ZEX we are considering and finalizing the details of an hard fork
As of today here will be the parameters
Supply reduce from 210mio to 100mio
Wallet will have to be updated
Hard fork will likely happen in April
Time to release properly
PoS/PoW: 92.23% - 7.77%
Rewards: 7.77% per year (dicreasing year 2 mechanically)
and 20mio dedicated to business dev , legal and marketing
Burn of coins corresponding to 7.77% per month of profit
The 60mio supply (100-mined supply)
Will be use for dev (33%) and business dev and legal (66.66%)
As of today we would like to also support margin trading of KMD but not sure need to make sure that it regulatory possible to do so
Pending final signature OCU (OUR) is the parent company of Zaddex (50% equity)
And will handle the ZEX assets
We have been consider transactional mining to promote the listed assets nothing fix as of today
Idea 💡 and contributions will be more than welcome
Tip bots will be put in place for both OUR and ZEX in the coming days
Thanks for your attention
Cheers 🥂 and please stay tuned

[30-Apr-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i cannot possible know every detail about every ecosystem project


[30-Apr-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and I am certainly not centrally managing all of them


[30-Apr-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
in fact, I am not managing them at all, the ecosystem projects are independent projects


[30-Apr-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
independent

Fabien was away for quite a while to work with Ivory Coast government. His extremely busy but gave a small update there 😃


[01-May-19 11:48 PM] cabera#9759
Yeah I saw the update @Crabby Paddy . I'm not suprised the licensing part is taking longer then expected for them when it comes to fiat  -> crypto. They should take help from me to speed things up when it comes to being compliant and applying the proper deposit/withdraw methods for the exchange 😃

And setpubkey to stake to single address. Otherwise using pos64staker will automatically stake rewards into optimal addresses

The Zaddex exchange has been down for the past few days, and seems to be abandoned by the team? Status is pretty unclear.

From Telegram: I  understand your concern, I am sorry that is happening, Redfox is in contact with de dev team that build zaddex which are the same that the one who build digital price back in the time. On our side we stop our involvement in day to day operation of the Centralized exchange long ago as we don’t see value and future for an xxxxxx other centralize exchange even with good markets and verticals. I know that Redfox been talking about giving part of zaddex to another partner-operator. On our side I think we have been more than clean and respectful of the community, offering a Zexo buy back and a real upgrade with DuneDex. That being said please don’t worry there was less than 2btc deposit and the dev team and Redfox has access to the exchange wallet (we don’t), I strongly believe that fund are safe and please know that worst case of worst case of worst case 2btc should not be much of a problem. I will still doing an AMA early next week. Thank you for remaining with us during this transition.

A few people have funds stuck on the now abandoned exchange and everyone is just passing the buck on who is responsible. In the end the users lose again.

Do you buy shoes often? 😂 @ComputerGenie 

Not sure what’s public or not at this stage, but from my personal understanding (however limited that is), his choice of path is the correct one. If all that’s been stated is true, then I see no other solution which would have been possible

Maybe 1 shoe for walking, 1 for sport, 1 for business? 😬
