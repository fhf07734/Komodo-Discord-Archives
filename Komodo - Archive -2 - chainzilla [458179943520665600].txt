is the air drop for people who voted for you?

No, I was actually never elected


[19-Jun-18 07:38 AM] PTYX#6840
It's for all Komodo users and registrations


[19-Jun-18 07:39 AM] PTYX#6840
I will release the details on the airdrop and how to sign up in the coming weeks

Airdrop based off amount of coins held? Or same for everyone/x amount for doing y actions


[19-Jun-18 08:29 AM] PTYX#6840
It will be a mix of both


[19-Jun-18 08:30 AM] PTYX#6840
I will release 10% of the supply through the faucets, and an airdrop to people who registered and verified their Komodo address. I'm still working on the scheme but I want the first round not to be based on the amount of tokens you have. So everyone would get the same in the first round.


[19-Jun-18 08:30 AM] PTYX#6840
That way we can spread it wide


[19-Jun-18 08:32 AM] PTYX#6840
After we deliver our first app and deliver our first project we will make a small ICO. Afterwards I will make a second round of airdrops which might be based on the amount of tokens someone holds. I'm not 100% yet because I'm still writing the distribution plan


[19-Jun-18 09:06 AM] BlackJesus#6161

just to clarify. in later airdrop rounds the amount of chainzilla tokens person receives depends on the amount of KMD in their address(es)? just KMD or something else also?


[19-Jun-18 04:13 PM] PTYX#6840
It's not defined yet. I will make the rules clear when I release the whitepaper.

Yes we will need those translations but let's wait until it's fully finished so we can get started. Do you have any samples for German?

Hello there, just finished a meeting with a director of IT school, they asked me to give lessons and educate master degree students about blockchain, and make practical cases. Any advice on how I could handle this ?
Basically I think I'll stick to just create a specific AC, then will show / help em learn basic commands and functionnality, but what would be the cost to get for example a dICO app running even with those test coins ?


[25-Jun-18 07:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
as the school has 3 locations in france, they may just ask me to deliver something that could be used in their whole group. I'm thinking about it and may launch something more official about resources, but I lack some points like app handling.


[25-Jun-18 07:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
(The AC basically wouldn't need to be notarized, but as you likely are able to deliver packages, I just prefer asking before reinventing the wheel)


[25-Jun-18 07:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
Potentially, this could lead me to teach in more and more IT schools, so I think I'd better have something well prepared than being on rush after it is launched


[25-Jun-18 07:51 AM] PTYX#6840
If it's for educational purposes a test chain that has its own version of Agama so that they students can send, receive, and test ztransactions.


[25-Jun-18 07:52 AM] PTYX#6840
The assetchain creation is very simple and all the documentation is available to teach them


[25-Jun-18 07:53 AM] PTYX#6840
@Deleted User let's coordinate a Skype or voice chat through here and I'll send you the pricing sheet afterwards


[25-Jun-18 07:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
It's 100% for educational purpose, to me, mass adoption begins with newcomers in IT industry. Just to show em what exists, and what is yet to be done. As I'll teach mainly to dev specialized, promoting some languages may lead em to become future contributors of any blockchain.


[25-Jun-18 07:58 AM] Chipmoon#7477
is chainzilla the right place to be if a coin is interested in getting notarized?


[25-Jun-18 07:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
this is a long run project, as the classes would only begin around january 2019 (2nd year of master degree), so I'm not in a rush at all, but I prefer asking here :). @PTYX I'll PM you this week and we'll be able to discuss it. Thanks


[25-Jun-18 08:01 AM] PTYX#6840

Which type of coin?


[25-Jun-18 08:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
(The thing is that school hires contractors which works for other IT schools, so potentially, as other groups already gave me projects for their big data courses infrastructure, I may end up teaching there too, and so on)

@PTYX  how KOMODO will benefit from chainzilla and Chainzilla from KOMODO?


[25-Jun-18 12:41 PM] PTYX#6840
We will add value to Komodo by redesigning and peer reviewing all the apps. Seeking appstore approval after the redesigns. Also, we are in a constant search for companies and institutions that want to use blockchain but haven't been able to implement it. Every chain that ChainZilla adds to Komodo adds value to the DPoW layer. We will also become one of the first second-tier notarization layer on the platform to provide a different security options for different types of chains.


[25-Jun-18 12:44 PM] PTYX#6840
ChainZilla benefits from Komodo's open source tech. As we will benefit from QTum's and NEM's. The premier contracts that chainzilla is seeking plan to bring on the new types of projects to Komodo. Even though we offer different blockchain products we believe the best minimum viable blockchain can be created on Komodo. So that's what we will make our primary weapon.


[25-Jun-18 12:50 PM] PTYX#6840
ChainZilla is the business layer built on top of Komodo and othee open source tech

@jspook16 in January more or less we will run a small ICO round to fund the expansion of the Agama wallet we are redesigning now. The plan is to make an airdrop, deliver one app, one premium project, and then ICO. Afterwards I will make a second round of airdrops. I am working on the airdrop schemes now and will release the lite paper and our website 1.2 in the coming week.

[12-Jul-18 04:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] so we capture it in the snapshot


[12-Jul-18 04:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[Cryptodamus#6225] My timing has been bad today


[12-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] to qualify for the snapshot you have to have a minimum of 500 KMD in your address


[12-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] the 1 million zilla will be distrubted among those addresses based on balance


[12-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] The address which holds zilla?


[12-Jul-18 04:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] whichever address you want brother


[12-Jul-18 04:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] as long as it's a Komodo address of cvourse


[12-Jul-18 04:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Ok for all the new people, here's the deal with the airdrops: 

There are two types of airdrops for $ZILLA
1) Discord Airdrops

PTYX will initiate the command and then you just need to reply with your Zilla address generated from your agama wallet. These airdrops happen randomly throughout the day. 

2) Holding $KMD in your agama wallet.

There is an airdrop for KMD holders if they hold more than 500 KMD in their Agama wallet. The amount of zilla received will depend on total number of wallets and KMD held. 1M coins will be split between these holders. The snapshot for this airdrop is august 15th and coins are distributed about two weeks later.


[12-Jul-18 04:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] the discord mini drops don't have anything to do with the main drop


[12-Jul-18 04:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] So people who never heard of zilla yet have a balance greater than 500 will get the airdrop?


[12-Jul-18 04:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] the first one yes


[12-Jul-18 04:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] there are 2 airdrops if you look at the litepaper


[12-Jul-18 04:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] the second one will require a registration


[12-Jul-18 04:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Ah, might get some dahmpage there


[12-Jul-18 04:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Gotcha


[12-Jul-18 04:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] i doubt it since there won't be places to dahmp


[12-Jul-18 04:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Bdex


[12-Jul-18 04:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] but that's up to the market to decide.

[12-Jul-18 04:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Litepaper link?


[12-Jul-18 04:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cye#9860] @PTYX ok so KMD must be held on AGAMA wallet for snapshot and not in Guarda¬† Komodo Wallet, is that correct?


[12-Jul-18 04:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] if you can export your guarda privatekey which i'm sure you can, then you can hold it in guarda


[12-Jul-18 04:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] you can export your privatekey and use it in Agama to see your zilla after the drop

[martiniblanco#4080] What does experimental mean? Is it save to use?


[12-Jul-18 04:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] And also eligible for airdrop and zilla?


[12-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Gordon Komodo#7477] I have used it a few times just to check my balance. So far no problem for me. Yes, it is eligible, because the fund in stored in the blockchain, as long as you have access to the private key of the address that have the fund, you can access the airdrop as well.


[12-Jul-18 05:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] Team members normally recommend  only putting a small amount on the web wallet. I've never heard of any issues though.

[PTYX#6840] but i cannot filter all of them


[12-Jul-18 05:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] some are known, others aren't

[Hollowman9000#3344] Gotcha


[12-Jul-18 05:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Good point  @Hollowman9000


[12-Jul-18 05:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Is there a functioning rich list anywhere?


[12-Jul-18 05:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] I wonder what percentage of the total supply exists in addresses <500


[12-Jul-18 05:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] TotSup - (known exchange addresses) - (sum of KMD in <500 addresses)


[12-Jul-18 05:14 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Rough guesstimate what the amount is eligible for the airdrop so far?


[12-Jul-18 05:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] I think 5 ish was the number.


[12-Jul-18 05:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cye#9860] @PTYX If I posted my KMD Wallet Address from Guarda Wallet for the 1 Zilla airdrop would I have lost that 1 Zilla that was won?


[12-Jul-18 05:16 PM] PTYX#6840
as long as you can export the privatekey you will be able to access it.


[12-Jul-18 05:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] The wallet you use is simply how you access that address


[12-Jul-18 05:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cye#9860] Ok cool


[12-Jul-18 05:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] The privkey can be stuck into any wallet


[12-Jul-18 05:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Not sure how nano works


[12-Jul-18 05:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Can you export priv keys from them or are you stuck with trusting it?


[12-Jul-18 05:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] guarda is a non-custodial wallet. They let users hold their privatkeys. Coinomi does too


[12-Jul-18 05:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] that means they can take those privatekeys and import them into another wallet.


[12-Jul-18 05:23 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] Thanks for help to all.
atomicexplorer wallet let me export priv keys also or not?


[12-Jul-18 05:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] the webwallet is a version of Agama so I believe so yes but I haven't done much testing on the web wallet


[12-Jul-18 05:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[webworker01#3884] Probably need to make sure your 500KMD is actually in one address, as the wallet will display and combine balances in multiple addresses


[12-Jul-18 05:32 PM] Atlaszka#2910
Will Larger Nano addresses able to participate in the airdrop?


[12-Jul-18 05:34 PM] Atlaszka#2910
Or claim Zilla later from Ledger addresses I mean


[12-Jul-18 05:39 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] @Ptyx thx. It's possible with both wallets. It's called WIF keys on Agama web wallet and only seen when wallet is active


[12-Jul-18 05:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] Could you send a Zilla to check it?
Appreciate it.

[goldenman#7301] 500kmd = 1 share = 1 ZILLA ?


[12-Jul-18 05:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] no


[12-Jul-18 05:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] üòï


[12-Jul-18 05:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] (Your share / total eligible shares) * 1,000,000 zilla


[12-Jul-18 05:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] one share means one portion of the 1 million that is equaly divided based on the balance of addresses above 500 KMD.


[12-Jul-18 05:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] it seems no matter how we word it, people are confused


[12-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] I figured 5% KMD supply below <500 per account per earlier discussion


[12-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Take another 15% on known exchange accounts


[12-Jul-18 05:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] So


[12-Jul-18 06:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hollowman9000#3344] Your balance / 84,000,000 KMD


[12-Jul-18 06:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] 500kmd = 5 ish ZIlla. 1000kmd = about 10 ish ZIlla. Something like that. At least from the discussion so far.


[12-Jul-18 06:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[12-Jul-18 08:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I didn't have 500 kmd


[12-Jul-18 08:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Ok for all the new people, here's the deal with the airdrops: 

There are two types of airdrops for $ZILLA
1) Discord Airdrops

PTYX will initiate the command and then you just need to reply with your Zilla address generated from your agama wallet. These airdrops happen randomly throughout the day. 

2) Holding $KMD in your agama wallet.

There is an airdrop for KMD holders if they hold more than 500 KMD in their Agama wallet. The amount of zilla received will depend on total number of wallets and KMD held. 1M coins will be split between these holders. The snapshot for this airdrop is august 15th and coins are distributed about two weeks later.


[12-Jul-18 08:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] The last one was at 4 am


[12-Jul-18 08:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[12-Jul-18 08:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] Whats the process of what wallets get drops?


[12-Jul-18 08:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] We trying to exclude exchange wallets? Jumblr funds, DEX funds, SuperNET, etc?


[12-Jul-18 08:40 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] Just between Jumblr, BOTS, and SuperNET, that's  5,697,750 KMD


[12-Jul-18 08:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[deathsgrip#5269] I would guess only if it‚Äôs in the agama wallet at time of snapshot


[12-Jul-18 08:55 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] also is it balance, or UTXO based @PTYX


[12-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Balance


[12-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I have a ton of btch


[12-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Balance in one address not multiple


[12-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Does that count?


[12-Jul-18 08:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[webworker01#3884] you can swap on bdex


[12-Jul-18 08:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[webworker01#3884] pretty sure it's going to be looking just at kmd üòÉ


[12-Jul-18 08:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I can't swap


[12-Jul-18 08:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] No one's buying


[12-Jul-18 09:01 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] and PTYX is it safe to say roughly 5 Zilla per 500 KMD?


[12-Jul-18 09:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[goldenman#7301] roughly yes. would be more Zillas than it according to number of less 500 KMD addresses.


[12-Jul-18 09:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Cool

[12-Jul-18 09:43 PM] PTYX#6840
Let's not distribute that yet


[12-Jul-18 09:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[PTYX#6840] When people see the graphic here they automatically assume it's valid. Also this channel is linked to the Komodo discord so it's not a good place to distribute graphics without approval. I can't delete messages on the Komodo side

you don't need to move your funds from ledger if you only desire to receive zilla airdop
priv keys will be required only when you'd like to move zilla somewhere else
however if you follow the above scenario make sure to record pub address that holds your kmd at the time of the airdrop
also, you are not required to install or use agama at all
generate an address from the paper wallet then make a deposit

[CryptoNoob8[BuyTheFuckingMN]#1300] Are there any instructions on how to become eligible for the airdrop?


[13-Jul-18 04:25 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @Unknown just hold your KMD (500min) in some wallet that is not on exchange

[13-Jul-18 07:34 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] Robert is right in the sense that to evaluate ICO's many people look mainly at the team. But I think a good team with 7 members is better than an average team with 20 members (or only 2 good members among them).


[13-Jul-18 07:34 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[Cryptoon#3362] Bittrex has a wallet where it holds all the kmd it's members has


[13-Jul-18 08:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] So if that wallet also gets an airdrop, bittrex get's to keep the zilla üòÉ


[13-Jul-18 08:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] That is what I meant


[13-Jul-18 08:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] My understanding is that they will eliminate those addresses so that we get more of the 1 million Zilla


[13-Jul-18 08:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Roger, that was what I was wondering


[13-Jul-18 08:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] I always assume a lot of people still keep their coins on an exchange


[13-Jul-18 08:17 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Lil komodo#3487] How can you tell what addresses are exchange addresses o:


[13-Jul-18 08:17 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] I think the team knows most exchange adresses


[13-Jul-18 08:20 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] @Deleted User  I don't know how they can tell but I thought I caught yesterday somebody mentioning exchanges would be excluded


[13-Jul-18 08:23 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] On the conversation about team  members earlier.  Several things to remember:

1. It's very new
2. They are not trying to create a new blockchain, but help others launch on already completed platforms.

They will be creating or improving interfaces though which will take some talented Devs, so I'm sure it will grow over time.

[yorklab#7270] IN the Litepaper:
 "Chainzilla became the first company to remove the barrier for other businesses
that are beginning to engage with blockchain tech or are interesting (interested) in migrating
altogether. "


[13-Jul-18 10:16 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] I know this is minor, but might as well alert you to it.

In the Raodmap under Phase 2:
"noterizations, I document storage (IPFS)" Need a an extra space before "I"

Also, I've never heard of IPFS revered to as "I document storage", but then I'm not well versed on that subject.

[Robert Naus#9564] so in theory u can sell and buy Zilla on barrtedex already and we are way over 5 months before ICO even launches..so much flexibility if u think about it

[13-Jul-18 04:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] The tough part is liquidity on exchanges afterwards. Oot is having this problem now, being on a big exchange isn't enough there needs to be some sellers and volume. As for how we do that. Not sure yet


[13-Jul-18 04:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Im selling some ETH and BTC to get to 500KMD .. tell me i'm not nuts..


[13-Jul-18 04:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @Regnar do atomic swaps actually count into trading volume?


[13-Jul-18 04:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Its still a trade


[13-Jul-18 04:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Just a different mechanism


[13-Jul-18 04:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] They do on dexs but they likely show up as regular transactions on main chains


[13-Jul-18 04:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] CEXs trading volume is limited to coin balances on exchanges. Which if no one deposits....


[13-Jul-18 04:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] So being listed on exchanges will only get us so far if sellers don't sell

[13-Jul-18 04:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] I think when we look at upside potential, KMD is a great bet compared to eth and btc


[13-Jul-18 04:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Probably 70% of my portfolio now

[Robert Naus#9564] I am not worried once market picks up everything will go up,people will jim on again and this time more cherry-picking ensues so KMD will get much more investors and whole Komodo asset will grow alongside


[13-Jul-18 04:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[Robert Naus#9564] @TheHaddock why don‚Äôt u send directly to agama and then swap for kmd?

[PTYX#6840] to increase liquidity you have to give a user a reason to buy and sell


[13-Jul-18 04:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] if we all hold, we will lose steam eventually


[13-Jul-18 04:23 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Our clients must buy Zilla to pay for our services. We can accept other types of payments but that will be our go-to payment option. This should give our coin a use.


[13-Jul-18 04:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I also thought that when we create the jumblr app, we add a requirement to have a bit of zilla in the wallet


[13-Jul-18 04:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Notarizations will give KMD the same type of use


[13-Jul-18 04:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] you need KMD to notarize and to fulfill contracts


[13-Jul-18 04:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] and to Jumblr too.


[13-Jul-18 04:25 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] that would work


[13-Jul-18 04:26 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] and with wider adoption, once the ball starts rolling we're gonna be good fo sure


[13-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I will come up with ways of giving it utility and encouraging circulation


[13-Jul-18 04:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I thought that projects that launch on ChainZilla could offer airdrops or benefits to Komodo and Zilla holders.


[13-Jul-18 04:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] things of that sort also add value

[AkiraX#8269] How can we get more chainzilla


[13-Jul-18 05:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] either wait for the ICO or get more KMD before the snapshot. There are orders on HyperDEX too.


[13-Jul-18 05:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The second and final round of airdrops won't be executed until after we ICO and it will require a registration. It won't be balance based most likely.

[13-Jul-18 05:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] around 0.0096 per kmd taking into account the entire supply


[13-Jul-18 05:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Wow. So the 6 chain zilla j got from this airdrop is quite ralot


[13-Jul-18 05:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Thanks


[13-Jul-18 05:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] But in sure people have like 5+87$!#;_# if knd

[13-Jul-18 05:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I'm driving


[13-Jul-18 05:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] zilla supply is low so yes it can be considered a good amount


[13-Jul-18 05:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] More discord airdrops through the month?


[13-Jul-18 05:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] yes, up until the main airdrop


[13-Jul-18 05:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] then we begin our referal and bounty campaign


[13-Jul-18 05:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] users that bring us projects that we sign will get a percentage and so forth


[13-Jul-18 05:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Does it stake?


[13-Jul-18 05:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] no, it's mineable but the reward is very small. 0.0001 per block


[13-Jul-18 05:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Can we mine it now?


[13-Jul-18 05:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] yes, anyone can with this string: ./komodod -ac_name=ZILLA -ac_supply=11000000 -addnode=54.39.23.248 -gen &


[13-Jul-18 05:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] it's a Komodo chain so it's on demand blocks


[13-Jul-18 05:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] the more transactions take place, the more blocks are processed


[13-Jul-18 05:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] In running veris wallet most of the time


[13-Jul-18 05:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Can I do it with that one?


[13-Jul-18 05:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] no, you would need to run the string on the command line.


[13-Jul-18 05:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] for us mining isn't a priority like for verus


[13-Jul-18 05:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] since our security is derived from the dpow

[14-Jul-18 07:33 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[glc#8243] Should i have a agama wallet? Or erc20 address is ok?


[14-Jul-18 07:33 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] Agama


[14-Jul-18 07:34 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] You need a Komodo address. You can add both KMD and ZILLA in Lite mode to Agama wallet


[14-Jul-18 07:35 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[glc#8243] Ok thanks


[14-Jul-18 07:35 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] you're welcome. It's a great wallet


[14-Jul-18 07:35 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[glc#8243] When will the airdrop is over?


[14-Jul-18 07:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[glc#8243] I will check


[14-Jul-18 07:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] If you have 500KMD you apply for the real airdrop.
Smaller airdrops are done here daily i think at suprise times üòÉ


[14-Jul-18 07:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Tort#9226] how do you apply?


[14-Jul-18 07:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Tort#9226] I have well over 500 kmd 8)


[14-Jul-18 07:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Think if you are commited to those daily airdrops that you can get more than the main airdrop.


[14-Jul-18 07:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] then you apply. More information will follow here I think


[14-Jul-18 07:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] Possible


[14-Jul-18 07:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] @Tort maybe you automatically get ZILLA in August. Or maybe we should register. I think autmatically


[14-Jul-18 07:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KomodoBo#8264] Best to have coins in Agama

[14-Jul-18 07:39 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] Hold your Komodo in an agama wallet minimum 500. Nothing else to do for the first main airdrop

[14-Jul-18 07:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] How to store kmd in cold storage?
I only have ledger


[14-Jul-18 07:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] But i think agama is secure


[14-Jul-18 07:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If you have a ledger with 500 or more KMD you will be included in the snapshot. however, you will need to export the privatekey of that particular address in the future to access your funds in Agama or our standalone wallet when it's released


[14-Jul-18 07:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] No need to apply, just keep in the Agama wallet


[14-Jul-18 07:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @TheHaddock I think it‚Äôs as secure as it can be, when u got your keys u good


[14-Jul-18 07:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[14-Jul-18 08:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Yeah you download the new version of the zip file. Then you extract and run. Then when prompted select reinstall current version


[14-Jul-18 08:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Itll show it uninstalling the old version and then reinstalling the new one, but your wallet remains intact even if its uninstalled

[Cryptodamus#6225] No problem, want more people involved!


[14-Jul-18 08:27 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] so once this is done i open my usualy KMD in native and i see Zilla too in there ? or do i need to activate zilla seperately ?


[14-Jul-18 08:27 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] No you select activate coin and zilla will be in the dropdown


[14-Jul-18 08:27 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] oh ok


[14-Jul-18 08:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Then just copy paste your zilla address and back it up somewhere


[14-Jul-18 08:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Then when PTYX initiates an airdrop, you can just copy paste your address in here and you'll get some $ZILLA

[Mastermind#1578] @Deleted User thanks i am using native mode though i got the setps to activate coins but was wondering if ill be downloaded whole chain data again ?


[14-Jul-18 08:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i am currently on the popup which says " do you want to uninstall agama and all its modules ? "


[14-Jul-18 08:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[DJ-Crypto#8569] Native mode should download the whole chain, however if you had one previously downloaded it should pick that up and run with whats already there. If windows app data is not stored in program files so if you uninstall or remove all modules it should not delete wallet data etc. To be safe open up a file explorer in windows and type in %appdata% look for the folder for agama and backkup/copy first to a safe location usb stick etc.


[14-Jul-18 08:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Yes the chain state files remain iirc


[14-Jul-18 08:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Which means itll only have to resync for like 15-20 minutes


[14-Jul-18 08:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i have backed up wallet but not chain data though


[14-Jul-18 08:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i dont want to download the whole thing again my net sucks


[14-Jul-18 08:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Maybe less


[14-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] it worked üòÉ thanks


[14-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] so if i activate zilla on native it will use the chain data already there from kmd ? or download it again seperately ?


[14-Jul-18 08:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[DJ-Crypto#8569] @Mastermind will use what is already there, however it has to resync/verify and that will take a while to complete but not as long as a download of the entire chain.


[14-Jul-18 09:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] thanks üòÉ or i can use lite for zilla but i think as i already have kmd chain data i can go with native itself

[14-Jul-18 09:03 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i dont know about what exactly that means


[14-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[DJ-Crypto#8569] none means foreground = keep the app open/updates  background = it runs without being a "active window, so minimize it"


[14-Jul-18 09:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] oh gotcha

[bogybogy#3962] @TheHaddock I'm from Eastern Europe (Romania)my advice have a short trip if you would like to visit Ukraine and do a research there,is not easy and contracts are not the best when you rent something,better buy a house and build your own place and move your mining rigs

The only issue I see in the Ukrain is coruption,curuption kills everywhere the business and, everywhere you find great people and to mention that  Russians can come ocuppy Ukraine is just misleading, Ukraine is sovereign country and the issue what they have   the part lost is more complicated and we get involved in story's where we don't have enough information for reality

[bogybogy#3962] Logical decentralization has the zero probability of system failure and can tolerate any accidental faults in the system. A attack aimed at disestablishing the system will have minimal or null effect on it. Lastly, a local system cannot act independently which also maximize the efficiency of the decentralized system as a whole.

[PTYX#6840] we are Komodos, not geckos. Komodos don't console each other

[Bo#8264] Is it a problem for you guys that some people (like me) are watching this discord closely?
I haveit open in a tab on my PC all the time, during soccer and whatever.
Also I have discord on my phone with notifications on, for when I'm on the road.
On both I have the KMD address in memory for fast pasting if the airdrop happens.


[15-Jul-18 05:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] This question is for @PTYX and @Deleted User

[15-Jul-18 06:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @Deleted User @Steve10 there is no problem in being fast. The problem is with sock puppet accounts. People who never wrote a comment, and suddenly are the first at every round.


[15-Jul-18 06:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Deleted User or do you mean you want to monitor in a more official basis?


[15-Jul-18 06:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] I see, I couldn't make a sockpuppet account if I wanted to


[15-Jul-18 06:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] @PTYX I don't know. That's not what I meant right now.
But by @Deleted User 's reactions up here it seemed he was not happy. Or was he just checking the bots?

[djithbit#3171] Oops ... sry


[15-Jul-18 06:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] make 1 bigger airdrop and at the end


[15-Jul-18 06:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] this is the best solution


[15-Jul-18 06:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[Emmanuel#5426] @Deleted User it's ok if you are fast and always win. Just take part in the community, those accounts banned never wrote a comment, new to Discord... Even if legit, they were doing 0 favor to this community.


[15-Jul-18 06:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[yorklab#7270] Just now reading more ChainZilla material. I really like the direction this is going. Business oriented, setting it up to meet Govt Regs, getting real-world business involved. Setting it up for a great chance at becoming very successful .


[15-Jul-18 09:13 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] chainzilla and similar companies/projects are invaluable for Komodo ecosystem. komodo is the foundation and now it's getting ready for stuff being built on top of it


[15-Jul-18 09:14 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] @siu is doing a nice job with his cainmakers project also


[15-Jul-18 09:19 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] I agree about Siu's Chainmakers; they have already helped a few customers, and I'm sure they have more. Any third part project that can help Komodo grow works for me.

[15-Jul-18 02:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] I remember when the internet came out. I was like why would anyone need that? Ain't making the same mistake again. I think crypto is even bigger.

[15-Jul-18 02:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @KLMJ1 forget internet i said the same thing about computers before and i didnt have my own laptop till i was 29, i was very hostile to any new technology back in the days, but  blockchain is something else entirely, but than again, its possible that the result will be the same as with any technology that was suppose to "free" people , so to speak


[15-Jul-18 02:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] What is scary is if USA have their own coin and do away with paper money.


[15-Jul-18 02:25 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[KLMJ1#2767] Total control. Could even decide what shops you could use.

[crumb#2550] not necessary


[16-Jul-18 03:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[Regnar#6164] @cheeweon  The coin is used for various processes on ChainZilla including paying for it's services. The Zilla chain will serve multiple purposes including
as a second layer of dPoW, KV storage, voting, and as a currency medium to
pay for ChainZilla services.

[16-Jul-18 06:46 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Not sure how one can prevent a faucet being abused like that though.


[16-Jul-18 06:50 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] And this is why real people like myself can't even get 0.1 Zilla from the faucet because it's constantly saying it's down...damn bots. I've tried the faucet every day and it only worked twice!


[16-Jul-18 06:52 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] It works every day for me


[16-Jul-18 06:53 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] I have not used any bot, do not accuse me without proof


[16-Jul-18 06:54 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] You could answer Robert's question then


[16-Jul-18 06:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] @castle32 explain this transaction then: http://explorer.chainzilla.io/tx/a08aeee21444267a90d047f45f0135077d72f2f52448f24df2cbcd347f2d5af0


[16-Jul-18 06:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] I do not have to give explanations about the exchange of cryptocurrency or the addresses that I have and have used manually.


[16-Jul-18 06:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] All these payments were made in one block


[16-Jul-18 06:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] so in one transaction


[16-Jul-18 06:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Good luck being able to do that manually


[16-Jul-18 06:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] The boy worked for $ 82.25


[16-Jul-18 06:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[16-Jul-18 06:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] If they have been done that way they have been to save commissions the sellers with whom I have negotiated. Those who do use bots and nobody says anything are the ones who put the address in the airdrops.

[16-Jul-18 07:00 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] I am very smart, thanks


[16-Jul-18 07:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] and on the developer's site, I would block this address and return funds for the faucet


[16-Jul-18 07:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] Was there any zilla paid out for chainzilla related services yet? I see no other way to have some beside being on team.


[16-Jul-18 07:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] As I said

[16-Jul-18 07:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] look at this transaction to his address


[16-Jul-18 07:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] 30KMD for 100Zilla. Deal?


[16-Jul-18 07:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] It's all transactions of 0,1 zilla


[16-Jul-18 07:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] So he's just exploiting the faucet


[16-Jul-18 07:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] yup


[16-Jul-18 07:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @Unknown greed is fine,it fuels progress and innovation but theft and fraud not.


[16-Jul-18 07:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Anyway, I wouldn't buy them just so we don't support this kind of behavior


[16-Jul-18 07:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] block address


[16-Jul-18 07:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Nah dont block address, that would be blockchain censorship, which I also don't like


[16-Jul-18 07:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @Cryptoon are u saying he is able to basically steal fractions of zilla somehow?


[16-Jul-18 07:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] The censors of cryptocurrency, the immutability of transactions and decentralization you leave it at home


[16-Jul-18 07:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] @Deleted User just create 100s of adresses, claim 0,1KMD with each of the adresses with the faucet


[16-Jul-18 07:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Transfer all to one adress and try to sell


[16-Jul-18 07:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] It's not really stealing per se


[16-Jul-18 07:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] and later people say that the project did not take off and there were scams and frauds


[16-Jul-18 07:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Just not really ethical


[16-Jul-18 07:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] 'exploiting the system'

[vtestcoin#9955] I have not stolen anything, I have bought and used the faucet with my directions manually and who says something else that proves what it says


[16-Jul-18 07:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] It's up to the maintainers of the faucet to have an opinion and take action if they want


[16-Jul-18 07:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] nice chainzilla promotion


[16-Jul-18 07:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] He might have bought the ICO.....


[16-Jul-18 07:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] the ico isnt live yet


[16-Jul-18 07:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] Else, explain how he exlpoited the faucet


[16-Jul-18 07:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] so no.

[16-Jul-18 07:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] I don‚Äôt like this, this should not be possible really,since it is,not much u can do but shouldn‚Äôt be.


[16-Jul-18 07:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Look at this transaction that went into his address


[16-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] 230 transactions of 0,1 zilla


[16-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] Let the guy be. Go exploit too


[16-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] To his main adress


[16-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Are you in on it too?


[16-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Otherwise you can see why this is not really a good way to behave


[16-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] he still wanted to sell here üòÑ


[16-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] funny ppl here LOL


[16-Jul-18 07:07 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[caex#1831] 82,25$ üòÑ


[16-Jul-18 07:08 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] not really fair for people that want to legitimately claim the faucet with one address


[16-Jul-18 07:08 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] But bump into an empty faucet


[16-Jul-18 07:08 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Because some guys are exploiting it like this


[16-Jul-18 07:08 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] That's why it's a topic.


[16-Jul-18 07:08 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] ok


[16-Jul-18 07:08 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] Has the bot airdrop ended here?


[16-Jul-18 07:08 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] Stop accusing, you have no evidence, I have not done anything that is bad, I have claimed as any user in my directions manually the reward of the faucet and I can pass if the owners of the faucet wanted a record of how I made it manually, as well as the purchase agreements I've made, so shut up

[16-Jul-18 07:09 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] it's a valid discussion i think


[16-Jul-18 07:09 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] This is evidence?


[16-Jul-18 07:09 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] There are 235 payments in one transaction, there is not way to do this manually


[16-Jul-18 07:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] That is not proof of absolutely nothing, just that to save commissions I have made the transactions together


[16-Jul-18 07:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] 251 payments, sorry


[16-Jul-18 07:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] PTYX appears, let it block this address and faucet


[16-Jul-18 07:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] that all


[16-Jul-18 07:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] If there is a genius, it is called having the Zilla wallet in native mode where you can do that completely manually, stop accusing without having any idea of ‚Äã‚Äãhow it works.


[16-Jul-18 07:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] to check and explain


[16-Jul-18 07:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] To more than one of here it seems that he would like the centralization and modify the transactions to his liking, it seems that they do not understand what the blockchain is, very sad ...


[16-Jul-18 07:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Cryptoon - Today at 16:03
Nah dont block address, that would be blockchain censorship, which I also don't like


[16-Jul-18 07:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Is what I said here


[16-Jul-18 07:13 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] I just said it wasnt ethical


[16-Jul-18 07:13 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] The only evidence you provide is transactions, which do not prove that the addresses of origin are mine or that have not been claimed manually, therefore you only say absurd conspiracies


[16-Jul-18 07:13 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] @castle32  Maybe you did it by hand but the point is that you wanted to sell it here


[16-Jul-18 07:14 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[caex#1831] you're smart


[16-Jul-18 07:14 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] I know nothing about how it all works but u simply abusing it. Fine u can do that, get away with it but don‚Äôt play some kinda hero bcs u just little weasel that just can‚Äôt play fair.


[16-Jul-18 07:14 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[vtestcoin#9955] I want to sell them because I prefer to have KMD that Zilla that give me more liquidity to exchange

[16-Jul-18 02:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] The thing about that is, everything in life is technically open source and can be copied, but we still give much more weight to the things that are done by professionals because they can fix things when they break, know the ins and outs, and have the knowledge to apply the right tools where they belong


[16-Jul-18 02:22 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] obviously we have copyrights, but i'm talking about services


[16-Jul-18 02:23 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] anyone can copy techniques that consultants use. or copy techniques that carpenters, mechanics, artists, or anything, but having the blue prints isn't enough.


[16-Jul-18 02:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] 1st mover advantage is the key


[16-Jul-18 02:24 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] Blockchain as a Service is about the people who intimately know the chains, and process, and know the code, providing not just the code as a product, but their expertise as a service. that is valuable


[16-Jul-18 02:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We are looking at protecting our process and some of our tech like the closed source ico website.


[16-Jul-18 02:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Aroc, the IP law firm is helping us with that


[16-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] At least in Latam because we do have first movers advantage in the region.


[16-Jul-18 02:43 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Speaking of which, We have a meeting tomorrow with NEMs Latam division. If we come to terms then we will become their first official provider.


[16-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Not_Sure#4240] Latam? as in Latin America?


[16-Jul-18 02:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Yes

[DaveArcher#1032] A pun in Spanish


[16-Jul-18 03:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[DaveArcher#1032] an 'INCA' coin has as it's smallest division the 'Picchu'


[16-Jul-18 03:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[DaveArcher#1032] so an INCA is worth "mucho Picchu"

[djithbit#3171] Cool to hear that things aren't so straightforward to be copied or stolen ... i fear chinese a lot..


[16-Jul-18 11:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] As they basically copied the world and even informed own population about the great chinese inventions.
Almost had to puke..


[17-Jul-18 02:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] It's not the code that has the most value


[17-Jul-18 02:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] It has some value


[17-Jul-18 02:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] But it's mostly the people implementing it that create value


[17-Jul-18 02:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] see for example SAFECOIN which basically just copy pasted KMD


[17-Jul-18 02:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] But in a very poor way


[17-Jul-18 02:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Their chain got attacked several times because they did not understand the code


[17-Jul-18 02:23 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] so even though kmd is open source, you need to know what you are doing


[17-Jul-18 02:23 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Good for them üòÇ


[17-Jul-18 02:23 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] You would need to study every aspect of the ecosystem for months/years to completely understand it the way @PTYX and team for example understand the ecosystem


[17-Jul-18 02:23 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] True.. i just learned how to operate a linux terminal.. sudo and get etc.. so many new things i learned..


[17-Jul-18 02:24 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] To start coding and be a dev .. i will need some reincarnations

[Cryptoon#3362] I read in kmd chat that jl777 was looking for an apprentice some time ago, but he required some understanding of C


[17-Jul-18 02:26 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] C++ looks interesting..


[17-Jul-18 02:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Im willing to learn it maybe.

Was thinking of doing webservice.. hosting websites on servers.
But surely that domain is far too competitive


[17-Jul-18 02:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] There is datacamp, I think they offer courses


[17-Jul-18 02:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Belgium located


[17-Jul-18 02:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Mostly for data science though, might not have C courses

[djithbit#3171] Fun game this airdrops :)
Receiving the coin before ico even.. woehaaa üòÄ
Never been there üòÇ


[17-Jul-18 02:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Zilla ico peice same as kmd? 0.1$


[17-Jul-18 03:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] 0,5 I think


[17-Jul-18 03:30 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] total ZILLA supply is going to be 11 million, so if we take the $0.5 price then initial 5.5 million marketcap would give us a lot of potential upside. compared to projects with hundreds of millions marketcap straight out of the gate


[17-Jul-18 03:30 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[blubbi#0643] 0,45$ in ICO


[17-Jul-18 03:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] so 4.5 million cap. even better üòÉ


[17-Jul-18 03:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[blubbi#0643] 0,35$ in private Pre-ICO


[17-Jul-18 03:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[blubbi#0643] 1MIll there


[17-Jul-18 03:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] 11 mio coins only? At 0.5$ ico? 
Ow man!!...


[17-Jul-18 03:32 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] ICO is going to be only 4 million. 11 is the total with multiple (two) rounds of airdrops

[George#8986] PTYX I have 1 question about chainzilla


[17-Jul-18 05:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[George#8986] so can any one, without any programming skills create a blockchain with the chainzilla platform?


[17-Jul-18 05:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If pass our initial interview yes


[17-Jul-18 05:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I don't condone launching blockchains for people with lack of teams to provide it maintenance, community, or utility.


[17-Jul-18 05:39 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[George#8986] Ye sounds logical


[17-Jul-18 05:41 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[George#8986] But wont people say its not true decentralized if you can decide who gets to create a blockchain?


[17-Jul-18 05:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] chainzilla is just helping with the process to create your stuff on komodo, nem, erc20, qtum platforms


[17-Jul-18 05:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] you don't have to use them.  chainzilla is not going to be a blockchain platform on it's own in a traditional sense. they just help companies/projects to apply it to their specific situation


[17-Jul-18 05:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's never meant to be decentralized


[17-Jul-18 05:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We are a company


[17-Jul-18 05:46 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] And we provide a service to other businesses. We use decentralized technology to create the blockchains and apps for our clients but the process of choosing our clients is not decentralized


[17-Jul-18 05:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We must adhere to strict rules. We must know who we are building for and where the funds are coming from. Our clients go through a KYC process.


[17-Jul-18 05:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Just out of curiosity.. how many hours a day are kmd and zilla devs dedicating towards the projects.. coding etc.. must be enormous no? üò±

[PTYX#6840] We are doing airdrops in temporary channels now


[17-Jul-18 05:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] it was not here it was in bounty2 section


[17-Jul-18 05:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] My address is alway on standby. I mistakenly press "enter" at times


[17-Jul-18 05:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] to deter the terminators


[17-Jul-18 05:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] once the drop is done, the channel is deleted


[17-Jul-18 05:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] lol


[17-Jul-18 05:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] it prevents bots from adjusting to the channel. people complained about bots, so i found a solution


[17-Jul-18 05:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] that's why i pasted my address in general and then thought wot is happening then say @Cryptoon  tag and went there straigh


[17-Jul-18 05:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] I will miss them all then


[17-Jul-18 05:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[brainland#4248] Just delete the whole channel. Lets start afresh üòÑ


[17-Jul-18 05:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] there are other parameters the bot looks for too


[17-Jul-18 05:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] typing your address doesnt make sense, as it's in a channel that doesnt exist yet


[17-Jul-18 05:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[TLMTroublemaker#2623] Thats good üëç


[17-Jul-18 05:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] ^ exactly


[17-Jul-18 06:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] How to notice an airdrop then.. have to check channels?


[17-Jul-18 06:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] check sounds and unread messages


[17-Jul-18 06:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] While being in a channel .. there is no sound..


[17-Jul-18 06:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] hmm, i don't know


[17-Jul-18 06:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Only when you are out of discord there will be sound.. tried it


[17-Jul-18 06:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] When the bot comes alive it does an @ everyone


[17-Jul-18 06:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] so, just watch unread messages very closely


[17-Jul-18 06:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] It pings you


[17-Jul-18 06:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] i think you can set it to vibrate when there is @ everyone thing


[17-Jul-18 06:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Ah my phone is on mute ...


[17-Jul-18 06:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Shame


[17-Jul-18 06:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] the phone will vibrate


[17-Jul-18 06:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Not mine.. its turned of


[17-Jul-18 06:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Dont like vibrating phone üòÇ


[17-Jul-18 06:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] well ofcourse you have to turn it on üòõ


[17-Jul-18 06:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] I have to now


[17-Jul-18 06:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] you can i think set it to vibrate for a specific channel


[17-Jul-18 06:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] like you can set it to vibrate when there is a tag in chainzilla channel

[djithbit#3171] That was quick


[17-Jul-18 07:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] How‚Äôd it go?


[17-Jul-18 07:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] How was it yea?


[17-Jul-18 07:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Zilla to the moon?


[17-Jul-18 07:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] @bo .. do the same with btc - kmd?


[17-Jul-18 07:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Faisal#8405] NEM or NIM (nimiq)?


[17-Jul-18 07:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] btc fees are high, I wouldnt do it if you arent trading for at least .5 btc


[17-Jul-18 07:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Other coins are alright


[17-Jul-18 07:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] ChainZilla will be working in a more official basis with NEM


[17-Jul-18 07:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[17-Jul-18 07:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] What will you do for NEM? Or what will they do for you?


[17-Jul-18 07:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Komodo is the Minimum Viable Blockchain and NEM is the minimum viable token


[17-Jul-18 07:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] 2 seperate platforms to cater to separate markets


[17-Jul-18 07:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Not everyone will want to launch a native blockchain.


[17-Jul-18 07:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Collaboration with NEM will bring us exposure to their huge community


[17-Jul-18 07:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] I may have a need for a securities token soon.

[PTYX#6840] One thing nem offers that Komodo doesn't is private blockchains. Which are becoming a thing.


[17-Jul-18 07:09 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Or a "permissioned ledger"

[17-Jul-18 07:15 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] might be a better option than eth for what I need


[17-Jul-18 07:16 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It depends. Eth is good for complex smart contracts


[17-Jul-18 07:16 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Although QTum might be the way to go since it's erc20 compatible


[17-Jul-18 07:16 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] You can port an ETH smart contract to QTum

[castle32#9955] What is the difference between ARDR and KMD?


[17-Jul-18 07:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] @PTYX  I‚Äôm gathering specs from some people in a company, I‚Äôm not entirely sure what they want to do yet, but things like managing shareholder accounts, dispersing distributions. That sort of thing. Ultimately if the company goes public, making the shares available as a security on exchange.


[17-Jul-18 07:41 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] I don‚Äôt think they need their own blockchain. Seems overkill.


[17-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Awesome, send over the information when it's ready to hello@chainzilla.io and we'll take it from there. If we close a deal you qualify for a referral fee of 10% of the total.

[Cabey#3299] Was there an airdrop?


[17-Jul-18 04:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] Or was my phone showing old notifications?


[17-Jul-18 04:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] Silent but deadly


[17-Jul-18 04:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[17-Jul-18 04:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] @PTYX would you consider leaving the channels for a day or two after the drop? It shows they actually happen and doesn't cause confusion üòÉ


[17-Jul-18 04:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I don't see how that is necessary since they are recorded on the blockchain so you can verify I paid them out.


[17-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If we use the channel more than once it increases the chances of a bot adjusting


[17-Jul-18 04:59 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The bot tags everyone when it does an airdrop so it should ping everyone with a notification setup for direct mentions


[17-Jul-18 05:06 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] Oh I'm not suggesting you reuse channels


[17-Jul-18 05:07 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[AkiraX#8269] Not mineable?


[17-Jul-18 06:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] it's mineable


[17-Jul-18 06:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] but the reward is very small


[17-Jul-18 06:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] 0.0001 per block


[17-Jul-18 06:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] the explorer at explorer.chainzilla.io is wrong though


[17-Jul-18 06:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] it is counting the transaction fees as block rewards


[17-Jul-18 06:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] so it shows like 2 chainzilla have been mined which is incorrect


[17-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] I totally understand changing up the channel that the airdrops are done in, sadly it makes it nearly impossible for me to catch them while at my job üôÅ


[17-Jul-18 07:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] I'll have to work on my priorities and figure out how to catch a few at some point. Wish the faucet was more reliable but it wouldn't work for me today


[17-Jul-18 07:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] the faucet was out of utxos


[17-Jul-18 07:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] ZILLAs are flying of the shelf


[17-Jul-18 07:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I will setup a second faucet soon.

[grim_chiefer#6001] Got my one Zilla! Been a fan of KMD for a decent bit, but took my sweet time switching to discord. Glad I did because I didn‚Äôt even know about this project.


[17-Jul-18 10:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] There is no #bounty2 channel


[17-Jul-18 10:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Goodmorning.. just woke up..


[17-Jul-18 10:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] @TheHaddock the channel was deleted after the drop ended


[17-Jul-18 10:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Getting too difficult to snatch an airdrop :/


[17-Jul-18 11:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] @Steve10 not sure what OS you are on, but on OSX you can leave notifications for mac on for certain discord servers


[17-Jul-18 11:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] So once this discord starts lighting up I get a bunch of notifications on the top right corner


[17-Jul-18 11:57 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] And it‚Äôs easy for me to click a message instantly in the correct channel and paste addy


[17-Jul-18 11:58 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Only works when you work mostly from your computer though üòÉ


[18-Jul-18 12:09 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Im only on discord with my phone..


[18-Jul-18 12:25 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Maybe something with notifications on phone or se then


[18-Jul-18 12:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] @TheHaddock when airdrop goes out the bot tags everyone so u get the notification if I have it on


[18-Jul-18 02:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] @Cryptoon I don't work near the computer mainly driving a lot, use a phone mostly. I get the notification symbol on the phone but I don't notice that as quick as I would all the activity when I just leave the channel open. I'll figure it out though.


[18-Jul-18 04:29 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Regnar#6164] @TheHaddock I'm snatching them on my phone too. I just paste my address into a text box or notepad on my phone and have notifications turned on. I see the drop and try and paste as fast as possible. sometimes you get it sometimes not haha.

[18-Jul-18 04:54 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] I tried to paste on phone


[18-Jul-18 04:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] Guess bots are the ones which take most of them so wuts the point


[18-Jul-18 04:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] What bots?


[18-Jul-18 04:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[figgy132#7531] You didn't get it because you pasted into the wrong channel


[18-Jul-18 04:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] indeed


[18-Jul-18 04:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] I did ?


[18-Jul-18 04:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] if you posted it in the airdrop1 channel and not in general


[18-Jul-18 04:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] Where was it i got notification here on phone


[18-Jul-18 04:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] you would have made it


[18-Jul-18 04:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[18-Jul-18 05:15 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[deathsgrip#5269] So in the discord notification I switch off suppress @ everyone and then do @ notification not all messages.  I gotta figure this out I am on like no drop day 4


[18-Jul-18 05:18 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Then on the phone click the link of the notification to go directly to the right channel.. and paste as fast as you can your adress ( wich is already secured by have it copied already )


[18-Jul-18 05:18 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[deathsgrip#5269] Okay, I think I got the notification set right


[18-Jul-18 05:39 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[-Hegemon-#3867] Will I get funds I I have a private key created some time ago?


[18-Jul-18 11:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] @Unknown how do you mean?


[19-Jul-18 01:14 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[cheeweon#5786] It may be a rather silly question, but I wonder why you choose NEM,QTUM,Ethrium?  and Do you plan to expand to other platforms?


[19-Jul-18 01:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] And KMD, PTYX was a developer on the Komodo team


[19-Jul-18 01:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] I think KMD/NEM/QTUM are the main ones

[Bo#8264] Already done üòÉ


[19-Jul-18 08:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Robert Naus#9564] the faucet still not working


[19-Jul-18 08:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Don't fret. A second faucet is being worked on by the plumber @webworker01 as we speak


[19-Jul-18 08:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] He's laying down the pipeline (no pun intended)


[19-Jul-18 08:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] so is ZILLA on sale right now or it will be after airdrop ?


[19-Jul-18 08:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Zilla is fully tradeable


[19-Jul-18 08:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] On hyperDex


[19-Jul-18 08:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] And after the airdrop we will be on coinexchange

[Cryptodamus#6225] Hey @PTYX  did you address that guy that was abusing the faucet?


[19-Jul-18 09:26 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] abusing the faucet?


[19-Jul-18 09:41 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] good question @Doink Do you remember his name?


[19-Jul-18 09:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] kraster - afgelopen maandag om 16:08
Stop accusing, you have no evidence, I have not done anything that is bad, I have claimed as any user in my directions manually the reward of the faucet and I can pass if the owners of the faucet wanted a record of how I made it manually, as well as the purchase agreements I've made, so shut up


[19-Jul-18 09:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] This guy

[19-Jul-18 09:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] yes


[19-Jul-18 09:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's difficult to stop. I'll have to Lower the amount and either way it's offline until the second one comes online


[19-Jul-18 09:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] This transaction for example


[19-Jul-18 09:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] The only thing you could probably do is blacklist those adresses from the faucet


[19-Jul-18 09:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] No much we can do against skynet. Blacklisting doesn't do anything


[19-Jul-18 09:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] He can generate more


[19-Jul-18 09:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] But as it's probably all scripts it wouldnt be too hard to cretae new one


[19-Jul-18 09:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] ones*


[19-Jul-18 09:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I'll have to add social media actions


[19-Jul-18 09:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] jep


[19-Jul-18 09:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Yeah thanks cryptoon, you were the one who originally did the work to find his address


[19-Jul-18 09:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We're working out a solution


[19-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I figured this would happen and that's why we tested small amounts


[19-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It did the job though üòÄ


[19-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Our community is growing and the faucet played a part


[19-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] I'm sure you'll come up with some elegant solution :)


[19-Jul-18 09:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Now we even got bot pirates


[19-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Now all we need is eth spammers on the twitter account

[19-Jul-18 04:46 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] you seem to look at prices too much. in short term there is too much noise in these movements. if you are not a trader it's better for your mental health to not look closely at the markets

[Cryptodamus#6225] Welcome new peeps


[20-Jul-18 04:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptodamus#6225] Ok for all the new people, here's the deal with the airdrops: 

There are two types of airdrops for $ZILLA
1) Discord Airdrops

PTYX will initiate the command and then you just need to reply with your Zilla address generated from your agama wallet. These airdrops happen randomly throughout the day. 

2) Holding $KMD in your agama wallet.

There is an airdrop for KMD holders if they hold more than 500 KMD in their Agama wallet. The amount of zilla received will depend on total number of wallets and KMD held. 1M coins will be split between these holders. The snapshot for this airdrop is august 15th and coins are distributed about two weeks later.


[20-Jul-18 04:12 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] Also it's worth noting that Discord airdrops will typically happen in a new channel, not in #deleted-channel

[cheeweon#5786] pre ico is  in progress?


[20-Jul-18 05:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We added it to the schedule but the pre-ico has been capped already


[20-Jul-18 05:39 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We had a request for a pre-ico investor that we decided to take. So we allocated 1 million zilla the pre-ico which we already sold. The total was 1 million Zilla for $0.35 each.

[20-Jul-18 05:52 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[20-Jul-18 06:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[20-Jul-18 06:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] also it's a brand new listing. maybe they have different servers for different regions

[yorklab#7270] ```What seems to be the going exchange between KMD to Zilla if you all don‚Äôt mind my asking. I seem to remember someone wanting 100 KMD for 1 Zilla but didn‚Äôt know if that was correct.```
If you have a minimum of 500kmd in your wallet you'll get a certain amount of Zilla. 4.8 or therabouts.


[20-Jul-18 06:39 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[Emmanuel#5426] If he is a real hacker, we'll see. In that case I see value in his work, even if black-hat. But it doesn't seem to be the case. Real hackers don't brag.


[20-Jul-18 08:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] He was aggravated that I told him not to trade on the public channels


[20-Jul-18 08:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I told him to use Barterdex


[20-Jul-18 08:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] So, possibly he does not have that much indeed


[20-Jul-18 08:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[grim_chiefer#6001] Trying to sell Zilla on Hyper but whether I‚Äôm trying to buy or sell it just times out at 3/5. So I‚Äôll only post this one time - if anyone is wanting to buy some extra Zilla just PM me. Hyperdex just isn‚Äôt working out for what I‚Äôm trying to do cause it‚Äôs not finishing the transaction

[20-Jul-18 03:42 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] That would be 150$ right now? I guess I wait for ICO in Jan then, where 1 Zilla = 0.45$. But thanks for ur offer.


[20-Jul-18 03:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[djithbit#3171] Not enough volume i guess..


[20-Jul-18 04:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] Guess not. All my buy orders lock up too so guess it‚Äôs hodl for the time being.


[20-Jul-18 04:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[djithbit#3171] Lock up happens till orders are filled... need a counterpart to swap with.


[20-Jul-18 04:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] Yeah but I‚Äôm buying from the broadcast sell orders and it still locks up. I get to 3/5 and then it freezes and eventually cancels the order.


[20-Jul-18 04:14 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[tolken#2655] ‚ÄúIt appeared that someone created multiple addresses collected a lot of .1 Zilla and then attempted to sell over 300 I believe here on Discord‚Äù hah. Crossed my mind, but I‚Äôm too lazy and I like these guys. Hopefully the faucet recovered after being violated.


[20-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[tolken#2655] Maybe I‚Äôll go violate the pizza faucet.


[20-Jul-18 07:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] That was some days ago.


[20-Jul-18 07:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The faucet has been offline while we make upgrades


[20-Jul-18 07:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Although, after the violation. The might never be the same. üòê


[20-Jul-18 07:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We're working on our referal dashboard too. So discord airdrops and the faucet will be changed


[20-Jul-18 08:41 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[The1earl#0991] The gleam app wants to post tweets for you, I will skip that air drop.


[20-Jul-18 08:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We're testing different styles of rewarding social media actions. Thanks for bringing that up


[20-Jul-18 08:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @The1earl it shouldn't require that anymore


[20-Jul-18 08:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[The1earl#0991] OK, I will check it out again bud


[20-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It did seem to work


[20-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I took the tweet down


[20-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] For now. But please do check it


[20-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Let me know


[20-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I'll send the airdrop later


[20-Jul-18 08:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's still valid

[21-Jul-18 05:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] i think 471 now


[21-Jul-18 05:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] Nice!


[21-Jul-18 05:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] That's correct. We also have 1.9 followers in LinkedIn, and another 400 on Twitter


[21-Jul-18 05:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The goal is to have 10K by the ICO


[21-Jul-18 06:09 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Link me the linkedin


[21-Jul-18 06:09 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[21-Jul-18 06:19 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] It's only 9 followers (including me). Not 1.9k


[21-Jul-18 06:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] i noticed the same. @PTYX ?

[PTYX#6840] https://www.linkedin.com/in/blockchainasaservice/


[21-Jul-18 06:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] that's what we are using for posts.


[21-Jul-18 06:32 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] why multiple profiles. just adds unnecessary confusion


[21-Jul-18 06:34 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Invite request sent üòÉ


[21-Jul-18 06:34 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] And followed


[21-Jul-18 06:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] But that's your personal profil. I would to post on the official Zilla profil


[21-Jul-18 06:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The account serves a purpose. Which is to promote ChainZilla. The company account will be built up but I don't see it as a priority given that anything that is published can be disseminated through that account.


[21-Jul-18 06:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It seems pointless to spend another 2 months building up the company account when we can do both things.


[21-Jul-18 06:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] https://www.linkedin.com/in/blockchainasaservice/ is your personal profile. i don't get why not do all stuff from company profile


[21-Jul-18 06:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] like i said. unnecessary layer of possible confusion


[21-Jul-18 06:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] I would post on both then. Should be not much more of an effort. This builts up company account seamlessly meanwhile. I think company account on LinkedIn is important for start of ico


[21-Jul-18 06:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Tbh personal accounts are often bigger than company accounts


[21-Jul-18 06:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] thanks for the suggestions.


[21-Jul-18 06:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] https://www.linkedin.com/company/chainzilla looks as the most obvious official ChainZilla profile


[21-Jul-18 06:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] Ask everyone in here to follow. Maybe for 0.5 Zilla :). It's a good starting point to gain followers


[21-Jul-18 06:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] not worth it üòÑ


[21-Jul-18 06:46 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] we went from 153 followers to 1900 without paying anyone to follow us


[21-Jul-18 06:46 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] after we started our marketing campaign.


[21-Jul-18 06:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] Do not underestimate the power of LinkedIn. Reach for crypto n Blockchain related topics and people is big in my opinion


[21-Jul-18 06:48 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[martiniblanco#4080] Well, then just start also posting on comp profile. It will built up itself

[crumb#2550] @st3rling0x in the medium article, second paragraph:
However, most startups are unaware that there are better projects that offer simpler tokenization and rubust infrastructure. 
it should say robust infrastructure


[21-Jul-18 08:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] also later in the article:
There are some advantages of launching a token on NEM. The platform uses a a consensug algorithm known as PoI or proof-of-importance. NEM is environmentally friendly, and very secure. Some of the features included are encrypted messaging
it should say: The platform uses consensus algorithm

[PTYX#6840] to run a MM usually you need command line


[21-Jul-18 09:00 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] better wait until we have the user friendly MM dashboard


[21-Jul-18 09:00 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[yorklab#7270] I know some of these ICO sites want money for a rating, more money, higher rating; Have you run into that issue?


[22-Jul-18 05:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Yes but I don't apply to the ones that want money


[22-Jul-18 05:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] There are a few that want 1-5 btc


[22-Jul-18 05:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's crazy


[22-Jul-18 05:29 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I don't mind paying a listing fee becausw it takes time to go through the info and do KYC


[22-Jul-18 05:29 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] But 0.01-0.05 is more than enough


[22-Jul-18 05:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Icocreed actually charged us the basic listing fee and they wrote us to tell us that they were impressed with the project. The rating is definitely an honest one from them.


[22-Jul-18 05:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Coinschedule does have higher packages but they do seem somewhat honest


[22-Jul-18 05:32 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I'll try icobench


[22-Jul-18 05:33 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] They charge 0.1 for a priority listing though. I've applied through the regular listing with no response.


[22-Jul-18 05:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[yorklab#7270] I know Sri from Utrum was a bit frustrated with the "money for rating" problem when he was looking.


[22-Jul-18 05:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Yes it's a pain


[22-Jul-18 05:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Same as the issue with "money for exchange"


[22-Jul-18 06:35 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] Yes, Utrum is gonna solve that kind of problems.

[23-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Unknown make sure you're on the latest version. If it gets stuck, restar the hyperDex


[23-Jul-18 02:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It should return the funds to you.

[23-Jul-18 02:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[23-Jul-18 08:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] @blubbi which ones are you referring at?


[23-Jul-18 09:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] At the faucet, I'm not seeing captcha's on my linux machine, on windows sometimes. So I have to go to windows to do the faucet.


[23-Jul-18 09:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] Not sure if this is OS related, or that it's something else


[24-Jul-18 02:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cabey#3299] I hate to switch from Chrome to Edge to see it, not sure if it was my adblock or similar plugin


[24-Jul-18 02:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] Since captcha is being provided by google you just have to make sure none of google related stuff is getting blocked from loading on page and it will work fine


[24-Jul-18 04:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Bo#8264] Somehow it works in Opera


[24-Jul-18 05:13 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] Article on CoinDesk about Dex trading platforms not being actually decentralized - Barterdex and Hyperdex omitted from the article.


[24-Jul-18 05:14 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] so far they have been always omitted


[24-Jul-18 05:14 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] go figure...


[24-Jul-18 05:16 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] Just like how EOS was leading the way in transactions per second - but Komodo has tested way higher before they even launched their platform. There‚Äôs no mention of that anywhere.


[24-Jul-18 05:18 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Galikazoid#8606] fickle


[24-Jul-18 05:18 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] many crypto publications ask money for coverage


[24-Jul-18 05:18 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] and there is too many projects out there for legit crypto outlets to research them all


[24-Jul-18 05:19 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] path of least resistance is to be fed the stories and ask money for publishing them


[24-Jul-18 05:19 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] newssites win, crypto ecosystem loses


[24-Jul-18 05:20 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] there is less than 1% of all people who actually research anything in greater depth


[24-Jul-18 05:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] so here we are


[24-Jul-18 05:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[grim_chiefer#6001] True, I always forget that a lot of these ‚Äúlegit‚Äù publications basically ask for money to put you on the front page. Same reason why there isn‚Äôt much coverage of ICOs on CoinDesk except for the rare few.

[pbca26#5430] i'm going to switch the faucet to fetch from recapthca.net instead of google.com
figured it could be due to google being blocked for some users


[24-Jul-18 06:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[crumb#2550] i didn't mean that üòõ


[25-Jul-18 11:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] where did they collect the addresses from?


[25-Jul-18 11:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[JvdP#8992] Ah. I think from the Slack signup.


[25-Jul-18 11:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] ah, ok


[25-Jul-18 11:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[JvdP#8992] At least that's the only place I gave this address to.


[25-Jul-18 11:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] i thought that too, but just in case wanted to know from source


[25-Jul-18 11:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] That website is from an email marketing tool we're using


[25-Jul-18 11:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] For distributing our newsletter


[25-Jul-18 11:55 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] @Unknown could you confirm where did you collect our addresses from tho? i don't mind the email, but i'm usually allergic to spam and so i would like to know how my address ended up in an email campaign.


[25-Jul-18 11:57 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Anyway would be good to share this msg in ann here + write on email about the address source to be 100% clear


[26-Jul-18 12:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] Sure, wait for ptyx to be online he'll surely answer that

[26-Jul-18 04:53 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] @st3rling0x i have a KMD > Zilla swap that stuck from earlier and failed - cant seem to get anything through today


[26-Jul-18 04:53 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] have tried a few different amounts - most is just unmatched - but the one that matched never made it to step 3  - just fyi


[26-Jul-18 04:54 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] ok I'll check fast to see if I see anything

[26-Jul-18 06:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] @st3rling0x - got a match  and made it to step 3 this time - but now it seems to have gone to sleep


[26-Jul-18 06:38 AM] st3rling0x#1568
stop trading for now. we r not sure what the issue is. ive seen two reports of similar behavior


[26-Jul-18 06:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] no worries - no biggie, just wanted to let you know


[26-Jul-18 06:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] thank you üòÉ


[26-Jul-18 06:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[st3rling0x#1568] yesterday the manager from digitalprice.io tested zilla and said it was successfully added. it will be live soon for anyone that want to trade


[26-Jul-18 07:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626] @PTYX  Why not stating your price in Komodo? There is time for your ICO and by that time Komodo may be different in usd terms.


[26-Jul-18 07:30 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I pegged it in USD because we have to use the funds to develop the apps, pay for marketing, and operations.


[26-Jul-18 07:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] my hope is that KMD is worth alot more by then and all KMD holders will be able to get more ZILLA


[26-Jul-18 07:32 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] amen to that


[26-Jul-18 07:32 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] if i had some more cash - a few days back was a steal when BTC took off and alts dipped


[26-Jul-18 07:32 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] still good to buy now as well

[miles#6381] Hi  @PTYX - have a HyperDex swap for KMD > Zilla from yesterday that seems to be stuck - have waited the allotted time, restarted etc but no joy - trade id 139f841adbd9a31665a539bc847b623d5a79cdd46b44b7d6945b768a90722732 - is there any chance some one have have a look - give it a kick?


[27-Jul-18 01:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] scrub that - no sooner than i typed it reverted üòÉ


[27-Jul-18 01:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] @miles For sure, we'll check it p

[Instel7#1416] Hahaha, have a nice day!


[27-Jul-18 01:46 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] thanks @Instel7 - pure magic power!!! - proving hard to get hands on zilla though - will that exchange be listing Zilla in the next few days?


[27-Jul-18 01:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] at this moment I'm not pretty sure about how long it takes to swap, but shouldn't take too long. Anyway, someone will come soon and and give you a specific answer


[27-Jul-18 01:53 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] the HyperDex swap is fine - its a bit hit and miss but i will keep playing. My question was more about what  PTYX was previewing yesterday the central exchange listing he is working on - just curious on timeframe


[27-Jul-18 02:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] Oh, alright. I misunderstood what you was asking. We are currently working on it. But to calm your curiosity: We are ALREADY listed in one platform, just adjusting things before making it official


[27-Jul-18 02:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] You'll surely see something about it these days. So keep your eye open! üëÅ

[miles#6381] @ptxy - thanks - have created an account - its like a KMD coin fest in there üòÉ - hear you re loses - allways...... üòÉ


[27-Jul-18 05:13 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[28-Jul-18 09:20 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @miles we weren't planning on it no. I did test a bit


[28-Jul-18 09:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] from the 500,000 that we unlocked for marketing, bounties, and op costs i can liquidate some through the exchange but it will be minimal. I rather pay someone in ZILLA than sell it for BTC at this point in time.


[28-Jul-18 09:25 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We are working on the electrum app and we are also in the beginning stages of our first contract with Bosque Guardian. I was given the dICO app redesign last week which we approved. That will go into development soon. There will be 1 airdrop to ZILLA holders around  December that I will announce the date of in September. It's from a project that we advised and provided security services.


[28-Jul-18 09:26 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] That is in addition to the projects we have in the pipeline for NEM.


[28-Jul-18 09:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] @PTYX thanks - is the zilla for sale on the KMD market and on Bartdex not you then?


[28-Jul-18 09:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Asking only because I moved some BTC into digitalprice but can shop in KMD as well üòÉ


[28-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] On Barterdex it's not us at the moment


[28-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The bobs are down


[28-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] At digitalprice.io I tested deposits and withdrawals and set one order for 100 zilla.


[28-Jul-18 09:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Then withdrew the amounts


[28-Jul-18 09:50 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I have to check again to see if the confirmation times were changed to 120


[28-Jul-18 09:50 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] When I checked it was only 5


[28-Jul-18 09:59 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Got it - thanks for info - looking forward to the next stages !! üëçüèæüëçüèæ


[28-Jul-18 10:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Is the idea that the December airdrop rewards Zilla holders as you secure contracts / clients ?


[28-Jul-18 10:13 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Well for that particular airdrop we already completed the contract and delivered. So it's just a matter of timing


[28-Jul-18 10:15 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It was a project that required smart contract reviewal and we performed advisor duties. I'll announce more about it soon but they are listed on our website as a partner.


[28-Jul-18 10:15 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] That is the idea though


[28-Jul-18 10:15 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Cool - look forward to it - usual KMD style - deliver first - hype second!!!


[28-Jul-18 10:16 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] To negotiate benefits for Zilla holders when appropriate. Same for Komodo holders it the project launches on Komodo


[28-Jul-18 10:17 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Yes - am a general holder of KMD and it‚Äôs eco system - so keen to see it grow and get recognition for being such  great tech

[traiderqwerty#3252] Hi, I installed Agama on Linux, but there I do not have the opportunity to create a zilla wallet, what is my error?


[02-Aug-18 05:54 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] it is sufficient if you just create a KMD address. if i give a very simplified example, you can think KMD address as a multi-currency bank account. account number stays the same, but you can store different currencies on the same address.


[02-Aug-18 05:55 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] again this is a very simplified analogy and technically inaccurate, but for new people it can be explained this way


[02-Aug-18 05:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] @traiderqwerty use the KMD address that you got and you can just activate the Chainzilla through Agama UI later.


[02-Aug-18 06:02 AM] traiderqwerty#3252
to activate zilla should i download the full blockchain komodo? but if I have a sid phrase for a zilla wallet, can I just run it in lite mode without native komodo?


[02-Aug-18 06:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] spv is enough. you don't need to run native


[02-Aug-18 06:04 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Spv works well and we have plenty of servers running


[02-Aug-18 06:05 AM] traiderqwerty#3252
but what I missed ?,  because I do not have zilla in activate?


[02-Aug-18 06:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] what version Agama are you using?


[02-Aug-18 06:05 AM] traiderqwerty#3252
Last


[02-Aug-18 06:05 AM] PTYX#6840
Then you should see ChainZilla in the Activate Coin list


[02-Aug-18 06:06 AM] PTYX#6840
If you're not on the latest version, you won't see it in the list


[02-Aug-18 06:06 AM] PTYX#6840
He latest version is here artifacts.supernet.org/latest


[02-Aug-18 06:06 AM] traiderqwerty#3252
is there any option in the settings that should be included so that zilla is available?


[02-Aug-18 06:08 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] Chainzilla should be available 'out-of-the-box'. no need to do anything special


[02-Aug-18 06:09 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We're working on our standalone wallet


[02-Aug-18 06:10 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It takes time


[02-Aug-18 06:10 AM] PTYX#6840
For now Agama should work fine though


[02-Aug-18 06:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] log in using your list of seedwords in 'Lite mode'


[02-Aug-18 06:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] and then you can activate additional coins

[03-Aug-18 08:39 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] Is there an exchanger already available to buy and sell zilla?


[03-Aug-18 08:39 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] On HyperDEX and digitalprice.io


[03-Aug-18 08:39 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] But there isn't much volume since we haven't even made the first airdrop


[03-Aug-18 08:39 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] digitalprice.io  is not available


[03-Aug-18 08:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] It does not let me neither withdraw nor deposit


[03-Aug-18 08:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I see it fine. Are you using a VPN?


[03-Aug-18 08:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Hmm I'll contact the dev


[03-Aug-18 08:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] i think he means the wallet is disabled at the mo


[03-Aug-18 08:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Oh I know why


[03-Aug-18 08:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] Itsbanned in some areas i think


[03-Aug-18 08:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It must be due to the update that took place a few days ago


[03-Aug-18 08:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I'll check

[03-Aug-18 08:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] That mainchain komodod still wont sync on the qt wallet


[03-Aug-18 08:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's due to an update that took place recently. It threw some of the clients out of whack. It seems some clients are banned


[03-Aug-18 08:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Which is the reason they won't sync


[03-Aug-18 08:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] Ya


[03-Aug-18 08:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's being worked on but our spv is working fine


[03-Aug-18 08:43 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] Ya agam is ok

[Mastermind#1578] i am having issues syncing wallet on agma KMD syncs fine buy Zilla is not getting connections , it gets like 1 or 2 for few secs then back to 0


[03-Aug-18 08:44 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] .41a release?


[03-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] 0.2.41 is what it says on top


[03-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] So I can only sell and buy zilla through the hyperdex, no?


[03-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @jr.trump yes if there are orders available


[03-Aug-18 08:46 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NWhiskeyTango#5590] @Mastermind get the latest release. If that doesn't work then i have 1 more thing that will fix it

[jr.trump#1045] And does anyone know if they are going to list more KMD tokens on digitalprice.io?


[03-Aug-18 08:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] @Moonraker.Breaks ok ill update and see if it works


[03-Aug-18 08:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @jr.trump i believe so


[03-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] I do not want to have to install the software, but I would like to buy Pearl Pay and Zilla and I do not know how


[03-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] pearl pay has its own DICO app you have to use


[03-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] available from thier  site


[03-Aug-18 08:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] did a small test amount and worked ok for me


[03-Aug-18 08:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] I do not want to install anything or run unknown software, so I want to buy in an online exchanger


[03-Aug-18 09:00 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] for Pearl Pay that is the only way - DICO  App built on KMD Atomic Swap


[03-Aug-18 09:00 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] Then I'll wait for this in an exchanger


[03-Aug-18 09:00 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] create a seed just for that account and move kmd from agama to that seed to purchase


[03-Aug-18 09:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] it should be up and running again very soon. we are updating the remaining servers and the issue should be fixed with the latest wallet.

[crumb#2550] hey @PTYX i have a question regarding airdrop on august 15th. amount of zilla to be distributed among kmd holders is about 4.8 zilla per 500 kmd with a minimum required balance of 500 kmd. does that 4.8 zilla number take into account the known exchange addresses? i remember you wrote somewhere that you'd like to exclude those accounts. if those addresses will be excluded, what would be the amount zilla to be distributed per 500 kmd?


[04-Aug-18 10:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We were only able to discern one exchange address and it only holds one million Komodo more or less

[06-Aug-18 06:26 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Which is true, it's designed to be a 5 star hotel but it's designed to be "green" and there are acres upon acres of already deforested land that the foundation can use

[06-Aug-18 09:51 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jr.trump#1045] @Unknown I will answer you from my point of view
1. Because you hope there are many people who want to help they develop their project from the Zilla's team.
2. It will depend on the people interested in what was indicated in the previous point
3. I suppose developing quality projects for clients, thus creating token demand.
4. The referral program is for bringing clients to the project, not for inviting people to invest, although perhaps in the bounty you find something
5. / 6.  You can find that in the litepaper without problem
7.  You can not know, the price that there is in the ICO can be greater than the one that has the token later, if it was known everyone would buy there                                                                                                                         8. Yes, you can sell your tokens in both the hyperdex and digitalprice whenever you want, surely there will be more exchangers in the future
9. Depends what you want to do, if your goal is to trade with the token, you can buy it directly on digitalprice and keep it there without using any application, if you intend to keep it in time you can download Agama, create an address and have them there, you would only have to download the Agama wallet
10.  From own experience it takes approximately 1 minute to have a confirmation, but the time is variable

If your goal is to buy in order to obtain short-term returns, you're wrong where to invest, knowing that the sale of the token will not be until this winter I do not think you'll find buyers well above the price of the ICO.
If I'm wrong about something, feel free to correct me


[06-Aug-18 10:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[coin.worxs.4us#1959] Very well said @jr.trump ; as I understand @PTYX  - following him on KMD quite some time - his main goal is to build/ improve common economic/business structures for elevating them on a higher level.


[06-Aug-18 10:05 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[coin.worxs.4us#1959] Therefore I think Chainzilla should not be understand as another Get Rich Quick scheme to just make some bucks. It‚Äòs - if - a long time investment just as KMD is (a building/improving and delivering platform) helping to widespread Cryptocurrency adoption!

[crumb#2550] the snapshot will be taken on August 15th and distribution August 30th. to participate in that round you need to have over 500KMD in a single address and you also need to control the private keys to that wallet. using Agama will be the best option for most people


[09-Aug-18 01:08 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[jr.trump#1045] I have sent a ticket to support to ask them to let me deposit Zilla and this is their answer: "Steve Harris (DigitalPrice Exchange Support)

Aug 10, 21:39 EEST

Hi,

We are waiting for a response from Zilla team, they have released an update but they need to contact us before we update their wallet, therefore in the meantime we keep it disabled.

Regards
Steve"

[twittler#0062] Hi all


[11-Aug-18 07:41 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[twittler#0062] I have a question


[11-Aug-18 07:41 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[twittler#0062] Will i also be able to join the airdrop when holding kmd on ledger wallet?


[11-Aug-18 08:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] You'd have to export the privatekey of the address on the ledger that held the 500 KMD and above


[11-Aug-18 08:06 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] But theoretically it will be included. We are going to work hard towards a ledger compatible wallet in the future so exporting the privatekeys might not be necessary if you wait long enough


[11-Aug-18 08:08 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[twittler#0062] Hm i might just get the kmd wallet then. Or just keep the airdrop waiting for ledger support. Still few days ro decide. Thx for the answer :)


[11-Aug-18 08:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[JP#5218] Presume you move from ledger to kmd wallet on the 14th, put them back on the ledger on the 16th. Then check kmd wallet on the 30th?


[11-Aug-18 08:41 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[twittler#0062] Im conidering it :) thx

[12-Aug-18 09:29 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] @Instel7 will need to import same address in chainzilla wallet to access them though righ ?


[12-Aug-18 09:29 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] KMD/Zilla Address is the same


[12-Aug-18 09:30 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] yea but wallet shows diff address when i start or am i wrong :p not sure


[12-Aug-18 09:30 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] You are using agama?


[12-Aug-18 09:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] yes


[12-Aug-18 09:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Make sure your on lite mode or native respective to your first startup


[12-Aug-18 09:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i am using native for both


[12-Aug-18 09:32 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] never used lite


[12-Aug-18 09:33 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If you use litemode, and then use native it will show different addresses. Also, native creates change addresses, if you look in the receive tab you will see all the addresses that your wallet has generated


[12-Aug-18 09:33 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i am syncing wallet right now will check n let you know


[12-Aug-18 09:34 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[iamcryptoseeker#3624] what wallet are you using ?


[14-Aug-18 04:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[iamcryptoseeker#3624] i just downloaded agama from the website its a beta but im not able to locate the private keys


[14-Aug-18 04:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] i am using agama


[14-Aug-18 04:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] you can run it in lite mode or in native mode


[14-Aug-18 04:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[iamcryptoseeker#3624] okay ill switch it to lite mode


[14-Aug-18 04:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] in native mode you can backup your wallet.dat and it downloads full blockchain on your pc and lite mode you need to make sure you save your WIF key as thats how you log into lite mode and if you loose that key you loose your coins


[14-Aug-18 04:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[Marv#8481] Did the snapshot take place yet?


[15-Aug-18 09:16 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[SDang#2970] Don't we need to put in here our ZILLA adress to receive them? Or how would the airdrop work instead


[15-Aug-18 09:19 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Marv#8481] Good question


[15-Aug-18 09:20 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] All komodo assetchains use komodo smart adresses


[15-Aug-18 09:20 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] So your adress of kmd and zilla are the same


[15-Aug-18 09:20 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] they take a snapshot of the kmd chain with the balances etc


[15-Aug-18 09:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] And then they just distribute the zilla to those adresses accordingly


[15-Aug-18 09:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] just login with your komodo seed to your zilla wallet


[15-Aug-18 09:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] and presto there are your zilla coins


[15-Aug-18 09:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] Kind of with ERC20 where you only have one ETH adress


[15-Aug-18 09:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[NedBGQ#8462] Thanks for the clarification


[15-Aug-18 09:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] np!


[15-Aug-18 09:21 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[SDang#2970] Thx mate


[15-Aug-18 09:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Cryptoon#3362] if you run kmd natively then you must extrect your key to login to zilla


[15-Aug-18 09:22 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Marv#8481] cheers! So when is the snapshot?

[Emmanuel#5426] Their are nice people an accessible. Maybe they are not asking for money for listing to anybody, and that's affecting their finances negatively? And now they need money for manpower? 
Mistakes are frequent from new enterprises, we need to understand.
Remember, they created the first KMD based market.


[15-Aug-18 06:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Mastermind#1578] @Deleted User didnt knew about KMD market , may be they need to work on their business model a little and be upfront about the fee's they will charge etc. so there isnt any confusion


[15-Aug-18 06:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] Totally agreed, @Mastermind


[15-Aug-18 06:32 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] There are very few airdrop rewards.


[15-Aug-18 06:33 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Deleted User they went awol for more than a week. Not acceptable being an exchange


[15-Aug-18 06:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Hollowman9000 i requested to delist zilla. We won't be listed on an exchange that can't even complete the simple task of updating daemons. Also, their lack of communication and overall demeanor is not professional. We already have better prospects for exchanges.


[15-Aug-18 06:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] Chainzilla       Is the money listed on the DP? Still voted.


[15-Aug-18 06:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Until they prove themselves, I'd stay away from digitalprice.io


[15-Aug-18 06:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± I don't understand the question


[15-Aug-18 06:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @PTYX I totally agree with the decision, and the given reasons. I just think that we must give them some time to learn about these things (not from ZILLA, though, they already lost that battle).


[15-Aug-18 06:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] True yes, I wish them the best


[15-Aug-18 06:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] digitalprice.io     How is Chainzilla going


[15-Aug-18 06:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± you mean if the currency is already listed? Yes, but it is de-listing, withdrawing from the exchange. 
Chainzilla's project owner is not happy with the exchange. 
Are you from China?

[15-Aug-18 06:44 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] @Deleted User Not a member of Digitalprice.io, nor a bounty hunter,
Just a KMD supporter.


[15-Aug-18 06:45 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± Even better! üòÑ
How is the KMD chinese community? Growing?


[15-Aug-18 06:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] @Deleted User  Not good, because KMD does not value wallets and related Chinese translations.


[15-Aug-18 06:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± it is hard, finding chinese translators.


[15-Aug-18 06:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] I think that Chainzilla's wallet will have chinese translation.


[15-Aug-18 06:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] @Deleted User  The translated text was given last year and they did not pay attention at all.


[15-Aug-18 06:56 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± you talking about Komodo? Komodo wallet?


[15-Aug-18 07:00 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] Chinese is really really hard for us, you need to understand. We need more chinese technical people in the community.


[15-Aug-18 07:05 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224] @Deleted User Chinese has the same meaning as Japanese.

[crypto9999#3411] Can we move coins back to the exchange ?


[16-Aug-18 01:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] ?  Once they are yours you can do what you want. Is your question specific to an exchange?

[Mastermind#1578] @Unknown yes you can move your KMD


[16-Aug-18 02:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[cryptopeeps#2865] @PTYX being that Zilla will be a dICO, does this affect small investors in the US?

[PTYX#6840] Which whitepaper?


[20-Aug-18 11:45 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626] I cannot share the chart but there is interesting statistics. The crypto ownership is highest with 18%  in Turkey than in USA and Europe. And 1 of 2 considers buying crypto. There is more. Trust in crypto is highest in Turkey. If Turkey is to be ground zero in the global financial crisis as James Rickards suggested, I think Turkey is more likely to be a paradigm frontier rather than being a canary in mining field. The reason for this might be we have already a system where people can create money in a non-digital blokchain. It was invented very long time ago. How does it work? I simply write the amount on a check and pay you. You sign it make payment to somebody else. It has a chain of signatures on the paper. Sometimes the paper does not fit. They stick additional paper on it to keep the chain. We definitely need talented developers. I think #chainzilla type approach will speed up the processes. If people discover the power of Komodo in Turkey it would help paradigm change a lot.

[jonnybbig#2316] Open question. What does it mean that you must ‚Äúmove your KMD once per month‚Äù to receive the 5% reward instead of once per year? To accomplish that should I send my entire balance to my own address each month? Or is that silly?


[27-Aug-18 12:54 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[jonnybbig#2316] Also is there a US accessible exchange to purchase Zilla?


[27-Aug-18 12:58 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Its not silly jonnybbig, that's what they mean. Send the balance to yourself once per month instead of year.


[27-Aug-18 01:15 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Unknown the "claim interest" button just makes a sendtoaddress transaction to your own address and it effectively claims any rewards accrued in your Komodo address


[27-Aug-18 01:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We won't be on any CEXes for a while. Our focus now is on our wallet. Our ico is in January so we have plenty of time. After the airdrop, I'm sure there will be sell orders in Barterdex and the #deleted-channel channel

[BoBot-BUY KMD BWK DEV $$$$2018#8821] is zilla on blockfolio


[30-Aug-18 07:26 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Not yet. We aren't on block folio and coinmarketcap because we need 100K in volume in one day to be considered


[30-Aug-18 07:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It's not an issue per se but we don't want to make a big push for people to buy or sell until the ico. You are free to trade on the DEX but the we will most likely wait until after full distribution to be listed on coinexchange and cryptopia.


[30-Aug-18 07:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] If for some reason we happen to reach 100K volume in trade before the ico (completely possible) then I'll apply for cmc that day.


[30-Aug-18 07:33 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[BoBot-BUY KMD BWK DEV $$$$2018#8821] ok cool, also there will be more zilla airdrops to KMD hodlers?

[PTYX#6840] There is one more airdrop that we have not still decided how to distribute.

[PTYX#6840] It's something that we are talking about and planning but it's a few months away from implementing because we already have 2 projects we're preparing this year and I'd like to get our apps ready before we onboard anyone else. The plan is to create a sort of competition in which each quarter we are presented with a range of projects or companies looking to implement blockchain. we filter out the best project and help them launch at minimal cost.

[gfhhgj#1929] Hello curious about the airdrop for KMD


[03-Sep-18 11:16 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gfhhgj#1929] should we have an equal balance of KMD to ZILLA?


[03-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gfhhgj#1929] nevermind


[03-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gfhhgj#1929] just read the pinned post


[03-Sep-18 11:17 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gfhhgj#1929] wish i would have known i needed to keep 500 in a wallet ü§¶


[03-Sep-18 02:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crypto9999#3411] @everyone No zilla listed in my wallet, how to check if airdrop was successful?


[03-Sep-18 02:16 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] check from block explorer first. enter the address where you held more than 500 KMD into zillaexplorer.io and from there you can see how much ZILLA you got


[03-Sep-18 02:17 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] and btw pinging the whole channel to ask a question is not good manners

[PTYX#6840] @crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy did you get that @ everyone?


[03-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I thought we deactivated the ability to tag everyone


[03-Sep-18 02:20 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crumb#2550] no, but this is general principle


[03-Sep-18 02:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] OK just making sure


[03-Sep-18 02:21 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[crypto9999#3411] @crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy thanks for the info.. I am not aware that ‚Äòeveryone‚Äô sends a ping to all.. will make sure not to use it going forward unless needed...


[03-Sep-18 09:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[crypto9999#3411] I checked and there‚Äôs some zilla received to that address but how to check the same  in the wallet ?


[03-Sep-18 11:09 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[paddycy#4865] @Instel7 thank you!


[04-Sep-18 06:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Unknown you have to import the privatekeys into the native wallet or use the seed and activate the zilla wallet


[04-Sep-18 07:50 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Seko#7408] Will the Chameleon Wallet be compatible with the Ledger and will it be possible to receive rewards?


[04-Sep-18 08:24 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] The ledger integration will take time but it's on the list of features. The v2 of Chameleon will have ledger integration.


[04-Sep-18 08:25 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Rewards for Komodo will be available in mobile and desktop.


[04-Sep-18 08:31 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Seko#7408] Thx


[04-Sep-18 08:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171

[Cryptoon#3362] Mobile Chameleon app I think?


[12-Sep-18 06:14 AM] rainbro7#4735

[12-Sep-18 06:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Chameleon yes üêä


[12-Sep-18 06:29 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We're trying to nail down the colors and layout for mobile. We should be finished by the 25th of September. Then we begin coding the Android and then ios app. We expect to have something to test on mobile by end of October.


[12-Sep-18 06:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[üåüKQweci‚òÑ#6562] Is the wallet out yet for download

[miles#6381] Looking cool!! Are there mobile and desktop versions of Chameleon? What coins will be supported? Same as agama or more like Barterdex?


[12-Sep-18 10:53 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Same as Agama except less coins that aren't used


[12-Sep-18 10:53 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Anything we deem not necessary


[12-Sep-18 10:54 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We will have a mobile and desktop version. Mobile will be released first at the end of October more or less


[12-Sep-18 02:11 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[miles#6381] Cool! Thanks - so screen shots showing ltc and eth, but these are not in agama?


[12-Sep-18 04:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] LTC will be added. We are waiting on our eth dev who will help us add eth to our wallet.


[12-Sep-18 04:12 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] LTC is already available in Agama actually


[12-Sep-18 04:13 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I don't have an estimated date for the inclusion of eth to our wallet but it's coming.

[PTYX#6840] the chameleon will have an animation that will make it spin and the spikes will shine a different color so i think the white on blue also works best for that.

[PTYX#6840] That's a mockup of the wallet ui. We did away with the normal charts and added the pie chart with a rotating function. When the user swipes through the coin options the portfolio pie will also rotate. Backend development has begun already so now it's just a matter of time.

[PTYX#6840] @wookie our goal is to provide the Goto wallet for the Komodo ecosystem. Like MEW for eth. We are in the process of also adding ETH, XMR, and NEM to our wallet so as to support Erc20 and as many coins as possible. If you launch a chain on Komodo, I think you'll most likely want to be on Chameleon.

[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Cant wait for ur own wallet , guys - I can not stand the KMD wallet - it is big time gabage


[12-Oct-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Great idea to make the bot !


[12-Oct-18 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-cz] <wh1rlw1nd> hi, thanks for offering help, but at this moment everything is fine üòÉ cheers

[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @Interesting_Times_Ahead What things you don't like about Agama?


[12-Oct-18 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> it is super slow to sync in - dont like the design as well , dont like the color choice , dont like it is 4 wallets in one separated in a strange "load up" way


[12-Oct-18 11:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> @Interesting_Times_Ahead you do understand that when you use native mode you need to download the respective blockchain and that will take time no matter which wallet you'll use


[12-Oct-18 11:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> if you want faster experience use SPV (light) mode


[12-Oct-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Yes I get that


[12-Oct-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> with respect to visual side i don't mind the current Agama, but think that Zilla wallet is way cooler


[12-Oct-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Still , I am allowed to think that is slow ... or am I not ?


[12-Oct-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Is there are a zilla wallet out ?


[12-Oct-18 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> just previews of visual have been out


[12-Oct-18 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> our wallet is called Chameleon and it will be realeased toward the end of the year.

51% Attacking Various CryptoCurrencies  on Saturday, Oct 13 at 3:00 CDT

[13-Oct-18 08:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> About 10 days ago, Einstenium implemented Komodo's DPoW, let's see what happens üëÄ


[13-Oct-18 09:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I am sure Komodo has a line of communication with Einsteinium and asked them to raise the confirmation limit on any exchange where its spend able. If that's the case, then the chance of a double spend is difficult


[13-Oct-18 09:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I haven't had time to look too deep into it but that would be the best plan of action.


[13-Oct-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Another scenario is that EC2 is prepared and has hashrate just waiting to be activated in case of an attack


[13-Oct-18 09:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Which is what I would do. Fight the hashrate with more hashrate.


[13-Oct-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> And a third scenario EMC2 just blows up üòÇ

[14-Oct-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Guarda has a good team


[14-Oct-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> have i had someone check the code, not yet


[14-Oct-18 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> would i trust it with more than 100 KMD, no. I wouldn't trust any online wallet with more than 100KMD.


[14-Oct-18 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> however, i do have less than 100KMD in various online wallets because you do have to spend it every now and then. it's convenient. With the chrome extension you generate a seed so I assume if your browser is not compromised you should be ok.


[14-Oct-18 02:47 PM] SHossain#0007
@PTYX did you find out why their Android wallets been removed from Google Play Store?


[14-Oct-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> yes, it was related to another application they developed - a game. it got banned and they subsequently banned all their apps.


[14-Oct-18 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> from what i understand, they were planning on getting rid of the standalone apps anyway and were releasing a multiwallet


[14-Oct-18 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> which i guess is what they did now with the chrome extension and their new web wallet.

[15-Oct-18 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763

[15-Oct-18 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Thanks @figgy132 There are some changes that we'll be making in these next days üôÇ


[15-Oct-18 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The dICO app was used by Utrum to carry out an atomic-swap powered decentralized ICO


[15-Oct-18 01:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> however, the app needs some improvements along with marketmaker


[15-Oct-18 01:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> our plan was to develop an improved version of the dico app to offer an easy to use dICO app for our clients. Not only for KICs but for ETH assets, Nem assets, and any other coin you can trade on BarterDEX protocol


[15-Oct-18 01:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The advantages of a dICO is that you are fulfilling the orders atomically. There is no trust involved which is gamechanging for ICOs. Contributors usually have to trust that the ICO issuer will pay the tokens.


[15-Oct-18 01:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> sounds really useful


[15-Oct-18 01:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> definitely. The more tools we have out our disposal the more things we can offer our clients.

[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> The animations started getting delayed when i scrolled down, about when i got to "developers". Looks great though.


[15-Oct-18 02:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> What are the tokens used for? Buying zilla products? I understand the use case, but confused about the purpose of the token it's self


[15-Oct-18 02:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> the token will server many purposes. one of them is spending them for our services at a discount


[15-Oct-18 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> however, we plan on activating cryptoconditions next year and we want to implement voting functions, airdrops, and other reward mechanisms


[15-Oct-18 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> when our apps are finished we might allow advertising through the apps which will pay the users in ZILLA.


[15-Oct-18 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Projects that launch through ChainZilla might want to reward the Zilla community with direct airdrops. We will try to keep the zilla token as relevant as possible in terms of use-cases

[22-Oct-18 05:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> These are the predictions the author made and which I think are the most likely to happen, what do you think?

1) When the bubble of hype and speculation pops, prices will drop, the majority
of ICOs will fail and the projects with the most practical, problem-solving *cough*Komodo*cough*
and easy adoption will mature and grow in the long run, becoming the leaders for it's massive adoption.

2) Many governments will not sit by and lose control of the money supply without a vicious fight.
Very strong government (centralized) cryptocurrencies come to power and dominate the flow of money for many
people around the world, they'll impose it and masses will follow them. This is maybe the most dystopian view for us.

3) Cryptocurrencies Will Become a Parallel Economic Operating System for the Planet. For this to happens,
descentralized cryptos need a killer app, one application so indispensable that people can‚Äôt imagine their
lives without it. 

4) That Killer App needs to expands and extends the best characteristics of the blockchain while
minimizing its greatest weaknesses. It must be: a) Ubiquitous. b) Easy to use. c) Acts as a platform for everything
from changing money to protecting privacy. d) Open source

5) Blockchain is Just the Beginning of another ruling Decentralized Consensus: Like the ones we have nowadays:
Hashgraph and IOTA's Tangle

6) Crypto Will Get a LOT Easier to Use: As any other tech development, Crypto will find it's own path implementing
solutions from other technologies to reduce it's major flaws and making it much easer to user for the average person.

[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Leave me your opinion, which prediction do you feel is the most likely to present to us in the following years?

[dscrd-cz] <Mixic> 5) Blockchain is Just the Beginning of another ruling Decentralized Consensus: Like the ones we have nowadays:

[22-Oct-18 05:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @Mixic That one is a little hard to see but I think that's what history has teached us is more likely to happen


[22-Oct-18 05:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> I believe #2 to be very true. Many people in crypto are in it for personal gains and don't even realize it's potential. If asked, they couldn't even explain what blockchain is. We need to spread awareness. Those that don't know now will be "taught" by these government "blockchain projects" that will be forcefed down the throat of the population.


[22-Oct-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Paul> I'd say all 6 points are true!!!  Especially this Killer App is important, that you can use your coins without much effort in everyday life and that you don't have to be afraid of theft by hacker attacks.


[22-Oct-18 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> I think they all play a role, but i see #2 happening if things don't change.


[22-Oct-18 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Paul> But let me ask you something else.  In a crypto event it was told that the development team of Iota left the company and so the tangle can't be expanded any further.  Do you know if that's true?


[22-Oct-18 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> I don't know anything about IOTA but if it means the end of it's project so be it. Doesn't mean others can't come along. No?


[22-Oct-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @Moonraker.Breaks That's completely true, may sound a little dystopian but that may actually happens if people is not conscious enough about their own privacy


[22-Oct-18 06:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <spencervogel> I see #3 being a necessity for mass adoption. There will need to be popular Dapps where the users don‚Äôt even realize they‚Äôre interacting with Blockchain. This will lead to trust of the technology


[22-Oct-18 06:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <c2k> I read that today and left a comment on Medium.. I actually think all the above predictions are correct to varying degrees and also agree with the author that BTC may not survive. I tweeted about it this year calling it #edisonsfirstlightbulb ...amazing visionary technology but becomming quickly outdated by far superior technology like Komodo.

Probably the one to happen soonest tho is that Governments will create their own cryptos, or put enough hash at some winning projects as to control them. Once they discover that the AI intertwined within blockchain technology gives them lots more power than they already have it will be a very quick and powerful move into this for the most powerful (think G20) governments at first with many others to follow. Orson Wells Big Brother at its finest!


[22-Oct-18 06:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Paul> there are simply still missing the mass adoption so that one can use crypto in everyday life.  As soon as this occurs more and more, the government becomes more and more involved.  I think currently the government already has an eye on crypto but they are NO realizing the potential does.


[22-Oct-18 06:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <cantptalblonit> Predictions three and four seem more logical as this is a world of duality and change takes time as the pendulum swings from one side to the other.


[22-Oct-18 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> #edisonsonsfirstlightbulb...i see what you did there lol I feel maybe not the most high tech crypto, but the most prevalent will overcome all. Unfortunetly i don't see news channels boasting about some "Komodo Platform"

[22-Oct-18 06:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> 2) partially (strong fight -yes, governments win and centralized crypto -no) and also 3), 6)
 My opinion: people always were going to have money&assets those wouldn't been controlled by governments. Such attempts always took place in past.  Crypto just continues an old historical row of digital money such as Egold, LibertyReserve, etc.  
So cryptocurrency  has been created especially in order to destroy&replace the existing financial system, this is it's main idea and target. But crypto is really decentralized in comparison with all previous and because of this property it can't be killed or kept under government's control so easy as all digital systems before it. So i believe that it is just  the next wave of money evolution.
I don't know if it would be done by BTC, or ETH, or KMD, or else, but it shall happen earlier or later. The evolution can't be stopped by a such shit as governments or similar.

[22-Oct-18 08:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <criptobear> My thought:
1) When the bubble of hype and speculation pops, prices will drop, the majority
of ICOs will fail and the projects with the most practical, problem-solving  #cough Komodo cough# and easy adoption will mature and grow in the long run, becoming the leaders for it's massive adoption.
This is already happening right now!


[22-Oct-18 08:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Yes, @criptobear  I like a lot that one too, seems to be the most possible for me, even the internet had a bubble burst and the whole market fell about 85% on those days

[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Very interesting!


[22-Oct-18 09:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> I agree with the points but I think we also need a centralised place for people to keep their cryptos. Most people do not want to be their own banks.. it's been like that throughout history. Also getting some celebrities on board will be good for mass adoption.. most people ask how high when a celebrities says jump. üòÇ


[22-Oct-18 09:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> I think if cryptos get too big governments will jump on board.. once they realise it's not going away they will try to control as much as they can


[22-Oct-18 09:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> Once number 1 happens and all the shit scam coins and exchanges are gone we can move forward. üëå

Not sure if its true as I have not verifies the information but it seems true. They show how the institutions missed the initial internet bull market so they bad mouthed it during a bear market.. everyone started selling and the institutions who bad mouthed the internet stocks started buying a shit load.  Goes on to show how those same institutions started saying bitcoin is a scam and bubble while buying up bitcoin and spending money on exchanges etc.

[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> These days I've read a lot trying to understand how Komodo works, read the
technical stuff about notarization, Independent Assetchains, dPoW, etc. But honestly few things
were not totally clear to me. Today I stumbled upon this article that grounded me a lot about what
I was investigating. It presents a historical-context point of view of where all these tech that were
developed in the proto-komodo times comes from. All of these were conceived under other names in
that time by jl777. Assetchains were denominated Runtime Forks and Timestamp Server was like the first dPoW.
Here's the link so you can check it, will surely give nostalgia to our older members here:

[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> True, @Instel7 , it was completely different. Everything. And PTYX was there since the beginning. He's like our grandpa.


[23-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> He can tell you thousands stories about Komodo and its origin.


[23-Oct-18 03:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Ask him and write a book.

[dscrd-cz] <crumb> it would be an awesome project as a documentary. i'm already convinced the movie would be good

[dscrd-cz] <crumb> good -> great

Money-laundering watchdog to set first cryptocurrency rules by June
The global watchdog for money laundering will set up its first rules on oversight of cryptocurrencies by June, a major step towards creating international standards for an asset currently subject to patchy regulations.

[dscrd-cz] <crumb> not directly related to crypto, but i watched the social media hearings in US senate and wooooww these guys have no idea how any of that stuff actually works. their ideas of regulating social media were completely out of touch with reality.

[26-Oct-18 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @Interesting_Times_Ahead Utrum is a platform that rewards members for Crypto Reviews, Analysis and Market Predictions with $OOT tokens.


[26-Oct-18 10:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> They are based on Komodo also, so they are part of Komodo's ecosystem


[26-Oct-18 10:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> How is that actually gona work ?


[26-Oct-18 10:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I think @Instel7 is confusing some things. Utrum is one of our partners. They are a rating platform that launched using Komodo. Utrum will be similar to other ico rating sites with added features and more transparency.


[26-Oct-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> OK ... why that business needs its own token ?


[26-Oct-18 10:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> It is basically a site  for ratings ?


[26-Oct-18 10:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Utrum? If I'm not mistaken they have a revenue/reward system through Oot. I don't know any in depth details though.

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Emmanuel I there any estimation on when the rating platform will go online for testing? I know you're more plugged in over at Utrum.

[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> BTW when are the airdrops paid ?


[26-Oct-18 11:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> At the end of the airdrop which is about 28 days. The airdrop could end sooner if spots are filled. We have to do a manual check for all airdrops to make sure we aren't giving away to bots

[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> I am not trying to be a dick - sincere question - What is the ground to call Chainzilla 4th gen ?


[28-Oct-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> NXT: 1st Gen, ETH: 2nd, KMD: 3rd, Chainzilla: 4th.


[28-Oct-18 05:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <BlockTech> So basically 4th gen of blockchain is using  second and third generation and adding services/GUI ? (User friendly).


[28-Oct-18 06:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> That's correct. In our opinion it is a combination of all previous technologies with a focus on experience, design, and security. In preparation for the increase in blockchain adoption our consultancy and development services bridge the gap between the open source communities and traditional businesses - allowing them to onboard, build fast, and maintain the system efficiently.


[28-Oct-18 06:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Interesting_Times_Ahead ill have an infographic made to explain that. I've heard that question a few times already so it makes sense to explain it.


[28-Oct-18 06:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Great -  looking forward to it


[28-Oct-18 06:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> It is good if u can quickly lay out in the info graphic what defines 1st gen as first gen , second as second and so on

[31-Oct-18 07:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Their app accepts the traditional Fiat payments and Dash. The drivers get 90% if their fair and will have ability to vote on certain aspects of the company and its operations

[03-Nov-18 04:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> same. even the right words have many possibilities and then you may not have the right order at all


[03-Nov-18 05:19 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Nov-18 05:34 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-cz] <SadykovT> the qr code is involved ?? it's broken.


[03-Nov-18 05:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> ü§î I dont want to give too much away. Each image added to the map equals one word.


[03-Nov-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I'm a very literal person so you can assume it's a literal interpretation. The clue in binary code should tell you which word goes first in the seed. Then it's up to you to pickup on the subtle clues as to the order of the final words.


[03-Nov-18 05:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> yes but the QR and the binary gives the same clue. i was expecting some more after i had to redraw the QR üòÑ

[03-Nov-18 05:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> ok now that it's a public secret, i can tell my problem is with those lines that are doesn't really connect all 11 words anyhow üòÑ


[03-Nov-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Oszyü§™ yes there is one word that is not so obvious. The rest are pretty obvious.


[03-Nov-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> i'll give out more clues if i feel it's becoming too hard


[03-Nov-18 05:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> i thought it was fairly simple when compared to other ones i've seen


[03-Nov-18 05:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> okay, i'll fry my brain meanwhile

[dscrd-cz] <Iseki> I have nothing better to do in my life


[03-Nov-18 08:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It would be funny if the first map was just a map to the original map


[03-Nov-18 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> u dropping hints there?


[03-Nov-18 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> No, the hints are in the binary code. I'm just poking fun.


[03-Nov-18 08:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> lol well you could be that savage lmao we dont know üòâ

[03-Nov-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Yeah if the price was like 100K I would make it extra complex. It's actually fairly straightforward.


[03-Nov-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <regtable> When u know


[03-Nov-18 08:19 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Nov-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <regtable> Same goes for most things crypto. It's voodoo till you understand it then it's just if or and else


[03-Nov-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <SadykovT> is it one sentence or are the words unrelated ?


[03-Nov-18 08:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Mike_O.> Theres a lot of little things that make so many variables which is why its difficult and no one has solved it yet. Trying to keep track is crazy when trying everything. haha


[03-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I think keeping track might be key


[03-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Mike_O.> Like is it.... kmd, KMD, komodo or even logo ??


[03-Nov-18 08:22 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-cz] <regtable> List out words for each one like moon, deathstar, fake komodo kmd and so on for each image then use a programme to dictionary list all possible combinations


[03-Nov-18 08:24 AM] Gateway#3763

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Great minds think alike I guess


[03-Nov-18 10:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Mike_O.> It is way different for sure.


[03-Nov-18 10:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> @PTYX very good move with this treasure hunt


[03-Nov-18 10:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> you released all hints at once tho it might take me a month to solve üòÑ üòÑ üòÑ


[03-Nov-18 10:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> Holy fuck my brain is done. Just spent hours trying to brute force any combo I can think of


[03-Nov-18 10:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> I typed out one seed and got "NXT" in green pop up where it usually says Iguana. Thought "I got it!" Then I didn't. After that I'm done. Too disappointed after that fake out to keep going :/

[03-Nov-18 10:40 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> Anyone else worked out why "no plurals" was explicitly stated? I think I've got that one.


[03-Nov-18 10:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> yea i think there's 1 in particular that is plural by the look of it


[03-Nov-18 10:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Mike_O.> same


[03-Nov-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> There's so many variables on the BIP39 word list that anyone who solves it will totally deserve it. Like, moon or lunar? Or crater? Dragon or lizard? Or something else? Then with the clown orgy I get shoulder chest wrist clown face, and I'm hitting more than 11 words! I just want someone else to solve it now and put me out of my misery!!


[03-Nov-18 10:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> i don't think it is bip39 only that's the thing


[03-Nov-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> @Oszyü§™ what makes you think that?


[03-Nov-18 10:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> i am sure of some of the words and those are not in the bip39 word list. also, you can enter whatever words as a seed when you create a wallet.


[03-Nov-18 10:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> Ok- but it would be practically unsolvable unless you restricted the words to those on a word list. Maybe the ones you think you've sure of, actually are wrong?


[03-Nov-18 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> i think that's why it hasn't been solved yet.


[03-Nov-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> who knows. maybe you are right.


[03-Nov-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The words are not on a word list as far as I know


[03-Nov-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> At least some of them aren't


[03-Nov-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I've seen people very close. I don't want to give it away too fast.


[03-Nov-18 11:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> Then I've had no hope all day üò≠


[03-Nov-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> i want to sleep tonight


[03-Nov-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Yes, there are few people very close, cmon keep trying üòÅ


[03-Nov-18 11:02 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Go to sleep. Tomorrow I'll release a clue.


[03-Nov-18 11:03 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> I think someone is gonna solve it today

[dscrd-cz] <NNoperator> At least he got free lunch out of the deal


[03-Nov-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> how do you think, what is (6) point? right after pizza?


[03-Nov-18 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> what it can be? volcano? mountain? rock? root?


[03-Nov-18 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> any suggestions? )


[03-Nov-18 11:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NNoperator> looks like roots to me


[03-Nov-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> too many synonyms ... it can be root, but if we count this like rock - it has many synonyms ... hill, for example ...


[03-Nov-18 11:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NNoperator> I think that is the (1) point though


[03-Nov-18 11:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NNoperator> It is the starting point


[03-Nov-18 11:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <sgt-pot-smoker> thats one im confused on decker. i was thinking volcano or roots

[03-Nov-18 11:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> here can be a few traps ... clown, dog with bandage, dog with pizza, mountain / root ...


[03-Nov-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> too many words can be applied to these pictures.


[03-Nov-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <SadykovT> not  mountain


[03-Nov-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> volcano, vulcan ...


[03-Nov-18 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Voight> my guess first five words after moon are kmd ecosystem coins


[03-Nov-18 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> kmd haven't clowns in ecosystem )


[03-Nov-18 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Voight> i think girls with mcdonald bitcoinhush (btch)


[03-Nov-18 11:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> or dogs


[03-Nov-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> @Voight why do you think "clown with girls" = btch ?


[03-Nov-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> i believe this is less kmd related that it is meme related


[03-Nov-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> +1 ... it's meme related ...


[03-Nov-18 11:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Voight> @Decker  hahah i don't know man


[03-Nov-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Decker already coded a brute force script üòÇ


[03-Nov-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> i was going to  do that but need the right words for that üòÑ


[03-Nov-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> brute force only solves the order problem üòÑ


[03-Nov-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Well, he created his own word list


[03-Nov-18 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> With possible options.


[03-Nov-18 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Nov-18 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763

[03-Nov-18 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> i thought i'll be smart enough to figure out without a script. üòÑ i failed myself.


[03-Nov-18 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> tell me what is #6 (mountain, hill, root) and i promise don't claim reward if i win ) only transfer 1 KMD to my address as a proof )

[03-Nov-18 11:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> But more like roots to me.

[dscrd-cz] <SadykovT> I wouldn't guess, I used the word "dog"


[03-Nov-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> pirate is in the middle not on the line


[03-Nov-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Bizonacci is looking at Satoshi and Satoshi is looking at the pirate

[03-Nov-18 12:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> biz looks on satoshi ... or they on one line ... but i think that pirate can be intermediate point on path biz -> satoshi ... so i doubt about order 10 and 11 ...

[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> Thank fuck for that! Never would have got that, I was being far too literal. I thought it was "eye patch" as the red line went through the doge's left eye then the right patch!

[03-Nov-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> BIP39 word list haven't zilla or chainzilla ... after i unerstood that one of words is zilla, or chainzilla - i forget to think about BIP39 ...


[03-Nov-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <C Adi> Yeah that one stumped me! I thought dinosaur or print or foot. But had so many possibles, it ended up being so many combos


[03-Nov-18 12:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> actually i don't remember what words it includes ... but absolutelly clear - that zilla can't be in BIP39 wordlist )


[03-Nov-18 01:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Decker> but who knows ... may be zilla will be official word of "nextgen" BIP239 ))))

[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @Interesting_Times_Ahead That channel is linked to Komodo's discord #pirate Channel, so everything people talk from Komodo's channel, you can read it here also, and vice versa


[04-Nov-18 08:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Yeah that channel is bridged to the pirate community. That's why you see a bot relaying the messages


[04-Nov-18 09:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> but in short what is the pirate community


[04-Nov-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> Pirate (ticker ARRR) is a privacy coin with forced z-only transactions and with bitcoin level security through dPoW. seriously can be compared to Monero


[04-Nov-18 09:07 AM] Gateway#3763

[04-Nov-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It was an experimental blockchain that took life of its own and I decided to bridge the communities because they have a strong miner community. Since chainzilla isn't mineable I thought it would be of interest to some people.


[04-Nov-18 09:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I think the ARRR hashrate is higher than many Zcash forks


[04-Nov-18 09:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> I can see that - anything called ARRR most definitely "took life of its own"

Bitcoin falls into 19th position while Komodo remains in the top 10.
What do you think about this? Is it a fairer ranking than the coinmarketcap's?

[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> yes I want to know how it was solved


[07-Nov-18 05:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> It was a Caesar cypher pastebin link gave the encrypted text, and the shift key is no. 11 in the background, which decrypts the text giving you the seed

[07-Nov-18 06:13 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <wookie25> Good job and it's a great list to start. There are numerous erc20 wallets out there. I think the next big thing is hardware wallet support.


[07-Nov-18 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> Honestly, I love it. Not that I have any, but i hated MEW hence did not really hold any ERC tokens or ETH. Now that it is in Agama, I might get more comfortable with that system.


[07-Nov-18 06:16 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> This whole metamask & MM based exchanges, the gas, spend $5 on transfer so you can sell you tokens for $2 didn't really work out for me üòÑ

[dscrd-cz] <Oszyü§™> _applies for beta testing üòÇ_


[08-Nov-18 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> that's a tough one. our development team is pushing to have the beta ready before december ends. i mentioned some time ago that we had to push the delivery data back around 7 weeks. The graphic design phase took longer than expected to iron out.

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> it's a team of 7 people and I am making sure they have their foot on the pedal but unexpected things always happen. we just have to deal with them the best we can with the resources we have.

[11-Nov-18 03:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> A cryptocurrency launched by any government could not be called  as a cryptocurrency indeed. Because it is centralized and most probably it would be not anonymous.


[11-Nov-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I don't know if that's 100% correct. I think you can have state owned cryptocurrency


[11-Nov-18 03:54 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Or state backed


[11-Nov-18 04:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <ch6ris> Yeah, that doesn't make much sense. Is ripple a cryptocurrency? Maybe ideologically, the term cryptocurrency refers to a requirment of being decentralized. Bitcoin is mostly centralized theses days. I think it's more to do with the math i.e cryptography.


[11-Nov-18 04:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <ch6ris> Define: Cryptocurrency - a digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank.


[11-Nov-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <ch6ris> Anonymity has nothing to do with the term cryptocurrency either. A state/government could indeed launch a cryptocurrency, controlled, centralized, KYC. Public, Private, doesn't matter.

[11-Nov-18 05:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> @ch6ris i agree..also, not sure i support the whole state backed term just seems like a loophole word. My thoughts like this, most "backed" projects, companies, ect. have a board or some form of organization where the investors or "backers" have the ability for input and persuation..I prefer state accepted. Just my 2sats


[11-Nov-18 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> Like, "We accept visa, mastercard, america express or crypto."


[11-Nov-18 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> Most places prefer say visa over amex because of the fees, and over crypto because of the ease of use. Backing any one of these just seems like they have a stake in the company.

[dscrd-cz] <NWhiskeyTango> I mean ya all are guilty to some extent, some more then others. People in the US complain about taxes. I feel most don't get the reasons behind taxes (or crypto fees). The abusers of such forced laws, taxes, fees, or monetary systems are the real guilty ones. I'm trying not be political here. I feel goverments should have zero stake in the monetary system. They are for law, order and state progression. Church, government and monetary systems need all be separated but accepted by each other to be as human as possible. They all are on god like pedestals, especially those "basically the world" types.

[12-Nov-18 06:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> I've always been a little skeptic about government-ruled cryptos, as this technology was precisely
designed to prevent governments from acting with impunity behind the opacity of the old system.
The beauty of cryptocurrencies is that they allow, through transparency, to avoid all those misunderstandings
that inevitably lead to corruption. I know very closely the case of crypto called "Petro" which was launched
by the Venezuelan government (Yes, that government who took practically the most rich country of the world into
an economic-ruin of almost 1 million percent inflation this year) in an attempt to evade the US economic sanctions.
But it didn't take too long for the fallacies of this project to be exposed: Lack of information about how to
buy it or exchange it, a not clear and totally unprofessional whitepaper, anyone knows how will be the crypto-oil
link as they have said that the coins will be backed in real oil reserves, and even the block explorer is not working
correctly. In a recent announcement of the Venezuela's government they stated that "only the ones who purchases Petro before December 31 can convert it to any other digital currency" as if they were going to regulate who and when
can the coins be exchanged.

[12-Nov-18 07:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> @PTYX  I think that BCH is like a already used condom:  i got it in Aug 2017, i sold it at the maximum price within first days and forgot about.  I considered it as a  died path of evolution at that time.  Roger Ver and Co. just wanted to grab some money easily, so they created BCH, nothing else.   Currently i have no any BCH accounts with more or less reasonable balance,  so nothing to think about it's fork because  of no chance to earn anything.  I'm not going to buy BCH especially for participation  in this fork. I think that  BCH big holders have exactly this target:  to pump the price on the event's rumor and to sell us their BCH bags. Correspondly, it's a way to losses for us, is not worth to buy.

[dscrd-cz] <enfarktus> @PTYX "we haven't been giving Bct much attention. I think I've mentioned it before. Analytics show us it has the worst performance out of all our social media and channels." 
                                                                                                         However, it is better to use all channels to ensure brand awareness.

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> the landing page is nothing more than a version of the ico site without any outside links, or anything else other than the contact form.


[13-Nov-18 07:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <enfarktus> As you know, most good projects cannot reach the level they deserve because of wrong publicity campaigns. For example Komodo.  I hope ChainZilla isn't one of them. Good luck! üëçüèª


[13-Nov-18 07:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @enfarktus as i mentioned, the linkedin paid advertising hasn't started. We have a secondary account which i use to publish any articles or links that has a larger audience. Until we have the landing page, they won't approve us to push the ads. I appreciate your input but I can assure you we are on it.


[13-Nov-18 07:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> https://www.linkedin.com/in/blockchainasaservice/ is where I usually publish any news or links. that will change in the coming week as the landing page is ready and we're just waiting for approval to use the ads feature.

[dscrd-cz] <Cruz_77> Hey guys, I'm Preston & I spend most of my time in the Verus Discord.

Maybe you've been over there & talked with John Westbrook. @JohnWestbrook ...
He has written Medium articles about VerusCoin & Utrum. And I know he has helped tons of people with technical issues, in the Verus discord, too. So maybe you've met him.

Well, his parents' home was burned down in the California Wildfire, this week. And, his dad is a Vietnam Veteran. Needless to say, they are faced with a difficult situation.  And can use any type of help with contributions at the GoFundMe, that he and his siblings set up, for his parents & their medical expenses.

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> ü§î time flies. I've been working on Chainzilla for about 6 months now.


[15-Nov-18 05:50 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> Yes time does go quickly in cryptos.. my first buy was over a year ago now


[15-Nov-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> I don't like this recent crash though first time I have been down overall lol


[15-Nov-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> Also let's hope the markets conditions are a bit better by the time the ICO finishes üòÑ


[15-Nov-18 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Yes.... It has made me rethink the ico date.


[15-Nov-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> But I think we should just play it by ear


[15-Nov-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Claunas> Yes btc guys


[15-Nov-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @CombatWombat Don't worry, bad times comes and goes it has always been like that


[15-Nov-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Claunas> I made a wire to litebit


[15-Nov-18 05:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Claunas> For me was the cheapest so far


[15-Nov-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Do you have usd or euro?


[15-Nov-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> Just trust that the real value of the tech will prevail at the end


[15-Nov-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Claunas> Gbp


[15-Nov-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Because euro is easy to trade for BTC


[15-Nov-18 05:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> @Instel7 I know.. just sucks this is the first time I have actually been down .. not that bad really seeing as we have handled this for almost a year now haha

[27-Nov-18 08:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] Komodo platform announced:
This is a massive upgrade in technology for the entire Komodo ecosystem. Please note that this update is a hard fork. It is, therefore, a mandatory update.
- Sapling Upgrade
- VerusHash algorithm, bringing near-equality between CPUs and GPUs with the fastest CPU mining algorithm in the world
- VerusPoS algorithm, allowing for a 50/50 hybrid blockchain, which can be combined with either 50% VerusHash or 50% Equihash for the proof of work component.
- Time Locking, which allows mined rewards to be time-locked for random release, within a set of parameters.
- The ‚ÄúEras‚Äù parameter (ac_eras), allowing 3 eras of different coin emission schedules to be defined which alter emission, including slow start options, and linear exponential decay at specific, predetermined block height schedules.

hi is there any update on the wallet and thx!


[27-Nov-18 10:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We had a meeting with the Chameleon devs last week and the team was working on the home screen, send, and receive functions. Most of the frontend work is don't. They are now working on "connecting" it all with Agama core. I have another meet on Monday to ibstall the app and analyze the beta.


[27-Nov-18 10:30 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We are working based on sprints and they have been keeping a good pace but what backtracked us was the original design work. It took longer than expected. I'm pushing to have a public beta out before the end of the year. If for some reason I think that won't happen we'll make an announcement and adjust the delivery times on the roadmap.


[27-Nov-18 10:34 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We are also working on a video update that should be published on the 1st about the ico. We have reduced the amount of tokens we will sell. There will only be 2.5 million zilla in circulation for the year and it's likely we won't need to do a second round of funding at all. The goal was moved down from 2.25M to 350K. Just enough to finish our token generation apps and polish the other tools that are already available.


[27-Nov-18 11:06 AM] hastrup#8742
hi thx for the update im looking forward se and test the wallet and thx for the news üòÉ


[27-Nov-18 02:26 PM] PTYX#6840
@hastrup no problem thanks for asking. Did you take a look at the Magnum wallet? We were added to that wallet recently just like Komodo.

[PTYX#6840] Small update: 
- We are preparing some marketing content for the coming weeks prior to the ICO. 

- The airdropsalert airdrop is on hold. We are working out some technical issues with them. 

- We are meeting the Pundix team to negotiate a collaboration strategy for Latin America que Chainzilla at the helm.

- In the coming weeks we meet with several teams to discuss the creation of a foundation/alliance for blockchain and Fintech initiatives in Latin America. The ones that exist right now are showman entities that only do conferences but don't toe the line when it comes to development.

- There are possibilities of a new project that we will be working with to help them launch. It's another project like Bosque Guardian that will introduce a new model for an industry that has an obscure supply chain.


[03-Dec-18 02:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @everyone keep an eye on the next newsletter. We will pick 3 users to test our pre-release app. The feedback will help us prior to releasing the beta.

[BTC-BTC-BTC#4223] Does Magnum wallet supports all kmd tokens?


[08-Dec-18 07:52 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Not all KMD tokens yet but yes it has the capacity to do so. Chainzilla is Magnum's preferred onboarding partner. That means if a Komodo asset wants to be added to Magnum they should come to us and we will onboard them.


[08-Dec-18 07:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We are preparing the pricing sheets with the Magnum team. They will be ready in a week or so.


[08-Dec-18 09:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[LocoMB#8593] does chainzilla have a bitcointalk thread? 
troll infested and BTC maximalist censored as that place may be, it is still good for following a lot of trends


[08-Dec-18 09:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Bitcointalk has the lowest performance out of all the websites we promote. We are focusing on Facebook, medium, LinkedIn, Twitter, discord, Reddit, and telegram. We do update bct every now and then but it's not our demographic.


[08-Dec-18 09:51 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Since we don't have unlimited resources, low performing things need to be replaced with high performing and low cost solutions.


[08-Dec-18 09:53 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We're now using Google and Facebook ads which have a better reach at a lower cost and with more statistics

[09-Dec-18 12:16 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gh√∏st#7639] The main goal of the bounty (including on the BT–°T forum) is the distribution of a small part of the coins among the community.
Real investment goes to the project another way.


[09-Dec-18 05:35 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Deri Septian Nugroho  UTC+8#7696] I agree with that, advertising on Facebook is indeed cheaper, but the reach on the bitcointalk is right on target that they are genuine krypto fans


[09-Dec-18 06:49 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @Unknown so what you are trying to say is that we should focus our efforts on BCT because it has "genuine crypto fans"?


[09-Dec-18 06:53 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Have you ever done any marketing campaigns on BCT for extended periods of time and analyzed the traffic data back to your project?


[09-Dec-18 06:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @gh√∏st true, and 2 years ago I would have said BCT was the place to be for true believers. However, now we spend more time filtering out the bots when we run bounties and any sort of distribution campaign. The same goes for most channels but BCT is full of people that make profits off signing up to as many bounties as possible and dumping as early as possible.  Discord has done a better job a trickling bounties than BCT.


[09-Dec-18 06:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] At the end of the day, we try to make decisions based on the numbers. BCT has been put to the side because it wasn't yielding results. Simple as that.


[09-Dec-18 10:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gh√∏st#7639] @PTYX 
"BCT has been put to the side because it wasn't yielding results..."

And what results did you expect from BT–°T?
 (signature campaign)?


[09-Dec-18 10:18 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We are looking for traffic. When we post across channels, we look at which posts brought more traffic to the website. We also tried the signature campaign. That brought minimal traffic. So no results overall. I'm sure there are projects who make bct work for them, mostly mining projects.


[09-Dec-18 10:25 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gh√∏st#7639] You had an extremely small payment per signature.
And the limit is the senior - minimum.

I can say my opinion, no more:
- Or quantity (from junior)
- Or quality (the best authors)


[09-Dec-18 10:25 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gh√∏st#7639] 7 people of whom only one wrote fine


[09-Dec-18 10:26 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Everyone has their opinion about the matter.


[09-Dec-18 10:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I respect and appreciate your opinion but we have a clear path set. I'm not diverging resources to support forums that don't drive any traffic or generate any business.


[09-Dec-18 10:27 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gh√∏st#7639] $ 25 in a coin for a senior is statistically very small. (week)


[09-Dec-18 10:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We used other bounties as a benchmark. The bitblend bounty to be specific.


[09-Dec-18 10:28 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gh√∏st#7639] We just talk.
 decide - only you.


[09-Dec-18 10:29 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[gh√∏st#7639] By the way, now the forum is becoming cleaner, it nice to read


[09-Dec-18 10:50 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] There's some nice conversation there. I don't visit it much anymore unless it's for an update but it used to the hub for all good projects.

[miles#6381] @PTYX thanks for the video on ledger rewards via magnum :zilla3:  - i gave it a try but when i access my nano the the wallet recognises a KMD address that isn't the ones that i have set up and use in Ledger Live. (i have three different KMD addresses in Ledger Live) I tried searching for the a fourth account within Ledger live to add it in but it doesn't find the address that shows in Magnum - anyone seen this or know who where to raise the issue?


[10-Dec-18 05:14 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @miles yes I've faced this and understand your confusion. I gave @Magnum Wallet the suggestion of a sweep function for those who have the kmd spread out in a few addresses across the ledger.


[10-Dec-18 05:15 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] For now as you mentioned, the solution is finding the correct address path and import then manually into the Mangum dashboard.

[11-Dec-18 05:18 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Verus vs chain zilla.  What‚Äôs the difference?


[11-Dec-18 05:28 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Chainzilla is a company that focuses on onboarding projects, consulting, app design & development, and incubation of new products.


[11-Dec-18 05:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We also offer our services in different platforms. Nem, Komodo, ETH, and Qtum for now.


[11-Dec-18 05:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] I don't think chainzilla is on the same category as verus


[11-Dec-18 05:29 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Both are pbaas?


[11-Dec-18 05:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Verus is much more technological and it revokes around the verus blockchain. I can see chainzilla offering verus services.


[11-Dec-18 05:30 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Like security or custom blockchains with their verus hash


[11-Dec-18 05:31 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Think of Chainzilla as the bridge that connects the client and a project like verus.


[11-Dec-18 05:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Chain zilla is not mineable


[11-Dec-18 05:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Correct


[11-Dec-18 05:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Pure dpow


[11-Dec-18 05:34 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I haven‚Äôt been following.  But I missed a lot of airdrops üòâ


[11-Dec-18 05:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We did an airdrop for KMD holders (500KMD and more) some time back


[11-Dec-18 05:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] I have no where near that amount of kmd


[11-Dec-18 05:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Oh OK


[11-Dec-18 05:35 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Yeah it was some time back.

[AkiraX#8269] Lol


[11-Dec-18 05:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] Is that a lot?


[11-Dec-18 05:36 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] There will only be 2.5M in circulation. If everything goes as planned, we won't need a second ico sale which will mean the tokens will be locked up.


[11-Dec-18 05:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[AkiraX#8269] How can I get more chuainzilla if I can‚Äôt mine


[11-Dec-18 05:37 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Participate in the upcoming ICO, get it after the ico on an exchange, or fulfill some bounties

Hi @Captain_Jack, I'll PM you the details.


[14-Dec-18 02:38 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Instel7#1416] Bosque Guardian is one of the projects in which Chainzilla is working. It surged as an initiative to preserve and protect the Tarapoto Forest (Peru) against deforestation and building a "Green" boutique Hotel.  Rafael Benavides, the enterpreneur behind this initiative provided us the conceptual master plan and some sketches of the hotel.
This is the full article and some of the images of the conceptual plan <https://medium.com/chainzilla/project-update-bosque-guardian-898c5f6e11cd>

[15-Dec-18 09:47 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[enfarktus#3901] Hi! I'm curious about the cost of a blockchain project. For example, what is the cost of the system that Chainzilla creates in the Ethereum network to a company?


[15-Dec-18 09:56 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] @enfarktus Chainzilla doesn'√æ work with Ethereum


[15-Dec-18 09:57 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[enfarktus#3901] You're wrong!


[15-Dec-18 09:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[enfarktus#3901] ChainZilla is a 4th gen Blockchain as a Service provider for NEM, Komodo, QTum, and Ethereum.


[15-Dec-18 09:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] A simple token is $5,000, with security review


[15-Dec-18 09:58 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] So no complex smart contracts


[15-Dec-18 09:59 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] A complex contract ranges from 5-20K


[15-Dec-18 10:00 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] It all depends on the overall scope of work


[15-Dec-18 10:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We have a standard pricing sheet but many of the services we offer are new and we have to establish benchmark prices


[15-Dec-18 10:01 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[enfarktus#3901] @PTYX Thank you for answer! üëçüèª


[15-Dec-18 10:02 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] Our cost is 60-75% lower than our competitors which are the ico launch platforms


[15-Dec-18 10:03 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[enfarktus#3901] Exactly!


[15-Dec-18 10:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[enfarktus#3901] It seems that with the support of Chainzilla the number of individual projects will increase.


[15-Dec-18 10:11 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] sorry, didn't know of that


[15-Dec-18 10:36 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] @enfarktus in time yes, we are usually approached by 1-5 people weekly that want to launch projects but only 10% passes the due diligence process and then 50% of those pass to the closing phase. We are just getting started with our sales marketing. We have been focused on ico marketing and community building


[15-Dec-18 10:37 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] As we move out of this ICO phase we are going to throw everything we have at sales marketing


[15-Dec-18 10:38 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[PTYX#6840] We've already closed sales for 2 blockchains, one app, and have 2 partnership with projects in which the chainzilla company has stake.


[15-Dec-18 10:40 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[enfarktus#3901] Your connection to Komodo gives people confidence. üëåüèª


[15-Dec-18 10:42 AM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Emmanuel#5426] PTYX is one of the most knowledgeable people in the Komodo community. Whatever you asks him, he knows.

[17-Dec-18 12:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] Yes - there are many industries and businesses where blockchain can and is logical to be used ( not only using it for the sake of being trendy )


[17-Dec-18 12:47 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] The key is making the adoption ridiculously easy


[17-Dec-18 12:48 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] Right now it is a nightmare to be in crypto - everything is hard , learning curve is steep and that makes real world use case achievement impossible


[17-Dec-18 12:49 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] Also vast majority of devs are cocky and intentionally snobbish and not helpful - they dont like to explain and feel "satisfaction in knowing things u dont know "

[PTYX#6840] Yeah, it's a long road ahead


[17-Dec-18 12:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] As long as that attitude is prevalent and teams are not tamed by market and social relation people adoption will be a pipe dream


[17-Dec-18 12:50 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Hungry_BullBear#1487] we are at least 10 year away from real mass adoption

[17-Dec-18 04:02 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[stock999#4818] I think that real estate will face on a very strong resistance . Just imagine a huge army of lawyers, notaries, other  bureaucrates etc. , those will lose a job if real estate operations would be handled by smart contracts. All of them  will fight  against blockchain for survive. So, it is a very far future.


[17-Dec-18 04:10 PM] Komodo-Bot#0171
[Steve10#5203] The poll is for 2019, cryptocurrency is the best answer for the poll because everything else will take a lot longer for adoption. All fields mentioned will use blockchain in the future no matter how hard people fight it.

[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> Stole how?


[29-Dec-18 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> when  try to access my  wallet then i input the correct pin but they showing incorrect pin


[29-Dec-18 11:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> im pretty sure i input the correct pin


[30-Dec-18 12:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> Check your address here. https://www.dexstats.info/assetviewer.php if the funds are still there you still own them and it's a matter of figuring out your pin

[30-Dec-18 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> dude look at me after i cant input my pin i try to recover with my first pashphrase but why my address is different from existing in the first time i make wallet on the pungo app, that why my balance gone


[30-Dec-18 12:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> Ok I've seen something like this before. It's possible that the first time you didn't copy the entire passphrase. I had to try my passphrase minus a letter and just kept trying with less and less letters until I got it. Might work for you


[30-Dec-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> @jspook16 its ok if the address its not changed with the same passphrase , but its another address with same passphrase


[30-Dec-18 12:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> its really annoying when i use another wallet such as imtoken when i import the passphrase i will found my balance with existing address


[30-Dec-18 12:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> with the same address with the same amount but not with pungo


[30-Dec-18 12:14 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> I personally use agama mobile (Android) and agama desktop (linux). If you can get to your balance on imtoken (I'm not familiar with that wallet) then I would send it from imtoken to a new wallet that you know the passphrase for sure.


[30-Dec-18 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> @jspook16 no dude imtoken is erc20 and eth wallet. i just comparing imtoken and pungo


[30-Dec-18 12:22 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> Oh gotcha. We'll try what I told you earlier. Try all of you passphrase except the last letter and then repeat, each time removing a letter until you get your original address


[30-Dec-18 12:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> Or maybe you have an extra space in there at the beginning or end of your passphrase


[30-Dec-18 12:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> @jspook16 i think you are missunderstanding


[30-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> i try to recover with my passphrase but no balance in my wallet also my address is different than before


[30-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> @PTYX can you help me?


[30-Dec-18 12:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jspook16> Maybe I am misunderstanding. But if the address is different thats because the passphrase is different.


[30-Dec-18 12:34 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> @jspook16 dude the pass is same but why pungo give me the new adress with no balance rather than my old address


[30-Dec-18 12:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jony> ok dude case closed


[30-Dec-18 04:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <yorklab> In the Agama Lite wallet if you have a different address it was because a different passphrase was used. When creating a new wallet copy the address then please be sure you can log back in using the same passphrase and check that it's the same address before transferring any funds into that wallet.


[30-Dec-18 04:29 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <yorklab> This would apply to any wallet used.


[30-Dec-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> If you didn't export your privatekey, or your seed file is encrypted and you can't decrypt it, then there is little we can do. I use Pungo and it works fine. It's based on the Agama seed generation.


[30-Dec-18 05:10 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I'll make a report to the Pungo team and look more into it.

Chameleon Alpha Test
We are happy to announce that we will pick 3 users to begin tests on the pre-release version of Chameleon Mobile. This will provide us invaluable feedback on the app's workflow and any minor improvements that need to be made prior to the public beta release.

[14-Jan-19 05:51 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Wallets must be protected by technology first of all.  Laws, KYC and an army of hungry lawyers can protect nobody.


[14-Jan-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I think KYC is something we won't be able to get away with due to anti money laundering


[14-Jan-19 09:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> but when it's implemented badly it can have bad effects on the users.

Good time of the day!
I would love to share an idea for the dapp and hopefully find people who resonate with it and would help to manifest it.

[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Well, Ledger is a reputable manufacturer. But it is not an open source code, right?


[16-Jan-19 05:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> On my mind the open source is much better than any reputation, as for a security

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> There are no open source hardware wallets at the moment

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The ledger device is the most secure hardware wallet as its the only one with a special chip set made to hold the keys. Trezor doesn't have any special chips

[23-Jan-19 02:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> @Instel7  I still have a question: do you really need KYC for ICO even for those  want  pay by cryptocurrency, not by fiat?
But it has been discussed here a while ago. So i'm not sure if it's worth to ask again in AMA


[23-Jan-19 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @stock999 instel is off today. As for the KYC, it is enforced for all users during the contribution period.


[23-Jan-19 02:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It was a must for us to comply with current and possible future laws.


[23-Jan-19 02:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> @PTYX  Yes, i understand


[23-Jan-19 02:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> But probably  others also would be interested in this. Smb thinks that KYC is a right way to legalization, but smb else considers it as problem or an absolute evil. So, may be it would be better to include it in AMA in order to make it clear for all.  Up to you.


[23-Jan-19 02:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> i don't like kyc, but some people need it


[23-Jan-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> both realms must exist and inter-operate


[23-Jan-19 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> kyc and non-kyc


[23-Jan-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> @Emmanuel Agree. KYC has a right of existence only for those prefer to pay via bank,  by fiat money. But cryptocurrency must remain anonymous, i.e. no KYC.


[23-Jan-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Even buying from bank, kyc shouldn't be considered necessary.


[23-Jan-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> You don't send a selfie to amazon each time that you buy a book


[23-Jan-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Same should be for BTC or any other coin. It's a number that you are buying, nothing more.


[23-Jan-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> The sole reason for KYC existence, is governments being afraid of losing power.


[23-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> And I couldn't care less about that.


[23-Jan-19 03:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> The most interesting is that the KYC procedure doesn't resolve any problem. It just creates additional troubles for honest people those want a privacy only.


[23-Jan-19 03:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> But it doesn't work against scammers. Everyone can hide a real identity easily enough if he wants this.


[23-Jan-19 03:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> So it is just a useless action, useless expenses for lawyers.


[23-Jan-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> it is useful for governments - you give up your privacy, you give up your freedom


[23-Jan-19 04:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> door kickers released if you bad behavior


[23-Jan-19 04:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> a.k.a. "thinking by your own"


[23-Jan-19 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> All businesses do basic KYC when dealing with financial information though. Banks, lawyers, doctors, and even schools.


[23-Jan-19 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We also can't pretend like we shouldn't worry about money laundering or possibly transacting with unsavory individuals that you wouldn't transact in your daily. I do agree that KYC's get breached all the time and we are using the minimum information that we need to comply. However, I think a better approach is to think of better forms of KYC and anti money laundering that doesn't involve handing your information over to someone forever.


[23-Jan-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> `All businesses do basic KYC when dealing with financial information though. Banks, lawyers, doctors, and even schools.`
That's what cryptos are intended to fix.


[23-Jan-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> This society is completely messed up.


[23-Jan-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> what is kyc?


[23-Jan-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> basic KYC. it's your name and your address.


[23-Jan-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> how are you going to go to school? with a hash number?


[23-Jan-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> i mean sure we could, in a crypto or blockchain utopia


[23-Jan-19 04:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> but that isn't going to happen.


[23-Jan-19 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> and basic AML is making sure you aren't transacting with individuals on certain lists and accounts.


[23-Jan-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> back in the day, only your name was enough, not even id


[23-Jan-19 04:35 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> things worked fine


[23-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> it still works like that in many places


[23-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> There are pros and cons


[23-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I personally like to know who i'm transacting with.


[23-Jan-19 04:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> you like, but you don't need to know


[23-Jan-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> the reason why you "need" to know is govs.


[23-Jan-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I think most people would like to know where their money is coming from.


[23-Jan-19 04:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> How would you regulate fraud in the blockchain utopia?


[23-Jan-19 04:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> or possible money laundering and corruption?


[23-Jan-19 04:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> If you have ideas i'd like to hear them. It's an interesting topic. You have to play devils advocate though. If noone used KYC and everyone used anonymous transactions, there could be all sorts of possible problems.


[23-Jan-19 04:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> You need to assume innocence first. How detectives work?


[23-Jan-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Ok so if a drug dealer sends you payment for a house, and you received a non-kyc contract with payment from an anonymous source. How could we prevent this from happening?


[23-Jan-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> KYC kills the innocence principle.


[23-Jan-19 04:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> ask the drug addict whom he bought from


[23-Jan-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> it worked like that for centuries, now all of a sudden KYC is ubiquitous and a supposed panacea


[23-Jan-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> so you would willingly accept money that was obtained with illicit sources. it doesnt have any moral reprehension on you?


[23-Jan-19 04:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> or would you rather make sure the funds come from licit sources prior to signing the contract?


[23-Jan-19 04:43 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> I worked for the money, it is legally mine. No moral problem there, as long as I collaborate with the security forces. But always respecting the innocence principle.


[23-Jan-19 04:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Even if the police find the drug dealer culprit, my money is clean, as he wasn't declared a criminal yet.


[23-Jan-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> You're completely forgetting about the innocence principle, and that's what is this all about.


[23-Jan-19 04:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Nobody's innocent, nobody's free.


[23-Jan-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> In a full KYC world, prisons are not needed, as the whole world is a prison.


[23-Jan-19 04:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> "Criminals" would just be less favored prisoners.


[23-Jan-19 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I'm not following your logic. what i was referring to was the ability to auto-regulate our activity, transactions, and interactions to minimize overwhelming intrusion from government. However, not knowing who you are transacting with is not ideal 99% of the time. As proven with Komodo Z addresses holding 0.01% of funds.


[23-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I would like to see decentralized KYC that we can all use ourselves to determine and allows us to comply with basic KYC/AML which means knowing someones name, address, and that they are not on a terrorist list. If you see that the transaction is coming from someone unsavory or it's an anonymous transaction, it's your choice to accept it or deny it based o its source.


[23-Jan-19 04:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> How can you trust a "terrorist list" from a government that creates terrorists but says to fight them?


[23-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> that's up to you


[23-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> but the choice is there


[23-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Exactly, just like with no KYC at all.


[23-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> with no KYC you can't know anything. how can you make an informed decision when part of the information is missing.


[23-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> unless we self enforce it


[23-Jan-19 04:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> which is what i'm talking about.


[23-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <LoboRei> Terror is a perceptional quality. Anybody including those meant to safeguard us could be deemed terrorists


[23-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> So are we to ignore there are bad people in the world that want to steal everything you have or destroy it?


[23-Jan-19 04:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> It is not your duty to condemn them. They are innocent until proven otherwise. KYC subverts that principle. 
You should only "freeze" or give up funds, at judicial order.


[23-Jan-19 05:00 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> (Or block someone, or anything.)


[23-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> For arguments sake, let's say a person was convicted of a financial crime and stole millions from a pension. And he is on the run. He is on a list that you can check in order to filter any tenants or business partners. He wants to rent or buy your apartment. If you don't check it, you have now done business with a criminal.


[23-Jan-19 05:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Was he sentenced?


[23-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Maybe


[23-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> at this point he is on the list


[23-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> "Maybe", that's the problem.


[23-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> being looked for by various jurisidictions according to our blockchain police explorer


[23-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Ok, so you ignore the facts and transact with him anyway.


[23-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> the kyc didn't stop you from doing business with him


[23-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> it just informed you so you can make a better decision.


[23-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> it's a tool


[23-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> KYC != sentenced people list.


[23-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> we need to rethink KYC and how it's applied instead of demonizing it.


[23-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> 1 reason is because it's not going away.


[23-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> and 2 is because blockchain will change the way kyc works


[23-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> "we need to think how to collaborate better with this dictatorship, reason 1 - it is not going away"


[23-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> same logic


[23-Jan-19 05:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> So KYC  equals  Dictatorship?


[23-Jan-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I don't follow


[23-Jan-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> yes, because it presumes everyone is guilty until proven otherwise.


[23-Jan-19 05:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> :PeepoThink:


[23-Jan-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> if kyc presumed us guilty, why are we most of us still able to our banks, paypal, and, western union accounts.


[23-Jan-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> as i said before, you're a very privileged prisoner


[23-Jan-19 05:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Can we agree there are extremes to KYC?


[23-Jan-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> What about decentralized forms of KYC?


[23-Jan-19 05:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> what about unicorns?


[23-Jan-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I guess wake me up when we live in the blockchain utopia with no kyc and enforced anonymity for everyone.


[23-Jan-19 05:10 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I'll build some services for people üòÑ


[23-Jan-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Of course, integration with the current systems and structures will help, i'm not blaming you for doing so.


[23-Jan-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> I just can't accept KYC as something inherently good. It is not. It is the opposite of good.


[23-Jan-19 05:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I understand where you coming from. The philosophy of it.


[23-Jan-19 05:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> KYC just doesn't work in order to restrict crime. Drug dealer will never act by own name, he will find innocent relatives, friends, etc.  As well as a person suspected in financial crime  will open an offshore company  with a nominal director, who is clean and honest.


[23-Jan-19 05:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I understand what you mean, but you're also talking about extremes.


[23-Jan-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The reality is that it's not going away. So better KYC implementations need to come along that dont' put people's identities in the hands of hackers or centralized parties.


[23-Jan-19 05:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> There are many ways how to hide the real face, except blockchain.  May be honest people just don't think about it, but criminals know very well all these methods and use it successfully.


[23-Jan-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Those methods you point out are legal loopholes created by the financial system and governments that aid them.


[23-Jan-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> So in essence, people that use those loopholes don't break any laws. That isn't KYC's fault, it's the system.


[23-Jan-19 05:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> like i said, KYC is just a tool.


[23-Jan-19 05:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> And they don't care, because, again, they lie when they say that it is to catch the bad boys. The bad boys aren't fools. It is meant for the regular user, the innocent trader. To control them. To posses them. To subjugate them.


[23-Jan-19 05:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Basic KYC is knowing a persons identity. That could be on either extreme. It could be an encrypted hash that tells you this person is not on a criminal list but doesn't give you any further information, or it could give you every detail of their life. I lean towards kyc that doesn't give all the information.


[23-Jan-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> We're talking about unicorns again.


[23-Jan-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> If we talk about no kyc it's worst than unicorns


[23-Jan-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> because it's not going away


[23-Jan-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> No KYC was the default mode for life for centuries. It works.


[23-Jan-19 05:21 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> unless the world changes


[23-Jan-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Ok


[23-Jan-19 05:22 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> hanging witches also worked for centuries. but times change. now they burn witches through kyc lol


[23-Jan-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> It wasn't as bad as they want you to think üòÑ 
Remember the 50's in the USA?


[23-Jan-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> No ID required, almost for every aspect of life.


[23-Jan-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> the real theifs are the banksters

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> those are who we should be indicting. but without transparent systems that isn't happening.


[23-Jan-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> even with transparent systems there will be corruption


[23-Jan-19 05:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Banksters, just like with any other form of monopoly, only can exist if there is a government giving them authority and power. 
Problem is governments and sovereignty.


[23-Jan-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Exactcy! Main criminals  are  government,  law makers, courts, lawyers..i.e  system


[23-Jan-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> USA was meant to be the cure to this problem. Sadly it failed.


[23-Jan-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> You can't fight the system from the outside


[23-Jan-19 05:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Not a system that permeates everything


[23-Jan-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> True, that's why I accept working with KYC stuff for now, but I can't see it as anything but a necessary temporary evil.


[23-Jan-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> But the system is indeed broken. You can see it just be seeing how the rich live when compared to the majority of other people in the world.


[23-Jan-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I've experienced it in my country. It's disgusting.


[23-Jan-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> If you think about it, I am typing on a laptop that cost me about what it would cost a child in Peru what he wwill make working in the mines for 3 or 4 years.


[23-Jan-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> I agree with that, but always consider inertial forces. The system is not always to blame, but the history is.


[23-Jan-19 05:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> History and inertial culture.


[23-Jan-19 05:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> You learned how to deal with a computer. Where I am right now people live with cents in their pockets for months, but they would never accept a free lesson on programming or computers. They don't like it.


[23-Jan-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> something I feel strongly about doing is bringing technology to the kids that really could use it to make something of themselves. if everything goes as planned it will be something the project will encourage.


[23-Jan-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It's tough though because they live in such a different mental state too.


[23-Jan-19 05:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> So out of 100 you might reach 1 or 2 but that's I think good. it changes perceptions.


[23-Jan-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> It creates a new History.


[23-Jan-19 05:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> God's work.


[23-Jan-19 05:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> @PTYX  It isn't in Peru only. The system is broken around the world. Everywhere a few of thick law makers have everything by doing nothing


[23-Jan-19 05:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Yeah, I agree. It is everywhere.


[23-Jan-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Most poor people want to keep being poor. Sad truth. (coming from a former very poor boy).


[23-Jan-19 05:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> I understand that you must follow the system's requirements, including KYC and other attributes,  if you want to work as a  legal company,   No other way


[23-Jan-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I've come to the conclusion that it's a mental state


[23-Jan-19 05:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The daily routine and hustle doesn't allow for anything more than day to day planning


[23-Jan-19 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Most people live paycheck to paycheck. They get sucked into the credit thing. End up owing their entire lives


[23-Jan-19 05:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I was lucky to have never taken credit. I was even denied credit for not having any credit history.


[23-Jan-19 05:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It's like this everywhere. And until you break from that mental state it's difficult to think of anything different or think longterm. There are exceptions of course.


[23-Jan-19 05:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> I think this is also because of system: they try to keep people as uneducated in financial,  to force them do not think too much, only work day by day


[23-Jan-19 05:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Like running in infinity circle


[23-Jan-19 05:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Oh definitely I agree with that. Keep the sheep blind


[23-Jan-19 05:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> And they have a reason to act so. I mean system, government. Because we feed them at least 1/3 of our work


[23-Jan-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Better to say 2/3


[23-Jan-19 05:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> In some EU countries is up to 60%


[23-Jan-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> That is just the official income tax.  But how many more  kinds of taxes there are!


[23-Jan-19 05:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> I drive every day, take gas for my car. Taxes are at least a half of gas price , for instance


[23-Jan-19 05:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Taxes are included in everything that we buy daily for our needs. Enduser pays all of them, i.e we pay


[23-Jan-19 05:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> So probably, it is much more than 60%, if assume all of this


[23-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Yeah i didn't take that into account. With taxes it's upwards to 75%


[23-Jan-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> or more in some countries


[23-Jan-19 05:59 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> that's pretty crazy to me.


[23-Jan-19 06:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Also add a tax for my house that is my own, for the piece of  land under the house  (which i bought at full price a while ago) üòÄ


[23-Jan-19 06:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> And there are many other taxes. There is not for air yet, fortunately


[23-Jan-19 06:09 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> But when i bring kids to school, need a doctor's help,  repair a road near my house, etc.  - i have to pay by myself for all of this. Nobody helps, nobody care.


[23-Jan-19 06:11 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Corrupted courts doesn't protect me too. That's why i hate this System. I just don't want to feed them


[23-Jan-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> nothing is your own


[23-Jan-19 06:13 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> not even yourself


[23-Jan-19 06:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> So i take KYC negatively too,  just as one of attributes of  this system. They must die all togever, all attributes, with no exception. Should went to history.


[23-Jan-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> We should go back to what it was before.


[23-Jan-19 06:17 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> Not long ago.


[23-Jan-19 06:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> It happens that people have short memory.


[23-Jan-19 06:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> People always used to dream get out of control, don't share hardly earned wealth.


[23-Jan-19 06:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Cryptocurrency is not the first attempt. There were several digital currencies, such as egold, liberty, etc. But all of them were squashed by system.


[23-Jan-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Blockchain gives us a real chance because of decentralization. Authorities may talk everything, but really they can not neither control nor destroy crypto


[23-Jan-19 06:33 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> So we should not help them by own hands, we should not bring these attributes such as KYC  to crypto.


[23-Jan-19 06:36 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> Well, everybody has a free choice what to think about this and what to do. The time will say the truth, as always.


[23-Jan-19 06:37 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> If you keep an elephant tied to a tree for long enough, it will learn to stay there when you say, even in absence of any ties.


[23-Jan-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> KYC is yet another "stay there where i say", but this time there are no ties.


[23-Jan-19 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> And we are the dumb elephant.


[23-Jan-19 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> The funny thing is, maybe the elephant is not dumb, and it's just pretending to obey.


[23-Jan-19 06:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> That's why i say "necessary temporary evil".


[23-Jan-19 06:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <stock999> At least we should not tie ourselves by own hands


[24-Jan-19 04:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <kalel> How do I register for the ICO?


[24-Jan-19 05:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @kalel we will release the purchase guide tomorrow which is a video tutorial that explains what you have to do. It's easy though. On February 1st you will navigate to ico.chainzilla.io and the buy button will be activated at 12 pm gmt.


[24-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <kalel> @PTYX Thanks for the prompt and clear response, I'm super excited to invest in this.


[24-Jan-19 05:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We all appreciate the support. In the coming week we are going to release the new version of Chameleon. Keep an eye out on that üòÑ


[24-Jan-19 05:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <kalel> Do all the transactions on Chameleon utilizes the NIX ghost protocol?


[24-Jan-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> No it doesn't but it's a possibility in the future. I chatted with matthew recently and he mentioned that there are some developments coming that they have been working on in regards to the dex manager.


[24-Jan-19 05:23 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Chameleon is in its initial phase and the goal was to design a good looking, easy to use, and easy to sell wallet.


[24-Jan-19 05:25 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It's one of the main tools we will use to offer other projects a managed or white-label solution when they launch their own token for whichever purpose. As Chameleon evolves, there will be more complex things added to it. After the ICO we will announce great news regarding an integration coming to the wallet which will make our wallet more usable.


[24-Jan-19 05:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <kalel> Wonderful, will be looking out for the new version in the coming weeks and the video tutorial tomorrow, cheers

[25-Jan-19 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> because people are idiots?


[25-Jan-19 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> So I figured a poll would give us a good idea what people really think

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Lol


[25-Jan-19 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Some are yes


[25-Jan-19 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> i guess its because he has money


[25-Jan-19 06:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> if he was broke he would have about 100 followers but he does have money

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Kardashian never went to jail


[25-Jan-19 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> but in all seriousness even if what he says is true the way he acts doesn't help him in anyway


[25-Jan-19 06:17 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> if you act the way he does most people won't take you seriously even if you are speaking the truth


[25-Jan-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I agree. His actions aren't that of someone who is trying to do good. It's of someone who is trying to save their ass


[25-Jan-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> People are now raising funds for his defense. Smh


[25-Jan-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> what are you serious?

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Yeah


[25-Jan-19 06:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <CombatWombat> so he makes money from shilling coins.. his followers prob lost money and now they are raising funds for him

[dscrd-cz] <Tac> @PTYX can we talk kmd dpos service in here


[25-Jan-19 11:12 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Tac> Or is there a more appropriate chanel


[25-Jan-19 11:19 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Tac there is a #komodo  channel but you can ask questions here too


[25-Jan-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Tac> @PTYX so I have seen the price calculations for what it costs to 51% attack a chain for an hour how would I find out that amount for new coins


[25-Jan-19 11:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> https://www.crypto51.app/


[25-Jan-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> For new coins it's a bit difficult but you can always reach out to them


[25-Jan-19 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Instel7> @Tac As far as I know, the cost would be proportional to the current hashrate the blockchain has


[25-Jan-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> You could take the new coin's hashrate and compare it with a similar coin


[25-Jan-19 11:37 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> if it's the same protocol you can get a ballpark figure of what an attack would cost. Most coins are just forks of major coins


[25-Jan-19 11:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> With dpow, the cost changes of course since it's creating checkpoint in the bitcoin blockchain.


[25-Jan-19 11:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Tac> The coin Is the same algorithm  an the new dpos that is using kmd gin


[25-Jan-19 11:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Tac> I would like to ask them about using kmd dpos but would like to have rough numbers before I do thank you @PTYX


[25-Jan-19 11:57 AM] PTYX#6840
I'll reach out to them


[25-Jan-19 11:58 AM] PTYX#6840
It would be good to be added up there

[dscrd-cz] <jellysmash> hi there good people


[25-Jan-19 02:42 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <jellysmash> what exchange(s) is Chainzilla trading on?


[25-Jan-19 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Interesting_Times_Ahead in digitalprice there are people trading but we haven't announced it as official yet. the coins in there were mostly deposited during the testing period. After the ICO we will give the go ahead on the exchanges we will be available.


[25-Jan-19 02:47 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The cryptopia hack was a blessing. We were going to be listed there


[25-Jan-19 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Im glad it happened before the ico.


[25-Jan-19 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> aa sorry


[25-Jan-19 02:48 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Interesting_Times_Ahead did you want to test chameleon?


[25-Jan-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Dont have time really - I am swarmed on my day job


[25-Jan-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> No problem, just wondering.


[25-Jan-19 02:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> would like to test but really dont have the energy and time for it


[25-Jan-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> You'll get to use it soon enough anyway as the official ChainZilla wallet üòÑ


[25-Jan-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Hope so


[25-Jan-19 02:50 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> This iteration implemented Agama seeds. So anyone with an agama wallet can use it. I'm very happy with the progress.


[25-Jan-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Are all tokens on-boarded by you gona be available in Chameleon  ?


[25-Jan-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> This version is much smoother than the last one.


[25-Jan-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Interesting_Times_Ahead yes, it's built into our pricing.


[25-Jan-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> Nice


[25-Jan-19 02:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The client has a choice of a whitelabel or managed wallet


[25-Jan-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Hungry_BullBear> what protections will the Chameleon wallet have (concerning phone hacks and malicious attacks) ?


[25-Jan-19 02:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> once we have the official release, we will begin the security audits as we are applying for PCI DSS


[25-Jan-19 02:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We aren't going to get stifled with it at the moment since all the frameworks we are using are open source. However, when the release version is ready, security is number 1 priority. In the coming month we will announce the news about what features will be coming to Chameleon and why we  will pursue the PCI DSS compliance.

We are also participating in the Binance Labs BUIDL competition for funding. So the team is busy making the presentations. As for the ICO, we will make an update on the next steps for those who participated and want to make refunds. At this rate, it doesn't seem we will make the minimum.

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @enfarktus it's unfortunate but we're not panicking. We'll publish an update in a few hours with the action plan.


[09-Feb-19 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> @PTYX i seem to remember that Chainzilla had an early stage funding round. so if i remember correctly, then you luckily have at least minimum funding and don't need to worry about completely shutting down. perhaps you can't do as much stuff as you'd like, but still you can keep going? keep up the good work!


[09-Feb-19 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Actually that's how chameleon came to be developed


[09-Feb-19 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We aren't stopping. What we are doing is changing the roadmap to reflect the priorities. Instead of expanding our app suite we will focus on polishing Chameleon and begin monetizing it.


[09-Feb-19 04:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <crumb> getting to positive cash flow is always a very good idea

ICO Update ‚Äì chainzilla ‚Äì Medium
First of all we would like to thank each and every community member that contributed to the token sale. It‚Äôs been one week since the ICO‚Ä¶

[09-Feb-19 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I'm super pumped about Cybertech. Chameleon can win that first place. There's a small money award but it's a seeding ground for VCs which is sponsored by the Israeli embassy.

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> After Cybertech it's off to the races with Binance Labs.


[10-Feb-19 11:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <RNI> @PTYX sad that it did not work üòü


[10-Feb-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Not enough people wanted to participate, i think it's not the result we wanted but it gives us an honest perspective of the market.


[10-Feb-19 11:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The plan is to adjust towards venture capital instead of token sale funds. We should have done that from the beginning in retrospect.


[10-Feb-19 11:23 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Those who hold ZILLA will be rewarded through Chameleon Pay. We will keep the token relevant and implement more solutions around the zilla chain.


[10-Feb-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We will keep everyone updated on the results of the startup competition we have enrolled in and any new partnerships. The dev team is waiting on an sdk to implement the giftcard and mobile phone refill purchase module.


[10-Feb-19 11:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I expect that to be implemented before the end of the quarter.


[10-Feb-19 11:26 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <enfarktus> Is there a bonus plan for ICO participants to prevent extradition?


[10-Feb-19 11:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> I have plans to reward the participants and zilla holders in general with a type of "stake reward" through Chameleon


[10-Feb-19 11:28 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We are still looking at different mechanisms to implement the reward feature but it's coming. The 1 M tokens designated for airdrops will be distributed through that mechanism to incentivize the use of the wallet and holding of the token.


[10-Feb-19 11:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Currently we are competing at CyberTech, Binance Labs, and NEM Ventures

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Even though it's not ideal, we are not going to throw in the towel. Several of our services and now wallet are ready to offer. We will focus on monetizing, fiat integration, and we will find venture capital funds in exchange for company equity.


[17-Feb-19 09:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <enfarktus> Will it be in the buy-back process?


[17-Feb-19 09:46 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> You can get a refund if you participated in the ICO but the plan is to keep developing and using the ZILLA chain as a means of rewards, payment, and hosting smart contracts in the future.


[17-Feb-19 09:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> The tokens that are in circulation will remain in circulation and we don't plan on carrying out any more token sales.

[17-Feb-19 09:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> It's not something we can do right now but it's definitely a possibility to create non-custodial contracts for payouts or exchanges through cryptoconditions

[dscrd-cz] <RNI> @PTYX  @Instel7  Hello! No its ok, i want to hold my zillas üëç 

Just one question.. i saw that being on digitalprice.io but no volume and no trading.. will it be removed from dp? are there any plans to be listed on any exchange some day?

yes and i hope you will win that final üòÉ


[20-Feb-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> There is not much volume on DP for most coins.


[20-Feb-19 12:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> @RNI


[20-Feb-19 12:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <RNI> yes you're right. but i thought it will only be traded after the ico sale. so zilla won't be delisted from DP?


[20-Feb-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <Emmanuel> i don't think so


[20-Feb-19 12:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <RNI> ok thank you


[20-Feb-19 01:05 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> No we won't be delisted, we are working on anothet exchange as well

[23-Feb-19 04:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @Umaru it gives you a seed that you can use to restore your funds. You va use the seed to export your privkey. We will add privatekey export in the future.


[23-Feb-19 04:33 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @stock999 yes, however, we didn't raise barely any funds. So we scratched all plans of making more apps. The priority is to polish Chameleon, integrate the purchase, Fiat, and exchange features so that we can monetize it.

The digital world in which agents live is called the Open Economic Framework (OEF).

[dscrd-cz] <roomba> PTYX why are there so many wallet companies? Guarda, pungo, agama, magnum. You guys are all part of komodo in some way, is this some type of divide and concur strat?


[27-Feb-19 04:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> @rainbro7 each service has their own wallet with its own purpose. Guarda and Magnum are third party wallet providers. We created Chameleon because we wanted to offer our clients an easy to use wallet with more functionality than coinomi.


[27-Feb-19 04:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Pungo has a whole ecosystem of products including a debit card, exchange, and escrow system. So they created a version of Agama to suite their needs. It might seem like the wallets are competing with one another but they complement the ecosystem.

[dscrd-cz] <RNI> that magnum wallet notification tool is awesome. any chance that this tool will be implemented in chameleon or agama too?


[07-Mar-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> Actually, it works with any address üòÑ


[07-Mar-19 10:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> so you can use it for a chameleon address. We have talked to magnum about our own bot but it's not a priority as of right now


[07-Mar-19 10:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-cz] <RNI> yes but you have to use magnum wallet. i didn't try that one out yet.

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> you can use the magnum notifier bot with an agama address as far as i know

[dscrd-cz] <RNI> ok thanks! i will try it out.

[dscrd-cz] <PTYX> We are planning on adding notifications as well but in-app and possibly telegram too. For the next 3 months we are focusing on polishing the graphical interface, adding some of the missing pieces in Chameleon, and add new coins. We are getting requests from several communities and have sealed a few deals already. So we are happy about that üòÑ

[dscrd-cz] <stock999> @groundhog @PTYX  These guys claim that they are an official Ledger dealer, i.e. the product is original.  But i have not found them in the  retailers list on Ledger site.  And i think that all official dealers should have the price  more or less the same, may be 1%-2% less as a discount, but  a discount 15%-20%  is too much.


[16-Mar-19 06:24 AM] Gateway#3763

[02-Aug-19 04:20 PM] Gateway#3763

Chameleon wallet is giving  Error unsupported protocol version: 1.2    It also will not claim rewards,    Error Not enough money to create transaction.   I did update the wallet, but the errors remain.  IOS version 3.0


[11-Aug-19 07:04 PM] PTYX#6840
@NNoperator ok thank you for pointing it out. we'll try to replicate on iOS. i've tested android and it's working.

[11-Aug-19 07:57 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
When enter to see the details of any tx and then return to the principal screen shows that message


[11-Aug-19 08:00 PM] PTYX#6840

Thank you for your assistance and tips on getting Chameleon happy PTYX.  It seems it may have just been my connection.  Switching from wifi to LTE cellular connection seems to make the error message go away.  Will claim reward later today to double check.

[16-Sep-19 09:07 AM] dan.#2473
what is the utility of zilla coin?


[16-Sep-19 09:13 AM] dan.#2473
@PTYX


[16-Sep-19 09:14 AM] PTYX#6840
@dan. we're creating more uses for the zilla coin but currently you can use it to receive lower rates for buying giftcards, the way it works is that if your wallet holds more than 500 zilla you get lower rates.


[16-Sep-19 09:14 AM] PTYX#6840
we are doing the same thing for our otc exchange called Moneyx which is in the process of launching


[16-Sep-19 09:14 AM] dan.#2473
oooh. i have like ~250 somehow, lol. How much of a discount


[16-Sep-19 09:15 AM] PTYX#6840
besides that, we're working on ad revenue paid in zilla


[16-Sep-19 09:15 AM] PTYX#6840
it's small discount, it's a little less than 1% of the cost which is basically our revenue for the purchase of a giftcard.


[16-Sep-19 09:16 AM] dan.#2473
gotcha.


[16-Sep-19 09:16 AM] dan.#2473
kyc?


[16-Sep-19 09:16 AM] PTYX#6840
nope


[16-Sep-19 09:16 AM] PTYX#6840
for the OTC desk there will be, for our in-app purchases there isn't


[16-Sep-19 09:16 AM] dan.#2473
coo. right on


[16-Sep-19 09:17 AM] PTYX#6840
oh, we also implemented a 5% fee for staking using Chameleon which is reduced to 2% for holding 500 or more zilla.


[16-Sep-19 09:17 AM] PTYX#6840
that will be valid for KMD, Dune, and Tezos staking.


[20-Sep-19 03:53 PM] PTYX#6840
@phideas we pushed an update, if you can check on your device and let us know if the crash you reported was fixed. Thank you.


[21-Sep-19 04:21 AM] phideas#8309
@PTYX latest update installed today. I can confirm the back button bug got fixed. Noticed few minor issues. 
- Pop up window shows up pretty often saying "Error failed to connect to electrum server"
- Main buttons haptic feedback is overkill, plz make it like all other buttons. Decent audio pop in normal mode, and silent when phone in silent or dnd mode.
