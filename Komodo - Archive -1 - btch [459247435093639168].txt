Did you guys want to bridge this channel to another discord channel? Let me know and we will get it done. I need an inivation link to your discord.


[21-Jun-18 07:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Audo this will replace our #btch Slack channel, so I don't think we need a bridge

@Mylo it's a komodo asset chain, so it's source code is KMD itself

[13-Jul-18 10:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Nobby2044 still here, and I would love to know, what would "other devs" do with BTCH ?


[13-Jul-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
I would add crypto conditions üòÉ


[13-Jul-18 11:40 AM] Nobby2044#8396
@dukeleto  are you looking to grow the team? It would be a real shame to ignore btch. I am aware you are busy on other projects but is there not anyone you'd trust to continue this?


[13-Jul-18 11:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Nobby2044 i have not heard from any devs wanting to do anything. Patches are always welcome. Do you want to add crypto conditions to BTCH? That would be great üòÉ


[13-Jul-18 11:46 AM] Nobby2044#8396
I know an incredible dev involved on a project at the moment. I won't mention the project here or who he is but it wouldn't hurt talking to him in the near future. @dukeleto Just an idea but I'd be happy to talk to him myself to see if I can get you 2 to have a discord meeting.

@Nobby2044 i always welcome experienced devs or people that want to genuinely learn to get involved. There is way more to do than I can work on, I am maybe only 1/777th as productive as jl777 . Basically, find an itch, and scratch it. That is how I got involved in free software + open source over 20 years ago


[13-Jul-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
actually crypto conditions is already in btch


[13-Jul-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
since it is in the KMD codebase


[13-Jul-18 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
what would be needed is a hardfork to enable ac_cc=1


[13-Jul-18 12:45 PM] Nobby2044#8396
What would be the pros and cons of doing this?


[13-Jul-18 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
my point is that without any specific btch development, all the improvements to komodo codebase is inherited


[13-Jul-18 02:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Nobby2044 BTCH inherits most/all features of KMD, but some features are related to the creation of the AC, specifically, the arguments that control all the options for the new AC

{Reactions}
üöÄ 

[13-Jul-18 02:23 PM] dukeleto#7326
when James and I created BTCH, there was no mining of AC's, and when we created BTCH, there was no CryptoConditions, so the current live chain does not have those features. If we recreated BTCH again, with these options, we would need to hardfork or maybe do a snapshot and airdrop onto the new chain to get those features.

[13-Jul-18 02:24 PM] Nobby2044#8396
Yes, even for someone with far far less technical knowledge than you guys I can see that.


[13-Jul-18 02:25 PM] Nobby2044#8396
I just would love to get this project out there more.

[13-Jul-18 02:28 PM] Nobby2044#8396
I hope this one day becomes a priority for you both in the future. A lot of time as gone into this and I believe there is a chance for huge growth. This is the time before the next crypto bull run.


[13-Jul-18 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810

Sounds like a great plan. But without something new. A new development in the btch world it won‚Äôt work. You‚Äôll need some new feature or something otherwise you‚Äôll get ‚Äúoh that dead coin blah blah‚Äù


[13-Jul-18 02:33 PM] Nobby2044#8396
The whole project is promising. I‚Äôm trying to buy some on coinexchange but my damn order isn‚Äôt being filled. Maybe I‚Äôm being too tight


[13-Jul-18 02:34 PM] Berg#2666
BTCH had great potential, it just needed funding to provide liquidity and marketing when the drop happened... CoinExchange alone will keep the coin in the grave until it's listed elsewhere.


[13-Jul-18 02:34 PM] Berg#2666

[13-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Nobby2044#8396
It needs to move forward with something yes. Then marketing, social media etc. New roadmap. At least a dev or 2 with some available time to work on it. That may not be as easy as it sounds.


[13-Jul-18 02:37 PM] Nobby2044#8396
Now is the key time. We know the bull will return.

I have 3x of what I had since airdrop


[14-Jul-18 06:54 PM] AkiraX#8269
@Nobby2044 how do you know the bull will return?


[14-Jul-18 10:28 PM] Nobby2044#8396
@AkiraX the bull run will 100% return. I‚Äôve held bitcoin for many years and seen this pattern before. Yes we may go lower but btc will destroy the $19,600 ATH for sure. All the institutional money is flowing in most of which will surely have been otc. Whether btch pumps or not is a different story. All we need here is some new development, roadmap and some people who can spend some time on this project. I think btch could be massive and I‚Äôm (trying) to accumulate now (if my damn buy order is filled).


[14-Jul-18 10:33 PM] Nobby2044#8396
When this bull returns we will without doubt see well over a trillion dollar crypto market cap. I‚Äôd be disappointed if btch doesn‚Äôt join the run and have huge increases. But again, we need some development and good news.


[15-Jul-18 07:23 AM] AkiraX#8269
Chances are. You probably already loaded the boat at 1700 :)

I am no way loaded up on btch at all. I have some but need more. I‚Äôm really interested. Need my orders filled.


[15-Jul-18 08:52 AM] Nobby2044#8396
Then I really think some planning needs to take place on where to take btch and finding people to help the devs. Seems more people are needed. I‚Äôm great on social media with projects and would love to help. I‚Äôm involved in a project now but can help in the near future

nothing stops BTCH from getting to where other bitcoin forks have, in fact it is the smallest blockchain among all the bitcoin forks

most of them have worth while block rewards


[15-Jul-18 11:45 AM] Alright#0419
so it leads to speculation on the price

Unfortunately BitcoinHush does not meet our requirements for listing at this time. Please feel free to re-apply when this project has become more established.

Sincerely,

[22-Jul-18 08:00 AM] Alright#0419
Might not be my place to suggest this, but has anyone considered relaunching BTCH with a worth while mining reward? Maybe airdrop to a new chain with initial supply of 2.1M and still have 21M max? Maybe make it a high % POS, so it doesn't detract from HUSH's or KMD's hashrate?


[22-Jul-18 08:00 AM] Alright#0419
Would be cool to see a POS chain in production once the tech is rock solid


[22-Jul-18 12:46 PM] Nobby2044#8396
@Alright sounds great but I think the main issue is having devs that have time to give to btch.


[22-Jul-18 12:48 PM] Nobby2044#8396
I see all the shit on coinmarketcap and they won‚Äôt list btch. The issue here is they see the 0 volume and lack of exchanges and not what btch is.


[22-Jul-18 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
I think lack of volume is partly due to it basically being a token as opposed to coin with mining rewards


[22-Jul-18 12:50 PM] Nobby2044#8396
Yes. True.


[23-Jul-18 06:52 AM] Berg#2666
I mean, I know KMD members are holding a ton of reserved BTCH, is there a dev fund that we can use to throw a 1 BTC listing fee towards getting on Crypto-Bridge or some medium exchange? I honestly believe that's the biggest thing BTCH is lacking behind marketing, nowhere to trade.

I am interested to hear from the community about what they think of this: BTCH does a hard-fork to a larger supply (to be determined) so that it can enable mining as well as cryptoconditions, and whatever else good stuff is available now in asset chains


[10-Aug-18 11:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
So, one theoretical scenario is BTCH forks to double it's supply (Satoshi's double vision) to 42M coins, and we make all the remaining 21M mineable via equihash. At the same time, we enable cryptoconditions so that BTCH can do all this cool smart contract stuff that James has been working on

{Reactions}
üçª 

[10-Aug-18 11:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
Doubling our supply does "dilute" current HODLers position, but if making BTCH minable + CC can more than double the price, it seems worth it. And since our price is so low right now, I could easily see this BTCH revival doing much more than a 2X.


[10-Aug-18 11:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
if BTCH had mining pools and all the culture/community that comes with mining, it probably would give us way better liquidity


[10-Aug-18 11:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
because miners will always want to sell, and traders will always want to speculate


[10-Aug-18 11:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am sure some people will not like the above ideas, but I think doing nothing is worse. It would be cool to mine BTCH on a z9

BTCH needs a revival, and I am 100% on board for this first step being taken. We'll have to peddle it around the community for further ideas, but this seems like the best way to get the ball rolling.


[10-Aug-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
I will support anything the community will want to do


[10-Aug-18 11:39 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I think a mineable BTCH is a great idea


[10-Aug-18 11:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
it seems that the downside risk is very small, and the upside is potentially very large


[10-Aug-18 11:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
so it seems we need to decide on specifics, like a new supply, and what the schedule for halving/etc will be


[10-Aug-18 11:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
the cryptoconditions part is easy, we just use `ac_cc=1` when creating the chain.


[10-Aug-18 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
make it ac_cc=2


[10-Aug-18 11:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
i think the biggest decision is how to change our supply


[10-Aug-18 11:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
oh, i wasn't sure what that did actually


[10-Aug-18 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
then it can be an oracle for cross chain usage


[10-Aug-18 11:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
sounds great


[10-Aug-18 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
ie. if BTCH store BTC Headers (see what i did) all the other chains can use that to verify BTC transactions


[10-Aug-18 11:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
awesome


[10-Aug-18 11:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
Doubling our supply and making all the new supply mineable seems to be one of the simpler possibilities, i am not sure about how the mining schedule should work tho


[10-Aug-18 11:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
BTCH was before AC's had mining and i haven't looked at all the mining options currently available when creating an AC

[10-Aug-18 01:45 PM] Berg#2666
I've been handed off the BTCH Twitter handle and plan on developing a marketing strategy to re-educate the public about Komodo upgrade inheritance and whatnot.


[10-Aug-18 01:46 PM] Berg#2666
Paired with the potential/planned developments I believe we'll gain some traction, but I agree that for the coin to gain traction it needs a half decent exchange to fall back on.

take a decimal place off of everyone's balance


[10-Aug-18 06:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright we can play all kinds of games like that, but makes the process more complex/edge cases/etc. With those numbers, you are allowing 90% to be mined, that is current HODLers being diluted to 10% of what they had


[10-Aug-18 06:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
and what about addresses with 1-9 satoshis?


[10-Aug-18 06:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are a hell of a lot of them, lol


[10-Aug-18 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
you won't attract many new miners if their mining efforts are dwarfed by the premine


[10-Aug-18 06:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
this is good feedback, i think we want to find a happy middle ground between people who currently hold BTCH and future miners


[10-Aug-18 06:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Alright if it's profitable as hell for them to mine BTCH on their z9's, does that really matter?


[10-Aug-18 06:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
a lot of BTCH is locked up in addresses from lost/deleted/gone BTC, there is actually a lot of BTCH that will never be used because of that


[10-Aug-18 06:15 PM] dukeleto#7326
there isn't some big pre-mine, there is none actually


[10-Aug-18 06:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
the currently supply of BTCH is, in theory, 21M, but taking into account all lost BTC, it is more like 15M most likely


[10-Aug-18 06:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
"accessible supply" or whatever


[10-Aug-18 06:17 PM] Alright#0419
if the purpose is to attract miners, I think you should make the current supply much less than the overall supply


[10-Aug-18 06:17 PM] Alright#0419
50% is a lot, just saying


[10-Aug-18 06:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
I wonder what current HODLers think of that


[10-Aug-18 06:18 PM] Alright#0419
You've heard from at least 1 üòõ


[10-Aug-18 06:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
if some BTCH HODLer knows they own 1% of BTCH supply and then we do this 90/10 as you suggest, they now own 0.1% of BTCH supply


[10-Aug-18 06:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
investors call that dilution and usually it scares them


[10-Aug-18 06:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you are purely a future miner, then that doesn't worry you


[10-Aug-18 06:19 PM] Alright#0419
I'm thinking as it as a miner


[10-Aug-18 06:19 PM] Alright#0419
"Will i actually want to mine this?"


[10-Aug-18 06:19 PM] dukeleto#7326
in theory, BTCH will easily fit into any znomp mining pool, there won't be technical issues to add it, like Verus


[10-Aug-18 06:20 PM] Alright#0419
yea, it's straight forward


[10-Aug-18 06:20 PM] Alright#0419
works like any other coin


[10-Aug-18 06:21 PM] dukeleto#7326
i think miners would always like more options


[10-Aug-18 06:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
and BTCH will be another option for z9's, and they can switch their miners to it if they want to specmine or when the price/difficulty is attractive to them


[10-Aug-18 06:22 PM] Alright#0419
make it POS? kind of appeases HODLers


[10-Aug-18 06:23 PM] Alright#0419
Another reason to make it POS is that it will likely detract from HUSH and KMD's hash rate


[10-Aug-18 06:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am not against it, it just sounds like a lot of work üòÉ


[10-Aug-18 06:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
and every new zcash fork that comes out, in theory, detracts from Hush/KMD hashrate. But we have asics flooding the market, so hashrates are increasing anyway


[10-Aug-18 06:25 PM] dukeleto#7326
mining BTCH will open a lot of doors, but long-term, what could bring a lot of inherent value to BTCH, is cryptoconditions


[10-Aug-18 06:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
if BTCH can do CC/smart contract stuff and talk to other KMD asset chains, well that is really freaking cool. That is unique to BTCH, Hush can't do that stuff (but maybe one day)


[10-Aug-18 06:26 PM] Alright#0419
the idea from jl is fucking cool


[10-Aug-18 06:26 PM] Alright#0419
if I understand it correctly at least


[10-Aug-18 06:26 PM] dukeleto#7326
which one? -ac_cc=2 ?


[10-Aug-18 06:26 PM] Alright#0419
essentially taking momom of BTC and storing it on BTCH


[10-Aug-18 06:26 PM] Alright#0419
so other assetchains can check BTCH to see if a transaction happened on BTC


[10-Aug-18 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
oh gosh that sounds nice


[10-Aug-18 06:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
i saw him say something like that but I didn't fully grasp it

Yea me either üòÇ


[10-Aug-18 06:27 PM] Alright#0419

ü§∑


[10-Aug-18 06:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
i really like it, it sounds like it gives BTCH a reason to live, a unique purpose that sets it aside. And it's a resource to other AC's, and we keep getting more


[10-Aug-18 06:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
if we changed supply to 147M, then current supply would be 1/7th of total, which leaves about 86% to be mined. Just a datapoint, i think bringing a few different options to the community and seeing how the feel is going to happen soon, maybe some kind of vote


[10-Aug-18 06:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
if we don't have to change the satoshi amounts of any address, that makes the whole process a lot easier


[10-Aug-18 07:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
There needs to be a more immediate "need" for the coin for it to get some traction.   I like the MoMoM btc headers idea but how long til there is a enough cross chain contracts that would utilize it .  Needs a renaming too.


[11-Aug-18 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it can be 100% PoS coin, but then no miners


[11-Aug-18 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
BTCH is a decent name for a chain with BTC headers

Don't you think supply should be doubled at max? I have 200k btch an would be pretty annoyed that this would be reduced 10*


[11-Aug-18 03:01 AM] Francis#7833
I'm an investor not a miner


[11-Aug-18 08:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Francis that was my initial gut reaction as well, minimize dilution. Miners and current HODLers don't quite have the same incentives for how the supply change will work


[11-Aug-18 08:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Francis also, you have more than the BTCH dev fund, nicely done üòÉ


[11-Aug-18 08:12 AM] Francis#7833
From what you guys have been saying it does sound like a good idea and could be worth it in the long run. Just as you say I think minimise dilution. Atleast if the supply is doubled soon, the prices would remain cheap so purchasing more wouldn't be a crazy expense


[11-Aug-18 08:12 AM] Francis#7833
Also üòÇüòÇüòÇ I'm just going to keep buying more tbh. I have faith

@Francis that means a lot, thanks for believing in us

@Francis if it were POS, you'd likely be the single largest staker, getting the majority of blocks


[11-Aug-18 11:39 AM] Francis#7833
True that but that's also kinda harsh on everyone else no? I really don't mind just as long as my holdings aren't diluted by more than half really


[11-Aug-18 11:40 AM] Francis#7833
@Alright


[11-Aug-18 11:41 AM] Alright#0419
it's only harsh to people that don't bother to stake


[11-Aug-18 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
if it's 100% POS, you'll statistically continue to hold the same % of the supply if you stake the coins you have

I think @Alright is right I‚Äôm thinking we need a high % of PoW blocks to come, so that miners will be interested. And clearly James‚Äôs headers idea is brilliant as well. I think your idea of 147mil coins @dukeleto sounds nice. Or something around that range. Some good halving points count be used as well to keep the PoW alive for years to come, like BTC.


[12-Aug-18 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
what about a 50% PoS and 50% PoW chain? that would allow the people will active stakes to maintain their percentage of total supply, while also allowing new miners to also achieve large positions

{Reactions}
üôè üëç 

[12-Aug-18 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the ultimate coin supply would be secondary with a 50/50 chain


[12-Aug-18 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
can also be 60/40 or 40/60, etc


[12-Aug-18 03:07 PM] xRobeSx#5136
That sounds like the best option


[12-Aug-18 10:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am not sure exactly how we would do 50% PoS/PoW, but it sounds interesting. Verus has certainly done a lot of work in the area that could be built upon


[12-Aug-18 10:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
has any coin forked from 100% PoW to 50% PoS/PoW? It would be interesting to see how the went about it


[13-Aug-18 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
-ac_staked=50 <- 50% PoS


[13-Aug-18 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
-ac_staked=60 <- 60% PoS


[13-Aug-18 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty easy to set the PoS/PoW percentage


[13-Aug-18 01:43 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD has -ac_staked option before verus, which uses a totally difrerent method of balancing. we have tested 90%, 100%, 50%, 10% and a few other -ac_staked percentages and unless there is another attack vector found, we should be good at any percentage.


[13-Aug-18 01:45 AM] jl777c#5810
I think using the -ac_* options quite a large percentage of all the other coin emissions can be replicated,plus a lot of new ones


[13-Aug-18 06:45 AM] xRobeSx#5136
@dukeleto we're about to start a new PoS/PoW chain for testing in Chips #pos64test channel

yes, we have plans for BTCH hardfork to activate CC and enable mining, maybe 50/50 PoW/PoS

[18-Aug-18 02:12 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
Just an idea - but it would be nice to be able to build an "assetchain" -cli direct from the source (btch-cli).
Using the command switches from the komodo-cli makes integration into existing add-ons (like wallets) an extra step most don't want to take.
Same is true of the daemon - having to create a scrip or remember startup switches is tedious - it must be possible to add these to the build script - a Bounty opportunity?


[18-Aug-18 04:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Bar_F1sh_Rel cd src/; ./fiat/btch help


[18-Aug-18 04:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
all assetchains have a ./fiat/ac wrapper


[18-Aug-18 04:41 AM] Bar_F1sh_Rel#0834
@dukeleto - yeah - but that is still just a script call to komodo-cli with wildcards accepted.
What is needed is a native btch-cli - as the wrapped script breaks calls in GUI's like swing.


[18-Aug-18 06:51 AM] pbca26#5430
i think verus already done something similar in verusd and verus-cli
but it will only work on mac/linux and those are also just a few shell scripts


[18-Aug-18 10:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Bar_F1sh_Rel `as the wrapped script breaks calls in GUI's like swing` sounds like a bug in the GUI


[18-Aug-18 10:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
verus-cli is just a wrapper around komodo-cli


[19-Aug-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
I came up with an MGW CC contract and plan to use BTCH to be the chain where the BTC token is issued. with the built in DEX for onchain assets against BTCH, it can create a good solution for speedy trading. it is a single chain atomic swap DEX
the redeem will be a transfer of the BTC assets back to real BTC, which will rely on user specified notaries
eventually can make it so the BTCH BTC token can be transferred to other CC enabled chains, but that would likely be next year

[20-Aug-18 05:40 AM] Berg#2666
Apparently LiveCoin BTCH is selling at $0.003 when CoinExchange is at $0.10....

We're being thrown off by "BitHash" I believe, same ticker symbol, likely confused for duplicate BTCH's.. We must establish dominance.

I added a -ac_ccactivate=height param to test branch of komodod. that means the community can decide when to activate the CC functionality. now all nodes would need to update, including exchanges, explorers, etc. as it is a dynamic hardforking

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Takoy_Nahal raise transaction fees. Some (semi-centralized) currencies work that way. IOTA and Waves are examples. Other way would probably be to burn unclaimed coins. How many of them have been claimed already? 10% of total supply? Set a time limit of 6 or 12 months and than burn unclaimed. From that point on you can probably continue with POW. Otherwise BTCH airdrop make no sense. Also, current name of coin is Bitcoin Hush. Bitcoin-Hush. Bitcoin. We all know what is maximum supply for BTC. ZEC (BTC's fork) and HUSH (ZEC's fork) remain with 21 mio. It's part of identity and it should be part of promotion and marketing.


[01-Sep-18 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> I'm not a developer, maybe your idea is sound. But it's still fork Komodo, and KMD is already 100 million, but its value in the bear market is not low


[01-Sep-18 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I'm also not a developer. BTCH is not KMD fork, it is KMD asset chain. With total suppy of BTCH market capitalization would be 1-3 million, with circulating supply it is some 100k $. Tell BTC whales (centralized exchanges) you will burn their shitcoin and some will claim it and do something with it. That is a way to increase market volume and price and it no longer is shitcoin. And even if 25 or 50 % of BTCH would be claimed it will still leave significant room for POW. Also you should know that 5-6 million of already mined BTC is lost in space, so nobady will claim those forks.


[01-Sep-18 11:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @halo kitty rules Yes you are right< my mistake, asset chain. I think we will know about it soon


[04-Sep-18 07:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> A huge thank you to @noashh for getting the BTCH bridge up and running. Komodo's Discord BTCH channel is now tethered to this one üòÉ

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> BitexBay rep just reached out to me.
Offered a BTC pair listing at 0.15 BTC
https://www.bitexbay.com/
^ I usually don't go for this kind of stuff, but BitexBay is not a bad exchange, and that listing price is extremely attractive.
As long as we can vet the legitimacy, which he gave me an official email to reach out to, I don't see why BTCH/HUSH wouldn't be interested. I believe our listing donations could cover a decent amount of a single pair.

[08-Sep-18 09:11 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Art0077> why you need exchange, hush already has good exchange cryptopia. To go for better exchange hush needs a lot more volume but now nobody is buying because this coin has nothing to offer - no value at all.


[08-Sep-18 09:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @Art007  and who on Cryptopia offers value?


[08-Sep-18 04:53 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Zatoichi> project left by the devs?


[09-Sep-18 07:52 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @Art0077 this is the BTCH discussion, and BTCH does need exchanges.


[09-Sep-18 07:53 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @Zatoichi Project is more alive than ever. It's a runtime fork of Komodo, meaning it inherits upgrades that the Komodo team makes to KMD, meaning it is also constantly being developed.


[09-Sep-18 08:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> While speaking about exchanges and Cryptopia... What about Cryptopia? They look generous last months. They supported SUMO fork few months ago and enlisted forked coin for free (SUMO team was complaining about that). They will also support upcoming BTC/ZCL fork. Who knows, maybe they can offer you a nice discount or maybe list BTCH for free. Don't forget: at BTCH snapshot there was close to 200k HUSH on selling side of BTC/HUSH trading pair. Also the biggest whale at BTCH snapshot time had more than 700k HUSH on 1 address, if I remember right. That should be Cryptopia so anyway they are one of the biggest BTCH whales, if not no. 1 (of course, if they claim coins). So they could be interested...


[09-Sep-18 09:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> ok, sure. please convince crytopia to list for free and let us know when they agree to it


[09-Sep-18 09:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> you make it sound so easy, but I have a feeling it might be a bit difficult to achieve. I can offer a 10,000 BTCH bounty if you can convince crytopia to list for free.


[09-Sep-18 09:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> According to my calculations, the listing  on Cryptopia costs 6.24 BTC


[09-Sep-18 09:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Correct, that's a full price at current DOT levels. Who knows, I just made a suggestion. Asking is for free:) They know HUSH and may be listening to you.

[09-Sep-18 09:59 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> They may be interested in POS from which they will receive coins, because Cryptopia, unlike Bleutrade, does not practice distributing POS to its customers. I hope they do not read Discord)


[09-Sep-18 10:00 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> They would be absolutely interested in POS. To distribute coins to themselves. That's why I'm not interested in POS.

[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @daanoontjeh Apparently, none of the developers do not want to disclose their account on Bittrex)


[11-Sep-18 10:12 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Yes, they would like to hide their BTCH balances.


[12-Sep-18 06:30 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> @daanoontjeh I've already inquired about Bittrex a billion times


[12-Sep-18 06:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Not actually a billion, but I've been waiting until we have a new release to make the project more appealing for them to list.


[12-Sep-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> If so let's take project more appealing. Even Bittrex is not necessarily for BTCH, it would be nice to be there. Now let's get back to talks about mining/coin supply. I will share some of my opinions. You don't have to agree with them, but your view would be wellcome, because it might help create directions.

I'm a strong supporter of 21 million maximum supply. Just because a fact that number is a notable mark, a brand. The brand, widely recognized. As I stated once before it should be a part of promotion and marketing.


[12-Sep-18 07:31 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> It would be great if you can burn unclaimed coins and leave burnt UTXOs for mining (are burnt UTXOs technically still UTXOs? They were once spent‚Ä¶ No matter). There should be a chain split or something for it, where you make ÀùoldÀù chain invalid and from where on you can set new/old circulating supply. A fork, which you would do anyway, if you want to increase total supply. Of course you anounce burning, but you don't have to be too loud. Contact loyal exchanges, put it on ANN and do it. Community win, loyal exchanges win, coin win and yet nobody lose. You don't steal anything from anybody. It's a owner's justice not to claim his property. And it's owner's fault if he ruin his property due to bad management. 
BTCH value is insignificant for BTC owners. BTC whales will not go through process of claiming for a few bucks. Out there are, how many?, 50, 70 or whatever BTC forks and for tham BTCH is yet another one they never heard before. It may be unpopular opinion but it's just a truth. At very best case it is whale's shitcoin to rid of and go away.


[12-Sep-18 07:32 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> With burning unclaimed coins you achieve:
1. Planty of space for mining, no matter it is POW, POS, masternodes‚Ä¶
2. Data about realistic circulating supply. Once coin on CMC it would be very usefull information.
3. Great starting point for all kinds of negotiations (!discounts! and much more) with exchanges.
4. Possibility for another atractive forks, which stays under 21 million total supply (BTCH+HUSH, BTCH+other alts, maybe BTCH+BTC).

Point 4 isn't as shitty as it sounds. There is a bear thrend out there with bottom in dec 2018/jan 2019. Then everything will be much easier, but yet slow recovery is awaited. No matter what you do now, prices of coins will keep falling. You don't have to hurry with HUSH-ng, messanger and those things. It not affect prices almost at all. But one day you will need BTC/fiat for bigger things. With all respect to team behind HUSH/BTCH, one day you will have to pay employees (part or full time), promotoins, marketing, development, bussiness trips etc. If not, your currencies will stay in shadows and/or die. So one day you will have to cash out developing funds. Sell those funds properly. Another hard fork with new coin (and a project behind) can help you. Right time for it would be 2020 +/- 1 year, but you should think about it today, if going in that direction.
Well, now you can throw it up‚Ä¶


[12-Sep-18 07:39 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> I am 100% on board with not increasing the supply if it's possible to avoid doing so. We'll have to see what duke and JL have to say about the coin burning possibility, or decimal movement or whatever can be accomplished. I do agree that 42MM supply would bring negative attention from purists that believe all BTC forks should have 21MM supply. We'll have to see what devs can do or what their opinions on it are.


[12-Sep-18 11:58 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Ok, And what about Ethereum with 100 million supply, or Komodo 100 million, or pivx -56 million, and many many coins with not low price?)


[12-Sep-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> if anything coins with really large supplys end up overpriced as a lot of traders confuse a low price per coin as being a good price


[12-Sep-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> but ultimately it is the marketcap that is the only market "price" that should matter, and considering how irrational pricings have been, not really much validity


[12-Sep-18 01:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> remember when everybody knew bitconnect was a scam, but it was trading for over a billion marketcap?


[12-Sep-18 01:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> actual marketprice is not rational


[12-Sep-18 01:52 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Good advertising and hype are good move the price of the coin, despite its quantity


[12-Sep-18 02:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> not so sure,I think when the price moves, people just call whatever happened as advertising and hype


[12-Sep-18 02:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> many coins have tried to advertise to gain marketcap and spent millions, but now are almost forgotten. think of all the ETH ICOs doing the prominent advertising, using funds raised to pump their price is probably what has made the price move


[12-Sep-18 02:03 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> what builds a coins price is a dedicated community and long term holders


[12-Sep-18 02:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> pump and dumps create a lot of people that lose money and become less likely to stay around, while the ones orchestraring the pump and dump are making big money andmoving to the next coin


[12-Sep-18 02:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Until the crypto currency is included in everyday life in all countries, such manipulators will continue to organize pumps and dumps. But you are right, most of the famous projects did not do anything ordinary, and many went into oblivion, leaving themselves only a loud echo of the past. For me personally, the technical side of the project is important.
Really behind this project there is a technology, the pursuit of such pacifiers as Bitconnect leads to collapse.
However, if we return to the magic number of 21 million, if BTCH shows its special uniqueness and usefulness in the future development of the blockchain, I think 42 million will not be a problem for him to have a good price


[13-Sep-18 12:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> something like 16 million BTCH in BTC people's addresses, so realistically vast majority of that is inactive. However, to just take away their coins seems a bigger violation to me, than to increase the theoretical supply. If the current active supply is 6 million, then maybe we can cap at 36 million. basically to target the total active coins to be 21 million. If the dormant 16 million wakes up, that would mean that BTCH is worth enough to bother to do that, which seems a good thing


[13-Sep-18 02:16 AM] 9oklp#8901
I agree with jl777, confiscating inactive btch is really bad karma, the goal should be to create enough activity around btch that the sl√®eping coins wake up , imagine if Roger Ver or a similar sized whale heard of btch and got interested only to find his stash had been absorbed for miners.


[13-Sep-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> In any case, to deprive the sleeping holders of BTCH would be unfair, can go negative in the twitter and other places. If there is an equilibrium solution where BTCH will be 36 million why not. The main thing is that there was a lot of interest for POW and POS miners and a big profit in the first stages


[13-Sep-18 04:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> At Coinexchange there are 50k BTCH in selling book at that moment. I know one BTCH whale is also smuggling around. In august he dumped around 50k BTCH to as low as cca. 600 satoshis with 44k BTCH being ÀùboughtÀù at lowest point. I remember because I cought a pieces at sellout. He immediately moved those 44k into the sky-high in sell order and later moved it ‚Äì it is 1 entity. So at BTCH's leading exchange there is 1 significant ÀùtraderÀù and there are probably less than 200k coins stored. Comparing to HUSH appereance on exchanges it could mean less than 1 million BTCH has already been claimed. Number of claimed coins really depends on HUSH whale with 700k coins at snapshot time - if he claimed, real circulating supply could be as high as 2 million. If devs have information about exact number of claimed coins, that information would be really useful for our orientation.


[13-Sep-18 04:49 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Go ahead: trading volume is at its peaks few 100 USD/day and few 10 USD/day at average, while market capitalization is 1-2 million USD. I found that weird and if I would not know a coin's story/fundamentals/team/potential, I would not touch that coin in reality or even dreams. Average trader don't read whitepapers and these things so he would not buy BTCH. That all combines to very unattractive allaround market situation with BTCH. I think the largest part of that is because of ÀùphantomicÀù BTCH, means the ones formally in existence but in fact not-in-existance. Those coins makes fear of once being claimed. If I'm sure they will not come into existence, I would immediately claim cheapest selling orders and increase amount of BTC on my buying orders. With potential of millions ÀùnewÀù coins coming to market at any time, I will for sure not do that. And for sure I'm not the only one. Without liquidating phantomic coins it will not get much better. That's why I suggest coin burning.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> If burning would happen it would be weird or unusual, but it makes sense. And I'm conviced burning is not stealing. For example, if it would happen on 1st of february 2019 that would be 1 year since snapshot. More than enough time for claiming. If burning would not take place and one day BTCH would somehow be a sucess story, phantomic BTCH would become real BTCH and ruin the market. That would be a lamb for the lazy wolf and punishment for those creating the story. Would you really put hundreds or thousands of hours into a project and latter be nailed? And if speaking of Roger Ver, he would probably look behind and found burning was cruical and act of good and responsible management. If not is his problem - at current time he has as much chances as anybody. If burning will not occur he will probably never heard of BTCH. I don't think you would like to see this. If he would still like a coin's specs, he should gladly bought it. Burning could very likely be a difference maker between stories of success and disaster and I think it is by far best option available.

[dscrd-hush] <Zatoichi> Bad stuff happen to coins when greediness pushes devs to produce many coins. Insane greediness, greedy hopes and expectations, lack of work on the tech, this all leads to failures.

[13-Sep-18 04:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> @halo kitty rules Your words are true, as you see JL777 is considering this option, maybe BTCH will go along the way of burning unclaimed coins


[13-Sep-18 05:04 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Takoy_Nahal it's not a point it must be mine version for mine/supply adjustment. It should be the best version that is accepted. And I see a lot of +'s and few -'s with that option.


[13-Sep-18 06:41 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> BTCH cant be burned as it was a snapshot. if you have the original privkey, you can access the BTCH


[13-Sep-18 06:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> that means satoshi's keys will give him access to the 1 million (or so ) BTCH


[13-Sep-18 07:09 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> If it is impossible to burn, then it makes no sense to argue and approve 42 million more, especially not so much, active investors will transfer their coins to a agama wallet and will be compensated with the POS mining


[13-Sep-18 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
it was never proposed to have 42 million more, just a total of 42 million or 21 million more. but I think if that is reduced to 15 million more, it will get close to a 21 million active supply (barring all the BTC whales accessing the BTCH, but that only happens in the good scenarios so doesnt seem like any danger issue)


[13-Sep-18 08:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> total 42 million

[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> I was wrong in the text


[14-Sep-18 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> There is no need to make a decision immediately. Rather than make a ÀùwhateverÀù decision make a good decision. Just increasing maximum supply seems like a poor choice. It only enables mining. Miners might be happy with increasing, but they would be mining even MyGrandmaCoin if existed. I still think for BTCH it would be extremely healthy to find a way for throwing phantomic coins out of game. Just increasing a total supply doesn't solve that. Let us know if the rest of you think throwing phantoms out would be healthy. If so we may together find a way. @jl777c do you have a data about amount of claimed coins? It would be useful for discussion.


[14-Sep-18 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> there is no way to know how many have claimed the coins, as there is no need to do any transactions


[14-Sep-18 06:21 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> we can only guess that most of the BTC whales have not


[14-Sep-18 11:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I was thinking Agama has some answers. Anyway, % of claimed coins is within few million. I've got an idea, crazy even for my standards. But today I don't have a time to write it properly, I 'll write it during weekend, you just shouldn't make a final decision until you hear it.


[14-Sep-18 11:06 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> My bad: % of claimed is low, realistic circulating supply is within few million.

As no one opposed my opinion about phantomic (non-claimed) BTCH choking claimed BTCH, some might agree with me. I kept digging on. And as we all are philantropists, we would not like to see mr. Ver and mr. Nakamoto would stay without their BTCH. Please send a message with text  #helpRoger and donate for poor magnate, who lost millions of USD in 2018. You can also donate crypto:

[15-Sep-18 04:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Snapshot's private key owners should be benefited with BTCH. OK. Claimed BTCH should take over. OK? Here is a way: you can switch around inbalance between ÀùrealÀù and ÀùphantomicÀù BTCH with ÀùfrenzyÀù POS. POS could be as high as you want, billions and billions % per very small time period (second etc.). Literally unlimited. As BTCH doesn't have cold-staking options, balance within ÀùsanctuaryÀù would be credited with additional BTCH values, while the rest of them would not be credited. As term sanctuary (or sanctuaries) I mean storing place (or places) like Agama, exchanges, web wallets‚Ä¶ whatever you choose as suitable place and enables you interventions.
Case 1. Just for easier immagination I'll presume there would be 5 million BTCH claimed and in sanctuaries. 16 million BTCH would be unclaimed or not in sanctuaries at time of inbalance switch (I'll call it fork time). At this moment amount of claimed BTCH is much lower as I take into account indirect evidences, but it should at least slightly increase. For purposes of simplifying I will forget unmined coins for a moment. I repeat: stated numbers are just for our easier immagination and have low probability to be accurate at fork time. So, at fork time you change maximum supply to unlimited or very high, switch on frenzy POS and multiply sanctuaries' BTCH. You can choose any value you want. If you are happy with 20 million as new total claimed supply, choose 20 million. If you would like 500 million, choose 500 million and so on. With POS % and time you achieve any value you choose. For easier intervening you can set temporarily supply limit to targeted value, switch on POS and later change limits again.


[15-Sep-18 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> When achieved choosen ratio, now you set new maximum supply (if not set before) and mining conditions. For example, 16 millions BTCH stayed out of sanctuaries and 64 million is new sum of claimed coins (total sum 80 million). That ratio is 1:4, which is simmilar with BTC's phantoms:non-phantoms ratio. Now you set maximum supply to any number (100, 500, 21.000‚Ä¶ million) and reset mining algorithm to the one of your choice (POW, POS, hybrid‚Ä¶).
What this mechanism doesn't match is 21 million total supply. What this mechanism match is it enables mr. Ver to claim his coins at any time with the same amount as proposed at BTCH-original creating time. Of course, mr. Ver has maybe already claimed his coins. Maybe he is the guy who dumped them at Coinexchange.


[15-Sep-18 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Everything written above is too simple. Why would you make it simple if you can make it complicated? We still haven't reach 21 million total supply yet. This number is not necessarily to achieve, but it would be favorable as some agreed with me. So we 'll try to get there, but I can't promise we will actually come.
Case 2. Let's take same numbers (ratios) as at start in upper case. Now we will not start in sanctuaries. First intervention would be to change limits downside. Divide  total supply with high enough divider. Let's say divider is 100.000 and now total supply is 210 BTCH. Now we shall move to sanctuary as in Case 1. Now there are 50 BTCH in sanctuaries and 160 BTCH outside. Next you remove maximum supply and turn on frenzy POS. Multiply BTCH in sanctuaries to choosen amount (ratio), turn off POS and set new maximum supply (why not 21 million?). With this model you can go in theory to really low circulating supply, which I personally am not fan of. New system shouldn't be mining festival, it only should repair BTCH shortcomings (again, that's just me). Paper sheet also enables new amount of BTCH as low as 1 BTCH or even 0.00000001 BTCH. But it would still leave mr. Ver option to claim his coins and that is most important.


[15-Sep-18 04:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> But that's just a paper sheet. I'm not a programmer/developer and I don't know if decimating in step 1 is possible. I don't know if in reallity it's possible to divide low balances and especially as low as 0.00000001 original BTCH. That's why developers are into existence. Tell us. There is a crowd of like 5 people overall which are interested  in that topic. Maybe increasing block size can help? Maybe a key would be increasing block size for a time of dividing and then returning to old block size?

Case 3. Case 3 is actually hybrid of Case 1 and Case 2. As Case 2 could be impossible to implement, Case 3 should take us to switch phantomic's inbalance and also achieve 21 million total supply. In first step of Case 3 we completely repeat Case 1. With favorable BTCH's ratio act of decimating should take place. It enables you to reset circulating supply to values below 21 million. Compared to Case 2 it should be easier to operate with Case 3. While it could be a problem to divide first and then multiply, in reverse order it could be slightly easier. That's the way rounding works.

Well, you got a point. With multiplying-dividing of supplies you can reach a heaven. With POS of only a part of coins (which work like an airdrop) you could change ratios between phantomic and non-phantomic coins. Let me know why I'm wrong and we can together find a better solution.


[15-Sep-18 12:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <paia> Please, read again, what jl777c wrote yesterday - there is NO WAY to know, how many coins have been "claimed". The word "claimed" does not apply for airdrops. You have your private key - you can access your coins already stored in blockchain. There is NO TRANSACTION for this action. So please again, stop talking about "burning unclaimed coins", because thats nonsense.


[15-Sep-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Can they claimed their BTCH at 2028?


[15-Sep-18 01:07 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <paia> if the blockchain is available, you can always access your BTCH with your HUSH/SUPERNET/DEX/BTC private key.


[15-Sep-18 01:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> ok, as I thought BTCH can be picked up before the onset of Armageddon of Earth)


[15-Sep-18 07:41 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Takoy_Nahal they can claim their BTCH as long as coin is still hanging around. But only in Case 1 they would get 1:1 AMOUNT (compared to their current amount) and in neither of cases they would get 1:1 RATIO compared to their today's ratio of total BTCH. Also, in theory numerous variations of transformations are possible, but maybe not all of them are technically feasible.

[16-Sep-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> The reality is that technically most BTCH coins are already burned. Most BTC wallets will have either lost their private keys, or will never have claimed BTCH even if the platform becomes popular because a lot of people using wallets for small transactions will likely not bother with claiming until much later in the future (at a point where they will either likely have forgotten their keys or have died of natural causes [natural death rate considered, such as accidents, disease, etc].


[16-Sep-18 06:38 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> And any known burned BTC also factors into that math.

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> ^ That is exactly why I haven't reached out to them in approximately two months, we had reached out beforehand but I figured proof of progress would give us a leg up.

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> BTCH is planned to be supported by NG as well.


[17-Sep-18 12:55 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> But as far as BTCH getting on Bittrex, I'd say there's no realistic chance right now. Hush has somewhat of a shot with NG and dPoW

[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> That's what I think too... Hush has a much better chance of getting listed once the messenger is ready

[17-Sep-18 12:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> If you think that it's too early for BTCH to be published on Bittrex, can it wait?


[17-Sep-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> IMO, let's first wait for completion of messenger and then get hush listed. After that, there'll be more understanding of the messenger and btch listing application would make more sense.


[17-Sep-18 01:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Raja_MBZ> Just my opinion though.


[17-Sep-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> BTCH at least needs to revitalization done in my personal opinion. Once mining and algorithms are worked out and we have some traction back it'd be worth giving a shot. We wouldn't really want to be listed just to have an instant hardfork


[17-Sep-18 01:02 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> Plus I don't think BTCH is an attractive project to an exchange of that magnitude yet, we'll build up to it as the ball gets rolling on the upcoming changes.


[17-Sep-18 01:08 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> Well, I agree that the best candidate is HUSH, probably really it is worth waiting for the release of the messenger to come to Bittrex and say: Guys see what a unique and interesting project I have, you must have to list me!)

[dscrd-hush] <Dochteur> So would it be a good idea to stockpile some available BTCH traded at coinxchange for future staking? Would it be announced at the BTCH main site, once available, or just via discord? What amount of it would make any sense to make reasonable passive income from it before it hits next bull market prices?


[19-Nov-18 11:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Dochteur amount is relative term, but I would not recommend you more than few % of your portfolio. As future directions of coin are unclear I consider it as high risk investment. Possible high reward one, but also high risk. I am also buying, but it will be a long way before the final destination. The main argument why team has to do something with the coin? They are holding a big bag (150k coins of dev funds) which should be around 10% (+/- 5%) of realistic circulating supply. At one stage they will have to unload them, so it should motivate a team to do something with that bag.

[06-Dec-18 01:01 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Takoy_Nahal , @Berg , were you recently in contact with Cryptopia about opening BTCH markets? What are Cryptopia's conditions? It's possible they don't know anything about BTCH progress. As there were dozens of forks that days it's also possible they forgot BTCH fork occured. I would imagine they don't follow the progress of unknown forks. People come and go, it's possible they have other people in charge now compared to january/february 2018. They might not know what a big player they are in BTCH sphere. On the other hand, bringing them into the game means massive staker when POS will be activated.


[06-Dec-18 01:05 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Consider something within HUSH/BTCH team. It's not impossible they would open BTCH markets for free. But you can also bring another whale along. If we are playing a fair game I would contact them about BTCH progress. Now or when HUSH markets will be back online. But one must notice there is a risk they can stake only and not open BTCH markets. Do your risk management. As I can't predict coin's directions I can't be the one who is making a decisions. I can only make a suggestion or reminder.


[06-Dec-18 08:07 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Takoy_Nahal> I think this is more a question of Berg or Duke.


[08-Dec-18 05:15 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <JiveBuddha> @halo kitty rules there are no external developers for btch, and no internal marketing. So there is no exchange ambition at the moment. However if external development started to yield significant results (maybe through crypto conditions) there would be incentive for marketing and btch would pick up. Time will tell. Not at the moment.

[09-Dec-18 05:27 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @JiveBuddha  Yes, we already get it at the moment there isn't much of anything in HUSH and BTCH. Devs must survive also in bear trend and must do something other beside work on these coins. But that shouldn't be the case for ever. Progress will follow but so will listing fees rise up. It's not an ideal time only for shopping, it's also an ideal time for widespearing to the new areas. And if speaking about Cryptopia, they have at least 500 complete shitcoins under their belt. I don't see a problem to go out with unfinished project as BTCH. Marketing and development are two different species of animals. Even if development is slow or on HODL, marketing can work undisturbed.

you can use Lite mode to login and access the funds if you have the private key of that address


[04-Jan-19 01:34 PM] SHossain#0007
if you have a backed up wallet.dat you need to use native mode and fully sync chain data before accessing funds

Is btch not available on agama mobile?


[02-Jun-19 09:49 AM] SHossain#0007
it is available


[02-Jun-19 01:19 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> Sorry for what might be a dumb question.  How can BTCH have a 21M supply if it was airdropped 1:1 with multiple chains adding up to way more than 21M supply?


[02-Jun-19 01:49 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> snapshot of the chains at the time was not the ultimate coin supply. how do you calculate the existing supplies at the time of the airdrop as being "way more than" 21 mil?


[02-Jun-19 01:56 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <aledel> He is calculating Max supply + Max supply :Surprised_Pikachu:


[02-Jun-19 04:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> my understanding from the website is BTCH has a max supply of 21M (same supply as BTC).  so the dropping 1:1 with BTC would create the full supply, no?  and then add in the other chains...


[02-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> BTC does not have 21M coins circulating though...


[02-Jun-19 05:51 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> You‚Äôre talking max supply, not circulating supply.


[02-Jun-19 05:58 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Cryptographic You most likely missunderstanding terms ¬®circulating supply¬® and ¬®maximum supply¬®. BTC and BTCH maximum supply is 21M. Only 21M of each will ever exist.. On the other hand circulating supply represent number of coins into existance at any given moment. At the moment BTC circulating supply is 17.7M and rising.


[02-Jun-19 06:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> On feb. 1 2018, when snapshot happened (BTCH ¬®appeared¬®) there were 16.8M of BTC and 3.2M of HUSH into existence. Also 2 minor coins and some premine were taken into account, alltogether still combined for less than 21 M.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> But you're right that fork details were poorely shared with public. That was due to lack of time and personel.


[09-Jun-19 03:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Chippiru> Ok. Up to 1M BTCH for DEX holders, 778k for UNITY, harder to calculate BTCH for BTC holders. What is the circulating supply for BTCH now?

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I've taken advantage of recent Agama breach for study of BTCH realistic supply and major ownership. Due to security breach huge movement of BTCH happened. On BTCH explorer I've took a look at every single june block so far.
In my timezone first june block was 182097,while  last block analyized was 182554. Also I reviewed a destiny of BTCH balances, which directly originated from the richest HUSH balances. I'll post results in Word and pdf shape and also in plain text. But please note that Discord can slightly rearenge form and drop off some of characters.
At fork time there were 38 addresses of 10000 or more HUSH (BTCH). They were looked under microscope. Owners of the biggest balances probably should take the most care of their funds. They should be a good indicator of happening at the rest of the ownership. It includes feb. 1 2018 balances with t-HUSH addresses, original BTCH addresses and status.
Some findings are interesting, some pointless. The research has been primarly made for my own understanding of overall picture, but I can share the results. My intention was not to bash anyone or anything.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> As I'm missing data about transfer of DEX and SUPERNET balances to BTCH chain, some conclusions are part of speculation. At some points I might be just interpreting things wrong.
From block 182097 up to block 182160 value transfer was basically 0. Block 182161 happened 1.5 hour prior to ca333's announcement of Agama security breach (KMD official channel on Discord). In that block team moved 265k BTCH of SUPERNET holdings and movement has begun.
From up of block 182161 until now, 1.5 million of BTCH were moved. Since blocks 182404 and 182405 were mined, there was only 1 transaction of 10000+ BTCH. That is 1 transaction in last 5 days. Right now movement is normal again, namely it is going back to basically 0. It is good time to draw the line.


[11-Jun-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Including block 182161, there were  5 moves which included balances of 100000 or more coins. 4 of them are sure in control of KMD team, while for 5th transfer I can say it is just likely under KMD control.
As said, block 182161 contains SUPERNET holdings, namely 265000 of coins.
Block 182175 represent old MSHARK funds, it carried 100000 of coins. Block was recorded 2 hours after ca333's announcement.


[11-Jun-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Block 182184 had 153000 BTCH inside. These coins originated from pre-airdrop (18th january 2018). We are talking about original address. It can only be premine, now called dev funds. Block was recorded 2.5 hours after ca333's announcement.
Block 182190 happened 3.5 hours after announcement.  It included 361000 BTCH, which originated from SUPERNET and DEX. Add that with block time and my conclusion is: these funds are also in control of KMD team.
So far there are already 879000 of BTCH within KMD command.
At blocks 182251 and 182252 additional 28000 BTCH were transferred to 361000 bulk. KMD sum is already at 900000+ BTCH.


[11-Jun-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Block 182383 was recorded much later (06.06.2019). There were 192000 BTCH within. According to atomicexplorer, this BTCH is coinsiquence of 180000 DEX and 12000 SUPERNET. In chaos funds were likely forgotten and claimed day later. It is very likely these funds are property of KMD people.
So that leaves me with 0.9 M or 1.1M of BTCH whale addresses within KMD control. The second of the two is more likely. Of course, some other (smaller) balances are also of KMD people, but I haven't dug deeper.


[11-Jun-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Interesingly, balances of 10000 or more BTCH and without proof or clear indication of KMD ownership were very scarce. There were only 13 of them so far:
 block 182185 had 23300 coins (which happened just a single block after transfer of 153000 coins)
182195 had 10600 of them,
182245 had 20000,
182261 had 13200,
182299 had 22500,
182331 had 11500,
182340 had 15400,
182365 had 12700,
182391 had 28500,
182399 had 15800,
182404 had 19900,
182405 had 15000 and
182535 had 21300.


[11-Jun-19 10:35 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> All 13 balances combined for 229700 BTCH. That means that balances of less than 10000 BTCH leave us with only roughly 150000 BTCH.



Conclusion 1:
I've underestimated the amount of BTCH under KMD ownership and the amount of claimed BTCH. KMD controls more than 1M of coins, while overall I can describe 1.5M of coins as active. However, there are probably another 0.5M of coins which were claimed earlier, especially in early 2018. So with term circulating supply I would describe 1.5M or 2M BTCH. Coins are heavily loaded on only a few addresses, addresses with middle-to-low amounts represent the minority of overall balance.

[11-Jun-19 10:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Conclusion:
I've expected much higher % of these funds would be claimed. I can argue that the majority of BTCH out there is mainly of DEX and SUPERNET origin. I can barely name BTCH as HUSH's fork or airdrop.
That could explain why HUSH community doesn't care about BTCH. It has never cared and I can't blame them for that. HUSH has been seen as a coin for private messanging, while BTCH is without a vision. Maybe HUSH and BTCH development/community should split apart.

[dscrd-hush] <Hot Albo> What is the main use case for btch,  is it basically the same as HUSH I.e. private messages with anon value transfer? Does BTCH do anything unique?


[01-Aug-19 03:15 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Hot Albo> Also, is PoS still planned for BTCH?

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @jl777c In the past 2 weeks there were created thousands of new addresses, likely 10000+ of them and still counting. The pattern is the same, all addresses are almost empty (0.0001 BTCH inside). Is there any logic to that or is someone just doing experiments?


[13-Aug-19 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> its called mining


[13-Aug-19 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> On 10000 new addresses?


[13-Aug-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> a new address for each block

[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> look at BTC


[13-Aug-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> each block gets a new address (usually) and gets the block reward plus txfees


[13-Aug-19 02:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <jl777c> same as BTCH


[13-Aug-19 02:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> It is not a very suitable way to collect the rewards üòÑ . Anyway, usually the miners were collecting their fees on addresses with hundreds and thousand of coins inside. Maybe someone is mining just for fun...

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Trading on Coinexchange will finish soon. Are we able to extract and store all the trading info from the charts? Should we ask the exchange for that data? Because these informations include entire registered BTCH trading history. Alltogether we are speaking about few thousands of trades. It  would be a shame if these details would be lost. End of trading here doesn't mean the end of coin. I'll likely make a series of print-screens of BTCH/BTC charts, but I guess there must exist more precised technique...


[14-Oct-19 06:31 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> storing data is good

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Heno1974 No, BTCH is airdrop from early 2018, where HUSH was one of 4 different coins who participated. And at the moment BTCH is not mineable, if that is a second question üòâ. Short info about BTCH: https://bitcoinhush.github.io/

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> That is a part of instructions to recieve BTCH. They were valid on 1st of february 2018. 2018!!! If you held HUSH on 1st of february 2018, you can claim your BTCH.

There are still small corrections (graphics, links, text) to realize but for me it works.

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @dukeleto Can you update the link on this page : https://github.com/bitcoinhush/mybtchwallet  ?

It would be necessary to replace :

[27-Oct-19 08:04 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @gilardh @dukeleto It has been working fine for me. I've been using PC, Windows 7. First off, there were number of transactions sent out of Coinexchange to first web wallet. Mostly single transactions were sent to single addresses, but it also works with multiple transactions. Addresses from the first wallet are here, you can check transactions:

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> In third attempt transactions were sent from both web wallets to external wallet (which dukeleto owns the keys of). I was able to empty the wallets without problems. However, when sending or receiving rounded amounts (1 BTCH for example), strange balances can be obtained. Wallet shows additional balance, namely it adds or subtract some BTCH on 15th or 16th decimal point.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> If trying to use too high tax fee, the wallet denies you (something as Àùabsurd feeÀù). Beside that, all kinds of custom fees works, even transactions without fees are accepted without a problems. Examples:

[27-Oct-19 08:16 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @gilardh One thing would be very useful. Is it possible to add a function, where with a single click you can add an address' balance to a sending line? You know it is complicated to work with 8-digit numbers when calculating tax fees...

[28-Oct-19 12:18 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I will have to reread your messages several times to understand what is happening with rounding and when the fees are too high. üòâ


[28-Oct-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I think I saw strange things like that in the wallet hush too.  A rounding problem on the screen.


[28-Oct-19 12:20 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> The fees were too high with example, when I tried to send 0.28 BTCH + 0.02 fees. The system denied me.  sending 0.295 BTCH + 0.005 fees was Ok and went through.

[28-Oct-19 03:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> @gilardh @halo kitty rules one thing to note is that there are only 8 decimal places. If some code is showing more, it's wrong and has bugs


[28-Oct-19 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> all amounts should be rounded to 8 digit precision numbers for rendering


[28-Oct-19 03:25 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> Javascript doesn't actually have numbers, everything is a string, so maybe it's doing dumb stuff


[28-Oct-19 03:42 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @dukeleto @halo kitty rules From memory, it's a display bug. In a next transation everything becomes correct again. I will try to reproduce this bug in order to identify the line of code to correct.


[28-Oct-19 03:44 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @gilardh @dukeleto Correct, with next non-rounded transaction everything goes back to 8-digits. But I think with double rounded transactions it remains in 15 or 16 decimals range. will check right away.


[28-Oct-19 03:57 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <dukeleto> this sounds like a javascript rendering issue


[28-Oct-19 04:24 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> It took some time, but I got it again. Is it possible the problem occurs when combining addresses within the same wallet and at the same time on the different pages? If not, it might be totally random. It is not the matter of rounded and non-rounded balances. I have tried numerous variations rounded-rounded, nonrounded-nonrounded etc., but it remained in 8-decimal range.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> If you look at the screen-shot from 8 hours ago, you'll see the same. There were combined balances from two different pages. only print screen was taken on page 1, but just look and you will see the balances on address and total don't match.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @gilardh I am sorry to report, but it has not been solved. While trying to explore Àùabsurd feeÀù problem, a series of small transactions was transferred between two addresses (within a same wallet). Code is still vulnerable...

[29-Oct-19 12:43 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> But likely the web wallet is not the only application with that problem. Look at the BTCH explorer: https://btch.explorer.dexstats.info/address/R9NW7yeXEfd4Ao4C4ssdkDqgAhWKpDvCmC


[29-Oct-19 12:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Explorer has a problems with series of transactions from the same address. 
10 BTCH were received from the external wallet and 12 series of 0.1 BTCH were sent out (plus transaction fees). final balance is correct, but Àùtotal sentÀù and Àùtotal receivedÀù doesn't match at all. i've noticed that behavior before, but didn't pay much attention. Should we ask CHMEX for a advice?

[29-Oct-19 12:54 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I assume Àùabsurd feeÀù is based on a % of sending amount. I'll check with higher and lower amounts...


[29-Oct-19 01:08 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> In fact it is not... Around 6% fee being described as absurd is being a rule in 0.1 BTCH and lower. 1 BTCH and higher amouts have different rules, namely 10x lower limit is being described as absurd. There must be a kind of logarithmic formula behind, but maybe we shouldn't pay too much attention to that. I'm fine with reminder Àùabsurd feeÀù. It prevents users from mistakingly spending too much on validation.


[29-Oct-19 02:36 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> @halo kitty rules Did you completely reload the Internet page? The whole program runs in the browser, it must be updated by reloading the page. Maybe that's why you still have rounding problems.


[29-Oct-19 02:38 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> It would be useful to add a visible version number on the application. This would help to know if this is the last version.


[29-Oct-19 02:45 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I do not think there is any transaction problem (series of transactions from the same address.). I was also surprised by this method of transfer but you do not send the exact sum. It's like giving a bank note and giving you change.


[29-Oct-19 02:47 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I'm going to look at the absurd fee problem in the code. Wait before doing new tests on this part.


[29-Oct-19 02:48 AM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Well, now I've closed the wallet completely and opened again. Firstly, it shoewd me balance with 8 decimals. After another series of transactions I've got again 15 or 16 digits...

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Arff, I need to verify that the github account files are updated. A version number would be very useful. I will look at all this. Thanks for the reports.

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I can't reproduce the decimal problem on my dev computer and i don't see the problem after deploy on github... I added a version number and fixed the absurd fee problem.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> I can confirm absurd fees are gone. All kinds of fees are accepted, until they are smaller or equal as sending amount. Higher as sending amount are denied.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> Decimal problem at Àùtotal confirmedÀù is likely gone. After numerous random and non-random transactions is balance still in 8-decimals range. However, on a very rare cases problem can be seen at Àùtotal unconfirmedÀù. I assume it happens when trying to send from the  address A to address B at least 2 transactions within a few seconds (before the first transaction is ÀùconfirmedÀù). It at least happen when sending different amounts and different tax fees. We are speaking about very rare cases. When transactions are confirmed, is Àùtotal confirmedÀù in 8 decimals.

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I will open an issue on github for Decimal problem saw briefly at all unconfirmed to not forget it.

[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> If someone can point me to the file, I might take a look. If anyone else needs a testing amount of BTCH, just post your address here or DM me.

[02-Nov-19 10:45 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @AkiraX Isn't that risky? Wallet hasn't been finished yet. Right now I would think twice before sending all coins to UNFINISHED WEB wallet.


[02-Nov-19 10:57 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> the address is from atomicdex key

[03-Nov-19 12:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> Would you like a button to empty an address to send an another address by deducting the fee?
Example you have 20 BTCH on A to send to B.
You clicked on a button that sent 19.9999 to B and set 0.0001 fee automatically?


[03-Nov-19 12:18 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> But I basically don't know anything about programming. If it can be done easilly, I can give you 500 BTCH for that shortcut. But it is not a must-have, it is more like a premium üòÑ .

[dscrd-hush] <gilardh> I don't speak English very well either. It's not my native language. So I understood correctly. I would look at that yes.


[03-Nov-19 12:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> As said previously, if it can be done briefly, I can give you 500 BTCH. If not, leave it as it is.

[dscrd-hush] <AkiraX> anyway prospect of tipbot for  btch?


[09-Nov-19 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> It costs money to implement it, once the coin is a true living thing I don't see why we wouldn't explore the possibility


[01-Jan-20 02:27 PM] c2k#4915
is BTCH traded anywhere? i thought it would be on Altsbit with all the other Komodo ecosystem coins but i dont see it there


[01-Jan-20 02:40 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <heguli97> BTCH was listed on coinexchange.io when it was open. I don't think it's on any active exchanges currently unfortunately. Regarding Altsbit, when Hush was listed there, formerly known as digitalprice, they asked money to do simple wallet updates to keep the coin online(should be free since that's the way they generate money with transactions/trades) and just the way they handled things generally with Hush made it so that we have no interest to get BTCH or HUSH on altsbit/digitalprice currently.


[01-Jan-20 02:52 PM] c2k#4915
ok ty


[01-Jan-20 03:01 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Privatoshi> @HUSH Bridge-Bot Are you trying to sell?


[14-Jan-20 01:53 AM] barv#0867
If you have $BTCH and you send it to your #coincollect $KMD address, it will show up in your mobile wallet. Pass the word.

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> They could've been swept by the Komodo/Agama team as well

[dscrd-hush] <CryptoJesus> What do you mean? @Berg

[dscrd-hush] <Berg> They swept some addresses coins into Komodo held wallets for safe keeping, then there was a claim process... Not sure if BTCH was one of them or not

[dscrd-hush] <Cryptographic> is BTCH something that is going to be further developed?


[01-May-20 07:44 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <Berg> There were future plans, but there isn't a dedicated BTCH team. The coin was planned to be repurposed, but hasn't yet come to fruition.

[dscrd-hush] <Dochteur> Id like to ask about going full ztoz - I have some BTCH in the same address I now hold Hush, once I transfer all my balances to z-addresses, am I right to assume, Id still be able to access BTCH in this R-address, if I have its WIF?


[26-May-20 02:20 PM] Gateway#3763
[dscrd-hush] <halo kitty rules> @Dochteur Yes, BTCH will stay on R-addr and you'll have an access with your WIF

When the Agama wallet was hacked, I received my btch in verus/agama wallet, but if it has now slipped away, how can I get my btch back again?

is this project dead now

BTCH is no longer maintained by the ecosystem and is kind of an orphaned coin. You can  get the wif/privkey for the address containing your coins and transfer them out if that is something you need to do.
