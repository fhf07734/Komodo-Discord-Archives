That's how the automated matchmaking works. You don't alwasy get your requested size if the UTXO's for it don't exist. But you will get your requested ratio or better.

You exchanged 1 beer... at the top
then on the left part of the table it says  pizza

<@U033SL06X> <@U5Z26MP60> <@U8WFL9AMU> it‚Äôs due to the way `marketmaker` handles sell orders. Basically sell orders don‚Äôt exist, everything is a buy. If we tell mm to place a sell it just flips the values and places a buy on the inverse pair


[28-May-18 04:08 PM] lukechilds123#0000
It is technically correct, we are displaying the correct trade data according to mm


[28-May-18 04:08 PM] lukechilds123#0000
but I agree it is confusing

You can see the discussion there why we chose to display it like we are


[28-May-18 04:12 PM] lukechilds123#0000
TLDR; it would be possible to show these as sell order in the way you expect, but we decided against that because it would literally mean showing incorrect data, just because it‚Äôs more intuitive.

[28-May-18 04:12 PM] lukechilds123#0000
>We obviously want to hide as much of the complexity as possible from the user, but completely faking the order book value just to make it seem more intuitive is too far IMO. As far as marketmaker is concerned KMD/REVS orders are not REVS/KMD orders.


[28-May-18 04:14 PM] lukechilds123#0000

<@U7B8VF6TB> I think its fine to leave it like that as the top of the trade shows correct, but it also seems very confusing the first time its encountered. My self, with BarterDEX GUI once I got use to flipping pairs, I always did it that way so I was always buying and the price was always the larger number, so I didnt have to deal with huge decimals. But it took weeks of playing around and making mistakes to get used to it. As far as I am aware you are already flipping pairs to always be Alice anyway in hyperDEX so maybe you should just inverse these numbers. 1/x should work fine, thats  the formula I used to flip pairs and never went wrong using it.


[28-May-18 09:40 PM] lukechilds123#0000
We don‚Äôt flip any pairs and you are always Alice anyway


[28-May-18 09:40 PM] lukechilds123#0000
it was misleading because in the API docs there are buy and sell commands


[28-May-18 09:40 PM] lukechilds123#0000
so we built the exchange with buy/sell functionality


[28-May-18 09:41 PM] lukechilds123#0000
but after testing it a bit more and wondering why we were getting weird responses from sell commands we realised that mm was just inverting the pair and changing them to buys


[28-May-18 09:41 PM] lukechilds123#0000
had we known that from the start we‚Äôd probably of only added buy functionality and required the user to flip the pair to ‚Äúsell‚Äù


[28-May-18 09:42 PM] lukechilds123#0000
but to clarify, we don‚Äôt change any data at all


[28-May-18 09:42 PM] lukechilds123#0000
we send the user input direct to mm


[28-May-18 09:42 PM] lukechilds123#0000
and display the mm output directly in the UI


[28-May-18 09:50 PM] blackjok3r#0000
ok no worries. Better docs were always a must, I tried to make some a few times, but things kept changing so fast I just gave up.


[28-May-18 09:51 PM] blackjok3r#0000
I think @Alright is doing it now though.


[28-May-18 10:21 PM] imylomylo#0000
yep <@U8MLQ662K> is on the case and has plenty of experience with mm.   new kmd team member <@U9LBB4CTG> also working on collating docs.  <@U02QSHX81> has a pretty good idea of what is going on in that regard coming from a testers background and is the QA/Support keeping an eye on progress.


[29-May-18 01:55 AM] jansako#0000
<@U7B8VF6TB> I was on a va(work)cation for a couple of weeks, just lurking mostly. 
I am inclined to think that if the 'Requested' and 'Broadcast' entries are so different, maybe the 'Requested' entry (which shows 'incorrect' ) should not be shown at all? Then all you have is the 'Broadcast' and 'Executed' side, and once it is made clear in help/documentation that the 'broadcast' side will be always a bit different from what the user enters into the trade request boxes and why, the whole issue just goes away. 
Same goes for the 'The executed price was 4% cheaper than requested' line. A nice marketing touch, but kinda defeats the purpose if in 50% of the cases it shows an incorrect value üôÇ. 
The related github issues are closed, but I am happy to add my thoughts if <@U8MLQ662K> is making a new one.
Thanks guys!

Executed trade is correct, so no big issue. But the displayed "requested" info is wrong. It should be simply fixed on UI level. I wouldn't remove it entirely b/c it is very useful.


[29-May-18 08:37 AM] jansako#0000
the 'simply fixed on the UI level' is the real issue here üôÇ. It would require a design decision to start 'interpreting' MM data instead of simply displaying it as is done now. There are very valid arguments for doing it and not doing it as well. 
Like I said above, I tend to go for axing a feature, even if just temporarily, if I can't implement it correctly...

You know how we keep describing the basics of how bdex/jhyperdex/mm work as an auction

might be worth coming up with a tagline for hyperdex that states something like that

I think a shapeshift style UI is much better suited to mm functionality

which we will be focusing on once we‚Äôve got the remaining features/bugs done with the exchange UI

<@U7B8VF6TB> earlier, while I was working with <@U2GC2GXTP>, I did some quick mockups of a more shapeshift/exodus UX/UI approach. It wasn't anything finalized, but may be useful to take a look at. Interested?


[31-May-18 08:13 AM] dan#0000
I think it's hard to get away from steps even in gui form because if something goes wrong   it's nice to let the user know visually where they're at in the process. But maybe it can be hidden in advanced view.

Seems like latest build has issues. But artem is not going to be availbale in a couple of days


[01-Jun-18 05:03 AM] pondsea#0000
<@U7B8VF6TB> <@U8NFS11R9> could we compile our own for the time being? @siu we could just use the mm from before the latest if that is the issue


[01-Jun-18 05:04 AM] siu#0000
Seems like the issue has been there for a few releases


[01-Jun-18 05:04 AM] pondsea#0000
What is the main issue?


[01-Jun-18 05:22 AM] siu#0000
It seems to crash and not start a swap


[01-Jun-18 05:22 AM] siu#0000
Thats why many swaps die at start

Hi, Is there any HyperDEX presentation materials available.  I'm also after recommended links.


[05-Jun-18 02:44 AM] acura360#0000
On Youtube there are several Videos about HyperDex


[05-Jun-18 02:48 AM] gcharang#0000
<@U93ET4RU4> see if any of these are useful to you: https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/305856581/HyperDEX


[05-Jun-18 03:50 AM] cris20#0000
Thanks, <@U9LBB4CTG>. I've gone through that and tried out HyperDEX this afternoon. If there is anymore info, particularly on its user benefits I'd be grateful!


[05-Jun-18 03:51 AM] gcharang#0000
What do you mean by user benefits? Benefits over other DEXs or barterDEX?


[05-Jun-18 03:57 AM] cris20#0000
Basically its selling points and how it will benefit BarterDEX and Kmd through user experience.  I can come up with some obvious ones and am looking for some that I haven't thought of.


[05-Jun-18 05:51 AM] pondsea#0000
Have you used command line or barterdex gui?


[05-Jun-18 05:52 AM] pondsea#0000
Main thing it does, it tries to hide all the stuff grandma doesnt care or need to know about


[05-Jun-18 05:53 AM] pondsea#0000
It would help onboard people who would otherwise not use the DEX because it is too complicated for them.


[05-Jun-18 05:54 AM] pondsea#0000
Going forward we are looking to add in agama functionality, write our own mm implementation and drive liquidity through it.

Somone is trying to buy equaliser on barterdex without luck and this is what they said: "Everytime I put up an offer it shows up as 0 UTXOs. (though I have a single 100 KMD UTXO) what is the UTXO size?"


[06-Jun-18 12:56 AM] cris20#0000
Hi <@U02PH4RHZ>, 
I used BarterDEX and the command line now.  
HyperDEX certainly looks better and simpler.

What's the procedure for stuck swaps in hyperdex. I have for swaps stuck at various spots ... 1/5, 2/5, etc.  Been that way for 12 hours now.  Hyperdex was hung so I shut down while swaps were pending.


[07-Jun-18 07:54 AM] allbits#0000
Thanks

Can i get my hyperdex seed from within the app?


[07-Jun-18 10:07 AM] daxirre#0000
The hyperdex will generate a 12 word seed when you creat your portfolio


[07-Jun-18 10:07 AM] daxirre#0000
you can also use your barterdex seed if you have it already created


[07-Jun-18 11:29 AM] allbits#0000
Thanks for the response, but I was asking a different question - can I get my hyperdex from within the app after I have signed on?


[07-Jun-18 11:29 AM] allbits#0000
I know one got generated when I created the portfolio but that's not what I'm asking


[07-Jun-18 11:53 AM] daxirre#0000
the seed is encrypted locally , you can ask the hyperdex team in the feedback option to include  a feature to decrypt the passphrase on the dapp


[07-Jun-18 01:18 PM] allbits#0000

i'm having trouble getting a sell order to stay in the books, not sure what i am doing wrong. comes back UNMATCHED each time.


[13-Jun-18 08:59 PM] Mylo#8306
@Cloudy hyperdex is the "taker" in a trade.  you need to find a "maker".   So someone on the buy side that is a market "maker" who has their order ready to be matched is the only way you can use hyperdex to sell at this stage. 
if you want to be a market "maker" this will come later i think through the hyperdex line of products.  currently "maker" is a command line or BarterDEX function only.


[14-Jun-18 08:16 AM] Cloudy#1215
@Mylo thanks for the clarification. i had been trying to use hyperdex after failing to make the same trade on barterdex however


[14-Jun-18 12:08 PM] Jonathan#3687
Question - was it by design to log out of the portfolio after you delete swap history?


[14-Jun-18 08:37 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Completely offtopic and having nothing todo with your question. But why delete your swap history @Jonathan It is stored locally not on  any server of any type. This is a key aspect of something being distributed and decentralized.

@Deleted User I cleaned out the SWAP file in the appdata section but it didn't change anything. I checked on the bitcoin block explorer and see that the alice payment is sitting in a different bitcoin address but removing the files didn't change anything or kick the trade to move forward.

It seems like both the alice payment and bob payment are sitting there but things are finishing up.

are not

@aFastHero  can you open the SWAP file in a text editor and past its content here?


[16-Jun-18 02:57 PM] aFastHero#2811
which swap file? There are multiple files in the SWAP directory.


[16-Jun-18 03:01 PM] aFastHero#2811
@Deleted User I have the file that was created at the time the swap began, or 3 minutes after.


[16-Jun-18 03:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
@aFastHero Well, we need to identify the swap on HyperDEX.


[16-Jun-18 03:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ok, open it and past the content here, please.


[16-Jun-18 03:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
on HyperDEX you can also see each swap id, clicking on the "View" button.

The other successful swap on HyperDEX has "BOBPAYMENT" and  "BOBRECLAIM" files associated with it. No such files are listed for the swap in question.


[16-Jun-18 03:14 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, bob payment means that you received your OOT.


[16-Jun-18 03:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
In this case you won't receive, but we can claim bob's deposit.

Is there any .finished file remaining there?


[16-Jun-18 03:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
You need to delete all the .finished files (making backup first of SWAPS folder is a good idea).


[16-Jun-18 03:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
1 - backup SWAPS folder.
2 - stop HyperDEX.
3 - delete all files which names end in ".finished"
4 - restart HyperDEX.


[16-Jun-18 03:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
Hum, you say that there is no remaining .finished files?


[16-Jun-18 03:33 PM] aFastHero#2811
correct.


[16-Jun-18 03:34 PM] aFastHero#2811
the only one in the directory was associated with the previous successful swap.

[16-Jun-18 03:37 PM] aFastHero#2811

[16-Jun-18 04:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
Try restarting HyperDEX. Did you update HyperDEX after that swap?


[16-Jun-18 04:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
(stop BarterDEX first)


[16-Jun-18 04:01 PM] aFastHero#2811
negative. The most recent HyperDEX was used for the swap.


[16-Jun-18 04:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
It should be fixed by restarting HyperDEX, it should issue a call "swapstatus" and that should kickstart the swap. Not sure why it is not happening.


[16-Jun-18 04:03 PM] aFastHero#2811
Well I am logging in to HyperDEX now

@aFastHero  HyperDEX has this nice feature for debugging, if you click "view" on the swap, and then at the bottom "Copy swap debug data", you can past it here, so we can analyze it more in deep.


[16-Jun-18 04:14 PM] aFastHero#2811
Alright. I'll do that now.

[matrix] <alright:matrix.org> Do you have any completed swaps in hyperdex? Can you look in the debug info for a completed swap for the requestid and quoteid and see if there are files for it in that directory?

I found the file, in the aforementioned directory, that shares a requestid and quoteid found within the debug data of the one and only successful swap in HyperDEX.

[matrix] <alright:matrix.org> No if you have the swap files, it's totally recoverable. Just for some reason Hyperdex is not doing it. If you are familiar with using CLI tools, I can walk you through how to claim it with the marketmaker CLI.

[16-Jun-18 06:39 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Daemon> HyperDEX version Alpha 6


[16-Jun-18 06:46 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <Daemon> Was able to send by manually typing value though... did notice the USD calc for outgoing KMD seems off... like it is dividing KMD out by the KMD/USD value instead of multiplying... 84.49 coins said it was a $42 value

I am not able to find the guide for marketmaker CLI on windows.


[16-Jun-18 09:24 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <alright:matrix.org> Sorry, I'm not sure I'll be able to help. I have 0 experience using the marketmaker on windows.


[16-Jun-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <alright:matrix.org> You could install barterdex, take the hyperdex SWAPS directory, put it in %appdata%\BarterDEX\DB , start barterdex, sign in with the same seed, go to trade history, click the stuck swap, click "kickstart stagnant trade" then restart barterdex


[16-Jun-18 09:26 PM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <alright:matrix.org> Should claim the stuck KMD


[16-Jun-18 09:37 PM] aFastHero#2811
Understood. I will get on that.


[16-Jun-18 09:38 PM] aFastHero#2811
I guess it would be worth my time to set up an old laptop with Linux to run the CLI?


[16-Jun-18 10:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
You can  get access directly to mm methods from the JS console


[16-Jun-18 10:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
it's a bit easier than using the CLI


[16-Jun-18 10:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
and it'll automatically use the correct port/userpass


[16-Jun-18 10:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
Open the devtools and run:

```
_api.debug({method: 'swapstatus', requestid: 174600499, quoteid: 4137389265})
```

in the console


[16-Jun-18 10:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
obviously change the params to whatever you want


[16-Jun-18 10:41 PM] lukechilds#2707
give it a few seconds and it will dump the response in the console


[16-Jun-18 10:42 PM] lukechilds#2707
You can do any mm command this way

I still have this same issue. I have btc stuck in the same manner. I tried moving my SWAP details into a working version of Barterdex and Barterdex isn't picking up on the stuck swap.


[17-Jun-18 09:45 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
hi guys, I was thinking if that would make any sense if Hyperdex would have 2 tabs 1 with atomic swaps exchange 2nd with proxy token exchange ?


[17-Jun-18 09:46 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Maybe it sound stupid, but from user experience (easy of use) proxy token is some way easier and faster right? more similar to CEX ?


[17-Jun-18 09:46 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
in that case the same app having these 2 options coul attract more users ?


[17-Jun-18 09:47 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
especially when small traders want to trade small amounts, atomic security is maybe not as important as easy of use and speed ?


[17-Jun-18 10:42 AM] aFastHero#2811
@SHossain My friend, you are the man! That worked immediately. Thank you so much for the guide, I will be saving it!


[17-Jun-18 10:55 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> @lukechilds if the current version doesn't do it already, and if it's needed (as i believe it's needed) i would suggest that HyperDEX implements a function (not necessarily exposed on the GUI) that not only issues the swapstatus method, but also deletes the affected .finished files.


[17-Jun-18 10:56 AM] Gateway#3763
[matrix] <dragonrider-e:matrix.org> maybe the "kickstart" method already does that?


[17-Jun-18 12:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
I withdraw some crypto, then I realized that i had no way to see the transaction id.


[17-Jun-18 12:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
It would be nice having some wallet functionality besides the swap/exchange stuff.


[17-Jun-18 12:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Basic wallet functionality i mean.


[17-Jun-18 12:17 PM] Deleted User#0000
Like transaction history (like some CEX's have).


[17-Jun-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> That will come later in the year. Hyper will have agama functionality


[17-Jun-18 04:27 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> We are looking into this


[17-Jun-18 04:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
what do you mean with "Agama functionality"?


[17-Jun-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Basically another tab in hyper that does everything that agama does


[17-Jun-18 04:28 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> So full wallet functionality


[17-Jun-18 04:29 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Or maybe we incorporate it into the wallet section


[17-Jun-18 04:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
oh, got it: emulating Agama's functionalities.


[17-Jun-18 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not using Agama's software, more like replicating it.


[17-Jun-18 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
making something similar.


[17-Jun-18 04:30 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Basically building the wallet functions within hyper


[17-Jun-18 04:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
Cool.


[17-Jun-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Once we have that we can do fun things like check bobs utxos


[17-Jun-18 04:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
sounds like a challenge


[17-Jun-18 04:32 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Have a list of them and setup trades based on that info


[17-Jun-18 04:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
I hope it works, it would be super. Or even hyper.


[17-Jun-18 04:34 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <pondsea> Haha we will see. When I get on discord remind me to shoot you a tip for helping out with support


[17-Jun-18 06:43 PM] vrcninja#5651
Just to close the loop @SHossain  I tried again and the suggestion you gave worked. My swap is no longer stuck and my payment was returned.

Yep, I'll be working on that this week


[18-Jun-18 03:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I would be great to have the option to switch the pairs you are trading like in barterdex


[18-Jun-18 03:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
For example when you have BTC on the left and KMD on the right, you see the price in kmd for a bitcoin 3457 kmd


[18-Jun-18 03:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And if you have a button to switch the pairs it would be nice


[18-Jun-18 03:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So you have the conversion to 0,00029

[slack] <acura360> if i place an sell order, i wait ca 30-60seconds... after that i get an "unmatched" and i don¬¥t see my Sell order in the Sell Orders Tab .. :thinking_face:


[18-Jun-18 05:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Cryptoon I wouldn't recommend flipping the pair, choose the pair you want to use and then place buys and sells


[18-Jun-18 05:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
a BTC/KMD sell is the same as a KMD/BTC buy


[18-Jun-18 05:43 AM] lukechilds#2707
but if you want to flip them, you only need to change one currency on the drop down, if it's the same as the other side it'll flip


[18-Jun-18 05:44 AM] lukechilds#2707
e.g if you're on KMD/BTC:
- Change the base currency from KMD to BTC
- The quote currency (BTC) will automatically swap to KMD

ah, and i remember @cipi saying something about their different algo making it difficult to create an electrum instance

[18-Jun-18 07:06 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <jspook16> @vrcninja you can always load the same keys into agama or barterdex and make a transfer. Its not a withdraw in the same sense as a CEX.


[18-Jun-18 07:14 PM] Gateway#3763
[slack] <vrcninja> I tried Agama as well but it is having server connection issues. I'm wondering if the same thing is impacting Barterdex

If you really want your own full node you could run your own Electrum server locally

i am trying to sell beer for pizza on hyperdex, i clicked on the beer buy orders and created the order now after 5 minutes of ‚Äúpending‚Äù it became ‚Äúunmatched‚Äù this is what i don‚Äôt understand if i accepted the price of the order in existence why it is not executed? (it says timed out)


[22-Jun-18 11:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
could be anything... I did just take down all my bobs. Try increasing the price a bit. I dont know if anyone else has good bobs up for that pair.

@webworker01 which os? I have an issue with hyper where it turns unresponsive after 10ish minutes, think it must be marketmaker or something. Clicking buy etc doesnt do anything anymore. Is on osx


[23-Jun-18 01:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Havent tested latest alpha yet though but it was still there on 6


[23-Jun-18 02:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
@webworker01 thanks for the detailed feedback, all of those issues appear to be issues with `marketmaker` though, not HyperDEX, we literally just send/display data to/from `marketmaker`


[23-Jun-18 02:23 AM] lukechilds#2707
>*sometimes the buy/sell buttons get greyed out or blink and don't seem to do anything and the app needs a restart
We grey out the button until `marketmaker` responds to the buy API request. Due it's blocking single threaded nature sometimes requests can take a very long time

>*sometimes the bobs don't show up anymore and the app needs a restart
We poll `marketmaker` for the order book once per second and display it's output. If orders aren't showing up it's because `marketmaker` isn't telling us about them

>*sometimes it seems that the bids/asks displayed either aren't really there or aren't responding to being matched properly
Same as above really.

>*almost always need to enter an offer higher than what is displayed but when the swap is completed you get close to the price displayed
We just pass the values directly to `marketmaker`, all order matching logic is in `marketmaker`.

>*not sure how utxos are handled but as i get down to the bottom of what i sent in to buy with the trades aren't close to my amount i wish to buy anymore where they were closer in the beginning with a single utxo, i need to now make multiple offers to get to my target buy amount

We don't handle UTXOs at all, it's entirely handled by `marketmaker`


[23-Jun-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
Unfortunately we can't fix any of these things in HyperDEX, it needs to be fixed in `marketmaker`. There is a v2 re-write in the works that will hopefully resolve these issues

[23-Jun-18 04:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
although I agree, if it worked correctly it would provide a better experience for the user


[23-Jun-18 04:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
if we restart we can guarantee the UI and `marketmaker` are in sync

New method of "Fill" and "Good Till Cancel" (GTC) now gives much better chances to buyers to fill their orders, as the seller's UTXOs gets adjusted as per the big UTXO order requests sent to the sellers. Don't feel confused. Just give trades a try. It's been amazing in my ...

So if waves does atomic swaps it could be a problem for this?


[25-Jun-18 12:27 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I think the waves atomic swaps refer to swaps on its own blockchain, for OTC trading and the like.  Nxt Asset Exchange did them, not cross-chain like Bdex tech


[25-Jun-18 12:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
OK so waves is centralised is that what your saying?


[25-Jun-18 12:53 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I don't mean it's centralized... using it, trading and creating tokens is permissionless but they also have a registered company for interacting with regulations. Anyway it's foremost an asset exchange platform, very different scope from say Bitcoin or a true cryptocurrency... so this hybrid approach makes sense.

[25-Jun-18 01:38 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
if for a case needs a colored coin rather than an independent blockchain, then it should use another platform


[25-Jun-18 01:38 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
But this is a deliberate design decision because with kmd you're not tied to the underlying platform, free to move away, no congestion from other projects and use only the parts you need

[25-Jun-18 01:43 PM] mv#8810
The Komodo whitepaper points out that there is no point at which a logged transaction is immune to being orphaned.  So waiting for 100 confirmations before releasing deposits makes it likely, but not certain, that the transaction will not be orphaned


[25-Jun-18 01:45 PM] dan.#2473
ive been out of the loop for some time, but, in the case of assetchains being swapped, they're at 3-6 confs for each part of the swap protocol.  As that gives time for a few notarizations to occur

okay


[25-Jun-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is just a normal orphan, then . it will just go into the mempool and get confirmed in the next block


[25-Jun-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you are swapping with a 51% attacker who is reorging the chain just to double spend on you, then the orhpaned tx wont be valid anymore. so for large amounts, use more confirms. for assetchains it is set to 3 so usually there is a notarization to protect it


[25-Jun-18 01:54 PM] mv#8810
Yes, notarized chains are relatively protected.  For other chains, the Bobs accepting coins are dependent on the security of those chains, and  are only protected by the confirmations.  What mechanism returns orphaned atomic swap legs to the mempool?  Is that automatic by the underlying protocol, automatic within the Barterdex / Hyperdex protocol, or manual, because the swap failed and the swappers manually retry it?


[25-Jun-18 01:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the underlying protocol


[25-Jun-18 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
automatically by bitcoin code


[25-Jun-18 02:03 PM] mv#8810
Okay.  I'm thinking of cases like the timewarp attacks on Verge last month... it orphaned many of the Verge blocks, and the newly mined blocks had no transactions in them.  I suppose once the attack ends, the accepted blocks have not removed the transaction from the mempool, so it would finally get processed and later confirmed.

Heh... we are talking about atomic swaps, and what vulnerabilities remain when using atomic swaps with relatively insecure blockchains.

if you are swapping a chain that is insecure, then that insecurity becomes part of the process

[25-Jun-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, I'm much too cowardly for that


[25-Jun-18 02:14 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
last time I traded more than a pseudo of $10k the markets jumped the other way and I would have made another $5k the next day


[25-Jun-18 02:16 PM] mv#8810
If we prefer a world of decentralized swaps, then in the long run we do want to be able to handle 50 BTC swaps.  If I'm a car dealer, I want to be able to accept payment in, say, Verge, and deliver the car the same day.  That probably means I have to be able to swap the payment into whatever funds are accepted by the factor who has loaned the money to buy my inventory.


[25-Jun-18 02:20 PM] dan.#2473
The protocol is tight. The only scary thing for me would be waiting for refund if the swap got stuck using large amounts. Even though I've gotten back 100% always.


[25-Jun-18 02:23 PM] dan.#2473

I've had to go back through some of my old testing swaps to get refunds, but I've never not gotten back 1/2 of the trade; be it my 1/2 or the 1/2 I wanted, I've always gotten a right amount üòÉ


[25-Jun-18 02:25 PM] dan.#2473

welll the nature of competition mining should dictate that if you put a super low fee and the mempool is empty (or not full) that someone would mine it for you... unless all miners are in collusion... then we all fucked.


[25-Jun-18 10:27 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
exactly. now, couple that with the fact that Bitcoin was never supposed to have fees for most use cases and only fees for large data transactions


[25-Jun-18 10:28 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the insanity of fees started with the 100k spam tx war over segwit/bigger-blocks


[25-Jun-18 10:41 PM] Deleted User#0000
it got to 200k there for a while... I wonder if anyone was using something like TxBlaster to spam it... I think thats doubtful, becasues they could have got it to millions of TX deep using that without much effort.


[26-Jun-18 07:53 AM] TomiDCat#6017
do we have the option to send with a lower fee?


[26-Jun-18 08:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
No


[26-Jun-18 08:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
we just use the fee supplied by `marketmaker`


[26-Jun-18 08:17 AM] TomiDCat#6017
seems excessively high


[26-Jun-18 08:18 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

[26-Jun-18 08:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
HyperDEX doesn't have anything to do with the fee calculations, it's all handled by the `marketmaker` daemon


[26-Jun-18 08:20 AM] TomiDCat#6017
understood


[26-Jun-18 08:20 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
1) stop thinking of BTC fees in pseudo USD
2) blame Core devs, they created the estimatefee algorithm


[26-Jun-18 08:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
HyperDEX seeds are compatible with Agama, so you could import it and send from there to get around it for now


[26-Jun-18 08:22 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Okay but point being fees are higher than necessary regardless of semantics


[26-Jun-18 08:23 AM] TomiDCat#6017
@lukechilds thanks I can try that. Just trying to create UTXOs so I can get a swap to go through


[26-Jun-18 08:24 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Again, that's something you need to take up with the coin devs (Core created this by design)


[26-Jun-18 08:25 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Ok but why is Agama able to estimate fees that are much lower?


[26-Jun-18 08:26 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Agama uses a flat fee and marketmaker uses a live fee to speed trades
different tools, different functions, different needs


[26-Jun-18 08:28 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
When you send BTC as a currency, it matters less if it sits a block or 3.
When you trade BTC as a commodity, no one wants to wait an hr for a trade to complete.


[26-Jun-18 08:30 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Doing a manual withdrawal needs to use speed trading why?


[26-Jun-18 08:31 AM] TomiDCat#6017
I understand the need for speed when trading within hyperdex but I am just trying to create UTXOs I have no issue waiting 5-10 minutes


[26-Jun-18 08:32 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
It's key to understand that DEX isn't meant to be a wallet, and there are no "withdraws"


[26-Jun-18 08:33 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Not going to pretend to be smart enough to understand the complexities of all of this but it seems like we are blaming core devs while we are using the wrong tool for the job


[26-Jun-18 08:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
The point is to allow you to use funds from your private wallet to freely trade for some other CoinX
Use your wallet for wallet things and DEX for trade things and you'll be golden


[26-Jun-18 08:34 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Not trying to be combative here


[26-Jun-18 08:35 AM] TomiDCat#6017
But creating UTXOs is something unique and new to me


[26-Jun-18 08:36 AM] TomiDCat#6017
When I have to mess around sending stuff back and forth to try and get a swap to go through I dont want to be paying excessive fees


[26-Jun-18 08:37 AM] TomiDCat#6017
I didnt think to try and use Agama to send to myself though so that is a way I can try that to bypass the fees


[26-Jun-18 08:39 AM] TomiDCat#6017
In the name of user friendly experience it seems like it would be possible to give them the option of using a lower fee if time is not important for a manual withdrawal


[26-Jun-18 08:39 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"it seems like we are blaming core devs while we are using the wrong tool for the job"
No, I'm placing "blame" estimate fee code on Core, because they wrote it. You asked why the fee is "high" and I responded specifically as to the difference.
Any wallet tools in DEX are meant for convenience and most coins don't suffer such an issue because their devs didn't code it to economically scale profits for miners.


[26-Jun-18 08:41 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Ok I accept your answer as being truthful as well, just wondering if it cannot be better


[26-Jun-18 08:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"In the name of user friendly experience it seems like it would be possible to give them the option of using a lower fee if time is not important for a manual withdrawal"
The short truth is that marketmaker uses the same code for both; however, I'm sure that devs would welcome anyone writing a separate, low-fee routine for manual transfers...


[26-Jun-18 08:45 AM] TomiDCat#6017
Ya I think that was the answer I was looking for


[26-Jun-18 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
"txfee" field can be passed into the marketmaker withdraw api


[26-Jun-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
if it isnt, for BTC, mm calculates what should get confirmed in a block or two as that is needed for following the atomic swap protocol


[26-Jun-18 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
not using the "txfee" field and letting m use the BTC stupidestimatefee api, well it is what it is

[matrix] <hermes_t:matrix.org> Latest version of Hyperdex ?


[03-Jul-18 10:02 PM] Mylo#8306
i think the  hyperdex devs like github issues if you've got the evidence already @Deleted User


[03-Jul-18 10:17 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
is it maybe a glitch result of sending it to yourself?

@WhiteWidow I don't think we will consider this beta until `marketmaker` v2 is released for us to build on, which may be a while


[04-Jul-18 12:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Deleted User Are you able to submit a GitHub issue with as much info as possible and we'll take a look into it


[04-Jul-18 02:06 AM] WhiteWidow#8771
@lukechilds K, thx for the update.


[04-Jul-18 02:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if you do a withdraw to yourself, the change output is merged to the last output value


[04-Jul-18 02:19 AM] jl777c#5810
so it might be that an extra output of 0.0001 would be needed to be the one to be merged into


[04-Jul-18 02:19 AM] jl777c#5810
eg. input 1 output 0.01 -> change 0.99 -> notices it is the same destination and merges to a single output


[04-Jul-18 02:19 AM] jl777c#5810
minimizing utxo explosion is the reason for this


[04-Jul-18 03:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Deleted User 
>I was trying to generate a BCH sell order, for 0.01 BCH.
>HyperDEX generated utxo for 0.1 instead.

Btw, HyperDEX has nothing to do with selecting the UTXOs for the sell orders or withdrawals. We just pass the parameters you set to `marketmaker` it and will place an order as close as it can to what you requested based on the UTXOs available. So this is `marketmaker` behaviour, unrelated to the GUI. The same issue will likely occur with the BarterDEX GUI or using the CLI


[04-Jul-18 03:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
So if you want to open an issue to track this, best to open an issue on the SuperNET repo

[04-Jul-18 07:25 AM] sindresorhus#8187
@cyrotiv You need to add the coin info and electrum servers to https://github.com/jl777/coins first. Then we'll pull it into HyperDEX. If your coin has a logo, also open an issue here to get a nice icon for it: https://github.com/hyperdexapp/cryptocurrency-icons

you only get the problem on win 10 and not on mac?

[05-Jul-18 01:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
Can you try going to `Debug > Show App Data` and move that entire folder somewhere
It's very important you don't delete it if you have already been using HyperDEX as it'll contain your encrypted seeds and trade history, just move it somewhere safe, and we can try and move it back later.
If you haven't done any trades or deposited any funds you can just delete it


[05-Jul-18 01:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
then try re-opening the app


[05-Jul-18 03:49 PM] jlbaseball11#9102
What is the payout schedule for the DEX coin?


[05-Jul-18 04:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
I think you need to ask in another channel, I have no idea, this is just for HyperDEX

ok thanks

@yugyug @lukechilds I had the same issue as yugyug.  Exact error stated... I did what you suggested and was able to log in.  What are the next steps to restore original keys?


[05-Jul-18 08:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
do you have swap history?


[05-Jul-18 08:05 PM] lukechilds#2707
or you only need the keys


[05-Jul-18 08:09 PM] 7rank#9952
@lukechilds just wanted to reinstate previous portfolio as I transferred some funds there


[05-Jul-18 08:53 PM] lukechilds#2707
So if you don't care about trade history, only the seed (funds), you can simple copy the portfolio folder from the backup you took into the new app data folder


[05-Jul-18 08:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
restart the app and it will list your previous portfolios and allow you to log in


[05-Jul-18 08:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
you will need to re-enable any non default currencies


[05-Jul-18 08:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
and it won't have your trade history


[05-Jul-18 08:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
but any funds you had will be there

@JackLeFou The trade system has been called BarterDEX and the 1st major reference GUI bears the same name; HyperDEX in an alternative GUI


[06-Jul-18 06:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
One of the main differences between the GUIs is that HyperDEX focuses on lite/SPV mode and "BarterDEX GUI" was designed to be a full reference implementation (meaning that it has "everything but the kitchen sink" in it)

[10-Jul-18 07:53 AM] Regnar#6164
I was thinking it could provide some type of positive benefit especially for atomic swap powered exchanges. I'm thinking that if you were to open HyperDEX to make a trade and see little volume you might just leave, but trades can happen any time but only when the DEX is open. So it might give people a reason to stay on and chat, find traders, or do something while they wait for confirmations. Obviously this could be done in here or telegram or something, but anyway.


[10-Jul-18 07:54 AM] Regnar#6164
just came to mind as I was waiting for the 5 confirmations for a swap and didn't have discord open to chat with people haha. Just a thought


[10-Jul-18 07:58 AM] yorklab#7270
A chat might be a way for people to set up direct trades also.


[10-Jul-18 08:00 AM] Regnar#6164
yea very true. just come for the hanging out, find someone wanting to trade haha


[10-Jul-18 08:01 AM] Regnar#6164
I think for true DEXs that will always be a problem. CEX can only have volume of the people in their wallets, but are very active because they are there to trade. We can have true population sized volume, but only if people are on at the right times and active.


[10-Jul-18 08:16 AM] Regnar#6164
It could probably go right where the swap box is on exchange tab.


[10-Jul-18 08:20 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

A troll box would definitely help keep attention on the books thats for sure . somewhere to hang while watching trades execute etc if its possible i think it would be a good addition


[10-Jul-18 08:34 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea, the dex needing to be open to make trades can make liquidity spotty, but if we have some other reasons to be on the dex too, it can help keep orderbooks open providing liquidity. I remember a few years ago hanging in the Poloniex trollbox with no intention to trade just killing time chatting, and then see an opportunity and place trades.


[10-Jul-18 08:35 AM] Regnar#6164
I know this is more of a real time auction so it's not meant to have trades open for weeks on end while you aren't online, but it can keep people on


[10-Jul-18 08:35 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

@Regnar For the Trollbox, @Alright worked out a way of making a TROLL blockchain that uses KV storage to facilitate chat. It would be a cool gimick, however every user would need to run a full node of TROLL for it to work.


[10-Jul-18 08:25 PM] Regnar#6164
yea I was thinking a little bit easier of a way, host a chat on the HyperDEX website (maybe hidden) use API so each HyperDEX app accesses it and can send through it.


[10-Jul-18 08:26 PM] Regnar#6164
given, the chat would be "centralized" but who cares lol


[10-Jul-18 08:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
You can make a centralised chat no problem, but that kind of ruins the philosophy behind the DEX>


[10-Jul-18 08:28 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe just use a Matrix Server?


[10-Jul-18 08:28 PM] Deleted User#0000

[10-Jul-18 08:47 PM] Regnar#6164
oh yea this would work


[10-Jul-18 08:50 PM] Regnar#6164
but I think the concept is actually pretty important for an atomic swap powered DEX. Like how I didn't think of it before, liquidity can be huge, but only if people are actively on it, and people who are only on it to trade won't be on it for long, or long enough to find buyers/sellers. So, add a feature that gets people to stay on it longer (for fun, company, or to find traders)

for BATA the DEX exchange states "coin disabled" and does not respond well to enable native or electrum

@lukechilds What do you think about this?


[15-Jul-18 10:36 PM] lukechilds#2707
It should run on a Raspberry Pi fine in terms of resources, however I'm not sure if `marketmaker` will compile on ARM, I haven't tried that


[15-Jul-18 10:38 PM] lukechilds#2707
Mobile app is definitely possible but I don't think it would be a replacement for a 24/7 box, it would absolutely kill the battery if it was always running in the background and would likely never get approved on the iOS app store


[15-Jul-18 10:39 PM] lukechilds#2707
An alternative would be to work on a fully featured API for `marketmaker` v2 which could run 24/7 on a cheap VPS and then the mobile/desktop client would connect directly to that as a thin client


[15-Jul-18 11:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm sure `marketmaker` will compile on Raspberry Pi fine.


[15-Jul-18 11:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Any GUI has to just replace the marketmaker in the app and it should work.


[15-Jul-18 11:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
best is to try the command line tools to run the app on Raspberry pi instead of expecting a prebuilt.


[15-Jul-18 11:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
BarterDEX GUI should work in that way.


[15-Jul-18 11:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
But since the Raspberry Pi is still a low resources machine, using it for DEX may or may not be as optimal on Desktop machines.


[15-Jul-18 11:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
should still be fine for using short time and tests.

Not sure how relevant it is or if the scenario would even come up but while having HDEX open when I open the GLX dICO app it crashes marketmaker and relaunches HDEX. Reproduced it quite a few times


[16-Jul-18 02:31 PM] DG#6934
I think they are using the same Marketmaker that can provoke that


[16-Jul-18 02:31 PM] DG#6934
they are the same process in some way

You cant run two marketmakers on the same computer. So its expected that the two apps cant run at once.

To do that in PIZZA/BEER stress test, I had to make 9 Virtual Machines to separate them all out.

And even then, each marketmaker had to be on a different netid... As you cant have 2 marketmakers using the same public IP on the same net id.

Dont forget it is 1 mm per wan IP also.....not just computer


[16-Jul-18 07:55 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is something we hope is fixed in mm 2.0


[16-Jul-18 07:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes. Unless you are using multiple NetID's then you can run more than one... Thats only a nanomsg limitation as far as I am aware. Moving away from nanomsg is probably required for MM2.0. IMO.


[16-Jul-18 07:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont know if you can get away from nanomsg, seems to be ingrained ....


[16-Jul-18 07:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
There has to exist better suited network stacks that can be used, I guess james used nanomsg because its C code and he had experience with it from iguana.


[16-Jul-18 07:58 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes and it worked

well if we want to scale


[16-Jul-18 07:59 PM] hyperDEX#6586
mm 2.0 will be using rust which should be much better in terms of memory handling, so i have high hopes that we can make something decent

@DG That's weird.

I have a bob node that has been up for a bit (~24 hours), there are active orders on it.  How do I make that bob to show up in HyperDEX? One cannot make a trade if custoemrs can't find him... I understand it is a matter of connections and who can see who. So how do I make myself seen? (If this is something that can be done, I can see a 'premium bob' service offering in the future...)


[18-Jul-18 01:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Special bobs for everyone @jansako


[18-Jul-18 01:26 AM] hyperDEX#6586
We dont do anything special, so if it is not showing up in hyper, it probably is not showing up on barterDEX. Maybe speak to @siu or @cipi they are masters in the craft


[18-Jul-18 01:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
Check your marketmakers mem use, and try restarting it. Sometimes orderbooks just stop working, and other times orderooks show but trades dont respond. I also advise using the release atrem posted yesterday instead of the marketmaker in jl's SuperNET repo.


[18-Jul-18 01:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
seemed to help the bob I am looking after.


[18-Jul-18 02:26 AM] jansako#3330
Taking this to #dev-marketmaker . thx!


[18-Jul-18 05:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
@jansako in HyperDEX we strip out orders with 0 UTXOs from the order book


[18-Jul-18 05:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
but it's unlikely that's the issue if your Bob is funded


[18-Jul-18 05:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
you can manually inspect the requests in the network tab of dev tools to view the raw order book response


[18-Jul-18 05:33 AM] jansako#3330
It was not showing in HyperDEX or Dexstats orderbooks, so not your issue. Restarted MM and the orders do. I just need to keep an eye out for when they drop off & restart the bob again...

Roger!


[19-Jul-18 02:53 AM] jorian#4555
that can actually be done: when you do the withdraw script, you can define the `txfee`. if you make that max button subtract the txfee from it, the withdraw works. standard txfee is 10,000, but i've used lower ones in my withdraw script perfectly fine


[19-Jul-18 02:53 AM] jorian#4555
and since you work with SPV only, no weird issues with native can rise, like stuck cache or sth.


[19-Jul-18 02:58 AM] jorian#4555
```{
    "method": "withdraw",

I'm trying to trade some DEX and a little bit of SUPERNET on HyperDEX.  Does anybody want to trade?  I will trade under market value.  I've been trying to trade them for more than a month now on coinexchange, barterdex, and now hyperdex.  I've got multiple UTXO's, but can't ever get a trade to go through.  If you are willing to help, I would much appreciate it!!!  Thanks in advance.

[19-Jul-18 05:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
@sindresorhus re specifying a txfee, that works fine for alts with hardcoded tx values but is totally hit and miss with currencies like BTC/LTC/ETH with agressive fee markets


[19-Jul-18 05:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
there is no single fee size that will guarantee a fast transaction


[19-Jul-18 05:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
and you need to know the size of the transaction to calculate a good fee size


[19-Jul-18 05:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
which depends entirely on the user's UTXO set


[19-Jul-18 06:02 AM] ranfoltu#0306

Giving up on barterdex for now, upgrading to hyperdex

Hyperdex doesnt leave orders open I think

Right, I understood that.. I just keep trying multiple times per day to see if any orders will go through I suppose

Berterdex will still work, if you want to trade with native wallets, you still need barterdex. Native has not been added to HyperDEX at this stage.

Never used Hyperdex - when I get to choosing Restore Portfolio or Create New Portfolio - do I choose restore and enter my Agama seed or do I make a new one and it gives me a seed specific to Hyperdex? 

Sorry, I‚Äôve used Barterdex but not Hyper

What happens if you place an order but there isn‚Äôt enough of the other token to fill?

Stuck in swap 3/5 and the order book has now gone blank.

Funds have been taken from my end but the coin I want to purchase is still 0


[20-Jul-18 01:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
During the swap the funds are locked


[20-Jul-18 01:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So the swap has to go on


[20-Jul-18 01:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
if the swap is stuk that sometimes means that bob has lost connection or something like that


[20-Jul-18 01:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
funds are returned after x hours (I think 4?)

The problem seems to be on the bob side, its failing to create the bob deposit transaction. I need to try and isolate this issue so we can get it fixed. Its a strange one, but its happened a few times now, so it should be able to be reproduced.

Doesnt alice blacklist bobs after a while?


[20-Jul-18 07:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes, I think thats for non responding bobs or something though. What seems to be the case is that bobdeposit is either not sent, or is not seen. Its appears to be fail on the creating of the transaction. I am working on getting swaps files and console outputs of swapstatus and I will forward these to james/artem and see if we can find the issue.

[21-Jul-18 06:52 PM] dukeleto#7326
@hyperDEX i was working on electrum support for it, but it's not easy due to the custom VerusHash algo. It requires a custom Electrum UI, custom electrumXserver *and* a version of VerusHash written in Python, which doesn't yet exist (for electrumx to use)


[21-Jul-18 06:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@hyperDEX i was mostly asking about native. what do you mean you don't have a way of enabling native? I might be able to help


[21-Jul-18 06:53 PM] dukeleto#7326
@DG good to hear, I have been mining a lot of it and hoping for buyers üòÉ


[21-Jul-18 11:16 PM] lukechilds#2707
@hyperDEX @Cryptoon Were you running HyperDEX and BarterDEX together? If so, one may block access to the other as they fight over ports.

But if the order book isn't showing up that's an mm issue not a GUI issue, we just display what we get from mm. You can view the data in the network tab which is the same response you'd get from a CLI response.


[21-Jul-18 11:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
@dukeleto We only support enabling coins in native mode because we don't think it's realistic that most users will install the entire blockchain for all coins they want to trade. It just wasn't a priority over other features. If you just want to test Verus then it should be fairly easy to just hack support in for Verus in native. However to reliably add native support for all coins will require quite a bit more effort.

> `If possible Web-RTC would be a great protocol to build mmv2 on`

MM2 compiled to WASM and wrapped in a WebRTC layer running in Chromium on Raspberry Pi 3, totally can do.

Raspberry Pi 3 [webtcp or ws2s, Chromium [WASM MM2  <-> JS layer implementing WebRTC API]] <-> PC [WebRTC <-> GUI].

Plus WASM version of MM2 might make it easier to embed MM2 in a GUI.

its just the alice claim, the trade is finished already, if its not claiming it, a restart or swapstatus call should claim it. I think newest hyperdex should auto claim them now though.

I hope those weren't charged questions, just curious


[23-Jul-18 08:06 PM] tolken#2655
@lukechilds is there a significant cost/expense or risk to calling swapstatus (kickstarting?) in bdex? I‚Äôve just wondered why bdex doesn‚Äôt more aggressively check this itself, or if I should concern myself with calling it too frequently.


[23-Jul-18 09:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
@tolken Yeah there is, `marketmaker` is single threaded so any RPC command you call blocks the main thread. `swapstatus` is pretty slow so calling it a lot slows down `marketmaker`. Originally we were using it as a single source of truth for our app state and polling it every second and re-rendering on changes. This absolutely destroyed performance and also made `marketmaker` very unstable and prone to crashing.

We now instead subscribe to the socket event messages to read updates on the status of swaps and have some some internal logic to occasionally call `swapstatus`/`kickstart` on specific swaps that we think we maybe out of sync with or that `marketmaker` has forgotten about.

In general you should avoid calling `swapstatus`/`kickstart` alone, you should call it with `requestid`/`quoteid` arguments to only query a specific trade. We've frequently experienced crashes was querying all swaps with `swapstatus` .

Really great info, thanks @lukechilds - been wondering about that for a while.  It also gives me better insight where I may want to use the socket info - which once I saw it wasn‚Äôt entirely sure what I was going to do with it.

[23-Jul-18 10:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah we considered parsing the filesytem based DB but it's just not practical for a robust system


[23-Jul-18 10:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
we want to be able to support remote mm connections


[23-Jul-18 10:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
which obviously won't work if you need to read the disk on the mm node


[23-Jul-18 10:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
without a load of hacks anyway


[23-Jul-18 10:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
socket messages are the way to go


[23-Jul-18 10:13 PM] lukechilds#2707
and then on completion we re-render everything from the final message
and conservatively send `swapstaus`/`kickstart` messages to specific swaps that looks like they could be out of sync


[23-Jul-18 10:13 PM] lukechilds#2707
to allow us to recover lost data if we went offline for a while


[23-Jul-18 10:13 PM] lukechilds#2707
the situation is not great though


[23-Jul-18 10:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you want to have any kind of decent performance you need to replicate the entire state to your app and constantly apply loads of hacks to make sure it doesn't go out of sync with mm


[23-Jul-18 10:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
we are pushing hard for a proper internal DB with mmv2 like SQLite that we can query via a nice API


[23-Jul-18 10:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
so no need to duplicate swap data, we can just query that performantly to get the app state


[23-Jul-18 10:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
and also do complex queries like filtering/ordering trades etc

[23-Jul-18 10:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
@smellycouch All good questions.

**How fast is hyperdex compared to barterdex?**
The HyperDEX GUI and BarterDEX GUI are purely GUI implementations over the `marketmaker` daemon. They both use the same underlying library to interface with the BarterDEX network. So actual real performance should be the same. However HyperDEX communicates in a much more optimised way which should result in updates from `marketmaker` being rendered much quicker (almost realtime) compared to BarterDEX GUI.

**How long does it take to complete a trade with btc?**
Currently, while we're in alpha it's hardcoded to require 1 conf for each tx on each chain. There are 5 steps to the atomic swap protocol from Alices perspective so it's roughly (alicecoin blocktime * 2) + (bobcoin blocktime * 3). So if Alice coin is BTC (10 min blocktime) and Bob coin is KMD (1 min block time) you should expect the entire trade to take around 23 minutes.

Obviously 1 conf for all coins regardless fo hashrate is not very secure, it just makes testing easier while we're in alpha. We will change these to more sensible values and allow users to override them with their own in the future.

We are also looking into implementing secure 0-conf swaps which will allow you to make any trade regardless of blocktime in a matter of seconds. 0-conf is secured by requiring both parties lock up collateral which will be confiscated in the event anything goes wrong.

**Other than the lack of third party (which is awesome), what other advantages do atomic swaps have for a dex over multisig?**
It pretty much is only the lack of a third party, that's a huge benefit. At the cost of everything else. Speed and simplicity suffers so that we can get real trustless exchanges without a third party. I'm not 100% how the multisig "DEX"s handle disputes, but there is no need for this in HyperDEX as the swap is an atomic operation. Either you get the funds you traded for, or you don't and you still have you original funds. There is no other possible outcome. (assuming the code is bug free :trollface:)

Hi - Using HyperDex today- have seen a few swaps get stuck at 2/5 3/5 stage today whilst similar ones go through. Using the latest Alpha version with the restart capability but still the swap not getting completed or failed. How long should i be waiting for it to tidy itself up like it does in BDex when you kickstart stagnant trade? Swapping ETH>KMD, HUSH>KMD and KMD>Zilla - thks

@DG i installed bdex and hyperdex  on my notebook. but i did not run both together. today when trying to login hyperdex error message ‚Äú market maker crashed‚Äù was pop- uped .


[25-Jul-18 09:43 PM] cheeweon#5786
i  heard to be listed on bdex or hyperdex , token or coin must be bitcoin-based. i cant understand what ‚Äúbitcoin-based‚Äù  means.  for example stellar is not be bitcoin-based?


[25-Jul-18 10:56 PM] cipi#4502
"bitcoin-based" means the wallet has a RPC-API with this calls: https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-reference#bitcoin-core-apis
so calls like "gettxout", "importaddress", "sendrawtransaction" and so on are supported...
btw. ERC20-stuff works too


[25-Jul-18 11:08 PM] cheeweon#5786
@cipi i am not a pro dev. so i cant understand it .  generally centralized exchanges are listing many coins or tokens like stellar,btc  etc  .  bdex is limited ?   i have a coin - on testnet currently, mainnet q4 2018 , not erc 20 token-  that want to list on bdex .


[25-Jul-18 11:12 PM] cipi#4502
yes, BarterDEX is limited, because it must deal with every coin in part, so every trade on BarterDEX is onchain, means transactions are made on the blockchains of the involved coins... means BarterDEX must know how to create transactions of the coins... centralized exchanges do nothing onchain, in fact you are not even trading coins there, only some database entries and you must trust them that the coins you trade there really exist and are not only database entries üòÉ


[25-Jul-18 11:17 PM] cheeweon#5786
i understood  what   you mean. so is not stellar bitcoin-based? if yes then stellar cant be listed ever?


[25-Jul-18 11:20 PM] cipi#4502
no, unfortunately not... else, i had integrated it a long time ago üòÉ if it will be possible to ever list it, is another question, but i don't know the answer, @jl777c has to answer this


[25-Jul-18 11:25 PM] cheeweon#5786
what questions should i ask dev of project that i want to list on bdex?


[25-Jul-18 11:28 PM] cipi#4502
if he wants to integrate a ERC20-token, the contract must be really ERC20 (not ERC223)  and it must have the methods "approve" and "transferFrom" (99% of ERC20 have this)
if he wants to integrate a bitcoin-RPC-compatible coin, the wallet must support some basic calls, like "gettxout" and "importaddress" and it must have BIP65 activated: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0065.mediawiki

we will have to test each coin in part, to be sure it is working


[26-Jul-18 12:02 AM] jl777c#5810
in theory ripple and stellar could be supported as long as they have multisig


[26-Jul-18 12:03 AM] jl777c#5810
support via ILP might be a more practical way


[26-Jul-18 12:26 AM] cheeweon#5786

@hyperDEX  what do you need?


[29-Jul-18 11:18 AM] monokh#4656
Hi, i found the HyperDex really interesting, i had a few questions
- i notice it uses these "SuperNET" node. what is this? does it have any implications for centralisation?  i couldn't find any details about this software
- Is it using a true chain to chain atomic swap? I.e. as a user i hold my own private key and i can execute the swap using my own block chain nodes?


[29-Jul-18 11:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
HyperDex uses electrum servers, so you hold the private keys, but the transacton is broadcast on a server so you dont need the entire blockchain. BarterDEX supports Native coins.


[29-Jul-18 11:37 AM] monokh#4656
thanks @Deleted User  is there no dependency on komodo? If i'm trading bitcoin to litecoin for example, does anyone of the process hit the komodo blockchain?


[29-Jul-18 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is not needed


[29-Jul-18 11:42 AM] monokh#4656
thanks @jl777c  as you developed the Supernet library, would you mind  explaining it's function? It is a pretty large library but i cannot find any info on what it's role is in the atomic swaps


[29-Jul-18 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it implements all but the low level crypto libraries


[29-Jul-18 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
all the atomic swaps, rawtransaction handling, networking, orderbooks, api, etc.


[29-Jul-18 11:47 AM] monokh#4656
i see, so with this library, I could technically run my own barterdex with orderbooks etc. with the use of the supernet node? 
there aren't any centralised points of information that the barterdex/hyperdex needs?


[29-Jul-18 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
correct. you could setup marketmakers on one of the 14000+ netids and not use any of the existing barterDEX infrastructure


[29-Jul-18 11:58 AM] monokh#4656
that's really amazing...


[29-Jul-18 11:58 AM] monokh#4656
but what really is the incentive for the developers? i noticed there is a fee involved, how do you setup which person can take the fee?


[29-Jul-18 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the dexfee goes to a special address


[29-Jul-18 12:08 PM] monokh#4656
at which level is the fee defined? The ui application which facilitates the transfer i.e. barterdex/hyperdex or the network like supernet?

Its very easy you just have to go to the exchange tab and select the coins you want to swap.

But I think hyperdex has an auto utxo splitter?


[30-Jul-18 02:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think for reliability its best to have a "trading" address with a spread of UTXO's then trades just always work. thats how I have always done it for a long time, and rarely have faliures.


[30-Jul-18 05:14 AM] 7rank#9952
@Deleted User can you elaborate?  How did you set up the spread that works most of the time?


[30-Jul-18 05:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Just have lots of them. I always yuse the same address then sent a heap of 10 KMD to it... over time the transactions cause change UTXO's to fill up the wallet... occasionally they get a bit small, sou you need to withdraw some KMD back to your own address to consolidate some of them. This way there is always lots of dust UTXO to use for the Alice Dex fee aswell. No nede to worry about splitting UTXO's and all that stuff.


[30-Jul-18 05:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
BarterDEX has the UTXO inventory, which is good to use to split one deposit in one transaction to save on transaction fees and time.


[30-Jul-18 05:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
Once you have it set up, it works for quite some time.


[30-Jul-18 05:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
Its not like I buy 100's of KMD volume of anything though.

send you KMD to trading address, make inventory... 10-50 UTXO 10-20 KMD in size and a few 0.1 to start with is pretty good.


[30-Jul-18 05:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
you should get matched on any trade that way, proveded the bob is working.

@Cryptoon @Deleted User thanks for your input, guys.  I'll try this from now on.  For some reason I though hyperDEX removed the utxo hurdle from users.  However, after many unmatched trades it would explain why I'm having issues.


[30-Jul-18 05:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
It does not `join` UTXO together... it can only trade up to the larges UTXO you have, and doesnt really tell you this.


[30-Jul-18 05:23 AM] 7rank#9952
@Cryptoon for larger trades, do you recommend the 2 transactions funding approach?


[30-Jul-18 05:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
unmatched doesn't necessarily mean you did anything wrong either... I was trying to buy GAME earlier, 2nd trade for 3 GAME was matched,  but only bought 0.9 adn then after than couldnt get a single trade through.


[30-Jul-18 05:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
Most bobs dont have large UTXO's for sale. so buy/sellign large amounts you usually need to do heaps of smaller trades.


[30-Jul-18 05:45 AM] 7rank#9952
@Deleted User I understand. Thx


[30-Jul-18 06:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
When I get a hit, I try the same amounts, if it's unmatched, it usually means the UTXO's of the sellers aren't matching yours so you can try different size orders/utxo's

Are you trying to open it with barterdex already open? Seems like possibly the marletmaker is crashing or not starting.

what do you mean... HyperDEX trades time out after 60s unless they match and complete

fwiw, i uninstalled and reinstalled. whatever the issue was went away and im now able to log in


[31-Jul-18 09:55 AM] Moonraker.Breaks#5590
My wallet shows my balance - my hyperdex balance. Hyperdex shows my swaps and "no match". It also shows "18 assets" my hyperdex deposit wallet shows 0.


[31-Jul-18 09:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
HyperDEX has a bunch of coins activated by default. I am not 100% sure how you remove an unmatched swap. Unmatched means it did not match and timed out. The DEX can only make trades while you are online, if you ave gone offline, (closed the app for any reason) that trade is dead.


[31-Jul-18 10:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
If it was unmatched it never found a seller and nothing happened.


[31-Jul-18 10:03 AM] Moonraker.Breaks#5590

[31-Jul-18 11:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
could be an issue with the underlying `marketmaker` daemon locking up your UTXOs which is out of the control of HyperDEX (we just build the GUI)


[31-Jul-18 11:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
you could try downloading HyperDEX Nightly


[31-Jul-18 11:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
import your seed into that


[31-Jul-18 11:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
then withdraw your funds


[31-Jul-18 11:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
they are totally isolated instances


[31-Jul-18 11:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
won't fix the bug, but will enable you to withdraw your funds


[31-Jul-18 11:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
you should avoid running both HyperDEX and HyperDEX Nightly at the same time too

Important: If you have used any previous beta version, you need to delete your trade history as this version has an incompatible format. Right after opening this version, go to the "Debug" menu and choose "Delete Trade History".

[01-Aug-18 07:14 PM] cipi#4502
can't see any CHIPS requests... means your node didn't sent the request to the network... so you either don't have proper UTXOs for the coin you used to buy CHIPS or marketmaker does not have proper connection to the network.... the console output of marketmaker will tell you what is wrong

Quick question, so there is no way to add a non-stardard non-komodo address based coin to hyperdex? The reason I ask is because there is a HUGE need for anytype of exchange for a sia-fork coin called hyperspace that currently has nothing to exchange with and people are resorting to private escrow via members in discord. Hyperdex would really be a great platform for this.


[03-Aug-18 12:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
And since they had a huge airdrop for sia holder it would be wise to be one of the first DEX services to be able to support P2P trades in it. Plus with all the legal trouble in SIA with the failed manufacturer of SC1 miners made in the usa im thinking a lot of sia holders will move mining and coins to hyperspace IMO..

Hi, i,m not sure if my BarterDEX (ver. 1.1.1. on Linux) works properly and would appreciate some clarification. When I try to buy some BTC for KMD I don't see my order, though the terminal shows that something is going on (fill.1  gtc.1) and then there's  message  saying "time expired for Alice_request". It then repeats and  also information about other requests occur

How long on average does it take until you find a trade partner?


[05-Aug-18 09:53 PM] jspook16#3059
it depends on what you are trying to trade. there isnt alot of volume on all trade pairs yet


[05-Aug-18 09:53 PM] jspook16#3059
what are you trading?

[06-Aug-18 04:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@sindresorhus ok, but is that also the reason why my orderbooks won't load?

@jspook16 i am trying to buy BTC for KMD


[06-Aug-18 01:55 PM] Erast#4164
@jspook16  buying BTC for KMD


[06-Aug-18 09:11 PM] jspook16#3059
you need to look at your UTXOs and try different amounts. You could look at the BTC orders and see what size their UTXOs are and try to match one.


[06-Aug-18 09:12 PM] jspook16#3059
@Erast Have you tried on hyperdex? that might be easier


[06-Aug-18 10:57 PM] Erast#4164
I guess I'll try hyperdex


[07-Aug-18 12:51 AM] Erast#4164
I am trying different amounts on hyperdex and they are all mismatched. Could the reason be not enough utxo for a fee?

Howw do i create a Order on hyper dex? if i buy or sell for a amount not currently offered by set orders?


[07-Aug-18 01:09 PM] 135b987#6684
i tried to play around and got the error code -9999


[07-Aug-18 01:10 PM] 135b987#6684
its not exactly described in the kb https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/322240534/How+to+view+Open+Orders+and+Swap+History


[07-Aug-18 01:14 PM] 135b987#6684
are the orderbooks for all dex based on komodo the same? lets say barterdex and hyperdex orders?


[07-Aug-18 01:15 PM] 135b987#6684
since the dex is only the gui?


[08-Aug-18 01:36 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
@135b987 yes, HyperDEX and BarterDEX have the same underlying orderbooks


[08-Aug-18 02:19 AM] sindresorhus#8187
@Cryptoon If you mean the rate-limit issue, it should not, but could potentially, since Marketmaker (which handles the orderbooks) talks to CMC too, and not being able to talk to CMC might block its other operations, like getting the orderbooks. @lukechilds Would probably be able to give a more accurate answer.


[08-Aug-18 02:33 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Cryptoon I don't think CMC rate limiting will stop your order books showing up. I often get rate limited by CMC and my order book still shows. Sometimes it does take a while for them to sync. Can you view the requests in the network tab and verify they are getting through to market maker?

You could also try running `_api.debug({method: 'getpeers'})` in the console to see how many peers you are connected too. If you're poorly connected that may be why


[08-Aug-18 02:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
But sometimes and on certain networks it does just take a very long time for order books to show, this is something I've noticed myself and is a problem with the underlying `marketmaker`  daemon. We poll it once a second for order book data and as soon as it gives us some info, we show it.


[08-Aug-18 04:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I'll see if I have time later to test it, will get back to you

The above error may be related to this?


[10-Aug-18 04:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
Did you follow the installation instructions and delete your trade history if you're upgrading from an old version?


[10-Aug-18 04:54 AM] sindresorhus#8187
@Cryptoon Did you do this?

[10-Aug-18 04:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[10-Aug-18 05:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
the above error is not showing anymore though


[10-Aug-18 05:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
Can you check the network tab in dev tools


[10-Aug-18 05:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
there should be lots of requests


[10-Aug-18 05:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
alternating between `portfolio` and `orderbook`


[10-Aug-18 05:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
you can view the direct response from `marketmaker` there


[10-Aug-18 05:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362

click on the most recent 127.0.01 request

you will be able to view the request/response

if it looks related to your portfolio, view the one after it instead, that should be an order book request

yep, the order book is empty


[10-Aug-18 05:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's coming directly from `marketmaker`


[10-Aug-18 05:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
you can right click a request `copy > copy as cURL` and then paste it into your terminal


[10-Aug-18 05:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
that is essentially using "CLI marketmaker"


[10-Aug-18 05:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
you will get the same response

it didn't say
```
node not found

?


[10-Aug-18 06:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
no, that wont work for you


[10-Aug-18 06:06 AM] snowdamn#2414
killall, delete folder, run


[10-Aug-18 06:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
You can try but I don't think it will resolve the issue


[10-Aug-18 06:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
it appears to be an issue with mm


[10-Aug-18 06:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
the GUI is working as expected, but mm isn't connecting to any peers


[10-Aug-18 06:08 AM] snowdamn#2414
don't mean to beat a dead horse here, but definitely killall mm if you try

now this will download the HyperDEX source code


[10-Aug-18 06:20 AM] lukechilds#2707
```
git clone https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex.git
```


[10-Aug-18 06:20 AM] Cryptoon#3362
done


[10-Aug-18 06:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
now move into the folder


[10-Aug-18 06:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
```
cd hyperdex
```


[10-Aug-18 06:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
done


[10-Aug-18 06:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
and run
```
yarn start
```


[10-Aug-18 06:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
that will install all dependencies, build everything and then launch the built binary


[10-Aug-18 06:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
might take a few mins


[10-Aug-18 06:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
oh, make sure you close the current HyperDEX instance too if you still have that running


[10-Aug-18 06:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah just tought about that before starting the git clone process

I'm seeing this before it starts building electron


[10-Aug-18 06:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
app is now called electron instead of hyperdex


[10-Aug-18 06:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
normal?

did you run it again without the error?


[10-Aug-18 06:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
or it finished ok despite the errors?


[10-Aug-18 06:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Just let it do it's thing and now I am at the login screen of electron app


[10-Aug-18 06:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
ok


[10-Aug-18 06:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
finished installing despite errors


[10-Aug-18 06:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
you can ignore all the Electron errors


[10-Aug-18 06:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
it just spams the terminal with loads of useless stuff


[10-Aug-18 06:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
roger


[10-Aug-18 06:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
can you try logging in with this build


[10-Aug-18 06:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
and see if you have the same order book issue


[10-Aug-18 06:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
if you do, we will try dropping in the BarterDEX GUI mm binary and re-launch


[10-Aug-18 06:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I see a lot of console output now aswell


[10-Aug-18 06:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
some errors in there


[10-Aug-18 06:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
if they are electron errors you can ignore them


[10-Aug-18 06:28 AM] lukechilds#2707
let it sit on the order book view for a few mins

these are not my adresses though


[10-Aug-18 06:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
no, those are the addresses of the bobs


[10-Aug-18 06:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
adress of seller probably


[10-Aug-18 06:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
so you're seeing stuff in the order book right?


[10-Aug-18 06:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah now showing up in gui as well


[10-Aug-18 06:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
only one kmd sell order for now, but it's more than before :p


[10-Aug-18 06:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's very strange, we literally haven't made any commits since the v0.1.0-alpha.12 release, so this build should be identical


[10-Aug-18 06:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
can you try closing that


[10-Aug-18 06:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
nuking the downloaded .app


[10-Aug-18 06:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
3 bid/asks


[10-Aug-18 06:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
and redownloading the v0.1.0-alpha.12 release


[10-Aug-18 06:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
kill process or normal close?


[10-Aug-18 06:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
you will probably have to do both in dev mode


[10-Aug-18 06:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
or jsut CTRL+c in the terminal


[10-Aug-18 06:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
and it will kill everything


[10-Aug-18 06:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
ok so just redownload from github fresh?


[10-Aug-18 06:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
delete some folders first?


[10-Aug-18 06:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
infact you don't even need to delete anything


[10-Aug-18 06:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
you will overwrite the old .app


[10-Aug-18 06:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
if you download the dmg and install via that

[10-Aug-18 06:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I have one peer?


[10-Aug-18 06:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
no order book though


[10-Aug-18 06:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
the peer could be the cmc peer?


[10-Aug-18 06:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
no that's marketmaker peers


[10-Aug-18 06:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
so you definitely have a peer now which you didn't before


[10-Aug-18 06:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
because it says one peer, but I dont see anything in the orderbooks


[10-Aug-18 06:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
hmmn


[10-Aug-18 06:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
can you run the getpeers command again


[10-Aug-18 06:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
have HyperDEX running?


[10-Aug-18 06:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yes


[10-Aug-18 06:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, see if you have any more peers

it's the peer's ip addr I presume?


[10-Aug-18 06:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
yep


[10-Aug-18 06:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
one peer is not a lot


[10-Aug-18 06:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But in network I dont see any orderbooks


[10-Aug-18 06:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
it normally takes 3+ to get a decent view of the order book


[10-Aug-18 06:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
3+ peers


[10-Aug-18 06:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So why is it connecting to that peer if it doesnt have an orderbook?


[10-Aug-18 06:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
peers and order books are unrelated


[10-Aug-18 06:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah k


[10-Aug-18 06:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
it will try to connect to peers and join the network


[10-Aug-18 06:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
peers will relay order books to eachother


[10-Aug-18 06:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
I believe


[10-Aug-18 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
orderbooks dont actually exist


[10-Aug-18 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
what exists are pubkeys and prices


[10-Aug-18 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
locally this is used to construct an orderbook


[10-Aug-18 06:55 AM] lukechilds#2707
relay orders* I should have said


[10-Aug-18 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
but it really has nothing to do with anything other than what is displayed locally


[10-Aug-18 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
as in, you can do a swap without ever having created an orderbook


[10-Aug-18 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a network


[10-Aug-18 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
you submit a request to


[10-Aug-18 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
if a bob sees it and it is a swap he is configured to do, he will respond back


[10-Aug-18 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
these initial responses include the specific txids being swapped


[10-Aug-18 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is no need to get a compleete list of utxo of all nodes propagated to all other nodes (bad idea to do that)


[10-Aug-18 06:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
so if you have 1 peer


[10-Aug-18 06:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
should you have a good chance of getting matched?


[10-Aug-18 06:58 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Cryptoon Can you try going on CHIPS/KMD and placing a buy order with a price of 0.09 for a total of 0.01 KMD?


[10-Aug-18 06:58 AM] lukechilds#2707
see if you can get a match


[10-Aug-18 06:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
will transfer some kmd into that wallet one moment


[10-Aug-18 07:00 AM] lukechilds#2707
make sure you do 2 transfers so you have enough UTXOs


[10-Aug-18 07:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I dont see an orderbook for chips/kmd though?


[10-Aug-18 07:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
buy one chips for a price of 0.01 I presume


[10-Aug-18 07:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
When I click buy chips the button greys out and nothing happens


[10-Aug-18 07:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362

placing an order just greys out the buy chips button and nothing happens


[10-Aug-18 07:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
sounds like mm is hanging


[10-Aug-18 07:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
if you view the network tab can you see requests going through?


[10-Aug-18 07:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
or does it just say pending?


[10-Aug-18 07:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I rebooted mm


[10-Aug-18 07:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
it was showing stuff in network


[10-Aug-18 07:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But as it has been from the first release untill now, after 15 minutes I get the feeling my marketmaker dies


[10-Aug-18 07:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but rebooting hyper always fixed that


[10-Aug-18 07:28 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But now from booting it also greys out when pressing buy/sell


[10-Aug-18 07:51 AM] lukechilds#2707
If you view the network tab as your press buy/sell do all the requests stop?


[10-Aug-18 07:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
we grey out the button until mm responds to the order request


[10-Aug-18 07:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
and it can't do anything else while it's processing that request so it blocks everything


[10-Aug-18 07:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
normally it doesn't take too long but occasionally it can take quite a while


[10-Aug-18 07:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
and I think you will probably need atleast one peer before placing an order


[10-Aug-18 07:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
otherwise I don't think you'll be able to broadcast it to the network


[10-Aug-18 08:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah after I restarted it just wasnt connecting to peers anymore


[10-Aug-18 08:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
which is probably why the button was greyed out


[10-Aug-18 08:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
very odd


[10-Aug-18 08:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
it really sounds like some kind of networking/firewall issue on your end


[10-Aug-18 08:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
but the fact that you get the same issue at home and at work


[10-Aug-18 08:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
and the fact that the dev build worked ok


[10-Aug-18 08:40 AM] lukechilds#2707
doesn't really support that theory


[10-Aug-18 08:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
could you maybe try alternating between the dev build and the prebuilt binary a few times


[10-Aug-18 08:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
let it run for a few mins, then check the connected peers


[10-Aug-18 08:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
if you try on dev build, then on prebuilt and do that about three times on each


[10-Aug-18 08:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
if you consistently get peers on the dev build but not on the pre built release at least we can be sure it's something to do with the release build


[10-Aug-18 08:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I'm gonna have to try that in weekend, got a lot of work left and need to go out with the in laws in a bit


[10-Aug-18 08:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah no worries


[10-Aug-18 08:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
ping me if you need a hand


[10-Aug-18 08:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
thanks for taking the time to look into it üëç


[10-Aug-18 08:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
no worries, sent someone with the same mac build as me a message that they test as well


[10-Aug-18 08:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
to see if orderbooks load yes/no


[10-Aug-18 09:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok had my brother test it, same problem


[10-Aug-18 09:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
fresh download


[10-Aug-18 09:10 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and he is at his place and on his laptop, so again completely different network/machine setting


[10-Aug-18 09:10 AM] Cryptoon#3362
will try the toggle between dev and github build tomorrow if I have the time, but I *think* the problem is at the level of the build


[10-Aug-18 09:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
That's very strange


[10-Aug-18 09:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
I can run the latest build fine on my machine


[10-Aug-18 09:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
do you mind saying what country/location you're in?


[10-Aug-18 09:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
it's possible you could have weak network connectivity to the rest of the network


[10-Aug-18 09:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
from a geographical perspective


[10-Aug-18 09:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
although that would mean the issue would persist on the dev build and BarterDEX GUI too which it doesn't

Today I tried to use both Barterdex and HyperDex several times. Both failed. I downloaded Hyperdex 12 and retried. The result was same. It gave error message like "not connecting to market place". I tried again in the evening. Maybe problem with my machine. I will try it on other machine.


[18-Aug-18 05:24 AM] DanMercurius#7990
Hello! I tried to update my Barterdex to 1.1.1 today. When I start it, I get error messages for all electrum wallets of my coins previously added to 'startup'. Additionally all coins come up as 'undefined'


[18-Aug-18 05:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
Hi @DanMercurius this channel is for HyperDEX development


[18-Aug-18 05:47 AM] DanMercurius#7990
Hi @lukechilds ! thanks, could you please point me to the barterdex channel? can't find it...


[18-Aug-18 05:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
To be honest I'm not sure one exists


[18-Aug-18 05:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
you could try contacting @grewalsatinder but I'm not sure he works on it much anymore


[18-Aug-18 05:48 AM] DanMercurius#7990
it states on the komodo website and github to please test barterdex and give feedback in the BarterDex channel on discord...


[18-Aug-18 05:48 AM] DanMercurius#7990
ok so should I transfer my assets from barterdex to hyperdex? 
Would be great to communicate discontinuation of barterdex to users...


[18-Aug-18 05:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think it's discontinued


[18-Aug-18 05:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
I think Grewal just moved on to something else


[18-Aug-18 05:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm really not too sure


[18-Aug-18 05:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
I'm not involved with BarterDEX development


[18-Aug-18 05:50 AM] DanMercurius#7990
^^ per definition not working on sth anymore is 'discontinued' . language fails again xD


[18-Aug-18 05:50 AM] DanMercurius#7990
is there a best practice to follow when moving assets from barterdex to hyperdex?


[18-Aug-18 05:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
the seeds are compatible


[18-Aug-18 05:50 AM] lukechilds#2707
so instead of creating a new wallet in HyperDEX

yep, I'm on to token exchange GUI which is CC


[18-Aug-18 05:55 AM] DanMercurius#7990
not scared that easily ^^ one quick question:
@grewalsatinder  Should I make a backup of my legacy coin db (which seems corrupted now, since all coins are shown as 'undefined) before resetting it in 1.1.1?


[18-Aug-18 05:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@DanMercurius don't need to fiddle with your BarterDEX data folder. just follow the video if you get it, and that should solve your problem.


[18-Aug-18 05:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I assume you are upgrading from 0.x.x version to 1.x.x ?


[18-Aug-18 05:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if that's the the case you have to follow the video help.


[18-Aug-18 05:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
no way around.


[18-Aug-18 05:58 AM] DanMercurius#7990
correct. the video says to reset coin db, however dropdown shows not 3 coins but all coins as undefined..


[18-Aug-18 05:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@DG and @SHossain can help you step by step.


[18-Aug-18 05:59 AM] DanMercurius#7990
if I have my seed, there should be nothing to worry about when resetting the coin db, correct?


[18-Aug-18 05:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
correct


[18-Aug-18 05:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
seed is the most import.


[18-Aug-18 05:59 AM] DanMercurius#7990
ok then I just go for it ^^


[18-Aug-18 06:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
make sure you follow the video help *exactly* as is. don't skip a step.


[18-Aug-18 06:02 AM] DanMercurius#7990
ha just realized; i started the client from a different location as the previous version... that could be the issue ^^

Hi


[30-Aug-18 11:07 PM] Maha#5777
I have one doubt regarding the BarterDEX exchange platform


[30-Aug-18 11:11 PM] Maha#5777
Who will be holding the  transaction fee in DEX platform ?


[30-Aug-18 11:12 PM] coingirl87#6489
Whats going on with barter dex? There is no volume since weeks...is the project dead?


[31-Aug-18 12:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @Maha The fees distributing to holders of the DEX asset chain tokens. An average fee is ~0.15%


[31-Aug-18 12:22 AM] TonyL#3577
@coingirl87 We are currently working on marketmaker 2.0 (MM2.0) which is planned for Q1 2019. There will be new features and it will be more user-friendly ( e.g. 100% ordermatch, regardless of utxo state)
 + Mobile DEX planning on approximately Q2 2019. So it's not dead and actively developing at the moment.


[31-Aug-18 12:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems people dont want to use the DEX other than for testing and now the testing is not active,the DEX is not so active


[31-Aug-18 12:25 AM] TonyL#3577
I think more userfriendly software, marketing promotions and some market makers providing liquidity can solve this issue


[31-Aug-18 08:22 AM] PTYX#6840
a user friendly interface is already available. it's hyperdex. the problem is that it's not easy to make sell orders on hyperdex unless there is a counter order in the orderbook already. So noone is using it


[31-Aug-18 08:23 AM] PTYX#6840
the traditional barterdex which allowed you to make a sell and keep it there until the connection died or someone picked it up is to hard to use.


[31-Aug-18 08:25 AM] PTYX#6840
when a user can login, make a sell or buy order, walk away, and come back when it's fulfilled then we will see increased users. until then, we will only see weekend warriors.


[31-Aug-18 10:03 AM] rainbro7#4735
There are no liquidity provider incentive programs? Can barterdex work with smartcontracts? For example, can people join a crypto picking competition (by donating som coins) and the winner be determined by a smart contract? Idk if its possible, just sounded like an interesting free marketing idea. I know there are other problems like liquidity, marketcap, etc... Just throwing things out there..


[31-Aug-18 10:05 AM] rainbro7#4735
It's sad that basic dexs are being used when this has more possibilities :(


[31-Aug-18 10:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
A liquidity provider reaps the spread


[31-Aug-18 07:52 PM] kremer#4440
i could not get hyperdex to work..seems to be more of the issue


[31-Aug-18 07:53 PM] DG#6934

I have bobs up with all combinations of kmd, ltc, bch, btc. Not a lot of UTXOs, but enough to trade for those that want to. I‚Äôll add larger UTXOs later this week for btc, probably in 0.1 and 0.5 sizes.

Liqudity is mostly low due to Alice‚Äôs not buying.


[01-Sep-18 04:01 PM] tolken#2655
More bobs are helpful but you can put all the offers you want out there. If no one wants to accept them, you can‚Äôt really force the issue short of wash trading.


[01-Sep-18 04:02 PM] PTYX#6840

i just tried chips and it stays open

so from what i gathered, hyperdex now let's you set an order and it won't stay open until cancelled?

[03-Sep-18 05:38 PM] jspook16#3059
is there a way to choose fill or kill on hyperdex....i know it was updated to leave the orders open but I also like the feature from before


[03-Sep-18 08:54 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont think we have that option in there. The liquidity is not great either so best to leave it open and hopefully it can fill at least some of it.


[03-Sep-18 08:56 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@DG I will get @luke to take a look


[03-Sep-18 08:56 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Luke can you take a look at what @PTYX posted above (unless that is what we were talking about yesterday) üòÉ

@DG have you been able to launch the new version on mac yet?


[04-Sep-18 07:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It just keeps loading forever here


[04-Sep-18 07:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
looking into this today


[04-Sep-18 07:09 AM] DG#6934
Yes it did but it had that issue that I showed but after launching again it worked , it could had something to do with my connection , will be testing it shortly again just getting back to the desk


[04-Sep-18 07:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
some one found something with that the other day I think may be related... there is a file marketmaker creates, called myipaddress or something, if that file is blank the network does not work properly. maybe something to check? @lukechilds


[04-Sep-18 07:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
would be good to ge that reported as a mm bug so it can get fixed upstream but we can definitely look into adding a workaround on our end and nuking the file if it's empty before mm starts


[04-Sep-18 07:25 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Deleted User do you have any more deets?


[04-Sep-18 07:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
I cant remember exactly dude... but someone wrote on some channel somwhere that he had conenction issues and found that removing that file and restarting fixed it


[04-Sep-18 07:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
on linux it creates that file where I start marketmaker for using cli


[04-Sep-18 07:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
I guess witout knowing what its ip is it cant bind the network or something..


[04-Sep-18 07:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Cryptoon do you still have that Mac that wont load orderbooks? Might be a good place to start.


[04-Sep-18 07:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
No it just stays on loading forever


[04-Sep-18 07:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
One minute will try again and make screengrab


[04-Sep-18 07:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
so you have new issue now ?

[04-Sep-18 07:56 AM] lukechilds#2707
if it gets stuck logging in can you open the network tab in dev tools and and see what's going on


[04-Sep-18 07:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
dev tools doesnt even open yet


[04-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Other network and firewall off still the same thing


[04-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What is the best way to remove everything?


[04-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Just delete the folder?


[04-Sep-18 07:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Going to try fresh reinstall if that helps


[04-Sep-18 08:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, from the menu bar there is an option to delete the app data folder


[04-Sep-18 08:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
that nukes everything


[04-Sep-18 08:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
including mm files


[04-Sep-18 08:01 AM] lukechilds#2707

That is the last one from 12.0.0.1

after that only coingecko stuff


[04-Sep-18 08:16 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So maybe it's the lack of glxt electrum servers that is blocking everything?


[04-Sep-18 08:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
it could be


[04-Sep-18 08:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
there was a bug in mm that meant non-existent electrum servers would hang mm for an insane amount of time


[04-Sep-18 08:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
but we reported it to James and it was fixed and we tested it


[04-Sep-18 08:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
so now it should just give an error after ~5 seconds and move on


[04-Sep-18 08:18 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah it just keeps hanging at the 'logging in' screen


[04-Sep-18 08:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And when I close that screen it just says could not connect to mm


[04-Sep-18 08:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
is this after a full reset?


[04-Sep-18 08:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Only app delete not deleted everything yet


[04-Sep-18 08:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
will proceed now


[04-Sep-18 08:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
After doing a delete app data, the app relaunches and now it launches


[04-Sep-18 08:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Well launches without getting stuck at loading


[04-Sep-18 08:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362

shutdown barter and restarted hyper, nothing there


[04-Sep-18 09:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Will keep it open for a while to see if it changes in time

gtg, if someone else has the same problem let me know, but it's probably marketmaker related


[04-Sep-18 10:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
You need to find where the hell that IP file is saved and remove it


[04-Sep-18 10:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
if you change networks, it will break the network connectivity of marketmaker


[04-Sep-18 10:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Is it different files for barter and hyper?


[04-Sep-18 10:49 AM] Cryptoon#3362
In car now will search later


[04-Sep-18 12:12 PM] DG#6934
@Deleted User  I think this is what you were referring to Figured it out. The "myipaddress" file in .Barterdex directory was empty for some reason. Put my ip in there manually, lanuched it and started giving all kinds of errors. I deleted the file and let bdex create it on the next launch and the ip was filled in and my orders are showing up now."


[04-Sep-18 12:13 PM] DG#6934
From here using MacOs 10.12.6 Sierra the newest version is launching without an issue for now


[04-Sep-18 01:25 PM] lukechilds#2707
To find the IP file open the app and click `Debug > Show App Data`. The folder that then pops up will contain a folder called `marketmaker`, open that folder. The IP file should be inside called `myipaddr`. That should work on all OSs


[04-Sep-18 01:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Delete that file?


[04-Sep-18 01:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
But I deleted all appdata earlier today


[04-Sep-18 01:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
So that one should also have been deleted?


[04-Sep-18 01:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah, was just putting that info out there


[04-Sep-18 01:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
if you deleted app data then you deleted the mm IP file too

barterdex and hyperdex share the same internals

[07-Sep-18 07:26 AM] lukechilds#2707

one also called BarterDEX


[07-Sep-18 07:26 AM] lukechilds#2707
and one called HyperDEX


[07-Sep-18 07:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
well, there may be more, but those are the two most popular I'm aware of


[07-Sep-18 07:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
so you have the BarterDEX GUI and the HyperDEX GUI which are both GUI frontends for the BarterDEX network

Hey guys, just realized a pretty cool marketing opportunity for HyperDEX/Komodo


[10-Sep-18 03:17 PM] Regnar#6164
Maybe we should try to be the first DEX to integrate the new Gemini Dollar? lol regardless of how I feel about usd pegged coins

Sure, it's ERC20 so should be trivial to implement


[11-Sep-18 02:45 AM] lukechilds#2707
Does anyone have a Gemini account that could send us a small amount of GUSD for testing?


[11-Sep-18 02:46 AM] lukechilds#2707
I can reimburse you in KMD


[11-Sep-18 03:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
Or alternatively like/RT this so we get some from Gemini

This should work fine as it's just an ERC20 token, but I haven't tested it. We need to get our hands on some GUSD first.
Also, we should wait for the icon in atomiclabs/cryptocurrency-icons...

Tried to send you some, but they won't let me have any yet ... "Gemini dollar is not yet available in your country or state of residence. We're working with regulators to get you started as soon as possible!"

That would be great if so


[13-Sep-18 07:36 AM] Jonathan#3687
it's already on their exchange, it's not tradeable but there is a "withdraw as GUSD" option - when I get some BTC I'll be able to test it üëç

or if you'd prefer once you get some I'll buy some off you and reimburse you in KMD

Can we use optional Jumblr in BarterDEX? Is it possible to use in HyperDEX, too?


[15-Sep-18 11:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You need native to use jumblr and hyper only works with lite mode for now so probably not.

Is it possible to use a hardware wallet for storing the funds within HyperDEX / BarterDEX or are they stored in a "wallet.dat" file or something? How and where are they stored exactly... Want to know üòÉ


[16-Sep-18 09:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Wallet.dat is only generated for native, so only for barterdex


[16-Sep-18 09:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Iirc hardware wallets use some sort of lite client?


[17-Sep-18 02:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
We encrypt your seed and store it on your machine, similar to how electrum does


[17-Sep-18 02:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
when you login and enter your password, your seed is decrypted


[17-Sep-18 02:07 AM] lukechilds#2707
so if someone gains access to your machine or your backups, your funds are safe, assuming you have a sufficiently strong password


[17-Sep-18 02:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
hardware wallet support isn't possible for us to add at the GUI level, but if it's first supported upstream in `marketmaker` it's something we could implement


[17-Sep-18 08:08 AM] nii236#2759
Are there any plans to migrate the codebase to TypeScript to avoid common JS gotchas? Might be worthwhile for an app that handles crypto-currencies.


[17-Sep-18 10:27 AM] lukechilds#2707
There are no plans right now, and a full re-write isn't really feasible currently. But we have already run into a few bugs that static typing would have probably prevented so I wouldn't say it's totally out of the question in the future.


[17-Sep-18 03:28 PM] jspook16#3059
As a side note. While hyperdex is running, if you grep the process, the key will be in the information returned. I'm just noting this so folks are aware


[17-Sep-18 06:33 PM] nii236#2759

>Just to be on the same page users could experience issues because of their resources , the minimum requirements are the same as Barterdex right?

Technically yeah but the minimum requirements should be pretty low. We do use Electron which can be a bit of a resource hog but I most of todays laptops should be able to handle it fine


[18-Sep-18 01:04 PM] lukechilds#2707
we don't have any official minimum requirements but if you can run Slack you can run HyperDEX

Congrats on the beta! Too bad about the Windows issues, hope you get it sorted soon


[18-Sep-18 07:11 PM] nii236#2759
Appending to some sort of error.log and having issue templates in GH might be a good idea


[18-Sep-18 07:15 PM] nii236#2759
I had similar problems in Electron, where just having the Windows environment there means that even tho Electron is cross-platform its never 0% bug free

Apologies to everyone experiencing issues on Windows, we've tracked down the error and will push a new release shortly


[19-Sep-18 02:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
For those interested in the reasoning, Windows seems to have a very low limit for the length of command arguments, we added a load of new currencies in this release which pushed the arguments we send to `marketmaker` over the edge, causing this error.

Heads up @grewalsatinder @jl777c, you will likely experience this issue on Windows too soon. We need a dynamic way to add currencies when `marketmaker` is already running to solve the issue.


[19-Sep-18 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
mm supports using a file for input, at least pretty sure it does, but it has been a long time ago


[19-Sep-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
ah, haven't seen any documentation on that


[19-Sep-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
that would likely get around the windows issue


[19-Sep-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
however is a bit cumbersome


[19-Sep-18 02:24 AM] jl777c#5810
windows is a lot cumbersome...


[19-Sep-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
yep


[19-Sep-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
but dynamic enable/disable would be a much nicer solution and bring many other benefits to all OSs


[19-Sep-18 02:24 AM] lukechilds#2707
will create an issue for mmv2


[19-Sep-18 02:24 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure barterDEX GUI used the file method


[19-Sep-18 02:26 AM] snowdamn#2414
FYI: also happened on linux, goes away by deleting HyperDEX folder in .config


[19-Sep-18 02:28 AM] snowdamn#2414
@lukechilds denoting because you only referred to Windows, scratch if same thing


[19-Sep-18 02:29 AM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think it's the same thing, should work fine on Linux, if it was the same issue deleting the HyperDEX folder wouldn't solve it. You likely experience a different (but similar) issue


[19-Sep-18 02:29 AM] snowdamn#2414
well, it was the same Unhandled exception during login


[19-Sep-18 02:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
with an `ENAMETOOLONG` error?


[19-Sep-18 02:30 AM] lukechilds#2707
do you have a screenshot?

no sorry, i quickly deleted folder

[19-Sep-18 02:31 AM] lukechilds#2707
I really don't think it's the same issue

@lukechilds @jl777c yea Barterdex GUI uses file method in windows and in all other os since coinsdb feature update


[19-Sep-18 02:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
That is why app restart required on adding removing coin in local coins.json file


[19-Sep-18 03:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Windows always used file method

So if I use the same seed across two computers, my wallets should have the same balance right? (They didn't, had to use the COQUI faucet again)

Just got hyperdex on my mac, but when I try to log in it displays the 'logging in' screen indefinitely. Anything I can do?


[19-Sep-18 08:43 AM] snowdamn#2414
@general_grievous what OS and do you have your seed saved?


[19-Sep-18 08:46 AM] snowdamn#2414
if you have seed, delete HyperDEX folder in .config (linux)/AppData (Windows)


[19-Sep-18 08:47 AM] snowdamn#2414
if you do not have seed, wait until it loads and/or new release


[19-Sep-18 08:52 AM] lukechilds#2707
We have also experienced very slow login times


[19-Sep-18 08:53 AM] lukechilds#2707
this is an issue with the way `marketmaker` handle's enabling ETOMIC for ETH/ERC20 trades


[19-Sep-18 08:54 AM] lukechilds#2707
a fix is in the works


[19-Sep-18 10:07 AM] general_grievous#6992
@snowdamn on osx, and I do have my seed. Will see if I can find that on the Mac version.


[19-Sep-18 10:08 AM] general_grievous#6992
@lukechilds thanks. I'll wait for the next release.


[19-Sep-18 10:08 AM] general_grievous#6992
Any estimates on when it will be production ready?


[19-Sep-18 10:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
There is a partial fix available for mm which should reduce the login time a bit


[19-Sep-18 10:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
we're adding it to our master branch


[19-Sep-18 10:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
and will release when it's stable


[19-Sep-18 10:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
maybe sometime next week


[19-Sep-18 10:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
or you can install the latest nightly if you don't wanna wait for an official release


[19-Sep-18 10:10 AM] general_grievous#6992
That makes sense.. I only want to mess around with the test assets anyway


[19-Sep-18 11:04 AM] lukechilds#2707
latest mm is in master and seems to make a huge difference in login time

you can try again later

we are planning on spinning some of our own servers up too


[20-Sep-18 03:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Regnar You mean you found a GUSD Bob to trade with too?\or you set your own Bob up?


[20-Sep-18 03:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
or you just created an order but there are no Bobs


[20-Sep-18 04:40 AM] Regnar#6164
I created an order to buy GUSD with KMD, there wasn't anyone already selling yet, but it shows as open, just doesn't indicate on the chart that my order is out there (says no data)


[20-Sep-18 04:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
ahh, yeah


[20-Sep-18 04:42 AM] lukechilds#2707
we need GUSD Bobs setup first


[20-Sep-18 04:46 AM] Regnar#6164
Ok so if there aren't GUSD sellers first, then buy requests dont show up?


[20-Sep-18 04:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
do your orders not show in the order book?


[20-Sep-18 04:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
they did before


[20-Sep-18 04:47 AM] lukechilds#2707
but mm seems unrealiable in how it shows the order book


[20-Sep-18 04:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
sometimes your own orders show, sometimes it only seems to be Bob orders


[20-Sep-18 04:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
but I'm pretty sure they should always display if the order is open


[20-Sep-18 04:48 AM] lukechilds#2707
that's more of a `marketmaker` question than HyperDEX


[20-Sep-18 04:49 AM] lukechilds#2707
maybe @jl777c or @artem.pikulin can elaborate


[20-Sep-18 04:49 AM] Regnar#6164
Ok thanks. Yes orders, at least this one, aren't showing in the book.


[20-Sep-18 05:17 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Regnar Hi, as Luke said due to `marketmaker` order might not show up. Could you please create an issue (https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET/issues/new) and provide more details:  What other coins do you have enabled? What order do you try to place?

If you successfully placed an order previously but it didn't show up it should be something with MM back-end. JS error should be different, but it's message is too generic to understand without Luke help.

Unique ID of your order generated by Marketmaker.

Like any other important entities orders should be uniquely identified to match each other, etc.

[21-Sep-18 09:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
@Regnar HyperDEx is just a GUI, we need the marketmaker devs to support new currencies, then we can enable them in HyperDEX


[21-Sep-18 09:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
For anyone having issues getting trades (@tolken) can you try installing this old build:
https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/releases/tag/v0.1.0-alpha.12


[21-Sep-18 09:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
It was before GTC support was added


[21-Sep-18 09:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
I have a feeling GTC orders in markemaker may be quite buggy and are causing some issues


[21-Sep-18 02:19 PM] tolken#2655
@lukechilds I‚Äôll try this build tonight. üòÉ thanks!

How to retrieve Private key from HyperDEX ?  ETH\ERC20 , which not present in agama ?


[21-Sep-18 11:34 PM] DG#6934
This is how it works with Barterdex not sure if Hyperdex has the same command. You can also use the same seed on Barterdex and try to retrieve them https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024470-how-to-retrieve-private-key-from-barterdex


[22-Sep-18 12:13 AM] Andersen#8337
Didn't work.  In output  is different ETH address


[22-Sep-18 12:00 PM] tolken#2655
@lukechilds  Tried older build 0.1.0 alpha 12. Tried kmd/btc and kmd/bch, no cigar so far. I‚Äôm running it via a VM instance of Mint Linux for what it‚Äôs worth. I‚Äôll try and get a non vm attempt going next. Just need to find another machine.


[22-Sep-18 01:50 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`0.1.0-alpha.12
...72 commits to master since this release`

@tolken Do you reckon there's a reason there's been 72 commits and 5 releases since the build you're commenting about?


[22-Sep-18 02:19 PM] tolken#2655
@ComputerGenie yes they are constantly working to make Hyperdex feature parity with the underlying marketmaker functionality. More recently in bdex development, jl777 added some fill or gtc, can‚Äôt remember which as added most recently. Anyway, hyperdex has to be adapted to use those new options. It‚Äôs anyone‚Äôs guess if that may have caused issues.


[22-Sep-18 02:54 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@tolken I'm not sure if gtc fits within the vision of HyperDEX or not, but my point was that an outdated version of any program not working is a moot point and I find it confusing why you would randomly try a specific known outdated code and then comment on it


[22-Sep-18 04:53 PM] tolken#2655
@ComputerGenie because the developer of Hyperdex requested (a few lines up) that I try the outdated code and provide feedback. Sometimes this is useful for debugging to know if an older version works for some people.


[22-Sep-18 05:26 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@tolken I apologize, I totally missed that ‚òπ


[22-Sep-18 08:10 PM] tolken#2655

@tolken will ask Luke to take a look tomorrow.


[23-Sep-18 05:13 AM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah, `0.1.0-alpha.12` was the last version before GTC was implemented, so wanted to see if people having issues getting matches stopped getting issues on versions without GTC


[23-Sep-18 05:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Well, I pretty much feel like an idiot for having said that without reading back and seeing the context


[24-Sep-18 05:31 PM] jspook16#3059

at the moment there are some major performance bottlenecks in mm that makes login very slow


[28-Sep-18 04:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
we are expecting mmv2 to resolve these issues


[28-Sep-18 04:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
so once that's releases and we update to mmv2 login should be much quicker


[28-Sep-18 04:21 AM] lukechilds#2707
however to answer your question, generally around 5 seconds with the default coins
That's on the latest release where we fixed a bug in mm that was causing 15s+ login times


[28-Sep-18 04:22 AM] lukechilds#2707
however if you enabled more coins it can increas the startup time by quite a bit

```

That disclaimer was more to cover our ass. Loss of funds is extremely unlikely, and as mentioned, we just use marketmaker under the hood, so if you're confident using real money with marketmaker via CLI or BarterDEX GUI then you should have just as much confidence (if not more, we fixed a lot of things) in HyperDEX.

However we did discover a very odd edge case a while ago in mm that resulted in a small loss of funds (fixed now). No code is perfect. I personally don't feel confident that marketmaker has been put under enough testing to guarantee 100% that there is no chance of loss of funds, hence the warning, but that's just me being cautious.

Remember that there is a non-negligable chance of loss of funds when using any centralised exchange.

@Deleted User how many bobs do we need though? Sure, relative to the gazillion coins bdex supports, there aren‚Äôt nearly enough bobs. However, we seem to have a good number of btc, bch, kmd bobs. I have ltc, btc, bch, kmd in every combination running and am disappointed to see very little activity. At the very least I would hope to see some moderate activity in those markets.

If you upgrades try rolling back to an old vesion, disable everything apart form KMD and CHIPS and then see if you can log in with a newer version

@jspook16  initial timeline for mm2 is Q1 2019. somebody from official team correct me if this has changed


[29-Sep-18 05:03 PM] lukechilds#2707
Regarding mmv2:

There are certain features we need to build a reliable UI that we don't have in mmv1. mmv2 is pretty much a direct rewrite of mmv1 in Rust with better support for concurrency, along with thread/memory safety and a few other things Rust gives us for free.

So it won't automatically fix all of our problems as soon as the first mmv2 version is released, although it should work much better than mmv1. It will likely still have some of the mmv1 warts due to it being a direct port. But it should mean we'll have a much more solid foundation to work with the mm dev team to get bugs fixed and new API methods and stuff added that we need that just aren't feasible with the current mmv1 codebase.

TL;DR mmv2 isn't a silver bullet that will automatically solve all our problems. But it is a required next step before we can go much further with HyperDEX development.

I've had the same Bob VPS running the entire time


[30-Sep-18 08:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
issue appears to be on Alices end


[30-Sep-18 08:54 PM] lukechilds#2707
the swap matches but Alice never sends dexfee


[30-Sep-18 08:55 PM] lukechilds#2707
only for etomic based swaps


[30-Sep-18 09:37 PM] tolken#2655
I believe that‚Äôs what I was seeing before, no Alice payment, but I‚Äôm not even getting matches lately.


[30-Sep-18 09:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
Thats an old issue, me and Alright were extremly vocal about it months and months ago, and it was never fixed... I think it has somehting to do with the FR nodes getting messed up and requiring a restart.


[30-Sep-18 09:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think you will find if you ran yor alice with canbind:1 it would not happen üòâ


[30-Sep-18 10:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think it's that, checking logs it appears I match correctly with another node, alice just never sends the tx


[30-Sep-18 10:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
even tried a trade where alice was KMD and bob was ERC20 and that killed mm


[30-Sep-18 10:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
so definitely seems to be some ERC20 related bug


[30-Sep-18 10:08 PM] Deleted User#0000
The swap never started is 99% due to the alic and bob not connecting.


[30-Sep-18 10:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
they match, but for som reason after that they refuse to connect and it times out


[30-Sep-18 10:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
I see


[30-Sep-18 10:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
I have logs


[30-Sep-18 10:09 PM] lukechilds#2707

There also obvs a huge amount of `ETH RPC response parse failed: (null)!` and `curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server` errors getting spammed


[30-Sep-18 10:14 PM] lukechilds#2707
so somerthing's definitely not right


[30-Sep-18 11:51 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@lukechilds could you please run `curl --data '{"method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}' -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST 195.201.0.6:8555` from your machine where you have a lot of network errors?


[01-Oct-18 01:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
@artem.pikulin 
```
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","result":"0x62264d","id":1}
```


[01-Oct-18 01:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
Btw, I tried tethering to my phone and I didn't get all those network errors


[01-Oct-18 01:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
so it could be possible that it was an issue with my connection


[01-Oct-18 01:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
however the bug still exists


[01-Oct-18 01:13 AM] lukechilds#2707

[01-Oct-18 04:02 AM] cipi#4502
i also had the problem of "SWAP never started" couple of times... bob then shows
```didnt get valid data after 120
error waitsend pubkeys```
the reason was always the same: i forgot to stop my JDownloader on alice before starting the swap
with a running download in the background on alice, 90% of the swap attempts failed


[01-Oct-18 06:03 AM] tolken#2655
For what it‚Äôs worth, I just successfully did a kmd buy using eth, using cli.


[01-Oct-18 06:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
Which mm version?


[01-Oct-18 06:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
And probably unrelated but are you using Electrum or native for kmd


[01-Oct-18 08:33 AM] tolken#2655
1.0.717, possibly 1.0707. I can double check if you need to know precise version - I‚Äôm going by when I downloaded it relatively to release. Using native kmd.


[01-Oct-18 08:35 AM] tolken#2655
I have some test eth bob online if you need to test.


[01-Oct-18 09:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah if you could let me know the precise version that would be great


[01-Oct-18 09:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
mm should dump it in the terminal on startup


[01-Oct-18 09:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
than I can test that version on my end and see if it works


[01-Oct-18 09:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
also, if you wouldn't mind downloading the mm binaries we bundle with HyperDEX and use them via the CLI seeing if it still works for you that would be incredibly helpful

Hi

[01-Oct-18 07:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
If so then definitely ElectrumX. They both support the electrum protocol but `electrum-server` is outdated and unmentioned, ElectrumX is the official replacement.


[01-Oct-18 07:09 PM] qmc#4355
Wasn't sure the protocol was backward compatible, thanks @lukechilds

@lukechilds confirmed mm 1.0.717 via terminal output. I‚Äôll see if I can test another trade in the morning with the hdex mm.


[02-Oct-18 05:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
@tolken Thanks, I just checked on 1.0.717 and I'm still getting the same issue ü§î


[02-Oct-18 05:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
Also, do you experience the issue when you use HyperDEX?


[02-Oct-18 07:33 AM] tolken#2655
@lukechilds   Successful bdex cli swap using 1.0.707 mm from the link you provided.


[02-Oct-18 07:35 AM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm a bit of a late starter using hyperdex, just tried it for first time a week ago. Really like the interface. I tried it through a vm (parallels on a Mac) using Mint Linux and it didn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôll try again on another computer config soon.


[02-Oct-18 07:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
Buying KMD with an ERC20 worked?


[02-Oct-18 07:35 AM] lukechilds#2707
normal coins are working for me


[02-Oct-18 07:36 AM] lukechilds#2707
it's specifically ERC20 that's the issue


[02-Oct-18 07:36 AM] tolken#2655
Buying kmd, yes.


[02-Oct-18 07:36 AM] tolken#2655
But it‚Äôs a kmd/eth swap.  You can do that fine?


[02-Oct-18 07:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
I actually only tried ERC20, I will try ETH


[02-Oct-18 07:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
pretty late here


[02-Oct-18 07:37 AM] tolken#2655
There are no eth bobs. I‚Äôm the only eth bob now afaik.


[02-Oct-18 07:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
will test in the morning


[02-Oct-18 07:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
yeah, I can spin one up


[02-Oct-18 07:37 AM] lukechilds#2707
thanks for your help


[02-Oct-18 07:37 AM] lukechilds#2707

[02-Oct-18 07:38 AM] tolken#2655
Np, thanks for all your help and explanations in the past. Least I can do üòÉ


[02-Oct-18 07:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
btw, re HyperDEX not working in a VM, there are known issues with mm and flaky networking


[02-Oct-18 07:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
and you can only have one mm instance per public IP


[02-Oct-18 07:38 AM] lukechilds#2707
so could possibly be some to do with that


[02-Oct-18 07:39 AM] tolken#2655
Reverting back to my old setup and putting my eth bob baxk online. I‚Äôll get some erc20 online next and test that.


[02-Oct-18 07:39 AM] lukechilds#2707
Legend üëå


[02-Oct-18 07:39 AM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôm isolating mm to unique ip


[02-Oct-18 07:40 AM] tolken#2655
even routed hyperdex through a different network. I think it‚Äôs a clash with the vm config


[02-Oct-18 07:41 AM] tolken#2655
Has many flavors of piggybacking on the host network.


[02-Oct-18 07:41 AM] lukechilds#2707
Yeah, possibly, re Mint, we only officially test HyperDEX on Ubuntu cos manually testing loads of distros would be a nightmare, but it should work on Mint. If you submit an issue on GitHub with details on the issues you had on Mint we'll look into it.


[02-Oct-18 07:41 AM] tolken#2655
Not in love with mint, I‚Äôll probably just move to Ubuntu next to eliminate more variables.

@jl777c we have a HyperDEX user with funds stuck for over 12 hours, kickstarting doesn't seem to help and mm will not reclaim the funds.

You can view the log from HyperDEX here: https://pastebin.com/xJAbqCVC

You can see mm sent `alicepayment` but the swap never progressed from that. The funds are currently in this address: https://kmdexplorer.io/address/bD7WSJat5QmzpKtpmdF5AMi2UKAGUXAmSE

I believe this issue happened to me before and you talked me through how to manually find the temp keys in the mm DB and created a redeem TX. Are you able to this with our user or cc someone else who can do this

Very rare if not edge cases that can be patched. I've done 10k swaps on cli and got every Satoshi back


[02-Oct-18 06:46 PM] lukechilds#2707
you would be better off asking in the #dev-tradebots channel as that is more of a marketmaker question than a HyperDEX question, but the issue aren't too regular. But they are often enough for us not remove the beta tag from HyperDEX

Just use a proper release of merketmaker and make sure your internet doesn't go down during swap and it usually fine. I had one instance a long time ago where I lost about $500 that was never able to be recovered. Dont think I have seen that particilar thing happen to any person ever apart from me... it wsa 99.9999% likley something I did, and stupid of me to be transfering that much $$$ at once on the wrong version of marketmaker üòÇ


[02-Oct-18 09:37 PM] tolken#2655
@lukechilds it likely isn‚Äôt lost. It‚Äôs BTC.


[02-Oct-18 09:37 PM] tolken#2655
I‚Äôve had it take days to come back.


[02-Oct-18 09:38 PM] tolken#2655
12h isn‚Äôt a guarantee or a maximum time.


[02-Oct-18 09:38 PM] tolken#2655
Btw, that trade was with my bob. Had a glitch that took my mm down briefly, no fault of mm.


[02-Oct-18 09:41 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont have time to troubleshoot it. it sounds like a reclaim is needed, which would happen after bob side does his reclaiming. BTC txfees went steeply up the other day and is the likely cause. with BTC the timeouts are set long, so as long as bob is still running his node, you can reclaim a bit faster. if he isnt then it invokes a different claim, but for that you need to wait a bit longer. you do get 12.5% more though


[02-Oct-18 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
cipi would know best how to recover


[02-Oct-18 09:46 PM] tolken#2655
@cipi any way I can speed up the reclaim? My bob has been active all day, was only down for a minute or so after it went down as the swap started.


[02-Oct-18 09:47 PM] tolken#2655
Marketmaker marked the job as finished.

[02-Oct-18 09:52 PM] cipi#4502
@Nabob | $ARRR sent that to me and i had a look... bobdeposit and alicepayment were done, both are unspent though... next would have been bob doing bobpayment, but that one is missing... if you call swapstatus for that swap it should be "rewinded" (alice gets back alicepayment and bob bobdeposit)


[02-Oct-18 09:53 PM] cipi#4502
yes, like this `curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"swapstatus\",\"requestid\":3076945675,\"quoteid\":1167555031}"`


[02-Oct-18 09:54 PM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
üëÜ  That issue is with other user @strugglebus


[02-Oct-18 09:55 PM] cipi#4502
could be strugglebus was alice and tolken was bob in this failed swap?


[02-Oct-18 09:56 PM] tolken#2655
Yes, my bob died right at start


[02-Oct-18 09:57 PM] tolken#2655

Thanks @cipi  for a quick look


[02-Oct-18 11:15 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@lukechilds @strugglebus Hi, in case of stuck swaps it's required to provide MM logs and swap data from `DB/SWAPS` directory. In this particular case I need to know bob deposit tx id to retrieve Bob PrivN (in case bob refunded the deposit). Please provide this info in PM and I'll be able to help.


[02-Oct-18 11:18 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@lukechilds Could you please point @strugglebus how he's able to find logs and SWAPS data?


[03-Oct-18 12:07 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
@artem.pikulin  Seems issue resolved, bob node stopped suddenly, after he started and initiated `swapstatus` call. then, everything goes fine
struglebus is alice
tolken is bob


[03-Oct-18 12:10 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Nabob | $ARRR https://kmdexplorer.io/address/bD7WSJat5QmzpKtpmdF5AMi2UKAGUXAmSE - the address reported as APayment and KMD is still there, need to send it back to struglebus.


[03-Oct-18 12:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i think strugglebus just needs to do a swapstatus


[03-Oct-18 03:06 AM] lukechilds#2707
Opening HyperDEX will do that automatically


[03-Oct-18 03:09 AM] lukechilds#2707
But if SWAPS data is still needed then you can get that by clicking `Debug > Show App Data` in HyperDEX
Then inside the directory that pops up navigate to: `marketmaker/DB/SWAPS`


[03-Oct-18 03:50 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@strugglebus Please follow steps Luke posted above, if HyperDEX restart doesn't help please send the swap data to me in PM.

@trade27 hyperdex is another trading software built on same barterdex network, same API calls, different gui and features.  barterdex is the "reference" of anything that is possible on the dex network.   hyperdex is a polished version of the functions for trading.


[04-Oct-18 07:58 AM] d_lzz#0109
The latest HyperDEX doesn't work on my Debian Stretch.  There is only the screen that asks if I want to add HyperDEX to  the menu. After that it just "hangs", nada. The terminal doesn't give any errors. The previous version also didn't work. The versions before that did start correctly. I have to add that I'm testing it inside Whonix, although I doubt it has anything to do with it.

Seeing this in hyperDex 0.1.3 although I seem to be able to continue. Since that error came up I‚Äôm 3/5 through swap steps buying bch with kmd.  Confirmed Alice payment, waiting quite some time for my fee. Not sure if it‚Äôs still going or not.

[06-Oct-18 08:20 PM] lukechilds#2707
can you submit an issue, we'll look into it


[06-Oct-18 08:21 PM] lukechilds#2707
just FYI for everyone  here, I'm focussing mainly on claiming KMD interest on the Ledger for the time being


[06-Oct-18 08:21 PM] lukechilds#2707
I'm still working on HyperDEX


[06-Oct-18 08:22 PM] lukechilds#2707
but Ledger interest is my priority at the moment


[06-Oct-18 08:22 PM] lukechilds#2707
@sindresorhus is probably a better point of contact for HyperDEX related issues for the time being


[06-Oct-18 08:56 PM] tolken#2655
Sure, I‚Äôll get it submitted. Great to hear on KMD interest üòâ

GUSD integration is complete


[08-Oct-18 05:57 AM] lukechilds#2707
basically no liquidity until people get their hands on some GUSD and want to market make it

$GUSD integration into @HyperDEXApp is complete. Just Ààtrustlessly bought $KMD with $GUSD via the power of atomic swaps. No KYC required. Permissionless systems for the win!

This is pretty cool, it means Gemini basically act as our unofficial (and probably unhappy) KYC partner, to allow people to cash in/out with fiat. It also means people can get hold of GUSD through HyperDEX without KYC.

Hello Komodo team,

i have a big problem with HyperDEX and
i will try it to cleare the problem in english:


at the 05.10.2018 i make a trade 73,21479399 KMD for 2.000,00293161 CHIPS
because the system dont has this complete amount, it exchange 21,69328229 KMD for 694,7906861 CHIPS   
the transaction was stop with the ErrorCode: -1007.

to this point ia already ok. 
And now comes the problem:

The 21,69328229 KMD has gone out from my wallet. 
But it`s kame no CHIPS back, no KMD back.
Also after 3 days kame no KMD or Chips back.

What can i do. This bug  is not a litle 

now i go to bed and will tomorrow look in discord.
üò©


[08-Oct-18 02:53 PM] gsnew#5366
how can i insert pictures to the chat. I have pictures form the agama wallet ( CHIPS and KMD ) , you see the out and incoming in this timeframe. 
i have a picture from the HyperDEX history in this timeframe.
And i have a picture form HyperDEX, in this you see the canceled transaction.

You can see the graphic volume inside the trade tab in Hyperdex , not sure we have them listed outside of the program

[09-Oct-18 05:53 PM] DG#6934
Just in case the swap is still stuck or pending you can use this guide https://support.komodoplatform.com/solution/articles/29000024479-my-swap-is-stuck-what-to-do-now- For now you can still wait for about 3 more hours and see if the funds get back to your address before using this guide. @350


[09-Oct-18 07:59 PM] 350#7618
so your saying it is normal, and happens often I suppose. Good to know.

@350 yes it happens often with all true dexes at this moment. They depend on connections and it has many moving parts

does this work with agama wallet ?


[11-Oct-18 07:41 AM] DG#6934
Hyperdex is built on top of marketmaker, in relation to this Barterdex is open source so you could technically built a new GUI if you wished to


[12-Oct-18 01:21 PM] Jcharming#2693
I'm curious how the HyperDex/BarterDex project is coming along.  Recently I was commenting on it in a reddit thread basically praising KMD and it's team for their work on this DEX system and someone asked 'What's the latest, when can I use it?  Vaporware?"  so I figured it was time to come back and get an update myself.  
I participated in the soft launch a couple months ago and I see recently there is GUSD integration.  
Is there someone that would be willing to just give me an update as to where it is, and what it's next time line is looking like?   Please and thank you for anyone that does.


[12-Oct-18 01:29 PM] tolken#2655
HyperDex devs have voiced concern over less than optimal order matching and have been trying to fully assess where the problem may be. There‚Äôs been some question about the success rate of order matching lately, so that‚Äôs an outstanding question if it‚Äôs working optimally with respect to the current version of marketmaker, which is the underlying engine behind BarterDex.


[12-Oct-18 01:34 PM] tolken#2655
Markermaker2.0 is apparently in the works, which seeks to improve the order match success rate (amongst other things)  It‚Äôll be completely rewritten in RUST, made more optimal/extendable for more devs to jump on onboard. They‚Äôre aiming to get a beta out Q1 2019 afaik. Don‚Äôt know how far along they are.


[12-Oct-18 01:48 PM] Jcharming#2693
Thanks for a quick update @tolken   I really appreciate it, so atm is it fair to say that Hyper/BarterDex's are not functional until MM2.0 gets finished?


[12-Oct-18 02:03 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

mm2.0 should fix the core and also help improving the ux


[12-Oct-18 02:10 PM] Jcharming#2693
So atm would you recommend people that are looking for a real dex to look into and learn how to use BarterDex or to wait out for hyperdex functionality with MM2?


[12-Oct-18 02:14 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
depends on their skill level,  for average users it's probably hard to use, even if tolken is providing volume for the main pairs. Skilled users can even use command line or learn to become marketmakers in anticipation of 2.0


[12-Oct-18 02:15 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
it was to be expected for the first iteration, in time it will get better


[12-Oct-18 02:16 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I've read Chainzilla is working on a dashboard to help do marketmakers, the more there are and the easier it will be trading


[12-Oct-18 02:18 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
so if the question is if this can be widely adopted right now, I'd say it's not for the masses (yet) but it's a matter of time


[12-Oct-18 02:21 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
like @KomodoWorld said for those people who are willing to learn, it can be used now already


[12-Oct-18 02:21 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
granted that there is enough liquidity for things they want to trade


[12-Oct-18 02:22 PM] KomodoWorld#8282

@javadth  Yes, can be used as a wallet. Can trade when you‚Äôre online, not when offline. Same limitations as regular wallet.


[14-Oct-18 06:06 PM] DG#6934
The wallet part of the functionality it's similar to Agama , it lets you access a specific address because you have the seed ...but your funds are in the blockchain not in the software The seed that you use gives you access to this specific address the same way as if you had the private keys for an specific address in the blockchain.


[14-Oct-18 07:32 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Eventually, we would want to build all the agama functionality into HyperDEX so it is a one stop shop.

@lukechilds is it possible to have marketmaker launch anyway even if one of the electrum servers isnt working? Because now it just keeps loading because of the vrsc electrum. I think most people dont look at dev console, so they wont know whats causing hyperdex to load forever


[15-Oct-18 02:23 PM] 0x03#8822

```
@lukechilds#2707 is it possible to have marketmaker launch anyway even if one of the electrum servers isnt working? Because now it just keeps loading because of the vrsc electrum. I think most people dont look at dev console, so they wont know whats causing hyperdex to load forever
```

@Cryptoon it should do that already, there is something like a 5s timeout. If the electrum server doesn't respond in that time `marketmaker` should ignore it and move on. If mm is hanging on an electrum server then it sounds like there's a bug in mm. Unfortunately we can't tell it to stop from our end, we can't communicate with it until it's finished.

If you can reproduce the issue are you able to report it to mm devs?


[16-Oct-18 04:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@lukechilds electrum servers are fixed, so now I dont have that issue anymore


[16-Oct-18 04:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But before I could just keep repeating the issue where I restarted hyper and it kept loading on that electrum server for vrsc that wasnt working. If I wanted to close hyper it said 'could not connect to marketmaker'


[16-Oct-18 05:00 AM] lukechilds#2707
ohhh, I see


[16-Oct-18 05:00 AM] lukechilds#2707
so most likely this is actually an issue with Electrum


[16-Oct-18 05:03 AM] lukechilds#2707
If @0x03 was resyncing then the actual coin daemon on his node would (I think?) be locked. So we probably did successfully connect to the electrum server, but there was an issue with Electrum <-> coin daemon communication on the actual server that was hanging.


[16-Oct-18 05:04 AM] lukechilds#2707
I don't think Electrum servers should be resyncing regularly, so this likely isn't a huge problem. But if people running electrum servers bring down electrum while they're resyncing coin daemons that would likely solve the issue


[16-Oct-18 05:05 AM] lukechilds#2707
// cc @0x03 @cipi üòÉ


[16-Oct-18 05:34 AM] 0x03#8822
oh, it is down during the resync of the chain (i.e. the outside/p2p port is not bound to by electrumx)


[16-Oct-18 09:32 AM] cipi#4502
the problem isn't there on CLI, when i enable electrums and they are unreachable, it simply takes longer, but mm is showing an error and continues with the other electrums


[16-Oct-18 10:59 PM] lukechilds#2707
that's odd


[16-Oct-18 10:59 PM] lukechilds#2707
it's possible that we have an outdated version of mm, but I don't that that's it, I'm not aware of any recent changes to the way electrum timeout is handled


[16-Oct-18 11:07 PM] cipi#4502
i also observed two different situations
1. the method "electrum" returns with an error saying the server is unreachable, so does the console output
2. the method "electrum" says everything is fine, but console says node is dead
on CLI this does not seem to make any difference, but i can imagine GUIs are relying on the info that mm returns (not the output in console)
i don't know where the difference between this 2 fails is... could be the difference is that one tcp connection returns "Connection refused" immediately and the other case is where Firewalls do their part and the connection attempt doesn't return anything, it is simply stuck... that may also cause the large delays when starting mm... it makes a difference if a connection attempt is refused immediately or if mm waits for the OS timeout... could be a good idea to try to cover this in the code by playing with the timeout-options, but i fear i don't have the knowledge to be able to tell this for sure


[16-Oct-18 11:11 PM] lukechilds#2707
The GUI works fine with either an error or success response


[16-Oct-18 11:11 PM] lukechilds#2707
if we get a success response but it actually errors that could definitely cause issues


[16-Oct-18 11:11 PM] lukechilds#2707
but it wouldn't just hang, it would move on to the next electrum server


[16-Oct-18 11:12 PM] lukechilds#2707
thanks for your help @cipi


[16-Oct-18 11:16 PM] cipi#4502
yes, you are right, it shouldn't hang forever... but i didn't experienced this with CLI, only that it takes much longer if i have bad electrums in my config

it changed recently, so i simply suppose you have the old config... but without knowing the electrum server you are trying to connect to, i can't tell, you would have to check

[28-Oct-18 01:04 PM] DG#6934
@vogelfreund  I don't see an issue from this side but still ...if you want to make a fresh launch of Hyperdex I will recommend first making sure that you have your seed written down and verify that you don't have any stuck or pending swaps. If you meet these requirements you can go ahead and erase the Hyperdex folder located in  %appdata% /Roaming/ path if usin Windows. After erasing this folder try launching the application again  from the latest version and see if that solves the issue.

@jl777c  will CC dex fees also support DEX asset or new asset will be realeased ?


[29-Oct-18 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
CC dex is totally separate, each action requires a txfee


[29-Oct-18 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not cross chain

Here is how you enable your coins in Hyperdex @peritonlogon https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024473-how-to-enable-coins-tokens-assets-to-be-available-for-trading


[05-Nov-18 03:52 PM] peritonlogon#7708
Thanks! but that's not what I was asking.  Barterdex hads a portfolio management option where you could set goals for your portfolio and a % above or below coinmarketcap, that would automatically put in orders  at that amount.  Does Hyperdex have something functioning , or in the works like that?


[05-Nov-18 04:01 PM] Jonathan#3687
It doesn't currently @peritonlogon but I like the idea. Will create an enhancement request for it

barterdex is a bit more esoteric and technical. hyperdex is sleeker and simpler

they both work, there is just a dearth of activity at the moment.

Yea that's the tough thing about P2P exchanges, if a person logs off, they take their liquidity with them. It would be cool to integrate the Oracles CC trollbox into HyperDEX. anytime you can keep users with HyperDEX open, the greater chance to have orders left open to provide liquidity, and also to find trading partners and ask about some of the coins on the DEX someone may not know about.

@Quijote claiming not exclusive to Agama, but there is a bug in Ledger that prevents it. There‚Äôs a workaround in the works by lukechilds that will allow us to use Ledger to claim reward. He‚Äôs actively working on it now, but I‚Äôm unclear when it will be ready.

@cantptalblonit are you still experiencing the issue? It's most likey once of your currencies Electrum server that's gone down, HyperDEX can't really "go down" as it's all local. However it should move on to the next server if one isn't responding.

@sindresorhus are you able to look into this?


[28-Nov-18 12:46 AM] sindresorhus#8187
@cantptalblonit Can you open HyperDEX, go to the Help menu, click "Debug mode". HyperDEX will restart. Then go to the "Debug" menu and click "Show Settings" and then copy-paste the contents and send it to me as a private message. Then try to replace the `enabledCurrencies` entry with `"enabledCoins": ["KMD", "CHIPS"],`, save, restart HyperDEX and then try logging in again.

Does anyone ever use HyperDex. I recently discovered this and wanted to try it out. I posted a transaction to convert some BEER to PIZZA and waited for several hours and did this on several different occasions, but no takers. Also when I check for offers under popular pairs like BTC/ETH or BTC/LTC, etc. I never see any pending offers. Is anyone using this yet?


[30-Nov-18 05:14 PM] actionslacks#4072
there is not a lot of participants right now. There‚Äôs an updated back end being built right now to add capability and grow usage. You can check the progress in #dev-marketmaker


[30-Nov-18 07:52 PM] tolken#2655

@tolken >what do you mean by pending offers?
I mean that when I go under "Exchange" and select BTC on the left and ETH on the right, I don't see any orders in the "Open Orders" area; even if I click on the BTC/ETH tab. Doesn't matter which pairs I select I never see any open orders. If I submit an order to exchange BEER/PIZZA I see it in the open orders area. But even after leaving it sit for hours, it does not get filled. Could it be that I'm not actually connected to the Dex?


[01-Dec-18 04:55 AM] osyed#0739
When I start HyperDex I do see a message saying "Could not connect to DNR Electrum server", but then the HyperDex UI still opens and appears usable.

[01-Dec-18 07:58 AM] tolken#2655
@osyed there aren‚Äôt a lot of trades on bdex. But there certainly are orders waiting to be filled - so this appears to be a problem specific to your end. I wouldn‚Äôt think the electrum would affect your view of the orderbooks as I don‚Äôt think electrum plays any role in them, but it is perhaps a sign of a network configuration/firewall issue?

[01-Dec-18 08:35 AM] osyed#0739
@tolken I installed Hyperdex on another computer. Now under "Exchange" CHIPS/KMD I see some buy and sell orders listed. I don't see them on the first computer. So it seems like a network issue on the first computer. Both computer are behind the same home NAT and both are Windows. I'm using version 0.2.1 of Hyperdex.

[01-Dec-18 09:38 AM] osyed#0739
I didn't try restarting the router, but after leaving the first computer on the CHIPS/KMD page for awhile I see a few buy and sell orders. Although the second computer shows more orders listed.


[01-Dec-18 09:40 AM] osyed#0739
I had another issue though. When I added and deleted another coin, my BEER entry disappeared from my portfolio. This happened on both computers.

@Nabob | $ARRR > dnr electrums are removed from our coins database, because of their outdated servers
It would be good to also remove DNR from the default coin list, so that the "Could not connecto to DNR Electrum server" does not cause confusion for beginners.


[01-Dec-18 07:26 PM] osyed#0739
@tolken > Have you tried restarting your router?
Just tried it. It made no difference. On the first computer, when I go to the Exchange CHIPS/KMD page I don't see any open orders, but after about 10 minutes I see a few orders. On the second computer, I see the orders right away and more orders are listed there.

[02-Dec-18 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
then also you dont close trades when closing the app.

Hi @everyone I am learning about hyperdex, which it is cool.
But I want to know how it works with orderbook.
I am  going to swap between `ZIL` and `ETH`.
When I clicked `Buy ETH` with some `ZIL`, it appeared in `OpenOrders` list.
But I could not see anything in `ETH Buy Orders` or `ETH Sell Orders`. It seems the orderbook does not work.
Could you anyone let me know how you manage orderbook?


[03-Dec-18 06:03 AM] cipi#4502
ZIL/ETH orderbook is likely emtpy... try ZIL/KMD


[03-Dec-18 06:04 AM] kmdstudent#8905
Who will orderbook then? I cant myself?


[03-Dec-18 06:05 AM] cipi#4502
every node in the network can make orderbook-entries... don't know how GUI is handling this, i do it with CLI


[03-Dec-18 06:06 AM] kmdstudent#8905
With CLI, you call `setprice` to add an order to orderbook?


[03-Dec-18 06:07 AM] cipi#4502
autoprice, setprice won't last for long

As I looked hyperdex code, I could not find calls of autoprice or setprice.


[03-Dec-18 06:09 AM] kmdstudent#8905
And I could not find from debug as well.


[03-Dec-18 06:10 AM] cipi#4502
then it is not implemented in HyperDEX GUI


[03-Dec-18 06:17 AM] SHossain#0007
HyperDEX GUI is primarily for Alice. Bob functions are not in the GUI


[03-Dec-18 06:17 AM] kmdstudent#8905
Do you have a plan to have Bob's function?


[03-Dec-18 11:29 AM] The Big Wan#6408
Hey, is there a place where I can view the volume of trades going through the DEX?


[03-Dec-18 12:05 PM] Acura#2748

Wouldn't say that, try running Hyperdex by itself......some scenarios can be iffy sometimes, like which one is open first. I get the same issue sometimes but it isn't consistent

How does BarterDEX autosplit funds to match available orders without having to create a new transaction?


[15-Dec-18 02:32 PM] crypto999#4866
As the¬†BarterDEX¬†GUI evolves, the handling of¬†UTXO‚Äôs will ultimately be handled seamlessly in the background using automated trade-bots. We already have implemented a process that automatically splits the user balance as necessary, to match the exact value of available orders. Note that these particular trading bots are performing the atomic swaps on your behalf! These are not average tradebots as seen on centralized exchanges, they trade through atomic swaps. Even though this approach more complex than a generic centralized exchange, ultimately it puts more power back into the hands of the users.


[15-Dec-18 02:39 PM] crypto999#4866
Also, i see on the BarterDEX images a Send button. Is that the equivalent then of the usual exchange withdrawal?


[15-Dec-18 06:04 PM] DG#6934
By sending you are taking the funds out of the Barterdex Smart address


[17-Dec-18 01:55 PM] crypto999#4866
Can anyone answer the question above. It says about automatically splitting UTXOs - how is that achieved without sending a new transaction and as such incurring transaction fees. Or do they mean splitting? Say I have one BTC UTXO - can the system automatically break that down to the amount I want to buy, the deposit, and the fee? Or does it need splitting up - in which case does there need to be multiple transactions to create useful sized UTXOs?


[17-Dec-18 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
splitting the utxo incurs txfees


[17-Dec-18 03:21 PM] crypto999#4866
OK. Thanks. For the order book, can you explain how that works? Indeed, and what incentive is there to be a full node broadcasting orders?


[17-Dec-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
nodes broadcast orders to all nodes


[17-Dec-18 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
each node uses that data to construct what its view of the orderbook is


[17-Dec-18 03:29 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no financial incentive to run a full node

Hello, I tried to use Hyperdex. Sometimes not very clear interface. If you want more people to use it, you have to simplify it.


[22-Dec-18 12:02 PM] SadykovT#2123
Tried to start on two different computers, on windows 7 x64, does not work, there is an error. Works fine on windows 10.


[22-Dec-18 03:09 PM] SadykovT#2123
I spent 3 hours, installed windows 10 on the second computer. put hyperdex. I made money on both wallets and nothing happened.


[22-Dec-18 03:14 PM] SadykovT#2123
withdrawal is also not working. writes "successfully" but nothing happens

@SadykovT thanks for your feedback.

I'm aware of the withdrawal issue, it appears to be either a mm or possibly Electrum issue. Other users have reported the same issue using the mm daemon directly. To be clear, HyperDEX is just a GUI layer on top of mm. If mm responds responds saying the withdrawal was successful then the GUI (HyperDEX) will display a notification saying the withdrawal is successful, that is functioning as expected.

We are aware of performance issues with mm and have been reporting them since we started developing HyperDEX. mm and HyperDEX are developed by two separate development teams. We have reported perf issues to the mm team and they are working on mmv2 which will hopefully address these issues.

Regarding the interface not being clear, are you referring to the actual visual design or the way it works? Any feedback you've got here or issues you encounter would definitely be appreciated. Feel free to discuss them in here. However if you have specific issue/suggestion/bug it may be best to create a GitHub issue with the "Feedback" button in the app so we can track it make sure we get the issue resolved.


[23-Dec-18 10:51 PM] tolken#2655
I like the design and think it‚Äôs fairly straight forward. It‚Äôs just the underlying mm not performing without a hitch throws off the experience. If trades matched reliably, i doubt there‚Äôd be any confusion over the HyperDex interface. As a new user, without a trade gong though successfully, it‚Äôs not surprising to start questioning if the GUI is responsible.

@lukechilds  keep this progress going its just amazing only what im waiting is MM v2 do you have some indicators when that could be when this do trades to be responding quicker then its final party

@lukechilds all assetchains with activated sapling need "txversion=4" in the coins file, else withdraws and swaps will not work
@artem.pikulin#0794  should i add txversion=4 to all assetchains with activated sapling, or is there a plan to manage this directly in mm?


[25-Dec-18 06:35 AM] cipi#4502
@artem.pikulin


[25-Dec-18 07:31 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@cipi Depending on version explicit txversion in config might be not required. The latest release in my repo has hardcoded Sapling activation for KMD and assetchains which was added by jl777.

[25-Dec-18 08:03 AM] cipi#4502

[25-Dec-18 09:46 PM] crypto999#4866
Can someone explain why the bobdeposit step is necessary? It says in the literature that this is to promote Bob moving forward with the trade, but my understanding was the transaction activity was done automatically once both parties had committed to the trade? Is that not the case? Do individuals have to confirm each of the steps manually? It seems to add an extra layer of complexity as well as risk to the Bob side...


[25-Dec-18 10:21 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@crypto999 Hi, swap protocol design discussions took place at 2015-2016: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1340621.msg13828271#msg13828271, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1364951 when there were just few coins with BIP65 (CLTV) support. The purpose was to allow one side of swap to send standard 2of2 multisig output so at least  Alice can swap the coin without CLTV.
Nowadays most coins have CLTV opcode support so swap protocol will be simplified in MM2, both payments will be hash/time locked outputs, Bob won't need 212% balance to trade anymore.

Ah, fantastic. Think that wo uld make things much more user friendly. Can I ask too about the SpeedMode/Zeroconf? It sounds like this could be expanded to allow instant non-swap transfers for a range of coins - effectively a multi-coin Lightning Network as it seems to work in a similar way with the providing of collateral on a payment channel...


[26-Dec-18 02:29 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@crypto999 We don't have plans about Zeroconf expansion/improvement yet. On current development stage MM2 doesn't even support it. We will think about possible improvements when we start porting the Zeroconf to MM2.

Hello


[27-Dec-18 04:08 AM] stock999#4818
How does work Hyperdex?  I have installed it, but what is the next?  I need a step by step instruction as for dummies. Please help.


[27-Dec-18 10:09 AM] jspook16#3059
Have you launched it? @stock999


[27-Dec-18 11:40 AM] DG#6934
I have seem similar issues in Mac OSx ...it doesn't launch in some occasions


[27-Dec-18 04:11 PM] stock999#4818
@jspook16  Yes, i launched it. But order book is empty for almost all pairs. There are just a few of orders


[27-Dec-18 04:15 PM] stock999#4818
I don't understand what it does mean : 'This swap is worth $.... '. Is it a fee?


[27-Dec-18 04:19 PM] stock999#4818
I don't understand  ' Avg Vol', 'Max Vol', etc.  I newer  used to work with such kind of exchange, atomic swap. That's why i need a detailed guide.


[27-Dec-18 09:15 PM] jspook16#3059
so currently volume is low for most pairs because not enough people are using it. "This swap is worth $.." should be an estimate of what the swap is worth in fiat. So if you trade 10 kmd for X number of Verus (example) it should say this swap is worth ~ $7. Im going off memory. I think avg vol is the avg vol of available utxos. Max vol i think is the largest utxo. Atomic swaps basically swap one utxo size for another of equal value. Hyperdex helps in creating a utxo for the size you are trying to swap for. What pairs are you looking to trade? @stock999


[27-Dec-18 09:16 PM] jspook16#3059
You can read up on barterdex here  https://docs.komodoplatform.com/home-barterDEX.html       Hyperdex is just a gui for barterdex backend. Maybe there is some useful info there for you. @stock999


[27-Dec-18 09:21 PM] jspook16#3059
@stock999 also as an fyi, currently barterdex is running marketmaker 1.0 (think of it as the brains that allow for atomic swaps). There is an upgrade early next year to mm2.0 (marketmaker 2.0) that should make things alot smoother. AND there is a project (coincollect) that is working on a mobile trading app with barterdex backend. The project is also advertising providing liquidity to jump start the app use. tagging @Diesmaster to make sure i captured coincollect project correctly.


[28-Dec-18 03:19 AM] stock999#4818
Thanks for the explanation  @jspook16


[28-Dec-18 03:38 AM] stock999#4818
It is still not clear about utxo.   What happens if i have no a proper size? For example, i have received 100 KMD  as a one single tx,  i.e . utxo is 100, right? But i want to sell only 10 or 20 of them. Will it work?


[28-Dec-18 03:39 AM] stock999#4818
Sorry if the question looks as stupid, but i'm really a newbie in this atomic swap

When you are doing an atomic swap , it will match the closest UTXO that you have available...

They charge their own token and share fees

Eg pay once off 100000 tokens and fees are split 50 50
Pay 200000 tokens and fees are 70 30
Pay 400000 tokens and fees are 90 10

 Think their cheapest package is 5500 usd. Not sure how Dex work or if compatible or anything but it could be worth a shot getting into contact. New coin, their first Dex launch in a week and they have a tiny mcap

[02-Jan-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
there will likely be those that are bad actors, so the important thing is that there is no economic gain, then it is just a nuisance factor. the atomic swap (with enough confirmations) is designed so that either both sides happen, or neither does

@lukechilds  Hi. A new hyperdex has been released, but I still don't see any orders and can't make a swap (KMD-PGT). Maybe you can connect to team wiever and show what's wrong ? if you have free time of course.


[07-Jan-19 06:53 AM] SadykovT#2123
since it is possible to make one exchange per minute, there is a lack of a visible timer.


[07-Jan-19 10:31 PM] lukechilds#2707
@SadykovT If there are no orders showing it's because there are no market makers placing orders on the BarterDEX network. This is unrelated to HyperDEX which is just a GUI interface for the BarterDEX network.


[07-Jan-19 10:32 PM] lukechilds#2707
A lot of people seem confused with the relationship between BarterDEX and HyperDEX


[07-Jan-19 10:33 PM] lukechilds#2707
BarterDEX is a protocol for P2P order matching and atomic swaps


[07-Jan-19 10:33 PM] lukechilds#2707
HyperDEX is a GUI frontend to allow you to view and interact with the BarterDEX network


[07-Jan-19 10:35 PM] lukechilds#2707
As a basic analogy, Imagine the BarterDEX network is BitTorrent, and HyperDEX is your torrent client (say for example Transmission).
If you were trying to download a torrent but you had no seeders, that's an issue with the BitTorrent network, not the Transmission torrent client.
You wouldn't contact the Transmission devs and ask them to screenshare with you to get your torrent to download.

Hi. I am here for the same problem, stuck on swap 4/5.  I followed the https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000024479-my-swap-is-stuck-what-to-do-now- instruction 5 hours ago, but still nothing returned. Any suggestion for a next step?


[23-Jan-19 06:06 AM] Jurjen#9294
To be sure, the documentation is speaking about 'UUID' , but Hyperdex is showing 'ID' when I click to the swap. I guess this is the same?


[23-Jan-19 11:01 AM] PTYX#6840
Yes it should be the same


[23-Jan-19 12:25 PM] Jurjen#9294
@PTYX thanks


[23-Jan-19 12:26 PM] Jurjen#9294
Any idea about a next step, do I have to try multiple times? Are there other solutions? If not, will it be lost and if so, should I report it somewhere for research?


[23-Jan-19 12:28 PM] SHossain#0007
wait for 24 hours and then start HyperDEX again. it should be back automatically after starting it. if not use the above guide


[23-Jan-19 09:59 PM] Jurjen#9294
@SHossain Do you mean I have to try it again? I used the above guide yesterday. Still 1 hour to go before 24 hours, but nothing returned yet.

Here is my stupid question of the day: what is the difference between BarterDEX and a wallet? Both hold coins, which you can deposit and withdraw to and from. Is it just the swap element?

By definition of a DEX the tx limit is the thruput of the slowest chain in the swap no?


[29-Jan-19 12:28 AM] tolken#2655
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre claiming atomic swaps, so may not apply.


[30-Jan-19 09:00 AM] crypto999#4866
Also, are there any figures on what the BarterDEX system market is - I.e. the value of non-fiat crypto to crypto exchanges which take place a day?

Thanks for the reply. What I meant is the potential market. So, Binance does around $10bn per day. What percentage of that (and other exchanges) is made up of crypto to crypto pair trading (no fiat involved)...

The hyperdex team is releasing a claim app for the ledger rewards. That seems like a step closer to integration but trading live with the ledger will probably take some time.

hey @artem.pikulin#0794! I see this answer from you earlier: 

```
artem.pikulin12/26/2018
@crypto999 Hi, swap protocol design discussions took place at 2015-2016: https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1340621.msg13828271#msg13828271, https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1364951 when there were just few coins with BIP65 (CLTV) support. The purpose was to allow one side of swap to send standard 2of2 multisig output so at least  Alice can swap the coin without CLTV.
Nowadays most coins have CLTV opcode support so swap protocol will be simplified in MM2, both payments will be hash/time locked outputs, Bob won't need 212% balance to trade anymore.
``` 

I understand about CLTV, but in an attack scenario I don't understand how this mitigates a Bob from "faking it" and accepting a bunch of trades but never filling them. In that scenario, wouldn't there be a bunch of Alice's doing "alicepayments" and locking their funds up when a malicious bob has no intention of actually sending his "bobpayment" (filling the order). This seems like it could cause a lot of trouble on the DEX, especially if a fake bob set a really low exchange rate which beat out other real bobs.


[22-Feb-19 11:44 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
@supermanblockchain I think you should ask this in #dev-marketmaker

thanks @KomodoWorld, I'll do that!


[23-Feb-19 03:02 PM] PTYX#6840
@supermanblockchain how could Bob fake it exactly?


[23-Feb-19 03:03 PM] PTYX#6840
If I'm not mistaken the Bob has to fulfill the same requirements as the Alice in terms of funds being available

Hi there. I have questions regarding the dex coin? Am i Right that 50% of the fees, once 1 million $ is reached, will be credited among the dex hodlers? What is the Max. Supply of the dex coin? Any difference to circulating supply? All decentralised Exchanges build uppon barterdex engine will Collect fees for the dex coin?


[21-Mar-19 02:28 AM] Hackelchen#9754
Where do i have to keep My dex in Order to get my chunk of the pile? Agama? What Will Be exactly credited? Kmd?


[21-Mar-19 02:38 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. max supply 1 million + a little for the small mining rewards


[21-Mar-19 02:38 AM] jl777c#5810
the KMD address that has the DEX will get the revshare


[21-Mar-19 02:40 AM] CHMEX#0686
>>will be credited among the dex hodlers
yes
>> Max. Supply of the dex coin
1'000'060   increases 0.0001 / Block
>>All decentralised Exchanges build uppon barterdex engine will Collect fees for the dex coin
yes if they don't change the address, which in case passens breaks the protocol with barterdex by komodo
>>My dex in Order to get my chunk of the pile? Agama?
yes
>>What Will Be exactly credited? Kmd?
yes fees are converted to KMD and than dividend is paid to your KMD address

Ok i did buy some dex today on coinexchange, so i guess it was me pumping the Price this high. In average i paid 8 kmd for 1 dex, just calculated it. So i am Willing to Pay 8:1 kmd/dex ratio. What do you say?


[21-Mar-19 07:07 AM] Hackelchen#9754

I was offered today to buy at 32 KMD a piece

Some noob questions: hyperdex = KMD dex? Above you are talking about a DEX coin? Would holding that coin mean i would benefit from TX fees when the DEX is used?


[23-Mar-19 08:13 PM] smkhound#7640
@Deleted User For  HyperDEX/BarterDEX or any app using the dex API, the dexfee is held for distribution to DEX asset holders when it reaches a threshold value.

@Deleted User ON BarterDEX / HyperDex and Coinexchange.io you can buy the DEX Asset, or you find an OTC Seller here. But the liquidity is low, many of the hodlers won¬¥t sell

@Acura Ah i see (https://komodoplatform.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/KPSD/pages/71729160/What+is+a+Parallel+Chain+Asset+Chain) Both Supernet and DEX are parallel (asset) chains on KMD. So this is the one i meant right? -> https://www.coinexchange.io/market/DEX/BTC. Which you offer 1 DEX for 50 KMD.


[24-Mar-19 04:42 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes


[24-Mar-19 04:42 AM] CHMEX#0686

[24-Mar-19 07:25 AM] Markus#5464
Dont know how i feel about DEX it sounds like this coin is pretty centralised


[24-Mar-19 07:25 AM] Markus#5464
with alot of benefits incase kmd trading app will be a huge success


[24-Mar-19 07:54 AM] applecider#7505
@Markus  The DEX token dose not represent a utility of sort , it more of a representation of shares  of reward to be distributed , so you ment to say a large portion is owned by a few which seems correct however a large share is held by other funds such as supernet token which in turn is held by 100s of  holders , and then the other 50%


[24-Mar-19 07:56 AM] applecider#7505
of reward  is held by MGW, BOT , jUMBLR, REV etc which is also held by 100s of holders each


[24-Mar-19 08:00 AM] applecider#7505
so you  dont have to buy DEX to own shares of DEX reward , but very few are willing to sell and why should they when the potential is high , alternatives is you make you own GUI with DEX api  and earn a portion , so it not centralised like say binance coin in terms of concentrated ownership


[24-Mar-19 09:58 AM] west775#4114
Dex isn't well distributed yet because it hasn't had a proper market since nxt days. Also many of the larger hodlers have had their dex since 2014 2015 and have strong hands; waiting for dex to start producing revenue


[24-Mar-19 09:59 AM] west775#4114
It will be very expensive to buy once revs start coming in


[24-Mar-19 10:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Will there be a minimum of DEX you need to hold before you get revs? (i read the first million in fees will be withheld and after that you get revs by holding DEX)


[24-Mar-19 10:57 AM] Markus#5464
Well if max supply is 1 million DEX then its probably 1$ per DEX as payout


[24-Mar-19 10:58 AM] Markus#5464
i assume


[24-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
No thats not what i meant. After the DEX is operational, the first 1 million dollars in tx fee will be for the team or whatever, after that DEX holders will earn from the tx fee. My question is if there is a minimum of DEX you need to hold to be able to receive those earnings


[24-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
or is it holdings/1.000.000 ratio


[24-Mar-19 10:59 AM] Markus#5464
Probably no minimum


[24-Mar-19 11:00 AM] Markus#5464
If supply would be bigger then it would make sense with a minimum


[24-Mar-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as the payout isnt a small fraction, it will go out


[26-Mar-19 02:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Evening all: a new day, new questions from me. I read in the Cryptoslate interview with CTO Stadelmann about the DEX. Interesting bits: 0 listingfee, every pair has a pair with every other listed coin, 0,15% tx fee. My question is: are those parameters embedded in the code (as well as de 1 million fee cap to be withheld first to cover costs) or are those subjects to change in the future? Further note: @jl777c i saw you only got 12 DEX coins, how i that possible as a lead engineer? I figured you "green" guys would be holding a majority of the coins in this project


[26-Mar-19 02:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
And other question: you guys told me earlier that the tx fee would be payed in the coin traded, but then you get fractions (for example, if you trade 50 KMD and 0,15% is taken off you end up trading 49,xx). Isnt that unpractical?


[26-Mar-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
the dexfee is in the protocol, the revshare payouts are done outside the consensus rules. nothing will be witheld for costs


[26-Mar-19 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
what happens when you trade on CEX? fees can be added to total or subtracted, not much difference really, unless you have OCD

what mechanism  distributes Dex earnings ?


[26-Mar-19 09:22 PM] CHMEX#0686
Its a human process.
Jl distributes it based on a getsnapshot height once it reaches 1m usd


[27-Mar-19 01:22 AM] mobipoi#5774
Hmm thats very centralised, as the private key to the fee earning addresses is held by one person , so the distribution of earnings is prone to human error, it also dangerous to


[27-Mar-19 01:23 AM] mobipoi#5774
It like CEX but for Dex asset would have thought it was automated


[27-Mar-19 01:25 AM] CHMEX#0686
Maybe in the future that might be a CC I don't know. But for now is sounds like the safest option


[27-Mar-19 01:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It was never a priority to automate as the distribution wasnt that often. I already read that @jl777c  would automate it once it would be more often. The problem I can imagine would be that you would need to convert all the fees to kmd in order to pay the dividend, dont know if it‚Äôs possible to automate that part? Anyway everything is on the blockchain and I can imagine someone like jl has 100x more to lose should he run off with a mere 1m$ in dexfees... its just not worth it to f*ck around with that.


[27-Mar-19 01:42 AM] jl777c#5810
once there is enough DEX liquidity, then the dexfees for each coin can be autoconverted to KMD and with payments CC, it would be possible to automate the payouts. I guess if the DEX allowed to specify an arbitrary scriptPubKey to send the proceeds to, then it can all be automated. However, automating is a lot of work and there is no sense to do this until it becomes a real need. I have already distributed millions in revshares from the dPoW fees (most arrived during the BTC fee market). So yes, currently the DEX asset is a decentralized dexfees arriving, but centralized revshare distribution. Only the dexfees are at risk from jl777 gone bad

[27-Mar-19 03:42 AM] mobipoi#5774
Yes payment cc is great was thinking of that too but the problem is jl777 might not  be bad but access to the fee earning  addresses is lost or hacked  what will happen can the fee earning addresses be changed in such events ?  Or it will be like satoshi btc address laying there earning fees but nothing can be done to get access


[27-Mar-19 03:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
What if binance privkeys get comprimised?


[27-Mar-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
if that happens, we can always update the DEX code to use a different address


[27-Mar-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
let us not worry about hypotheticals in unlikely scenarios when there are solutions to them


[27-Mar-19 04:47 AM] mobipoi#5774
Yes I agree , doesn't hurt to be paranoid once in a while but nice to know there are solutions already in place


[27-Mar-19 04:49 AM] mobipoi#5774
@Cryptoon  we should be better than binance


[27-Mar-19 06:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
It was more in the sense of that the likelyhood of binance privkeys being compromised is a very super highly unlikely, just like it would that the DEX address should be compromised. Is it worth the time/effort to be the final 0.00000001% safe instead of just 99.9999999% even if the cost of that final 0.00000001 would be too high compared to the relative risk?

[28-Mar-19 03:03 AM] jl777c#5810
the issue is that every coin would need a "sweeper"


[28-Mar-19 03:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so really not practical to make it 100% trustless across all coins


[28-Mar-19 08:45 AM] mobipoi#5774
@siu  death proof maybe important , if dex become widely used dex existence depends of jl777 which is not bad but can be dangerous


[28-Mar-19 08:49 AM] mobipoi#5774
That all I was trying to say valuation is linked to that however kmd is filled with talented devs including jl777 so solutions will be created


[28-Mar-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
once it becomes a meaningful revenue stream, then we can change to multisig address for most coins

@lukechilds there quite a few ETH clones around doing different things will they be supported?


[14-Apr-19 05:01 AM] lukechilds#2707
Then that's a question for the marketmaker devs


[14-Apr-19 05:04 AM] Ridz#9550
@artem.pikulin how does one work towards getting an ETH clone onto this ecosystem.


[14-Apr-19 05:09 AM] Ridz#9550
@artemciy_dice maybe you have the answers im looking for?


[14-Apr-19 05:25 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Hi, @Ridz !

I might be wrong, but I'd start with finding the coins file and adding your coin there. The file format is described at https://github.com/jl777/coins.

You can probably experiment with this by modifying the coins file that comes with the HyperDEX, I think they have it somewhere (cf. https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/blob/1d4ed3234b482e769124725c7e979eef5cd72d24/app/marketmaker/supported-currencies.js).

@artem.pikulin#0794 should be able to help you further tomorrow, and you're welcome to ask in #dev-marketmaker and/or the older #dev-tradebots channels.


[14-Apr-19 05:29 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
`> there quite a few ETH clones around doing different things will they be supported?`

If they have a compatible wallet API and/or Electrum servers, or if there's interest in helping us implement the necessary changes, then sure, why not?


[14-Apr-19 05:31 AM] Ridz#9550
thats why im hear as all info ive found seems slim and sparse, and want to be able to swap on the platform with our chain


[14-Apr-19 05:33 AM] Ridz#9550
should i take my chat to another channel @artemciy_dice as i have questions and don't wanna hijack this chan


[14-Apr-19 05:35 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Yeah, I think that #dev-tradebots is closer to the subject of coin integraions.


[14-Apr-19 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is a infuria type of support that can be used, it shouldnt be too much work to add


[14-Apr-19 06:14 AM] Ridz#9550
just need a list of requirements of API and i can make it happen as i would love to work towards getting the other ETH variants on the platform


[14-Apr-19 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
it needs to provide the same thing ETH does


[14-Apr-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont know the details, but if we are using ETH infuria servers (which I think we are), then the clone would need to be running infuria servers on the clone ETH


[14-Apr-19 07:55 AM] cipi#4502
we are running parity nodes for the ETH chain. They are defined here: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/ethereum/ETH together with the "swap_contract_address". I think the same contract must be deployed on the other chain.
ETH is enabled like this: `curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"enable\",\"coin\":\"ETH\",\"urls\":[\"http://electrum1.cipig.net:8555\",\"http://electrum2.cipig.net:8555\",\"http://electrum3.cipig.net:8555\"],\"swap_contract_address\":\"0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871\",\"mm2\":1}"`
it contains the parity nodes defined in the above file and the contract address from the same file. I suppose this would also work with other ETH clones, but @artem.pikulin can tell us more for sure.

@lukechilds Is there a build guide on HyperDEX?


[16-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Satoshi#3333
For Win mainly


[16-Apr-19 10:16 PM] Satoshi#3333
Well building on Win? Node v10 required and anything else?


[16-Apr-19 10:21 PM] lukechilds#2707
@Satoshi HyperDEX is just the GUI, it doesn't have an API, we just bundle in the `marketmaker` binary and use it's API

ahhh

I have 2 Dex now, will that be enough to get a piece of the distributed fees or do i need more to not be a fraction and miss out?


[25-Apr-19 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
2/1000000 would be your revshare


[25-Apr-19 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
probably not enough


[25-Apr-19 03:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
Do you have ballpark figure what i need?


[25-Apr-19 03:14 AM] jl777c#5810
no idea what percentage of revshare you need


[25-Apr-19 03:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
Is it right that the higher the volume on the Dex the amount dex needed to not be a fraction gets lower?


[25-Apr-19 03:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
100 fee x 2/1.000.000 is almost 0 but 100.000.000 fee x 2/1.000.000 isnt.


[25-Apr-19 03:17 AM] jl777c#5810
2 DEX will get 2/1000000 of the revshare


[25-Apr-19 03:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it is proportional to the number of DEX you have


[25-Apr-19 03:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
I understand but is the amount of fee to be distributed over all 1 million Dex a variable to determine if a revshare is sent to the Dex holder?


[25-Apr-19 03:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
Or only the x/1.000.000


[25-Apr-19 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
when there is $1 mil worth to distributed it will be sent out, since DEX gets 50% of all revenues, 2 DEX will in that case get you $1


[25-Apr-19 03:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
But earlier you said 2 Dex is nog enough to get that 1 dollar?


[25-Apr-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i didnt say that


[25-Apr-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
2 DEX will get 2 millionths of revshare


[25-Apr-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i keep repeating this


[25-Apr-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just simple math


[25-Apr-19 03:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
Ok my bad, a comment from you a few weeks back confused me. Then you talked about fractions being too small to receive revshare. I may have interpreted that wrong

[25-Apr-19 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810

To mw the binance dex is not really a dex because it can only be operated by binance. As komodo has all the atomic swap functions I don't see any reason eht komodo should not emerge asnthe biggest dex of all.

@Bongistan mm2 repo is this https://github.com/artemii235/SuperNET (README contains build instructions)
and this are the API-calls mm2 supports atm: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/blob/mm/docs/basic-docs/atomic-swap-dex/dex-api.md
i sent you friend request. i hope that after you accept it, i can invite you to the mm2-channel (doesn't work atm)

Is hyperdex like the next version of BarterDex?


[25-May-19 03:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@jacman hyperdex is a client that uses the barterdex platform

Hello @hyperDEX   I'm trying to withdraw from HyperDEX   I can't get it to work.   It does ask me to OK the transaction fee, and makes the alert claiming that the withdraw was sucessful, but I don't get a transaction hash nor do funds transfer to my address.

no, only the name is similar. the backend is completely different, barterlly is a web based service for otc trades. There's a plan to change it to a p2p app using barterdex tech in the future but this will require some time

@hyperDEX can you elaborate some more on the mid july update for the hyperdex/barterdex? Will it be a first mm2 version or production ready and what are the improvements over mm1?


[26-Jun-19 12:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
@Deleted User the focus right now is to get atomicdex working (basically the mobile app), so work on web sockets (way our app communicates with the back end) has not started. Without that we cannot provide updates to the GUI.

The biggest changes is that mm2.0 was built in rust so memory leakage issues were solved and that trades are completing nearly 100% of the time whereas the old mm 1.0 there were issues.


[26-Jun-19 12:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So overall a big UX win.


[26-Jun-19 12:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So i am waiting for them to port that functionality from mm 1.0 to mm 2.0 then my devs can start porting hyperdex over. I dont think there should be too big of a delay between mm 2.0 being 100% ready and when hyperDEX can use it


[26-Jun-19 12:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
@hyperDEX Okay thanks, atomicdex uses the barterdex asset also in the backend(DEX)?


[26-Jun-19 12:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes so atomicDEX is the mobile GUI the KMD team created


[26-Jun-19 12:24 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So it will be part of the DEX asset


[26-Jun-19 12:25 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The back end uses the new mm2.0 which is the upgrade of mm1.0 which was used by barterDEX and hyperDEX


[26-Jun-19 01:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
Thanks for the update, i'll keep hodling my DEX assets (would be nice if there will be a liquid market soon), my delta app fluctates very heavily b/c of the DEX (although the price of DEX is the same for the last days on CoinExchange due to lack of volume).  20-25% changes out of nowhere give me a heartattack sometimes üòÉ

Hey @hyperDEX so what's the word on porting over to MM2? Do you guys have a rough timeline for when you can start/finished?


[05-Jul-19 11:45 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Regnar Unfortunately there were some miscommunications surrounding how our GUI was built and what functionalities mm2.0 requires for it to be a easy port. Unfortunately it is more work but i have asked Sindre to look into. No ETA at the moment as  there seems to be a few things we have to change with the current interface.

We will try to get it out ASAP

[25-Jul-19 11:02 AM] allbits#5898
I get error "unhandled promise rejection" again. Seems to happen right after I start a second simultaneous swap


[25-Jul-19 11:07 AM] allbits#5898
Swaps completed tho. But I had to restart to see the updated balances.


[25-Jul-19 11:07 AM] jansako#3330
that you feeding me DEX?


[25-Jul-19 11:09 AM] jansako#3330
on my node it was sitting on some sort of http_fallback:464 status, but eventually got over it & completed


[25-Jul-19 11:11 AM] jansako#3330
says things like "time to use http fallback"


[25-Jul-19 11:12 AM] allbits#5898
This time I got unhandled promise rejection with just one swap outstanding.


[25-Jul-19 11:12 AM] hastrup#8742
@applecider I do not agree whit that. If atomicdex api is a top 50 exchange. That in my mind is a success. But its now boom or bust but decent.


[25-Jul-19 11:27 AM] allbits#5898
Then I just waited without swapping and got the unhandled promise rejection error. Once that happens, balances and orderbooks stop updating and restart is required


[25-Jul-19 01:18 PM] applecider#7505
@hyperDEX I see that sometimes  orders are no longer visible after a while when doing other things but that is fix when hyperdex is closed and restarted , a "Refresh button will be convenient or a circle icon with arrows point clock wise , so one can just click on it and orders reappear

All good. Just reporting what I find :)  Great to back on hyperdex again! Brings back memories. And it's already working so much better!


[25-Jul-19 03:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586

When the user clicks on an order, the price field is automatically populated - at the moment, it is populated with a price that is a little lower than the price clicked on. This was necessary in the olden times.  But now, the actual price clicked should be populated.


[25-Jul-19 04:29 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@allbits we are waiting for the mm2.0 team to change the API for that but we are working to resolve that in the GUI once done

@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± you can set limit orders

We are working on a way to cancel the order. For now if you close the app and reopen the orders should be cancelled

This is not ready to be used for real trading. Little amounts is fine but please be aware we are still trying to get a stable release out, this is a very early beta

No doubt! But for such and early beta to out so quick and useable for small stuff is credit to everyone! Out of interest, I can see a difference between the fees for AtomicDEX and HyperDex for coins that are common (ltc for example) at the moment, is this something that will be aligned in the future so that users have. It need to think where to swap for the best rate?

How there is a cancel Button for an open order on hyperDex?


[26-Jul-19 01:35 AM] Acura#2748
Is there also an option to Withdraw Coins from hyperDex?


[26-Jul-19 01:36 AM] Acura#2748
Otherwhise the user must Login via an another wallet to withdraw


[26-Jul-19 01:47 AM] jansako#3330

@miles  you mean fees or the rate? The mm2.0 team need to create a new API that gives accurate numbers, then we dont need the small % margin of error. Say i was to buy something listed for 0.1, when you click on it, our DEX might sell it for 0.09 instead. This was due to the mm1.0 needing this error margin. It will still execute at 0.1 though

Hi, can you explain how hyperDEX works and how it differs from other swap/exchange apps in the Komodo ecosystem? Thanks


[26-Jul-19 06:28 AM] gcharang#6833
@D2D privacyalternatives.com all the DEXes in the komodo ecosystem use the same backend - mmV2
they are all different GUIs so they have different UX + UI + features

creating an order in one of them will match in all the others


[26-Jul-19 06:28 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
Ah OK thanks!


[26-Jul-19 06:29 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667

consider all the different GUIs to be in beta
some might be in alpha

I've already added Barterlly and AtomixDEX on my directory
I added (beta) so that people now, but they are the most voted exchanges so far
Maybe I can already add Chainswap and hyperDEX too


[26-Jul-19 06:32 AM] D2D privacyalternatives.com#5667
or maybe it's too early for hyperDEX?
I think Chainswap is now fully released


[26-Jul-19 06:33 AM] gcharang#6833

@D2D privacyalternatives.com maybe another distinction, hyperDEX is the only one with a market view where limit orders are places. atomicDEX and Chainmaker's DEX does market orders like shapeshift.

Will it be possible to add  features in which all order pairs of a specific coin can be seen


[27-Jul-19 06:24 AM] mobipoi#5774
Because of the liquidity multiplier , this can help sellers to navigate which actual coin they want


[27-Jul-19 06:25 AM] mobipoi#5774
So e.g Kmd/k64 ,  kmd/btc ,Kmd/bch, kmd/dex etc .....


[27-Jul-19 02:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@mobipoi that is something we will be working on as soon as the core functionality is stable.


[27-Jul-19 02:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
That is our focus right now, that we refactor the code to mm2.0 that we make sure all the little bugs and so forth are done so normal users can place simple orders and get them executed. Once that is done we will add on further functionality


[27-Jul-19 02:43 PM] applecider#7505
ok that is a cool feature but I think it better we focus on the main things first @mobipoi as hyper said


[27-Jul-19 02:51 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It is part of the road map, liquidity multiplier option and market maker bot üòõ

@hyperDEX when Accointing tax optimizer¬†?
You could offer this automized software solution to Premium members who pay it with $KMD/$DEX .

It could be an extra revenue stream, no?


[30-Jul-19 10:03 AM] phm87#7395
Taxes on internationnal lvl are complicated. There are some data on CMC but we may need 150 fiscal experts and with huge risks I guess @CS_ 
But your idea is good on paper, I like it. I had a similar project called tax load balancing but I never found investors to fund it


[30-Jul-19 11:15 AM] CS_#7849
@phm87 oh so it needs to be a Project built on Komodo then?

No. I was not talking about kmd sorry


[30-Jul-19 11:17 AM] phm87#7395
But yeah doing it on komodo can be easier because tech is already there. Pb of taxes is complex formulaes and always changing


[30-Jul-19 11:19 AM] phm87#7395
I heard of 1 of the big 4 that have an optimization tax app on international lvl, it did cost more than 100 millions but .... it made them earn way more.

[12-Aug-19 06:06 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@miles Hi! I've checked your swap status on the seednode and can see that other side swap was completed with refund. Due to the bug of MM2 (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/502) your payment is stuck until MM2 is updated in HyperDEX bundle. But once you update the app with new MM2 it will be refunded. Please ensure that you don't delete the app data since it will be harder to recover if MM2 database is removed.

@hyperDEX i had someone review hyperDEX back in Q1 this year [1], it's probably due for another review but you're probably working working on the marketmaker integration [2] pic in bottom of link of the atomic swap api info.

has hyperdex got some sort of roadmap?   or any other info needing an update post?

@miles Hi, did you enable KMD and DEX coins after opening the HyperDEX app? MM2 requires the coins to be activated for swap to automatically kickstart.
If coins are activated but your payment is not refunded I will need MM2 logs to check what's going on. @hyperDEX Can MM2 logs be viewed from HyperDEX app?


[02-Sep-19 11:51 PM] miles#6381
Thanks guys for response, both coins were activated and the swap was still active at step 5/7 but didn‚Äôt refund. I am away for a couple of days but if you let me know how I can grab the logs or some info to debug I can look at it Friday if that helps

Hi @Artist - nodeJS, react, electron stack being used and the app obv. written in JS with some CSS for the styles. It is a GUI built on top of the atomicDEX technology: https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/blob/b44b2990ceb956d3015d046aad0fa22bc840fdd1/README.md#hyperdex-is-just-a-gui

The git README and repo has quite some useful infos if you are interested in more details.

what i am missing  currently is a button to cancel open orders. only possible if i shutdown the app itself which is not perfect.

Hello, I am a new user, having just downloaded 0.4.0 for Linux.  I wanted to see if my seed words for AtomicDEX would work in HyperDEX and they mostly didn't.  HyperDEX sees my Bitcoin Cash balance, but not BTC, KMD, or ETH.


[16-Sep-19 09:52 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
When I connect to a HyperDEX account, there is an error that says "Couldn't Connect to ETOMIC Electrum Server", but evenutally the wallet does load.


[16-Sep-19 10:41 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
I have sent both BTC and USDT to my HyperDEX wallet.  The USDT showed up no problem, however the BTC is not showing despite having several confirmations.

[17-Sep-19 01:04 AM] phideas#8309
@FTL_Ian you are on old version of hyperdex. you can try out current nightly builds instead. remember hyperdex is in early development stage. only test with small amounts and report bugs. https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex-nightlies/releases/latest

anything dealing with ETH or ERC20, needs ETH

no matter whether you're maker or taker?


[17-Sep-19 12:07 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
May want to make the error more clear to the user.  In my case, using Ubuntu 19.04, it pops up and goes away.  If I weren't  watching, I'd never know it.


[17-Sep-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i think both maker and taker need to invoke the atomic swap contract on ETH, which costs gas


[17-Sep-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
general rule is ETH charges gas for everything


[17-Sep-19 01:26 PM] cipi#4502
both taker and maker need gas when dealing with erc20... and USDT is not supported by mm2

AtomicDEX is also known as MM2?


[17-Sep-19 03:54 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
I was wondering if AtomicDEX would be able to interact with trades from HyperDEX and vice-versa.


[17-Sep-19 03:54 PM] PTYX#6840
MM2 lives inside the atomicdex


[17-Sep-19 03:55 PM] PTYX#6840
hyperdex also use mm2 as far as i understand it. this goes for any implementation that wants to get liquidity/orders from the general network.


[17-Sep-19 04:32 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
So how come USDT is in HyperDEX if it's not included in MM2?


[17-Sep-19 06:19 PM] PTYX#6840
Mm2 should support erc20 and USDT was added on mm1


[17-Sep-19 06:20 PM] PTYX#6840
I suspect that mm2 supports tether. Different graphical interfaces might have different coins available depending on their listing policies.

@hyperDEX could be a good idea to remove USDT from the coins list, else more people will have their USDT stuck


[19-Sep-19 11:28 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
agreed


[19-Sep-19 01:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Will do.


[20-Sep-19 05:07 AM] cryptopoli#6868
My experience with Hyperdex!  Yesterday Buy 1 placed Dex order, the order was marked with cancled, I thought nothing about it wol not be executed. This morning look in and see the order executed, in the history but still marked with Cancelled, KMD amount was debited, 0.99999 Dex were written well, ???????????????????????????


[20-Sep-19 05:09 AM] lollipop#1682
If you want DEX use chainswap. Works every time.

What is the price for DEX on hyperdex?


[20-Sep-19 05:22 AM] cryptopoli#6868
Well I rather expect an answer to my story with Hyperdex KMD/InstantDEX Order? has anyone had any experience with Hyperdex? The prices are very different v 10-40KMD


[20-Sep-19 05:24 AM] Acura#2748
My trades on HyperDex, especially Dex Asset working fine


[20-Sep-19 05:24 AM] Acura#2748
Never had bad experience


[20-Sep-19 05:37 AM] cryptopoli#6868
yes it seems to work even if an order is marked ge-cancled, but that contradicts the general practice of an order withdrawal!!! and I would have hoped for an answer to that.


[20-Sep-19 11:21 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
@cipi , unfortunately MEW did not work with my HyperDEX seed words.  I also tried Exodus wallet and it doesn't see anything.


[20-Sep-19 11:24 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
Just tried to withdraw BTC from HyperDEX and got this error:

Unhandled Promise Rejection
TypeError: Cannot use 'in' operator to search for 'amount' in undefined
    at app://-/bundle.js:142066:30


[20-Sep-19 11:27 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
ok, tried a smaller amount than the full amount and it worked - apparently that is the error that comes up if you type in the full amount in your wallet


[20-Sep-19 11:50 AM] FTL_Ian#8600
update- I was able to withdraw USDT by using an amount lower than the maximum


[20-Sep-19 02:45 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@cryptopoli can you send me a screenshot? Are you saying you did get it the DEX too?

There is some differences in the way mm2.0 handles the taker/maker model which the GUI does not account for and something we are trying to get done. Hopefully i will get some assistance to speed this up soon.

Currently the nightly releases somewhat work but please consider it a alpha until we get a refactored release out.


[20-Sep-19 02:46 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@FTL_Ian good to hear


[21-Sep-19 05:05 AM] gcharang#6833
@FTL_Ian you can use the seed words from hyperdex in Verus Agama to export private key
the private key can be used in MEW or other wallets
https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024495-export-private-key-wif-from-a-wallet-seed-or-pin-password
you need to enable the coin "ETH" in lite mode to see the privatekey corresponding to it


[22-Sep-19 05:51 AM] 2456145768#5267
I'm confused. Which software do I use for hyperdex?

Can I provide any logs to investigate or is this already a knows issue?

Can everyone stop using hyperDEX until there is a official release please.


[27-Sep-19 02:24 PM] Satoshi#3333
Ah thought you needed testers hah and Oszy was just a regular withdrawal after doing a deposit waited a good amount of confirms

Great work though so far!


[27-Sep-19 02:31 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I did but i think just for now, i am going to hold off until we get a better release out. Unfortunately the devs that have been working on this for the last 2 years, are burnt out and would like to do something else. I have reached out to the team and they will assist with a dev resources, so until i get this sorted, dont think there is much value in wasting the testers time until we can fix issues promptly.

I think it should be well established by now that Cryptobridge is a corrupt exchange.  I was notified that I need to verify my identity to Cryptobridge/Fractal ID in order to have access to MY funds. I have submitted my drivers license, name, legal address, source of income, a photo of me holding my license and a credit card statement. This is enough! yet CB requested my latest tax return. That is too much information. They have more than enough information to verify my identity and yet I can't access my funds. I have emailed them and thus far received no response. If anyone knows how to remove funds from this exchange please let us know it can be accomplished. I hope we, as a crypto community, spread the word so that others avoid this exchange. I hope there is a special place in hell for the thieves that work at Cryptobridge. They are truly scum. For all those who have been ripped off by Cryptobribge please take the time to post these types of warnings on as many other forums as possible.

[04-Oct-19 07:23 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Satoshi thanks for the offer. The komodo team are helping me with a dev resource. They are looking at the code base and hopefully will start working on completing the gui refactor for mm2.0


[04-Oct-19 07:24 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Once that is done then we can start with the testing once again. Also since HyperDEX uses the same netid as all the other GUIs, you can add liquidity to them now and they will show up on hyperDEX once we get a release out.


[04-Oct-19 07:31 PM] Satoshi#3333
Perfect!


[04-Oct-19 07:34 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@Satoshi I dont have twitter anymore but i just saw a tweet thread with you and PTYX. hyperDEX is free because i have footed most of the bill for it (i pay the devs). That is a choice that i made to give back to the community, probably not the best financial decision. If it was about the numbers, hyperDEX would not be free because there would be no way to justify the expense.

@hyperDEX   The coin failed, is it necessary to manually set the miner's fee?


[07-Oct-19 09:00 PM] gcharang#6833
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± development of hyperDEX seems to be paused for the moment
are you trying to move coins outside of hyperDEX?
which coin?


[07-Oct-19 09:47 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@gcharang BCH  kmd


[07-Oct-19 09:49 PM] gcharang#6833
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± you can use the seed words from hyperdex in Agama wallet to move those coins
<https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html>
<https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000029966-logging-into-verus-agama-with-an-existing-private-key-or-seed>


[07-Oct-19 10:15 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@gcharang Because atomicdex updated 2.0, a black screen appeared and the seed was lost after reloading. I can still log in to HyperDEX with a password before I want to use HyperDEX to transfer the currency.


[07-Oct-19 10:21 PM] gcharang#6833
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± can you get private key of KMD and BCH from hyperDEX?


[07-Oct-19 10:27 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
If you can display the mnemonic with a password, it is best.


[07-Oct-19 10:32 PM] gcharang#6833
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± go to settings -> click "View seed phrase" -> enter your password
you can see your mnemonic

please remember to write down your mnemonic from the next time


[07-Oct-19 10:33 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@gcharang  hyperDEX  Also?


[07-Oct-19 10:35 PM] gcharang#6833
yes in hyperDEX,
go to settings -> click "View seed phrase" -> enter your password

@gcharang chainswap ?  Is there a GUI for that?

@peddycb the swap failed
the dex are still in the imtermediate address https://dex.explorer.dexstats.info/address/bUTaYUUb67kgi2UDZ5BGWumExYGtUdyJDj
they should come back to you after 4 hours(keep hyperdex running)


[21-Oct-19 03:28 AM] peddycb#5889
ah ok


[21-Oct-19 03:29 AM] peddycb#5889
What's the mistake ? hyperdex always has to run


[21-Oct-19 04:00 AM] Oszy#5734
of course it has to run until swap is finished


[21-Oct-19 04:05 AM] gcharang#6833
I don't think there is any mistake
some swaps simply timeout
it could be because of network conditions or maker going down etc.
I don't think it is recommended to use hyperDEX currently; its development seems to be paused


[21-Oct-19 04:51 AM] Lennart#9331

@lukechilds  is there a way to recover fund stuck ?


[07-Nov-19 04:26 AM] Oszy#5734
right. first of all don't try to fix or delete anything. HyperDEX current version does not yet support recovering funds of stuck swaps. 
You are going to have to wait for a release that does, or get marketmaker CLI working on your PC to do it.


[07-Nov-19 04:29 AM] Oszy#5734

@TonyL @Sir Seven can we help this gentlement? I thought if we use latest mm2 binary we could cURL the fund recovery trough that, I tried on my end but the binary can't access any swap history from hyperDEX, and comes up with " swap not found"


[07-Nov-19 05:50 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@Oszy send me json you are trying to use as history.


[07-Nov-19 05:50 AM] Oszy#5734
I don't have json maybe thats the main issue üòÑ

MM2 will not know about any swaps until you transfer swap history from json file.

[24-Nov-19 11:53 AM] Elmis#0347
I'm speaking with some others i support but the solution is not so clear, the problem is:   when I conect my  ledger, open the Ledger KMD Reward Claim and click on Check Rewards to beguin the process and after the firs time I press on export public key, I get a red label error: Error

Network, p2p orderbook and order matching layer.
BarterDEX retired. AtomicDEX API is the replacement.

AtomicDEX app is the app that uses the api.
HyperDEX is an app that originally worked on BarterDEX network & is currently being upgraded to work on the new atomicdex api

[05-Jan-20 02:37 AM] hyperDEX#6586
hyperDEX is transitioning into a community project. We are looking for people to volunteer for the following positions:

1. Core Dev, helping out with the hyperDEX code base, must have js exp and can understand the code located at https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex/
2. QA, helping out to test the hyperDEX code base, have had experience with writing up user stories and doing QA 
3. Support, willing to understand how hyperDEX works and can provide support to users. Would be great to understand the various mm2.0 steps to complete a dex transaction.
4. Marketers, helping to spread the word on social media and to help market hyperDEX in general.

Now i understand that since these are not paid positions, this will only be a viable if we can get enough people that can dedicate enough time to push this forward. Now this could all be a futile effort since the team is building their down Desktop app but the other alternative is to let hyperDEX die. I am hopeful there are still others in the community that would like to help, if that is something that you would like to do, please DM me.

@richardt True. Unfortunately there are even less people willing to spend money to make their investments more valuable, or support efforts to do that.

I'm a little surprised. Last month, you guys seem pretty confident that Hyperdex would be released in December. How did it go from that to now needing volunteers to move the project forward or "let Hyperdex die"?


[06-Jan-20 08:00 AM] jorian#4555
we can't release it as is, it needs active people to offer support, work out bugs and do some marketing. if none of that is available, it just stops being an option


[06-Jan-20 08:06 AM] richardt#2807
I see. Hope you guys find the help you need. Hyperdex looked promising


[06-Jan-20 08:24 AM] smkhound#7640
I'd encourage anyone interested to read the code and learn / contribute if they have the time or inclination - especially prospective notary node candidates heading into the next election. Contributions like this are worthy of earning some votes and demonstrating capability. Maybe you dont get paid directly working on a community project, but investing your time pays of in skills growth and future opportunities.

Hi, I'm running the hyperdex appimage. I've created a portfolio which is empty at the moment. When I choose an asset there is no data available, I'm guessing it's because I see this error `curl_easy_perform() failed: Couldn't connect to server`. Anyone knows if it's related and how I can fix it? thx


[12-Feb-20 08:40 AM] Oszy#5734
maybe you choose an asset that has no SPV server anymore? which one is it?


[12-Feb-20 08:44 AM] Pand#8752
the default is chips and it displays no data, and I went through all the assets of the default list of assets, none of them displays data, maybe there's a log file I can take a look at for more info?


[12-Feb-20 08:45 AM] Oszy#5734
```Failed to connect to host. curl managed to get an IP address to the machine and it tried to setup a TCP connection to the host but failed. This can be because you have specified the wrong port number, entered the wrong host name, the wrong protocol or perhaps because there is a firewall or another network equipment in between that blocks the traffic from getting through.```

isn't it related to the fact that there are no funds?


[12-Feb-20 09:19 AM] Oszy#5734
no


[12-Feb-20 09:20 AM] Oszy#5734
so you only have chips and kmd now and it still says `Couldn't connect to server` ?


[12-Feb-20 09:24 AM] Pand#8752
yes, and on the dashboard the chart of komodo is showing but chips displays no data available


[12-Feb-20 09:25 AM] Oszy#5734
the CHIPS chart won't show anything


[12-Feb-20 09:26 AM] Oszy#5734
it's not in the FIAT API


[12-Feb-20 09:26 AM] Oszy#5734
regardless it should work fine


[12-Feb-20 09:26 AM] Oszy#5734
if you go to Exchange CHIPS/KMD you should see some orders


[12-Feb-20 09:26 AM] Oszy#5734
if those show everything is ok#


[12-Feb-20 09:27 AM] Pand#8752
ok, on the exchange tab the pairs kmd/chips chips/kmd both show  `no data available` `no orders`


[12-Feb-20 09:29 AM] Oszy#5734
I see this

there are no CHIPS/KMD orders in the orderbook atm


[12-Feb-20 10:51 AM] Oszy#5734
maybe you should try to curl the orderbook from terminal see what it gives back


[12-Feb-20 10:52 AM] Oszy#5734
`curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"orderbook\",\"base\":\"KMD\",\"rel\":\"CHIPS\"}"`
try this in terminal


[12-Feb-20 10:54 AM] Oszy#5734
@cipi why do i see some then üòÑ


[12-Feb-20 10:55 AM] cipi#4502
no idea, maybe old stuff... i don't see any orders in CHIPS/KMD

wtf üòÑ


[12-Feb-20 10:56 AM] cipi#4502
i used to post CHIPS/KMD orders, but my script removes them if coinpaprika has no price for CHIPS (one trade in the last 24h)


[12-Feb-20 10:56 AM] Pand#8752
@cipi do you see orders for another pair?
@Oszy so I replace `userpass`with my password right, no security issue there?


[12-Feb-20 10:57 AM] cipi#4502
sure, i see orders for all kind of pairs


[12-Feb-20 10:57 AM] Pand#8752

my hyperdex is running on another port


[12-Feb-20 11:01 AM] Pand#8752
let me try with it


[12-Feb-20 11:01 AM] Oszy#5734
there's definitely something wrong with this version, I can't see my balances, everything is 0.


[12-Feb-20 11:02 AM] Pand#8752
so I tried with the port I got from `netstat` and I got an error `marketmaker crashed hyperdex will now relaunch`


[12-Feb-20 11:02 AM] Oszy#5734
that's the problem then


[12-Feb-20 11:02 AM] Oszy#5734

[12-Feb-20 12:10 PM] jorian#4555
but seriously: any release from hyperdex is deprecated right now, as mm2.0 has changed so much that hyperdex simply doesn't work anymore


[12-Feb-20 12:11 PM] jorian#4555
@hyperDEX has gone MIA so we can't progress much further. we need access to the atomiclabs repository on github before we continue, to at least have some credible history


[12-Feb-20 12:11 PM] jorian#4555
until then and until we announce a release that works with the new mm2.0, hyperdex should not be used

[17-Feb-20 06:26 PM] Mylo#8306
when doing `yarn install` i'm getting errors with node-gyp part.  does hyperdex node-gyp need python2?


[18-Feb-20 11:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That i am not too sure. The code base at atomiclabs repo is a bit outdated, so first thing we need to do is for the other dev to do a pull request in first, get it basically functioning then see what the next step should be.


[18-Feb-20 11:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I will send them a message


[18-Feb-20 01:28 PM] Mylo#8306
ok thanks.  i was trying to build particle4dev repo, the newer branch.
i'm on a newer OS i don't usually do node/electron testing on, so i'm a bit in the dark with it.  i'll spin up a ubuntu VM on weekend and use for hyperdex testing.


[18-Feb-20 01:33 PM] jorian#4555
@Mylo maybe you have a too new Node version


[18-Feb-20 01:33 PM] jorian#4555
i had that issue


[18-Feb-20 01:35 PM] Mylo#8306
node 12 (using nvm) which version required?
gyp complaining about python2 vs python3.  i only have python3 installed.  python2 i think is EOL.


[18-Feb-20 01:41 PM] jorian#4555
node 10 i think was required


[18-Feb-20 01:41 PM] jorian#4555
i had to brew link --force --overwrite those symlinks on my mac to make it work

@jorian has pledged to work on HyperDEX as part of his NN proposal for SH region - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/blob/master/season4/candidates/jorian/README.md
Though he has also retained a node in NA due to good performance in S3, so hopefully this means work will continue even if SH node fails to win (though at half speed/funding)

[19-Apr-20 06:55 AM] jorian#4555
i'm not all chainmakers is, the NA node is siu's, i just managed it under the Chainmakers umbrella. Now that the EU node is lost, i am without funds


[19-Apr-20 06:56 AM] jorian#4555
i can also tell that if i don't get elected the SH node, i won't be able to dedicate much time to hyperdex


[19-Apr-20 02:43 PM] Mylo#8306
a vote for jorian helps mylo out too, handy community members.  i can help with hyperdex as stated in my proposal.  currently my focus is on the https://orderbook.live web app & CHIPS poker deployment.  https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/blob/master/season4/candidates/mylo/README.md#antara-module-development--hyperdex

ps vote for jorian to help enable the hyperdex development

hey guys does the DEX have an auto complete feature so users dont have to be online to execute?


[27-Aug-20 10:59 AM] jorian#4555
That never works


[27-Aug-20 11:00 AM] jorian#4555
Because the swaps are wallet to wallet, you need an active wallet to sign the transactions with your private key


[27-Aug-20 11:16 PM] gcharang#6833
@sidhujag x-post from #ü§ù‚îÇdex-desktop 
```
the best that can happen is, something like: user creates a AWS account, adds billing info, creates an API key with appropriate permissions and gives the key to a GUI. the GUI automatically creates a VPS, sets up mm2 on it, and talks to it as if it was running on the device itself. now, the user's mobile phone doesn't need to be online all the time and it won't need those sounds :D

but, this feature isn't a priority right now and it might be a long time before we see it
