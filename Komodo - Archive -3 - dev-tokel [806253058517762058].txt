@pbca26 Audo has made us this channel to chat in üôÇ


[02-Feb-21 12:07 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
@dimxy We can also test the tokens v2 in here so it doesn't get lost in the dev-general

I'm happy to help with testing tokens v2 sometime this week. I think I saw it was added to research branch correct?


[02-Feb-21 12:43 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
That's correct, dimxy was finishing up some additions to the assets CC v2 though. Hopefully they are pushed within the next few days and we can create a test chain

yes, tokens v2 testing i'm interested in.


[02-Feb-21 11:46 PM] dimxy#2587
yes i am finishing with assets module v2 (with the support of improved lib cryptoconditions). The assets module provides ask/bid rpcs for tokens trading

https://github.com/pbca26/sec-wallet/releases/tag/v0.0.2
this app is a bit dated, circa 2018
however it has full tokens rpc support (native)
i've tried to collect all issues and limitations in release description
let me know if you find anything else
chain is WSB since it's really small and doesn't take forever to sync

@daemonfox yeah, this was covered in a tech tuesday back in 2018.  @Jcharming @Audo are the tech tuesday articles going to be brought back for the komodoplatform blog or something?

if not, can i get a copy of them to republish on my blog?


[04-Feb-21 09:44 PM] Mylo#8306
the tech tuesday articles pretty much cover tech innovation that will be relevant for the next 3 years still


[05-Feb-21 01:12 AM] Audo#5667
hey @Mylo , I will ask and send. Indeed they are no longer online. I think we didn't import all content when we migrated to Ghost CMS.


[05-Feb-21 01:16 PM] Jcharming#2693
As far as I know the import is still happening - we're just cleaning, preening, and updating all the articles as they come in and adding in branding/SEO optics to get a boost @Delton Can I get some confirmation this is generally (although slowly) the process we're in on this?


[05-Feb-21 02:21 PM] Delton#2644
Yes, I've started adding the old blog posts to Ghost CMS.


[05-Feb-21 06:09 PM] Mylo#8306

So anyone want to provide a simple and clear explanation for this channel so we can pin it for people coming by? Preferably with links to resources.


[06-Feb-21 02:23 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
@Regnar we are polishing up the Tokel paper and will release it this week. I will grab a synopsis of that and put it in here :)

Basically this is an open development channel for the Tokel project (we are making a bridge bot to link it with our development channel). Tokel will provide an easy to use token platform using existing komodo technologies.


[06-Feb-21 10:33 PM] NutellaLicka#4241 (pinned)
```Tokel is the Komodo ecosystem token platform. Tokel will provide a solid foundation, using existing Komodo Technologies, for token projects to launch and succeed from using end-to-end token solutions for fixed supply and non-fungible tokens. This channel is used to discuss Tokel development efforts.```

So is this about the nSPV Token v2 I've been reading about? which I assume is creating tokens without using a full node, just using an nSPV client?


[07-Feb-21 06:24 AM] jorian#4555
that's an important goal yes


[07-Feb-21 01:37 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
We are developing an application that will be nSPV and provide users with not only a coin wallet, but a token wallet, tokendex and NFT marketplace (all-in-one).

[19-Feb-21 02:31 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I mean what makes those NFT worth so much? Some arent from renown artists


[19-Feb-21 02:31 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
is it all just hype / reddit posting etc?


[19-Feb-21 03:01 AM] gcharang#6833
it's mostly hype. but, nfts  can have real value in the sense of bragging rights. like owning one of 50 limited edition watches released by a famous brand.

or a person can display their support to an artist in a provable way. say, artist releases 10 digital art pieces and creates an nft for each of them. sells them to supporters. 
supporters get:
1) satisfaction of supporting the artist
2) ability to prove said support
3) immortalization of such support on blockchain

I don't think many nfts go for these particular characterstics


[19-Feb-21 03:11 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Ive got a stupid idea, but I think it might just work

How awesome! Thank you KMD team for allowing the discord bridge bot. Also, thank you goes to @sclear for creating this bot, and all of the tipbots in the community!

We now have a direct bridge between the Tokel and KMD discords through the #deleted-channel & #dev-tokel channel, respectively. 

For those that haven't been in the Tokel discord, we have launched the Tokel Test chain and have been testing CCv2 with dimxy. If you'd like to get up to date on what has been done, I'd recommend joing the Tokel discord and having a read back in the chat.

by assetsCC do we both understand tokenbid/tokenask rpc?
i am going to adapt TonyL's tui tests for those rpcs to cover as many cases as possible and also make load testing (I hope on the next week I can spend time on this)
could you share your general roadmap so I could know what you need

@jorian I was just chatting with @dimxy about the evalcode and NFT data fields. These were his thoughts:
```I also was thinking about not a json format but something else, maybe ASN.1, to make it more compact and consistent to other data (f.e. cryptoconditions are encoded as ASN.1). Or we could encode it simply as a set of pairs <id1><url><id2><something>..., using bitcoin script format.
This is also less length constraint dependent as a json object encoded as a single vector of bytes is limited by 520 byte.
So the set of pair structure would have that limit just for each element in a pair```

It's not easier for humans. Its more efficient data storage.

Eg 80 05 02 03 37 37 37

80 may represent some key, eg TokenName
05 is length of this token name
02 represents the next value is integers
03 represents the length
37 37 37 is the value, "777" as hex/integer digits

It's 7 bytes in length instead of

yes there is
you can either use this url and replace the address with another one http://explorer.komodoplatform.com:20000/tokens/address/RTWtxY7GTBZ3zL8jfzyWWz1fveF3KXKBF8/WSB or simply use the search bar at the top
it runs a search through address holdings while you're in tokens section of explorer

sounds interesting
this will solve a case where a creator wants to sell multiple copies for example
with current code base one needs to create multiple nft tokens to achieve similar result

If people want to create a set of NFTs, it can be done through the creation of normal tokens, but each token is fully fungible with the rest, I.e they are not number 1/100, 2/100, etc. They also do not have the ability to add anything to the data field when creating it.
If the creator wants to create a numbered set, they would need to individually create many NFTs. Which can be done via a GUI. The ID section of the data field can be used to signify the individual number of the NFT, I.e 35/50, 21/50, etc. That way, although each NFT represents ownership of a single thing, there are a verifiable number of other copies

[30-Mar-21 03:42 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
@dimxy I have a few questions/points about the assetsCC.

‚Ä¢    It doesn't look like tokenv2bid & tokenv2ask are filling each others orders. Is this supposed to be this way? I.E if I put up an ask order for 1 token at 5 coins, can somebody make a bid order for 1 token at 10 tokens, and it not fill the ask order.

‚Ä¢    When conducting a fillask/bid, the initial txid (ask/bid) changes and function code from s to S. In the documentation it reads:
```    A lowercase b describes an bid offer.
    An uppercase B describes a bid fill.
    A lowercase s describes an ask offer.
    An uppercase S describes the ask fill.```
But as stated, the s (ask offer), turns to an S (ask fill), even if somebody only fills 1 out of 50 in the ask offer.

‚Ä¢    If 2 people conduct a fillask/bid RPC at the same time (in the same block), who fills it?

‚Ä¢    Fillask/bid RPC's allow for a partial trade amount (i.e 1.1/2/3/4/5) but it seems to round down. E.G If you put a 7.99 bid order, it only buys 7 tokens, not 8.

‚Ä¢    Do all assetsCC bid/ask/fillbid/fillask orders require a tx fee?

[30-Mar-21 04:11 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
indeed, token2bid and token2ask are just offers and do not fill each other. To fill each there are either token2fillask or tokenfill2bid respectively.
A token2fillask, if it fills only partially, creates a new order for the remainder (with 'B' funcid)

> If 2 people conduct a fillask/bid RPC at the same time (in the same block), who fills it?
the tokens or coins on an order are stored on the 'shared' address to be able for anyone to ask (or bid).  The winner is the one which could send a fill tx first and then this fill tx is added to a block. The second sender will receive a error or his tx will be removed from mempool because of 'missing inputs'

> Fillask/bid RPC's allow for a partial trade amount (i.e 1.1/2/3/4/5) but it seems to round down. E.G If you put a 7.99 bid order, it only buys 7 tokens, not 8
yes it uses an integer function to parse this param so it just drops the fractional part (we can add check to warn that integer should be used in the param)

> Do all assetsCC bid/ask/fillbid/fillask orders require a tx fee?
every tx requires a small txfee, tx with no txfee at all might be stuck in mempool

So the person to have the first tx fill the request gets it. Is it possible for 2 fill tx to be in the same block? If so, what happens?

most probably the one who has sent his tx first will fill the order, the second will likely get an error because the order has been already spent by the first one. Two txns in the same block are possible but only if the first tx spends the initial order ('s) and the second tx spends the new order (for the remainder, 'S')

Do we need to get a total balance for several tokens. One token might represent one asset, like stock shares another token maybe some commodity? It was supposed for each token there is its own balance

We have hard forked TKLTEST with the new params listed below, to incorporate the new evalcode for NFT data validation.

Please use the repo/branch: <https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/tree/test-eval-nft>

Start Params:
```./komodod -ac_name=TKLTEST -ac_supply=1000000000 -ac_reward=10000000000 -ac_decay=77700000 -ac_halving=525600 -ac_cc=1 -ac_ccenable=224,243,245,246,247,228 -addnode=51.38.124.215 -addnode=94.130.38.173 &```

Regarding royalty implementation in assets cc (to allow the token owner to receive royalties from each token sale), here is a couple of questions:
1) It looks like we should store the royalty percentage somewhere in token data (where name and description is stored)
We can't simply add this to tokenask as we will lose this param after the token is transferred somewhere.
The only way to check royalty in tokenask/bid is to have it in the initial tokencreate tx after the basic 'name' and 'description' (the other way is NFT data, but then we could not have royalty  for no-data tokens)
2) who will pay the royalty buyer or seller? that is, should the buyer pay askprice+royalty or royalty will be deducted from the askprice (same for bids: when the bidder locks coins to buy tokens, should he lock bidamount+royalty or royalty will be deducted from the bidprice?
3) what to do with the initial sell when the owner sells a token or the owner fills a bid. If the buyer pays askprice + royalty then the owner will get more actually. Then it seems logical if the seller pays the royalty - then it would work all right for the owner sale (or we maybe need a special case for owners sales)
4) as a caveat, anyone who wants to by pass this royalty might organise off-chain sales (without tokenask/bid api)
5) I think it is better to store royalty as integer fraction of 1000 (because we can't use floating point in consensus - this is platform dependent) so royalty could be from 0.001 to 0.999

1. I think we will not want/need the royalty feature for non-NFTs. So the data could be stored in the data section. Royalties are about creators of NFTs gaining value and a benefit from the on-selling of their work. Not specifically for fungible tokens.

2. I believe the cost should always be worn by the Seller (similar to most market places). The buyer always pays the exact price that is listed. The seller can set their price, and the % should come out of that price. If the seller wanted to sell it for 100 TKL, but it had a 1% fee, maybe they would just set the price as 101 TKL.
If it is a bid price (somebody offering an amount of TKL for the NFT), the royalty is still worn by the seller. I.E bid price is 150 TKL with a 1% royalty. The seller then fills the bid, the buyer pays 150 TKL, and the seller gets 147.75 TKL and the creator gets 2.25 TKL.

3. If the owner is selling, the code would still be the same, and the cost still worn by the seller (I.e ask price - royalty) but the royalty gets sent back to the original address, which happens to be the same as the sellers address. 

4. Yes that is a good thought, if people transfer the token, there is no way of enforcing the royalty because a transfer isn't a medium of value exchange, it is a one sided exchange (there is no buy/sell on chain and 1 person receives the NFT and the other person loses the NFT). It will simply be a known limitation because they arent using the 'dex' to transact the NFT.

5. Sounds like a fine plan to me. So people can set a 0.01 to 99.9% royalty fee (where the royalty is the % of the sale/ask price)?

Maybe that can then act as a feature for the evalcode specifically. If you want to use royalties, you must use the f7 evalcode to create your NFT's. 
With that being said, should we provide more flexibility to the NFT data. Currently its ID:URL only. This will increase to ID:URL:Royalty%. Should we also add a section for arbitrary data? So ID:URL:Royalty%:ArbitraryData

Yeah we have the option of having the NFT data contain completely arbitrary data (evalcode 00). I was specifically talking about the evalcode f7 which is (in my words) the 'Tokel Standard 1' on chain validation that will have the fields I mentioned above. I think we all agree the arbitrary data section should go into that one as well for further data capture.

This relates to a usecase for NFTs.  Selling signed version of valuable comics.  Person thinking to include an NFT with physical comic. Something to prove authenticity of the sig/comic.
Could someone pls give me a quick rundown on NFT status?  Will look, but no joke about having to much on my plate atm.

I believe I have finished with the royalty feature (it's in the test-eval-nft branch).
The royalty should be in the NFT data as 'compact size' param with id=3 from 0..999, for example, for 999 it would be 03fde703.
Please note I added a version field (01) after the eval code in the NFT data  (for the case if the format may change in future)
All properties in the data are mandatory, so for no royalty it should be set to 0 (maybe better to make it optional...)
--
I added also a simple test to run tokenv2ask/bid in a batch. It does not have a gui params but you may set them directly in the file, if you like:
the test (src/tui/tui_assets_orders.py) requires:
- rpc1, rpc2 username and password for 2 nodes 
- tokenid (a NFT should be created before the run)
One node does tokenv2ask, the second calls tokenv2fillask, then the second calls tokenv2bid, the first calls tokenv2fillbid, so the token should return back to the first node.
The test package requires py slickrpc package to be installed.

> I think validating NFT data is something that should not be done in consensus  (@Alright)
I think maybe we need to consider that. Let me explain:
in the current token implementation when we add a non-null eval code as the 1st byte of the nft data, all token txns with this tokenid are routed to the validation code for that evalcode. This was planned for  _on chain_ apps that implement some logic directly in the chain consensus. For _off chain_ gui apps there is no sens to send all token txns to the cc validation, as the nft data is stored only in the initial nft tx (so it should be validated only once). So maybe we should consider always using 00 nft data for off chain guiü§î

@NutellaLicka i've added TKLTEST http://explorer.komodoplatform.com:20000/tokens/TKLTEST
i completely forgot about tokenv2 methods, now they're added in
tokencreate mempool transaction parser should work well for regular tokens
nft tokencreate transactions are parsed partially since data format is not concrete yet
when it's finalized i will update the code
there're a few things that need improvements, i will revisit them in future
now would be a good time to start breaking (testing) the explorer üôÇ

as if you have the token(or see someone else with it), you know the transaction where it was created and therefore all of it's data

apart from there being no reason to do it on-chain vs off-chain, any other reasons? if you do it on-chain, you increase the risk of 'hacks'? and doing it on-chain will increase chain sizes, probably

yea like let's say you have some NFT game whereas your NFT loses "health" each time it's transferred(just some arbitrary rule)

The chain logic would allow breaking the rule, but the UI would spot cheaters

yes, only if you don't do the logic on-chain that is. i think i recall you saying this too with kmdice (may it rest in peace), there were numerous ways to hack that chain and be a winner in all hands, therefore depleting the dealer

if you restart it use another name because any chain called "TKLTEST" now does not validate that logic until block 15200

I see, If we did that then we would have to delete the validation logic out of the repo. Or start the TKLTEST chain from the KMD repo that doesn't have that code. Either way it's a semi-pain

this is a quick fix to turn off old rules for the test chain, so we may not restart it when consensus has been changed

@dimxy The last NFT data explanation I have is:
```'f701fdffff0211687474703a2f2f6d79736974652e6f7267', where
'f7' - nft data evalcode (note: I changed it to F7 now)
'01' - code of field 'ID'
'fdffff' - value of field 'ID' in compact size format, 65535 (example of a big value) (format is here https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#Variable_length_integer)
'02' - code of url field
'11' - url length in hex (17 in decimal)
'687474703a2f2f6d79736974652e6f7267' - url value in hex (http://mysite.org) ```

Is it true that the royalty feature is `03` could you please explain the 1/1000 data format

yes, royalty is yet another field with id 03, it should be followed by the data in the compact size format (https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Protocol_documentation#Variable_length_integer)
The royalty value is represented as integer fraction of 1000, acceptable values are from 0 (no royalty) to 999 (max royalty of 0,999)

@dimxy do you have an example of a working NFT with royalties? i'm bumping into the following issue:
```
CC Eval EVAL_NFTDATA Error!: nft data invalid: could not unmarshal nft data spending tx 85bf1ca78b354b5f00007ff49c0008d000007ff49c000d400000000000000065
```
for this command:
```tokenv2create TEST 0.00000001 "test 123" f70133021168747470733a2f2f746f6b656c2e696f2f0364```
explanation:
```
f7 - the eval code
01 - id (can be arbitrary, i made it 51)
33
02 - url field
11 - length of https://tokel.io/ is 17 so 11 in hexadecimal format
68747470733a2f2f746f6b656c2e696f2f - hexified ascii
03 - royalty 
64 - 100 in hex

@pbca26 <http://explorer.komodoplatform.com:20000/tokens/TKLTEST> made a NFT, (owner RAur) but it shows it a bit weird. i used this as input: `tokenv2create TEST 0.00000001 "test 123"`

i noticed that _just_ doing a tokenv2orders doesn't show all orders. is that on purpose? so:
```tokenv2orders

```
and

btw, token balance 0 is correct because when you did tokenv2ask the token actually is moved from your address to a shared address to be later transferred to the buyer

I started a TKLTEST node on my laptop (when you asked about fillask tx) and I mined recent blocks, maybe that is why your tx was staying for some time unconfirmed (because I started my node after you sent that tx into mempool, so it did not get into my node mempool)

Just looking at the NFT data field, I believe the only thing we need to add is an `0x4` which is an arbitrary data field. Then we should be complete if everything works correctly.

here is my test that runs a series of tokenv2ask /fillask/cancelask/bid/fillbid/cancelbid rpcs
https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/blob/42dc4637d094911e2a073c84502601b91a43fc9a/src/tui/tui_assets_orders.py#L34
To run it you need to change rpc conn params (2 nodes are needed) and tokenid to your data
the test may print interim errors bcz txns are not mined at once so several retries are done. The test would cancel if all retries are unsuccessful

I found what's wrong with this tx -  it is spent by a tx in an orphaned block.
I need to fix CCgetspenttxid function usage (fixed this already in marmara), will fix this soon

no it is a normal situation when some blocks are mined concurrently
(I just recently added CCgetspenttxid check to catch spent asks/bids earlier, at the rpc level but forgot to add a check that the spents are in the active chain)

Royalties are looking great. This specific tx, I made the initial NFT, but I was buying it back off Jorian and the CC split my 4500 TKLTEST UTXO into 3 parts, the purchase cost (1800), the royalty (200 back into my wallet), and 2499.9998 (the change from the UTXO).

Then when I fill the bid, it comes out of the CC address, into my address (which is then split into the royalty part, and the rest)

A history would be worthwhile. This would generate a value in and of itself in the future. "I own an NFT that was owned by such and such"

it means looking at the active chain blocks. The function I use might return all the blocks, including orphaned, I need to add an additional check

Nice job @d4v !
I saw in your proposal that you will do donations to projects but you did not specify which projects. Some ppl listed projects but without amount, see list in #deleted-channel. Based on your interesr in tokel in our phone conversation, you could give to projects such as tokel, maybe chips, arrr ... Can you confirm ?
Our graphist friend Sparkee may do few drawings to do NFT for us üòç but we need to convince him about NFTs first ...

Yes I'am interested in NFT project but I still have to discover this technology. For now, I just contribute as I can, such as with this new explorer. But I will update my proposal and that's sure, I will give some donation to token project.

@dimxy we are trying to get this RPC working over nSPV (https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-api/address.html#getaddresstxids). Is it as simple as adding it to this file? <https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/blob/test-eval-nft/src/komodo_nSPV_fullnode.h>

TKLTEST default rpc port is 58492 (and nspv binds to the same port)

@NutellaLicka @daria I checked the code and did a test and found out that listtransactions nspv rpc works as we need - it gets data from the index (not from the daemon wallet as I thought - its name a bit misled me as that name on the komodod side indeed works with the wallet). Sorry for the wrong info, we may use listtransactions in the GUI for retrieving the history for an address

listtransactions returns the from the addressindex. If return additional data it would require to load each transaction, access block index - this would affect the rpc performance

@pbca26 The NFT data fields have bee solidified. Are you able to update the explorer code to decode them at all?
An example of NFT data is below:

The data field broken down:
```'f701' - NFT data evalcode (f7) and version (01)

'03' - Code of Royalty % field
'64' - 100 in hex (Value is represented as integer fraction of 1000, acceptable values are from 0 (no royalty) to 999 (max royalty of 0,999))

Awesome work!
Are you able to convert the royalty fee into a %? The value is 100/1000 in that example. 
Also, is there any chance you could hyperlink the URL field? In the future I see our application pulling the information from that field and showing it as well (graphics, gifs, etc)

Im not opposed to that, either that, or we create a fork for test purposes within the tokel organisation and give the appropriate people the ability to PR. This may help when other devs come on board, but also may confuse people as to why there is only a test repo and not a main repo (main repo will be held in komodo repo)

To be honest, Tokel was founded on transparency and open development. Im happy to keep the repo public and allow the community to discuss the development efforts

then maybe you could make an official tokel repo development only (however I think it might look unusual if there is an official repo for development and another repo for releases)

Yeah that'd be weird, we can make it clear in the documentation that the development occurs in the test repo and we PR upstream to keep all the tech within the Komodo tech stack

@pbca26 I have been playing with your explorer a bit. It is displaying some tx's incorrectly.

<http://explorer.komodoplatform.com:20000/tokens/3e54d1f345949815edb138c29ae81972dc96a47c5499804490b555a8b421b142/transactions/TKLTEST>

On your explorer it shows a huge number of tokens:

took me a bit longer than expected
let me know if you find any other issues
it's possible not all cases are properly handled but it should be better now

Dimxy has added a pubkey output on a token transaction (i am yet to look at this indepth). This will give the ability to see what pubkey sent you a token, and for the explorer to output that as well. It also opens up the opportunity for multi-sig addresses for tokens.

yes we store M-value and pubkeys in the OP_DROP, this allows to see dest pubkeys (and show them in explorer) and also allows to construct vouts for spending MofN. We actually borrow this approach from Verus code

please consider 'CCaddresses' not as true addresses but as destination identifiers (maybe good to point out this in the explorer).
A transaction with cryptoconditions must be created with an appropriate cc module rpc, never with a sendtoaddress or similar tool (which makes only simple P2PKH outputs but not cryptoconditions outputs).

you need to create one tx and send it to the chain and only then create the second tx and send to mempool. If you want both in one block you need to stop mining

Jorian and I are going to setup a new TKLTEST chain from the Tokel github repository version of komodo (<https://github.com/TokelPlatform/komodo>)

Once we have started the chain and are ready to continue public testing, we will release the start parameters (expect this to be post main chain launch). In the mean time, people can create their own smart chains using that repository for testing if they so choose to.

We have taken some of the testing out of the public domain as we have been testing specific main chain launch parameters and are keeping these private until we publicly announce chain launch. This is to ensure a fair launch.

During this private testing, a number of issues in the cryptoconditionv2 code for tokens/assets and have had to patch and retest these. I personally see this as a win for both Tokel and Komodo as we have given steam to the engine that is the Komodo tech stack and managed to improve significantly upon the technology that is available for others to use, whilst ensuring the Tokel main chain is provided with the best possible chance at success and minimising the risk of issues post launch. 

I appreciate that the chain launch date is far beyond what we initially expected, but I am glad we have been as diligent as we have been.

> why does tokenv2fillask allow for optionally setting "unit_price"?
this was originally enabled by the consensus code (made by JL, I suppose). It checks for 'not less' instead of exact match.
When we worked with redfox they suggested to allow this on the rpc level too

in fact there is no difference between NFT and fungible tokens.
an NFT is simply a token with value == 1

:bust_in_silhouette: Alright#0419 (Tokel, tokel-test)

:bust_in_silhouette: NutellaLicka#4241 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[23-Jun-21 12:41 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
I guess it came about because I wanted to change the NFT data section specifically. Then the royalty feature just went in there I guess

:bust_in_silhouette: NutellaLicka#4241 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[23-Jun-21 12:45 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
If we incorporate the data section into the create RPC, it could be something like:
```tokenv2create name supply "description" "URL" [royalty %/1000] [arbitrary data]```

Where the following are mandatory:
name
supply
description

Any of the following are non-mandatory (can be left blank ""):
URL
Royalty amount
Arbitrary data

:bust_in_silhouette: NutellaLicka#4241 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[23-Jun-21 12:45 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
The "ID" field would not longer be needed and creators would either add that into the description or the arbitrary data field

:bust_in_silhouette: NutellaLicka#4241 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[23-Jun-21 12:46 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
Or should we keep it as is? I.E within the [data] field, but just allow tokens with >1 supply to use this?

> so why do you prevent adding data to a token with supply >1
simply because it was developed in response to requirements. Initially fungible tokens did not need any data except name and desc, then NFTs were required with a data field. It seemed logical then that NFTs could be differentiated by their unique data field while having the same name

yes the api is always exposed
it's relatively easy but there's no one click installer for insight tokens changes
bits are scattered across 4 repos
there's one click installer for regular insight explorer though
with a bit of copy pasting it's possible to setup tokens explorer
otherwise i can set it up for you if you're able to share chain params

Actually I convert json to the old format.
The only thing I changed is the first byte of tokendata which means evalcode which is supposed to validate the token data. It was set to F7 earlier and now I have changed it to 00. 00 means that the token cc checks the token data itself. Not-null values are reserved for cases when additional cc modules check tokendata

Oh right. So how would one add arbitrary data, instead of the evaluated data of the Tokel Standard 1

:bust_in_silhouette: NutellaLicka#4241 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[30-Jun-21 10:40 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
As in:
Tokel Standard 1 = `tokenv2create name supply "description" '{"url":"http://some.org/",  "royalty": 10, "ArbitraryData":"01a0bbccde"}'`
Arbitrary Data = `tokenv2create name supply "description" 'Any data format I want'`

:bust_in_silhouette: NutellaLicka#4241 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[30-Jun-21 10:40 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
Or would arbitrary data look like this
`tokenv2create name supply "description" '{"url":"",  "royalty": , "ArbitraryData":"01a0bbccde"}'`

:bust_in_silhouette: dimxy#2587 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[30-Jun-21 10:55 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
I made it this way:
`tokenv2create name supply "description" '{"url":"http://nam.org",  "royalty": 99, "arbitrary":"01a0bbccde"}'


[30-Jun-21 10:56 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
:bust_in_silhouette: dimxy#2587 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[30-Jun-21 10:56 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
so now it is now allowed to add unformatted data. The default format is based on url, royalty, arbitrary fields


[30-Jun-21 11:01 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
:bust_in_silhouette: NutellaLicka#4241 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[30-Jun-21 11:01 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
We would still want the ability to put in unformatted data though


[30-Jun-21 11:10 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
:bust_in_silhouette: dimxy#2587 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[30-Jun-21 11:10 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
then we probably still need evalcode in the data. Null-evalcode would mean totally arbitrary not validated data, non-null evalcode would run the data over some cc module

:bust_in_silhouette: NutellaLicka#4241 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[30-Jun-21 11:18 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
Yes, which is fine and we have discussed before. We need to give the option of completely arbitrary data.

:bust_in_silhouette: NutellaLicka#4241 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[30-Jun-21 11:20 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
Tokel will give people the option to follow a data standardisation (url, royalty, arb data), but if a specific use case doesn't require that, and they want something else, they should be able to create that.

I also acknowledge the royalty feature will be specific to the Tokel Standard 1 data validation

okay then the tokel format will be bound back to evalcode F7

@dimxy what is disabled through the dust disabled mechanism? Could you outline how it stops spam tx?

:bust_in_silhouette: dimxy#2587 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[01-Jul-21 11:47 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
without dust disabled anyone could create a non-cc tx with millions of zero-outputs and spam the chain.
For cc outputs this is unlikely as we control most of cc outputs in the validation code (amounts and number of outputs)

Is the difference between these RPC that you aren't required to put in the first byte of data for `tokencreatetokel`, it is automatically an F7 (Tokel standard 1)

you may wrap {} with apostrophes 
or quotes (but you also need to escape quotes inside like `\"`

wrapping is needed if you call the rpc from the cmd line as {} are interpreted as special sympols
however you do not need wrapping if you call rpc from an app

for the nspv client it is safer if the client would parse data itself as the tokenv2info resutt is not signed and potentially may be spoofed while travelling on the net

`getrawtransaction txid 1` or `decoderawtransaction` return all tx data decoded. To decode further tokel data you need to parse the last opreturn vout
(I sent a PR with tokenv2infotokel rpc)

I'm still getting:
```error code: -26
error message:
16: bad-txns-premature-spend-of-coinbase```

Is the daemon trying to spend my immature balance?
```  "balance": 100000406.10593609,
  "unconfirmed_balance": 0.00000000,
  "immature_balance": 96.00000000,
```

This is caused by the 100 confirmation coinbase maturity that is put on by default with ac_eras

i can see you did not escape quotes:

Very small thing, but the id shows before the URL as in the creation command. Does this matter? I'm not really sure it does
``` "dataAsJson": {
    "id": 69,
    "url": "https://tokel.io/roadmap",
    "royalty": 100,
    "arbitrary": "54686973206973206120746573742068657820737472696e6720746f20696e636f72706f726174652061726269747261727920646174612e"

:bust_in_silhouette: dimxy#2587 (Tokel, tokel-test)

version 1 means token data structure version (in the opreturn)
IsMixed = yes means using cryptocondition v2 aka 'mixed mode' that is in the condition both fingerprinted and non-fingerprinted subconditions (exposed evalcodes) are used

Hey üëã  Sorry I wasnt following discussions in here real close so I could be asking duplicate questions. It is just sooo much to read through üôà  

```

  },
  "version": 1,

What is the difference between `description` and `dataJson.arbitrary`? Or is arbitrary data encoded description?

> What is the difference between description and dataJson.arbitrary? Or is arbitrary data encoded description?
the description is a string description in addition to the token name, the len upto 4096 chars. The arbitrary may be formatted as needed. No check for its len however the whole opreturn tx data is limited to 10k

it is a reserved field, we are not going to use it in tokel (afaik). But if you need you could format whatever data there, for example a not a big json or serialised C++ structure or else

the arbitrary field should be properly formatted by the GUI and therefore checked by the GUI when it is read. But I agree it is a bit embarrassing when some field formats are defined and others are not. If we want all the data are checked on the chain level we should consider adding new validated fields by a hardfork

Hey @acnebs we were having a discussion yesterday here on the NFT data validation. There is a field in the json above https://discord.com/channels/774497890025472010/814771024696442880/863383543195500564, `dataAsJson`.`arbitrary` which is allowed to have any type of data in it with no char limitation. However there is a limit on the whole object not to be longer that 10k, so a lot of chars to fill in with artbitrary if you want. So my concern is that coz its arbitrary it can be misused against us, ppl can enter antyhing there, it is not validated on the blockchain side.  Of course we will validate it on our side but still, a wild field seems a little scary. What do you think about that? Am I being overly paranoid? I just wanted to hear your opinion on this as well coz I know you have done some security before.

Now may be as good a time as any, but there is also another token data input that is completely arbitrary. It doesn't require any ID/URL/Royalty/Arb Data. It can be completely arbitrary. The format of ID/URL/Royalty/Arb data is a specific evaluation code that runs on chain if you tell it to (with the F7 evalcode).

@dimxy can you plz tell me what am I doing wrong? I am on tokel komodo repo, started the chain and trying to create a test token now.

```
test@ubuntu-s-2vcpu-4gb-nyc3-01:~/tokel-komodo/src$ ./komodo-cli -ac_name=TKLTEST5 tokenv2createtokel Ticket 1 "Ticket token"
{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "cant find normal inputs"

this just means you do not have sufficient satoshis for tx fee and to create token outputs. 'normal inputs' means ordinary not CC inputs

@dimxy In relation to assets, if I was to post an ask/bid order, then subsequently take my node offline, what happens to the order? Can it still get filled?

Awesome, so you can post ask/bids and not require a node online. This is great. Do the orders time out after a certain period of time at all?

no they are not expired (this needs to be added yet) 
however the creator can cancel it at any time

[13-Jul-21 12:49 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
we discussed this but did not decide how to implement this (auto cancel orders? disable to fill after expiration time?)


[13-Jul-21 01:01 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
:bust_in_silhouette: NutellaLicka#4241 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[13-Jul-21 01:01 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
Auto cancelling would work the best. This way, they are off the block chain (stops clogging up the blockchain with old orders that may never be filled due lost wallets or whatever scenario).


[13-Jul-21 01:07 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
:bust_in_silhouette: dimxy#2587 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[13-Jul-21 01:07 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
auto cancelling could be implemented like that: for any node it is allowed to close an expired order (for some reward taken from the order amount)


[13-Jul-21 01:08 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
:bust_in_silhouette: NutellaLicka#4241 (Tokel, tokel-test)


[13-Jul-21 01:08 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
So it requires somebody to conduct an action to cancel the order? It couldn't automatically occur at a set block?

[13-Jul-21 01:13 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
an order is a transaction in the chain so to cancel it someone needs to spend it, we could allow to do this with a shared key (so anyone could do this), but it needs to be some node(s) periodically trying to find such orders and cancel them for a reward

@dimxy just want to make sure I understand some stuff correctly. Token can be trasnferred using the rpc `tokenv2transfer` and tokens can be swapped using DEX functionality too right? So when I buy an NFT,  I swap any coins, e.g. bitcoin for the NFT itself. Is that how it works?

[13-Jul-21 01:42 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
You can transfer the tokens as you would with a dollar. If I hand you a dollar bill and receive nothing in return, I have transferred you a dollar. 
If you use the DEX (assets) RPC's, I can post my table for sale at x price. If you see my table listed for sale (public order book on chain), you can purchase right then and there. When you do that, your dollars are taken, the chain recognises you've sent the dollars, then the chain sends you the table and sends me the dollar.

[13-Jul-21 01:44 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
You can also walk past my house and see my table and really really like it. You can then publicly post on the order books on chain "Hey I will pay 1 dollar for that exact table". If I hear/see this (your bid), I can say, hey you know what, I will sell this table for 1 dollar, and send my table over, in turn receiving the dollar.

The assetsCC RPC's only allow you to transfer Tokel (the native blockchain coin) in exchange for tokens, and vice versa

Probably as she had just connected with my node. I started mining shortly after her, so I guess I orphaned all of her blocks

:bust_in_silhouette: dimxy#2587 (Tokel, tokel-test)

she could build a subchain of several blocks that later becomes orphaned if she was not receiving or sending the mined blocks

:bust_in_silhouette: dimxy#2587 (Tokel, tokel-test)

no any connection issues in Daria's log, normal block updates are logged.
I think while the difficulty is low and new nodes just entered several nodes may mine blocks concurrently more often

I think it has been already mentioned above but I am not sure what the result was. Is there an auction system on the chain? I have added it to the design but I am not sure if we have it and how it works.

@dimxy or @NutellaLicka or anyone else?

We will need to either build upon assetsCC (doing so allows other projects to build upon the on-chain logic), or build this logic into the app (broadcasting the intent to sell and allow people to bid, not sure)

No I think in the explorer, people should be able to place bids on tokens. The token owner should then have an output within their token wallet that shows how much people are bidding on that token

In the tokenDEX/NFT marketplace, people have the ability to place a `tokenv2bid` even if the token owner hasn't put it up for sale via a `tokenv2ask`

If somebody places a bid via `tokenv2bid` on my token because they want to buy it for 100 TKL, this should output in my wallet. When I am looking at my NFT's, it should show current 'bids' (`tokenv2orders tokenid`)

provide a raw transaction hex as an input

it outputs the tx hash. Then use `decoderawtransaction`
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TKLTEST5 decoderawtransaction 0400008085202f890300539d11df3ae27e67501ea989b918d7d347c0.......```

About the assets order expiration parameter
it will be stored in the opreturn (so the opreturn format is to be changed)
What should be the expiration value, timestamp or height, or like in the CheckLockTimeVerify opcode, we can treat values before LOCKTIME_THRESHOLD (500000000) as height and over as timestamps?

There is yet another suggestion, regarding the royalty.
Currently I have enabled dust checking on normal outputs (but not for cc outputs), to prevent spamming transactions flooding.
So it became potentially possible, if the royalty percentage too low, for tokenfillask/bid to be rejected from mempool when the royalty output drops below the dust limit on this node. I already added a check for some fixed dust value in the assets consensus (so if the royalty value is less than this fixed dust there should not be the royalty output at all. But instead maybe we could send royalty to a cc output (and provide an rpc for getting the royalty from this cc address). So we could remove that code from consensus and simplify it (it is not a good idea to check dust in consensus). Maybe I am too much concerned about the dust issues but better be safe

You've lost me a little bit here. Just so I'm understanding this, you're saying that if you set a really low royalty amount (but still above 0), you may not be allowed to sell via the tokenfillask/bid RPCs because it thinks you're doing a dust attack? 
What amount is the dust attack limit?

[19-Jul-21 02:46 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
if the dust check is enabled than each node would be rejecting transactions with very small amount. This dust threshold is calculated as `min-txfee * size-of-output` and typically is equal to 58 satoshi. But a node could change the min-txfee param and increase the threshold
I set this param in assets to 500 sat (in hopes that this would suffice), that is if the royalty output is less than 500 it is not created and the assets consensus allows the absence of the royalty output.  I am not happy with this approach.

for instance, if the unit price==0.001 coin and royalty fract == 1/1000 then royalty value==100 (and close to the default dust threshold). Should we be concerned about such amounts at all?

in a hypothetical situation when there is a spam attack and all nodes need to raise the min txfee threshold it might still exceed our estimated minimum royalty

I suggested doing this but only for cc outputs. Not sure if this is okay for normals though (maybe some third party gui apps may fail)

So the idea being if the validation identifies a dust transaction, they are required to pay a set tx fee? But if it's not dust, then they don't have to pay the set tx fee?

they are in the komodo code but do not touch the consensus part, so not affect the chain's functioning

As all nodes are eligible to provide to nSPV clients, this would require all nodes to update

basically for this moment I would like to add couple of helper methods to nspv protocol, to add remotely normal and token inputs to new token transactions (this is actually an optimisation to allow not to download all inputs on the client side, so inputs are selected right on the server side.
Also I could see that several locking calls are missed when chain objects are accessed from nspv server side, better to add them

- Please remind me what is the "id" for in the "dataAsJson"

- Yes, the token data is exactly the same for fixed supply tokens as it is NFTs. The fixed supply token can still have a digital image/URL associated with it. For example if somebody want to split their digital artwork into 10 pieces, they would create a fixed supply token that has a supply of 10. Each 1 of the 10 tokens then represents 1/10th ownership over the artwork/asset. 
- Yes royalty (and all token data) is the same for fixed supply tokens.
- ID is a field people can use for whatever purpose they need a numerical field for. For example, a creator could use it to signify their different collections. ID of 1 = the 1st collection. The next collection they create could have the ID of 2. So on and so fourth. It can be used however the creator wants to use a numerical data field, without requiring it to be put into the description or arbitrary data section.

Gotcha, though just to clarify in that example, each token is going to have a completely unique (and unspecified) tokenid, so it is not sufficient (using the blockchain alone) to determine that token 2 comes after token 1 in any way, except by looking that the same owner made both tokens. In order to make in actual "series" of works, you'd still need to use the arbitrary data field to have something like a `series` key

The creator would be able to publish all `tokenid`s of the series. It can't be assumed that an ID of 1 = the first series, no. But if the creator determines that, and publishes that, then it should be known to the people that are looking at that creators tokens

An example could be
ID=1
Arbitrary Data = {series: 1, total: 15, number: 1}

The properties of the series can be written in the arb data rather than taking up the description space

hey guys, i had an issue some time ago when trying to run the testchain. I realised it would be best to get a VPS to eliminat any problems regarding my homeserver and ip and so on. I installed dependencies and the setup of the environment went fine. I have a problem now when trying to start synching the chain. There is no ./komodod directort. is this an error on my part? Thanks for any help in advance

@dimxy @Alright @daria I'd like to plan this optional codebase upgrade that we will need for the nSPV updates. Is it a requirement for the apps token wallet to work correctly? If so, we should plan to roll out the update at least 48 hours before the token wallet release so that NN's can update at a minimum.
I also have another request if we can get it into this update, and that is that we make a `tokel-cli` command for people to use instead of having to write out the entire `komodo-cli -ac_name=TOKEL`. Is this possible to add in the next update?

> I'd like to plan this optional codebase upgrade that we will need for the nSPV updates.
I added a couple of helper rpcs to optimise finding inputs for transactions, this is not mandatory but I believe you wallet app will rely on them.
Also it seems listtransactions and listunspents rpcs need to add a max records param to improve pagination on the GUI side

@pbca26 I think there is an issue with tkltest api

https://explorer.komodoplatform.com:10000/tkltest/api/

`Error occured while trying to proxy to: explorer.komodoplatform.com:10000/insight-api-komodo/`

Could you please have a look?

btw for the RUXnkW5xrGJe4MG8B7YzM7YhuSoE44RVTe it would throw exceptions on the initial txids as their utxo values are greater than max integer in javascript (
`tokel issued satoshis = 100 000 001,12778960` and 
`max js integer is        90 071 992,54740991`)
Are we concerned with this (meaning we should change our js lib and use a bigint lib), or we could treat this address as a special case which would not appear in real work?

That is quite low, you can allocate more cores to it by `setgenerate true x` where x is the number of cores to mine. I can mine from my server, two secs

@dimxy so if I want to call `tokenv2list` via nspv, I can just call it in a similiar manner but with the name `tokenv2list`? 

```

  this._request('nspvBroadcast', txidhex, txhex, opts, cb)

no, because a majority of users would use `tokel-cli` because they won't be aware of `komodo-cli -ac_name=TOKEL`. But for those that do know (Notary Nodes & devs), they have the option of using both. I know keeping `komodo-cli` will be extremely helpful for NNs

ok, well as long as I dont have to cross check ids with the list of all tokens on the chain I m happy. In the other chat you said - `and verify its opreturn at least (I'll see how to add this in the js lib)`

Do you think you could please add a new call which will combine all that? it will basically be `getCCUtxos` and then it will only return the ones which are tokens, and can be called `getTokens`  or smth like that ?

yes we could add such a call as an optimisation, but you still need to verify the results on the GUI, because nspv nodes are _untrusted_ and could send fakes

we need to validate 2 parts:
- this tx exists in the chain. Notarisation checks makes this more confident
- this tx is a valid token tx (check token opreturn, check the output is the token output) - there should be a function for this on the client

strictly speaking this is a not fully secure way as tokenv2balance results are returned by a nspv node that may be fake or out of sync. that's why we are adding txproof and notarisations proof features on the client

I made my own TKLTEST node synced it with yours and it returns correct skipcount:0, your node still returns skipcount: 4294967295 for the exactly same request. Seems you should rebuild komodod. Maybe I messed with branches as I worked lately in a branch with tokeld daemon. I just have updated https://github.com/dimxy/komodo/tree/tokel-nspv-fix, plz try it

wondering if anyone here can help me... I've been trying to spin up the test chain for a few days and my linux machine just keeps crashing about 15 mins into the execution of ./zcutil/build.sh -j$(expr $(nproc) - 1) (I'm running linux mint debian edition on a 256 flash drive with persistence, it's the only distro that works ok on my antique macbook)

...is there anyway someone could help broadcast my transaction for me, ideally on the test chain first to check is all good and then onto the chain itself.... I can provide you with my wallet address so you can generate the publickey and also my tokenv2createtokel command so that you can generate the hex and then broadcast the transaction (on the testchain and then the main chain providing it's all good.

Do you have more than 4gb of ram? What build errors are you getting?

I can definitely broadcast the transaction for you. If you create and sign it, I can broadcast it.

my machine crashes during ./zcutil/build.sh -j$(expr $(nproc) - 1) so before I can even launch the chain or even get my publickey to run the chain with - so I need someone to generate my pubkey, run the chain, create they hex and then broadcast the transaction

Yeah 4gb is a minimum. I usually have a 4gb swap on my VPS as well. 

I cannot create the token for you. If I use that RPC, my privkey will sign the transaction and the token will be created by my address. I mean I could then send it to your address, but it'd always show that my address created it.

out of interest, when the GUI launches, what key will be signing users transactions? will the GUI/tokel instance create a key upon starting the application / creating a token? i'm guessing that running the app won't require each user to run the chain locally or on VPS?

The Tokel all-in-one dapp will use a javascript implementation of nSPV technology to create, sign and broadcast transactions. nSPV is a superlite client that can interact with full nodes on the network. You create and sign the transactions locally on your own machine, with your own private key, then broadcast that signed transaction to a randomly selected full node from the network. You can also request information from that full node (like address balances). This is done in a trustless fashion because it randomly selects any full node on the Tokel network, and the data you receive is verified against the notarized chain information; any information that is not validated against the notarized chain will not be used or trusted.

What this means, is that there is no 'tokel instance', and we have no servers or computers helping you create and broadcast your transaction. If you haven't tried the all-in-one dapp, I'd suggest you give it a crack. It is currently only a TKL coin wallet, but showcases how quick and simple it is to use (no blockchain download required).

You would need to set the node to mine via cpu with the `setgenerate true x` RPC, where `x` is the number of cores you want to mine with

You can use `setgenerate false` to stop mining

i'm kind of lost at to public key, private key, address etc. i'm using my tokel wallet address to get my public key with validateaddress command, but then I run the chain with my public key and try to execute a tokenv2createtokel command and I get {
  "result": "error",
  "error": "mypk is not set or invalid"
}

what is the ./komodo-cli -ac_name=TKLTEST importprivkey for? I don't recall getting a private key, I only got seed and password when creating my tokel wallet

You need to create a new address using `createnewaddress` then you can use `dumpprivkey` to find the private key to that address.

The private key is the cryptographic key that unlocks the funds for the associated public key (address). Whoever has the private key can use that address and any funds in it.

You can use whatever address you already have. You have to know the private key already and import it into the daemon using `importprivkey`

Yes the address will need the TKL in it. The `tokenv2createtokel` command then automatically takes those on token creation

I think it could be because in my PR some commits accidentally had nspv_msg flag defaulted to false, I noticed this and fixed in the most recent commits yesterday. Maybe you need just to update your node

Hey guys, im having some trouble with creating the tokens. I start the chain with the pubkey parameter and it seems to run fine, but when i use the tokenv2create command i still get an error(cant find normal inputs). I am using the example listed in the documentation: ./komodo-cli -ac_name=TKLTEST tokenv2createtokel "MyFirstNFT" 0.00000001 "This is the description field of an NFT."

Any idea how i could fix this? Is the command i am using to create the token wrong? otherwise the only option is that there is a problem with the pubkey i am entering

Hi, do you have coins on your pubkey? You need some to be able to create transactions

[20-Sep-21 09:44 AM] Discord Bridge#1463
i dont, i will try that. do i need the coins even when im just creating the hex code? if i understood correctly, the step im stuck with is before sending the actual transaction to create the token

It worked!! Thank you so much. is it the same for the "real" Tokel chain? i need to send some of the tokel i bought to the adress of the pubkey i use to create the tokens to generate the hex code?

yes to create a token you need at least amount of  10k+ satoshi to pay transaction fee and the token amount (it is 1 satoshi for an NFT)

hey @dimxy üëã  I am trying to call `getRawTransaction` from ccutils, but it says `method not supported` ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  
Also in the comment above the function it says - `Get transaction both in hex and decoded`. Is that what it does? if yes then thats great!

@dimxy 

Ok, so I have a question now. I want to get decoded transactions for a user. Right now if I get it correctly I will call `getTxids`, to get the ids, then I will call `getTransactionsMany` to get tx hashes and then I will call `decodeRawTransaction` on each hash. Is that the way to go? Is there a quicker way?

getTransactionsMany returns full transactions not txhashes
you could decode them like that:
`let tx = Transaction.fromHex(getxns.transactions[0], mynetwork);`

I think we should not modify Transaction.fromHex - it makes a transaction object with all existing tx data. this object is not ready for printing but it is needed for processing like modifying inputs outputs and sigining.
For printing we may add something like toString() function

I still need date, so blockheight or block hash or anything that can help me figure out date. Can I get block info somehow too?

is that block number? `expiryHeight: 41877,`?

i suggest I can extend getTransactionMany to return both transaction and something from the block (hash, height, timestamp)

üôå  that would be pretty awesome.

So I need this added to each output:

- txid,
- address
- scriptPubKey locked data info
- block timestamp

maybe we could create a new object type for printing TransactionDecoded (not based on Transaction), like a json with all the required data, with no methods (like what getrawtransaction rpc returns)? I am not sure that adding new properties to the Transaction would not break something in it

btw now all chain-related params are configured in networks.js (for each chain): seeds, magic, messages, protocolVersion etc.
so you need only to network in PeerGroup creation (no need to pass seeds etc - this all is taken from the 'network' object)

I was under the impression JS nSPV library is from Komodo Platform, developed by Komodo Platform developers + Tokel Developers, and it will remain common name to Komodo.

if you are talking about this?
```
  ccimp = require('cryptoconditions-js/pkg/cryptoconditions.js');  // in nodejs, use 'wasm-pack build -t nodejs'
  ccimp = require('@tokel/cryptoconditions'); 
```
You can see that now instead of having to manully compile a wasm file and have a dynamic reference to it, you can use a package which is already precompiled and much easier to use.

What we are doing here is using Komodo technology and collaborating together in order to make it accessible and usable for everyone. One of our main goals is High Usability. We want everything we work on and create to be easy to use by developers and non developers. By achieving that we will move the whole ecosystem forward not just Tokel.

Currently the js library needs that as it is still requires quite a high level of knowledge to manipulate and understand how it works. We publish it under Tokel for quick iterations and rapid development. We can discuss options if that is necessary, however I belive forking an open source library and publishing it is in alignment with open source technology as long as all the original authors are credited and licence is honoured.

Co-development efforts definitely need to be credited accordingly. Without Komodo, we wouldn't have the original library, without Tokel, this library may have stagnated (like it has for a long time before Tokel) and not become the beautiful product it is today and will become tomorrow. If we work together on something specifically for improving Tokel, whether we are writing the code, or ensuring it's usability via testing, then I personally believe there isnt a problem if we create a Tokel specific repo and brand it accordingly. As Daria mentioned, the credits will be listed appropriately, and the Komodo team have every right to have exactly the same repo but branded accordingly for Komodo. We will always give props to Komodo tech, as we have. We are a wider team and a mutually beneficial partnership, not competition üôÇ

@dimxy 
I am trying out those rpcs now: `tokenv2indexkey` and `getaddressutxos`. Is `getaddressutxos` the one that returns all the tokens that under the current public key, aka is that the function we talked about? Or is it an existing rpc I wasnt aware of?

The PR goes to TokelPlatform/tokel -b tkltest

There is no rush on the update as it is not a hard fork update. This is purely for the chains run from the `tkltest` branch (which I assume your app is).  (<https://github.com/TokelPlatform/komodo> --branch tkltest)

If it were a hardforking change, there would be much more notice given and a specific block time where people would need to update by. 

As this is the test environment/branch, changes will come when they are ready to be pushed and anyone using them for testing will need to update when they can, otherwise functions may no longer work, depending on the changes.

Hey @dimxy I am looking at the validateTokensV2Many function and I dont understand this line 
https://github.com/dimxy/bitgo-komodo-cc-lib/commit/ee7fff57432baa064f21788453dfbe2246b3df8e#diff-41c5bea47e4e5c2dda7f8eb6df9b0ad743f394c047cfb60024e3fb97c004493fR742

The problem I have with this is that outputs of the Transaction which are returned by `let tx = Transaction.fromHex(e.tx, mynetwork);` do not have txids in them. They look like this:

```
  outs: [
    {
      value: 600000000,
      script: <Buffer 76 a9 14 55 bb 0c 93 f2 79 e8 15 f9 b7 92 86 1e 2a 21 ad 18 a2 3f de 88 ac>
    },
    {
      value: 4399990000,
      script: <Buffer 76 a9 14 26 2b 88 c4 d5 3f ff 85 32 a1 6d fe e0 90 dd e8 7e 57 59 d7 88 ac>
    }
 ```

I am not  üíØ sure if its a bug or if I am doin something wrong. 

My code assembled from your samples:

```
  let ccindexkey = address.fromOutputScript(ccutils.makeCCSpkV2MofN(EVAL_TOKENSV2, [mypk.toString('hex')], 1 ), mynetwork)
  const ccutxos = await ccutils.getCCUtxos(peers, ccindexkey, skipCount, maxrecords);
  const validated = await validateTokensV2Many(mynetwork, peers, mypk, ccutxos.utxos);
```

validateTokensV2Many was meant to accept not tx.outs but the results of getCCUtxos (the 'utxos' nested object) - they are different objects

[07-Oct-21 11:32 PM] Discord Bridge#1463
the idea was that you get a utxo list and pass it to validateTokensV2Many which loads the txns for utxos and validates them as tokens

so on the exit you receive the validated utxos with added token data

the issue I have is that later after you decode it  `let tx = Transaction.fromHex(e.tx, mynetwork); ` you loop through outs.txids which are not there

for security reasons we should not trust the remote tokenbalance. We should getCCUtxos, validate tokens from the result and calculate balances.
For NFTs getCCUtxos 'satoshis' always equals 1

oh okay, so satoshis will show me how many of these tokens I got? I can have multiple utxos with the same tokenids, I will just add them up. Is that what you mean @dimxy ?

yes if this is a fungible token you need to sum all satoshis for the same tokenid|
if it is a NFT you would see only one satoshi for each tokenid

I remember I saw such things before in another client app.
The problem is that libnspv was originally designed single-threaded.
If need parallel calls support we need to extend the nspv protocol and add a correlation id for the request-response (to reroute responses to the proper callers in the same app)

All TKLTEST nodes, Non-Mandatory Update.

We have pushed changes specific to CLTV transactions and allow nodes to identify time-locked transactions. Please update and rebuild your daemons and restart your TKLTEST chain.

These are not hardforking changes but we need to test the changes prior to moving into the main chain.

@dimxy Hey üëã  After the last bitgo udpate together with chain update I seem to be getting for nSPV requests. Could you please have a look? To reproduce you can just try run the token.js sample. I wonder if there is something wrong with my node ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è  I will rebuild it in the meantime.

```

Is there a guide anywhere that explains how to get the Tokel airdrop for ledger users?


[03-Nov-21 10:35 AM] Regnar#6164
idk about a guide, but you might be able to access them with this <https://pbca26.github.io/hw-kmd-wallet/> not sure you can send from that though


[03-Nov-21 08:57 PM] tolken#2655
@Regnar thank you. It shows zero Tokel. Hmm, thought I would get airdrop.


[04-Nov-21 03:17 PM] Regnar#6164
You can also check your main KMD address from your ledger here <https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php>
