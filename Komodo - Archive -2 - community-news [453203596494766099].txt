I have created a new role 'Ecosystem Developer' for people who are building something on top of Komodo. I enabled few extra abilities such as 'change nickname' and 'manage emojis'. Hopefully you are able to change your name to include your project name now, and you can upload special emojis related to your project.

All ecosystem project owners can get this role.

If you have open positions or bounties available you can post them to our forum's Job section: https://forum.komodoplatform.com/c/jobs-bounties

We are trying to start utilizing our new Komodo forum more. We try to limit the number of channels we have here on discord and for the time being we won't make a separate 'job-offers' channel. Forum format should work a lot better in this case.

Good afternoon, I have received several questions regarding the possibility of adding AC to the services we are developing. Let me share some thoughts on it:

1 - Any AC needs to have people willing to buy or sell (orderbooks), which probably means there is people that beliefs in the product and has real market expectations, thus a buy-sell market comes to exist

2-  A market can be a centralized exchange (which involves listing efforts and trusting a 3rd party) or a DEX like Barterdex. Unfortunately BarterDex seems to be not yet ready to give a "granma friendly" experience. Thus creating enough "market liquidity" through BarterDex seems yet not a possibility. Other DEX's like the ones that trade tokens based in ETH already have acceptable liquidity pools, which means you can find acceptable orderbooks and volumes (kyber.network, oasis.dex etc)

3- For now, getting some liquidity on a KMD based Asset Chain means getting listed into a centralized Exchange, like Utruum has recently done.

That said , feel free to contact us regarding integrating AC onto our growing product portfolio

I'm confused


[09-Jul-18 09:37 AM] PTYX#6840
How will the AC be added to the service


[09-Jul-18 09:38 AM] PTYX#6840
Is it in an exchange capacity?


[09-Jul-18 09:51 AM] sergipcm#2275
How AC could be added to the service?

By supporting debit cards loaded by AC or  fiat gateway between AC - EUR/USD etc

To trade $PIRATE on a Central Exchange, the exchange has to do it Only via z transactions.
What are your thoughts on having $PIRATE coin trading on a Central Exchange?
Would you like to trade this MOST (I guess) Anonymous coin on exchange?

Copy from Verus discord by @miketout 

We've just announced the latest planned update capabilities in a tweetstorm that calls out Vitalik Buterin, and Zcash's Zooko to ask for criticism of our new solution that solves two theoretical proof of stake issues by using an enhanced crypto-condition contract, activating on October 28th, along with Sapling support. There's a lot in the Tweet Storm, and the last tweet is a link to our community's @Oliver Westbrook 's article on how the new Stake Guard capability works. Again, this is a major breakthrough and not only a solution to fundamental proof of stake problems, but also leveraging enhancements to the Komodo crypto-conditions that will be fundamental to our PBaaS work. We plan to release the newest version a little later this week after full testing. Verus Coin's upcoming release is an advance worth sharing!
Enjoy!

Apparently community is up; solving, testing and figuring solutions for KMDICE Assetchain. A pool is up. Explorer is there, and it got now significant hashrate too. I‚Äôd just call it a speculative mining.

CryptoRich interviewed me for his YouTube channel.   
We were happy to be on the show and we talked Pirate, Privacy, as well as short mentions of STAKED, VERUS dPoW and minng.
Yes I made a few technical mistakes, 2 were simply the nerves I think catching me off guard.  
Feel free to correct anything in the comments.

Hi,

I'm one of the many candidates running for election for KMD NN operator in the `EU region`.

I could really use your support and votes.

My proposal (node-9) can be found here: `https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/notarynodes/node-9`

Please send votes to me at this address,  `RBDivEArcb7aRsYTvtN5MRnaxeDAepSNmW`

and to other candidates who support the KMD ecosystem, and need votes, at the addresses that they post.

Thanks,

CrisF

Hello everyone :).
As some of you may already know, this year, I'm candidating for a node in SH region.
The past year has been very nice : I learned so much thanks to you all who supported me, it was really amazing.
So amazing that I try to contribute more and more, and to find ideas that could help the community. This led me to the creation of a project called Barterlly, and here's the true reason behind my proposal : 
I believe this app, and its future versions can be the starting point of something very useful for the community and help spread the word and attract users and devs into KMD ecosystem : Any dpowed assetchain / coin will automatically be listed on the platform (and all "derivative" ones yet to come ;) )

I won't go into tech details on this post, and will just wish you a good election time, but don't forget ! 

Support Barterlly, Vote for dwy ! : RKUV7wkP4yTR1suVYLicf4ZaooQzz8u5iR

Greetings,

I wanted to shoot out a message to members of the Komodo team and community to see if you would be interested in recording a podcast for my week long podcast series of the Komodo Project. 

I recorded a podcast with two Komodo team members several weeks ago and it was a big success. Many people contacted me asking to create more episodes and I would love to bring on anyone who is interested. Here is a list of topics I would like to create a podcast over, each topic would be its own podcast:

-Why Komodo is a better blockchain solution
   --Blockchain difficulties, scaling issues, problems Komodo solves, etc

-Antara
  --What Antara is, it's frame work, smart-chains, why its a superior solution, etc.

-Komodo economics
  --Token supply, POS, staking, price outlook, scarcity, etc.

- How to customize your blockchain
   --How its done, why its important, how business can adopt this solution, etc

-Blockchain Web app on AWS
   --How to use it, how business can adopt it, etc

PM me if interested or shoot me an email at drew@crusayder.com

Testing @utrumdotio again, here's a SWOT analysis of @PirateChain. I'm definitely a lover of ARRR but in making reviews it's important to be objective & understand where weaknesses are. Luckily many of these are already on Pirate's radar & progress is being made daily.

As most open source projects are ownerless and have no legal entity it can limit it‚Äôs options (App Store) or cause unwanted liabilities for developers (EtherDelta).  

To solve this we created the *Autonomous Software Foundation*. This (Dutch) non-profit acts as a publishing agent for projects facing these challenges.

So far we published Komodo ecosystem project *CoinCollect* (public beta wallet), the Grin community project *Ironbelly* (wallet) and we like to add many, many more.

We think open source and free software betters the world and deserves to have at least the same opportunities as their closed source cousins. 

Feel free to reach out to us (dm me) if you feel we can help a project you are working on and are passionate about. https://autonomoussoftware.org/we-can-help/

3 open positions for LABS notaries are up for grabs right now. Running a LABS NN is a great way to get started with blockchain development, basically forces you to learn. To get a spot, you must enter(and win) a provably fair "lottery". Deadline to enter is Oct 27 (1572202066). Inquire in #kmdlabs if you're interested. No cost to enter, just show you're competent or at least willing to learn.

edit: to be clear, this is for LABS notary positions, not KMD

We are looking to raise .8 BTC (we already have the devs on hand)! Please consider donating.

> the lead dev for this will be Radix, duke will assist if needed. 
> I2P is more decentralized. TOR uses standard a fixed directory of peers, while I2P discovers on the fly. Furthermore TOR is fixed to 3 relays and I2P can be configured to use the amount of relays (tunnels) you deem suitable for your safety. TOR communication is 2-way, I2P uses one-way tunnels, increasing the security.

We are starting the new TV series with the title ‚ÄúNew World Economy‚Äù sponsored by Komodo Turkey. Anyone has experience in preparing a generic introduction video to start each program? We had a TV program several years ago. I Show that just as an example. You can put Komodo related images whereever possible. You can contact me for the theme.

@here I have been busy developing the next version of subatomic GUI Shurli.
It already has the first Proof of Concept version which has been ready for a while for Linux and Mac OS, except for Windows which was being troubleshooted for issues. I'm hoping Windows version will be working soon.
I did invite some people to fill the form and show interest if anyone wanted to test the so far PoC version, for which only about dozen of users signed up and only about 8-9 had keybase account to get invited.
And after being invited, I did not receive any feedback since much of them wanted a Windows version to test, which we did not had.

So, either this shows people don't have interest in the project that I'm working on, or my approach of inviting people to test is wrong.

The purpose of the Proof of Concept (PoC) version of Shurli testing was to gather some feedback on the initial user experience so it may help a bit with the next version. Also, just to give a taste of what it feels like doing fast swaps of cryptocurrencies using subatomic tech.

So, who wants to test Linux and Mac OS version of Shurli? It is already there for a month waiting for it to be tested.
Hopefully will get some update on Windows soon enough.
https://medium.com/@satindergrewal/inviting-testers-for-first-poc-subatomic-swaps-app-shurli-d78a7aee58c3

I think I can try a little different approach.
Follow the instructions to setup and test Shurli from this repo:
https://github.com/Meshbits/shurli

And can give feedback in #meshbits channel in Komodo Discord. Would appreciate anyone's participation on it.

@everyone A new __non-mandatory__ wallet version 0.7.1-5 has been released. In this release a fix for an issue on testnet so a miner/staker can make a block with the large transaction edge case that will be accepted, where the previous release crashed. Testnet does not need to be reset for this wallet. Also several GUI issues have been addressed.
You will not need to reset or change your testnet folder to upgrade. This version is approved for, but has no changes for mainnet. It is, however, important for continued use of testnet. Thank you!

@everyone 
CHIPS will conduct a hard fork on block #6874120, occurring roughly on the 3rd of September. Thanks to @phm87, @SHossain and @sg777, this hard fork has integrated the Komodo technology, Adaptive Proof of Work.

Adaptive Proof of Work, otherwise known as aPoW, is not to be confused with Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW, another Komodo technology that protects CHIPS from 51% attacks!). APoW is a "variation of Proof of Work [that] allows a blockchain‚Äôs network to adapt to sudden and substantial changes in hash rate. " You can read more about aPoW in Komodo's blog post here:
https://komodoplatform.com/adaptive-proof-of-work/

After the hard fork, the mining algorithm will remain SHA-256 (and remains mineable by SHA-256 miners), but will now be mineable by CPU. A single CPU will have the power to mine and readjust the hash rate difficulty, post a difficulty stranding event (such as any miner with a significant amount of SHA-256 stranding the chain, causing poker games to come to a grinding halt) within a short period of time.

The reason we have decided upon using aPoW, instead of changing algorithms (which is unachievable as bitcoin & LN technology are core tech in Pangea Poker) is to give players the ability to mine the chain whilst they are playing a poker game. Along with normal SHA-256 miners, players, dealers and cashiers will be able secure their gameplay by allocating a CPU core to mining. It is in their best interest to keep the CHIPS blockchain moving along. Each poker hand played will be written, immutably, to the CHIPS blockchain, and any payouts and winnings processed on chain and used for dispute resolution purposes. The more players Pangea Poker has that are mining with a core of their CPU, the better protected the CHIPS blockchain will be from difficulty stranding.

CHIPS is protected from 51% attacks using KMD's dPoW.
CHIPS will be protected from difficult stranding using KMD's aPoW.
Players can play Pangea Poker knowing their gameplay and coins are protected by leading edge technology developed by the Komodo Platform team.

For all CHIPS miners, KMD NN's, explorer operators, exchanges and electrum server providers, please update to the repo below by the 3rd of September (don't be late, otherwise you will be on a hard fork of CHIPS).
https://github.com/chips-blockchain/chips

You can update your daemons now, as they are fully compatible with the current chain, and will automatically hard fork and adopt the aPoW technology at block #6874120 (3rd of September).

@everyone Announcing the non-mandatory (but highly recommended) v0.7.2 Verus Wallet mainnet release, including the most groundbreaking testnet the Verus project has ever released. We believe the technologies now on testnet hold the potential to improve and reshape the DeFi industry and beyond. There are truly so many new capabilities and blockchain firsts working now on testnet that I realize people working to get the word out to the world have a hard time adequately covering them all. People now have easy access to see for themselves on testnet and soon mainnet.


[20-Sep-20 11:22 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
Here are some new capabilities active on the v0.7.2 testnet that will be on mainnet in the near future after hardening and testing for worldwide, public scale of the world‚Äôs first actual DeFi integrated blockchain protocol. Even Verus testnet is a decentralized network with 50% proof of work, 50% proof of stake, worldwide availability, and is running the new Verus protocols that are being tested and hardened for mainnet. All currencies and assets on the Verus testnet have absolutely no value and may be reset at any time in the interest of testing for mainnet. To get a basket of Verus testnet currencies to try it yourself, just ask in the #deleted-channel channel.
* Multi-currency, fractional DeFi, currency launches and cross-currency liquidity integrated with blockchain processing and fees
* Reserve to reserve sends across any compatible fractional currency with query search for best choice (eg. BTC -> ETH, via VALU)
* System-wide queries for fractional basket currencies for arbitrage, investment discovery, or conversion bargain hunting
* Enhanced VerusIDs with Verus Vault technology
* Verus Fee Pooling technology A fee collection technology that strengthens, rather than weakens blockchain security as expressed by Vitalik Buterin with respect to ETH and ETH 2.0 (still not addressed in ETH). (https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/07/27/inflation-transaction-fees-cryptocurrency-monetary-policy/).
Verus Vault - Advanced Time Locking of Identities
On the new Verus testnet, we have introduced a capability we call ‚ÄúVerus Vault‚Äù, which both provides options for a theft-resistant workflow of identity management, but also enables many use cases from trusts to vesting schedules, to escrow alternatives, estate planning and more. The concept is simple, but the ramifications when combined with the already unique revocation and recovery capabilities offered by VerusID on mainnet are immense.

@everyone I just want to thank everyone running testnet and give people a heads up that we spoke to soon above. It turns out that the current testnet had an error that got in late in the process and wasn't fixed before testnet was started. As a result, currencies are not converting correctly on testnet at present, and we are testing a release that fixes those issues right now. We have also had reports that a few people have experienced some sync issues on the older version of the wallet on mainnet, which do not occur on the newer version. For mainnet usage right now, we recommend either upgrading to 0.7.2-1 or if you are running a pool, waiting until the 0.7.2-2 release tomorrow and upgrading then. For continued testing on testnet, we recommend waiting until the 0.7.2 release expected tomorrow. Thank you all for testing and quickly exposing these issues. That's what testnet is for, even though we would prefer not to hit these issues at all. Now that they are found and fixed, we look forward to more community testing and progress towards our mainnet release üôÇ

@everyone Announcing mandatory for pools and notaries, but not generally mandatory Verus node and wallet upgrade v0.7.2-2. While most of the changes in this release are focused on testnet, the mainnet support does include some synchronization improvements and a fix for the getblocktemplate API used by pools. The testnet will be reset, so if you are using testnet, you will need to clean out your VRSCTEST folder and get another basket of currencies or mine new coins. Any testnet IDs will also need to be re-registered. All features described on the previous testnet announce should work as expected with this upgrade. Thanks for joining in community testing and learning about this new technology! We appreciate all the use and reports to date and look forward to much more in the coming weeks before mainnet release!

DeFi will be used to enable renewable energy (and hopefully lessen climate change) and be monetized through energy web. People with solar charged BEVs and home energy powerwalls will be able to offset peak energy demands replacing expensive and polluting peaker plants. EWT will be used to make this happen.

@everyone over the past few hours a network split and likely some downed nodes at the same time seemed to cause two disconnected network islands on the Internet. one of the islands had a lot of hash power and moved it's fork forward. Once the networks reconnected, that chain was long enough that the daemons on it saw they were on the wrong chain, based both on chain power and notarization, and those nodes stopped at 1210690. We are still looking into the data to determine the exact cause and if it included more than just a network split. The network is now fine with all known main community nodes online and running well. Explorers are back up, and Electrums will be shortly. If you did not get onto the fork, you will likely be blissfully unaware that there was an issue and can carry on. If you did get onto the fork, your daemon will almost certainly have recognized the issue and shut down, requiring a bootstrap or resync, which will have you back up and running without issues.
The good news is that @Asher put a new boostrap script into the last two releases, and if you have 0.7.2-1 or later, you can use that script as the easiest way to clean and bootstrap your machine. The bootstrap scripts will fetch and install a bootstrap of the VRSC blockchain data into the correct location. If existing data is found, which in this case, it will be, you will be prompted to overwrite the existing data and cleanup, which will not touch the wallet.dat or VRSC.conf file. While this should not affect your wallet.dat, we recommend to back it up before any upgrade or bootstrap. Also, make sure to close any active daemons beforehand.

Linux/Mac Usage:
To install bootstrap in default data directory:
```./fetch-bootstrap```

If existing data is found in installation directory, a prompt will ask if the data should be overwritten. Press 1 for yes, 2 for no.

Windows:
Find and run: ```fetch-bootstrap.bat```hit enter, and follow the prompts.

@everyone There is a left over issue from the issues we had over the past couple days. Some people ended up with corrupted indexes as a result and those who did are getting stuck on block 1213553. If you are stuck on this block, you should shut down and do 1 of the following:
1. (fastest) bootstrap from https://bootstrap.veruscoin.io
2. (second fastest) restart your daemon with the -reindex command. this can take a significant amount of time
3. (resync from scratch) also can take a significant amount of time
The good news is that if you hit this, you are likely just stopped. Obviously, the bad news is that some people may still need to do something to get back up and running smoothly.
Update: it seems the block that looked like it was stuck is slowly being moved forward by someone, so it is currently at block 1213565. If you are on that branch and not up to date with https://explorer.veruscoin.io, please follow the instructions above.

@everyone We were notified by our community members about a VRSC/USDT trading pair on GX.COM. Community members have warned us, claiming that the GX.COM exchange is not legitimate and is a scam. The listing, even if it should turn out to be legitimate, has taken place without any interaction between the exchange and anyone we are aware of at all in the Verus community. Because of this, we have no factual information on how this particular exchange is run, if they are in any way legitimate, how they process withdrawals and deposits, or what they do with coins sent to their addresses. We have requested information of them, but they have not responded with any details, except a screenshot of their announcement that they listed VRSC.

**Verus users, in the interest of their own safety, are NOT recommended to use GX.COM for trading, depositing, or interacting with VRSC in any way at this time.** As the Verus project grows, we should all understand that scams, unfortunately, attempt to target every successful project in the crypto industry. At the same time, we are not making any specific accusations, as we have no factual information to do so, but we can in no way recommend the GX.COM exchange and encourage all community members to stick with exchanges that are respected in the community, communicate directly with well known community members, and are known to have provided good service to other community members in the past.
Thank you and stay vigilant.

[22-Oct-20 01:19 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
@everyone Announcing v0.2.0-beta-1 of the Verus Mobile application. Now with support for RFOX ERC20 token and an easy to use claim button to access and claim your migrated funds. 

This version includes the new capabilities and fixes.
- Support for RFOX ERC20 token

- Temporarily disables biometric login on Android

- Fix for QR scan handling of partial invoice and address URLs

- Add Claim button to RFOX send screen to claim migrated funds

NOTE: for Android users only of this version - We have debated the Android biometric support in use of the previously released version that enables that feature on both iOS and Android, On Android, the biometric login to the wallet is cached by the operating system, and when the phone is unlocked, this can cause the wallet to be opened and accessed via the cached biometrics. After some debate, we decided that this behavior does not meet what we would consider the level of wallet security we would want as our community gold standard. As a result, we have disabled biometric login features on Android only (iOS still has biometric login), until we add additional features in an upcoming version that will require biometrics to be used repeatedly without caching whenever you reload Verus Mobile. If you had enabled biometric login on the previous version on Android, we do not automatically disable it, but we recommend that you do so manually in this version to prevent anyone from accessing your wallet after you have unlocked your main phone screen.


[22-Oct-20 01:19 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
Migrated RFOX funds can be claimed on or after Ethereum block: 11127543, which is expected to be mined on October 25th. If you have ERC20 RFOX funds to claim, and the mobile wallet you are using has the seed that is the correct R-address from which you have funds migrated off of the RFOX blockchain, according to the RedFox announcements and guidelines, you will see a claim button on the RFOX ERC20 token send screen, which you will be able to press and your claimed funds will be deposited into your RFOX ERC20 address in that same wallet.

@everyone Announcing the NON-MANDATORY, highly recommended upgrade v0.7.2-3 for GUI and CLI, with the following improvements and fixes:
- (GUI) Easy, built in bootstrap option for new Verus installs or as a menu option to fix an existing installation
- (GUI) Adds support for the RFOX ERC20 token, but DOES NOT YET ADD THE NEW CLAIM BUTTON. If you need to use the claim button to claim ERC20 RFOX migration funds, use the Verus Mobile wallet announced above
- (GUI) Fixes an issue that may occur when sending Ethereum or ERC20 tokens that can cause the send to throw an error
- (GUI) Update to the node, elliptic library used for signatures to address a signature malleability issue that does not affect Verus, Komodo, ETH, or other blockchains, which do not use this Javascript library in their low level daemon, so we do not consider this a security update
- (GUI & CLI) Stricter updateidentity parameter checks to ensure that revocation and recovery IDs are registered, valid IDs on the blockchain before accepting the update
- (GUI & CLI) Fixes a rare issue in wallet synchronization for IDs that have been transferred between wallets in a specific combination of transfers and spends of prior outputs. In the cases seen, the wallet maintained some outputs as unspent, when in fact they were spent on the blockchain. We have seen a very small number of people hit this issue after transferring IDs between owners and/or separate wallets and having spent prior outputs on transactions that still have valid UTXOs to the ID. If you have encountered such an issue, this version will properly synchronize the wallet with a full rescan. If you have not, use of this version will prevent the issue from ever occurring.

@everyone Back in July, Bithumb Global offered to list Verus on their exchange for free, asking only for $50,000 of Verus to be used for promotions and giveaways when the listing goes live. All across the community, members stepped up and donated some small, some large amounts, and we were amazed at the breadth of participation. We've been in constant touch with Birhumb Global, working with them on the promotions they would do, videos that would be part of the announce, and ways they and volunteer members of the community would put those donated funds to use to have the best launch possible.
LAUNCH DAY IS HERE!
It is my pleasure to announce that today, 11-11-2020, Bithumb Global's listing of Verus in both BTC and USDT markets goes live at 9:00AM UTC! Deposits will open in one hour from now at 3:00 AM UTC.
In celebration of this launch, Bithumb Global will be giving away $50,000 USD worth of Verus (as of Nov 3rd), 140,000 VRSC in contest giveaways split between a trading competition, a buying competition, and a staking giveaway for all who join and participate on the exchange! Community marketing has also used additional funds for videos, articles, supporting awareness and co-marketing activities, and other efforts that will continue over time until funds are used to make this the best, top tier exchange launch ever for the Verus Project, its community, and all newcomers to our network! The Bithumb Global competitions will be offered as follows:


[10-Nov-20 06:11 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
1) Trading competition - You can compete to have the highest accumulated trading volume with a minimum of 4,000 VRSC traded. The top 1500 traders will get a share of 53,500 VRSC.
2) Buying competition - If you buy 500 VRSC or more and hold it until the buying competition ends, you'll earn bonuses in addition to your purchases of up to six percent.
3) On exchange staking competition - You can choose to lock your VRSC coins on the exchange for 30 or 60 days and earn up to an additional 30% by doing so.
For more details on each contest, check the Bithumb Global link at: https://support.bithumb.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360058904053
To join in all the fun, make your Bithumb Global account at https://www.bithumb.pro using the referral ID - **8jznat**, that's **8jznat** to buy, trade, and stake Verus on the Bithumb exchange now. The competitions are live when trading starts at 9:00 AM UTC! Don't miss your chance to earn your share of thousands of dollars of VRSC and having fun as you do!

@everyone CRITICAL FOR GUI, NON-MANDATORY FOR CLI v0.7.2-4 with world's first friendly-name zk-SNARK addresses for mainnet AND testnet
This release adds the following new features and capabilities:
GUI: Added RFOX claim button for migrated funds
GUI: Verus Desktop will not shut down daemons that it did not start when the app is closed.
GUI: Show details screen instead of blank screen, if there is an application crash
GUI: Added update notifier, which will automatically notify all GUI users of new updates as they become available
GUI: Critical security fixes
GUI: As a reminder, this GUI release also includes a first run and menu item to bootstrap a Verus full node, making setup easier
The following new CLI features are not yet included in the main GUI screens, but can be accessed via 'Settings->Coin settings'
`sendcurrency` can now use sapling addresses as a funding source for any transaction. **As of this release, `sendcurrency` is now a proper superset of Zcash's `z_sendmany`.**
An identity's z-address can now be referred to by appending :private to an ID. E.g "idname@:private". This form of z-address will also be able to be used on sendcurrency outputs. `z_getbalance` API will now also work with both friendly name private addresses and the wildcards below.
New wildcards on address source will be:
All transparent addresses (both R and IDs)
`"*"`
All R-addresses
`"R*"`
All i-addresses (VerusIDs)
`"i*"`


[13-Nov-20 05:51 AM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
sendcurrency will now be an asynchronous API that will return an operation ID, as z_sendmany does, and complete in the background. It will also have its status available through z_getoperationstatus.
NOTE: Due to the zero knowledge nature of z-addresses, a z-address is an endpoint in your VerusID which can be changed if you revoke and recover an ID, funds held on a private address or endpoint are not able to be redirected to the newly recovered ID unless you still have control over the z-address itself. Transparent funds controlled by an ID are recovered when the ID is revoked and recovered, even if you have lost the keys. This is a fundamental limitation of zero-knowledge privacy, not an error and not something to be fixed. Please consider this when using friendly-name private addresses as funds and not just message endpoints.
The Verus DeFi Testnet -- THERE IS NO TESTNET RESET
All new 'sendcurrency' features described above now work on both mainnet and testnet. In addition, testnet can source funds for DeFi features from private z-addresses as well. Again, use of these feature in the GUI is currently accessible only from Settings->Coin settings.

*About CHIPS*

CHIPS enables decentralised, peer-to-peer, trustless, on-the-blockchain, casino style games.

At the moment we are working on a poker game, which uses CHIPS and Pangea Protocol.

Our core focus right now is to make the game a multiplayer, hence there is no need to understand all the intricacies of the Pangea Protocol implementation and cryptographic details. If you like the job you can always study all of that in detail later.

*Requirements*
- Very good understanding of C
- Preferable love and interest in blockchain
- Good communication (you talk to the team, you explain what you are doing, you plan your work, you make GitHub issues, etc.)
- Interest in the CHIPS project
- Full-time/Part-time (at least 15-20hrs a week)

*Task*
- The main task at the moment is to make sure the backend can handle multiplayer games
- The work includes working on C code to adjust the game to work as a multiplayer, coordinate with the GUI developer to make sure it works smoothly together
- Fix a couple of bugs when game freezes or throws Segmentation fault

*Interview *
- Check the source code and issues and make an estimation on how long will it take to make the game a working multiplayer. Corresponding GUI which consumes the API is at <https://github.com/chips-blockchain/pangea-poker>

*Money*
- Renumeration will be discussed with the candidate one on one

@everyone
People in discord may have received a message from **Veruscoin News ** or similar accounts
This accounts sends Direct Messages to people informing them of a mandatory wallet update.
The links in the message refer to **FALSE** websites that are not Verus.
***DO NOT CLICK THOSE LINKS***
The user has been reported to Discord and to the website hoster

**Verus will never send direct messages to update your wallet**
The official wallets can be downloaded through our website and verified through the **VerusID** tab of the current wallet.


[10-Dec-20 12:06 AM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
@everyone The DM spam attack that happened this week emphasizes the need for the community members to verify the downloads. All officially released wallets are signed by the foundation, which enables anybody that downloads a wallet to verify if the download and the content is legitimate.

The only safe way to upgrade your wallet is to download from a **trusted** location. Trusted locations are our website https://verus.io/wallet and our github https://github.com/veruscoin.
Even if you download from these trusted locations, is important to **verify** that your download is intact and release by `Verus Coin Foundation@` by checking the signature of your download in your current wallet (if you are running in native mode) or on our website https://verus.io/verify-signatures.
Unpack your download and open the `*.signature.txt` file to access the signature details. Select the unpacked archive in Verus Desktop or the website, add the VerusID from the `signer` field  and the signature from the `signature` field in the `*.signature.txt` file.
Only when Verus Desktop returns **SIGNATURE VERIFIED** or the website returns **IS VALID**, you have a wallet that is released officially and is safe to install

**New versions are *ONLY* announced in the Verus #deleted-channel  channel and in Verus Desktop itself**
**Verus will never send direct messages to update your wallet**

hi everybody, 

i've come to announce the immediate availability of our new (and improved) explorers: 

https://explorer.verus.io
- iquidus updated to latest release
- all external http resources removed
- BTC price displays correctly again; source is coingecko
- now with local instead of fixed GMT timestamps

https://insight.verus.io
- has been added as an option to the other explorer
- all external http resources removed
- price can optionally be displayed in USD; source is coinpaprika
- this one is recommended for mobile use

a note on the `insight-api`. should you currently be using the insight api at `explorer.vrsc.0x03.services` or `insight.vrsc.0x03.services` you're kindly asked to migrate your deployments to use the **hostname** `insight.verus.io` instead.

both explorers adhere to our very strict privacy policy - you can read it at https://verus.io/privacy-policy - it's not very long!

thanks for your attention, seasons greetings and stay healthy.

@everyone I wanted to give an update on Verus DeFi development for mainnet, the ETH bridge, and more as we approach the end of the year, collectively enjoy the holidays, and hopefully, find some time to stay connected to family and friends. As usual, though I've been fairly quiet around the channels and have appreciated so many community members driving so many great activities, some developers have been working day in and out to get the DeFi release and all its supporting software ready for mainnet, including the ETH bridge, which will connect Ethereum and every ERC20 currency through an easy to use bridge to Verus, with its revocable, recoverable, VerusID's, new Verus Vault time-lock capabilities, and on-chain currency baskets and conversion via Verus DeFi.
Although Verus DeFi was targeted for mainnet without PBaaS support and with the ETH bridge, the process of enabling the ETH bridge has made it clear that bridging PBaaS networks and Ethereum can both be solved by one common cross-chain protocol, which leverages what has already been done for Verus PBaaS and VerusIDs to create a foundation for interoperability across all external, PBaaS, or even centralized, multi-currency networks.
To deliver the simplest combined solution with the most capability, we have taken recent weeks to reconcile the ETH bridge work with the PBaaS cross-chain protocol and are now making good progress on completing both of them as variations of one cross-system protocol. In fact, though we still have the priority to get DeFi and the ETH bridge to mainnet, whether PBaaS is ready or not, we now hope to have both the ETH bridge and a version of PBaaS on testnet and headed to mainnet very early in the new year.
While we have been quiet, we have been working non-stop and making great progress. You can learn more about the PBaaS / ETH bridge work in the #deleted-channel channel. Wishing all of you in Verus community a wonderful holiday season, and to all of us, an incredible New Year üôÇ !

Ahoy Pirates! 
We have improved the process for receiving user support here in discord. We believe this will result in faster response times while providing you with a better overall experience. 

We would like to introduce the #deleted-channel channel along with a wallet support section on the faq page on pirate.black (https://pirate.black/frequently-asked-questions/)
On #deleted-channel , you will be greeted with a support ticket panel. 
You will first be invited check out the wallet faq page on pirate.black to see if the issue is answered there. 
If it isn't, click on the  emoji, and a ticket will appear where you can communicate with the Pirate Chain team directly and privately. 

Once the issue is resolved, you may close the ticket and it will disappear. We will be adding common issues and solutions to the FAQ page, so over time, that page should help resolve the majority of issues. 

We hope that you will have a overall better experience by improving the assistance you receive in the shortest response time.

As mentioned in the #wsb channel, I can now publicly disclose a project that I have been working on in the background for a little awhile now, Tokel. We will be using existing KMD technologies to offer a Token Platform within the Komodo ecosystem. We are developing an application that will focus on token creation,management and trading (fixed supply and Non-fungible tokens). This will include an in-built tokenDEX and token NFT marketplace. We have the technical support of JL and are being assisted by dimxy in the CC development/testing area at the moment. We have recently acquired funding and have started the development process. It is still early days and there is a lot of information to provide to you all. We are working on a Tokel Paper that articulates what we plan to provide, a website that summarises our intent, and are laying down the foundations for application development. We hope to work closely with the Komodo community and team to fulfill a gap that we see within the ecosystem currently.

If you'd like to learn more, please head over to our discord https://discord.gg/DZvuAR6QzX

[17-Feb-21 11:26 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
@everyone

We have hit our second milestone in our communication/information passage efforts (The first being this discord)

I'd like to introduce the tokel website!

https://tokel.io/

Please check out the website and let us know what you think! We have gone with a minimalistic design approach, with brief explanations of what the platform will offer. Some of the images you will see are a sneak peak at the all-in-one application design images. This design is a work in progress, and will adapt as we continue development. The website itself provides a basic overview and understanding of what the Tokel platform is trying to achieve. You can also find links to our github and discord.

What have we been working on?

- Website
- Tokel paper
- Development roadmap
- Discord bot integration discussions

We have been busy working on this website along with the Tokel Paper. The Tokel Paper is in final stages of review and will be posted to the website once it is complete. This will provide a more indepth look into the Tokel platform, compared to the website. 

From a development stand point, we are solidifying our development roadmap. The roadmap will outline our goals and estimated timeline for the stages of development. We will use this to guide development efforts and provide us with a less-restrictive framework to remain nimble enough to pivot and adapt where neccesary. 

We are commited to transperancy, which includes open, clear communication. If at any stage, you have a question about the platform, please post it in the discord and we will do our best to answer it as clearly as possible.

We are excited to see some forward movement for the project, and look forward to sharing more milestones with you in the future.

@everyone 

If you had checked out the website in the last day or so, you may have noticed a sneaky little addition.

<https://tokel.io/roadmap/>

We have released our 2021 Project & Development roadmap. We invite you to have a look and understand what our development pathway looks like. We are going to use this roadmap as a set of objectives for the team. Each task listed will be tackled in order, with enough time between tasks to ensure adequate testing and release procedures can be conducted without rushing. These release dates are estimates based on our current team, and are subject to change if we believe we can be more efficient in our work processes, or we decide on new priorities. If that is the case, we will update the community as soon as we know.

Of note, the Tokel all-in-one development releases are listed 1 through 4. The release specifics will be broken apart in the Tokel paper. We hope to bring that to you over the next week.

If you'd like to help Tokel out, we would love to have your assistance. The best way to contribute is to be active in this discord ( #deleted-channel or #deleted-channel ), and communicate the skills you bring to the table and any thoughts you have.

Thank you,

The Tokel Team

@everyone 

As promised, we have completed and released the Tokel Paper. You will find it on the website, or at our github; links below.

<https://tokel.io/>
<https://github.com/TokelPlatform/tokel_web/blob/development/static/TokelPaper1stEdition.pdf>

Although 13 pages, there are lots of graphics in there, so don't think it's too overwhelming.  It should take about 15 minutes to get through the whole thing. The intent of the Paper is to provide an overview of what we plan to do, what problems we are solving and with what solutions. We do not deep dive into the 'how' because we intend for that to be general and have more data within the roadmap. 

Topics that the paper talks about:
What is Tokel and what do we plan to offer
What Antara Modules Tokel plans to use.
Tokel blockchain specifics (minus the exact chain params as this is not set in stone until we conduct testing)
A deep dive into the Tokel application and what each release schedule looks like.

Please let us know what you think!

Thank you,

The Tokel Team

Friday Development Update

Hello community @everyone

Since @daria is not well, i thought of sending the weekly update this week
```
What we done this week:

Major implementation done is player sitout, what basically we done is we provided the ability for the players 
they can opt to sitout for the next hand or the following hands.

What we tested on it is, say suppose a dealer is running a table for 2 players, and after playing for a while say if player2 chose to sitout, then player3 can join the table and can play with player1 and this is all happen without restarting of any of the nodes.

One more nice feature we completed is handling player disconnections, so with this if by any reason if any or all of the players gets disconnected the dealer won't crash or hang, it simply consider those disconnections as fold and move on playing with rest of the game. One more nice thing with this is, say if all the players gets disconnected the dealer won't evaluate that hand, so in that case players by using DRP protocol they can get back their initial deposit funds.
```


[19-Mar-21 06:41 AM] CHIPS #announcements#0000
@ComputerGenie  is working on generating the installers and chips-qt wallet stuff, you can expect to have a stable wallet and installers soon.
```
What's in next week:
On GUI the full implementation of DRP and couple of issues related to GUI are planned in the coming weeks. In the backend the long waiting fixing the issues related to deck shuffling 
for more than 2 players is planned to do this week.

What's next:
1. Implementation async -event based handling of the backend messages, now all the backend communications are synchrous, this is very important upgrade that needs to be done because 
even for the dealer to handle multiple tables simultaneously and for the cashier nodes/BVV to take part in multiple deck shuffling simultaneously we must have this async event based model - 
any suggestions on this is are welcome


PS: Please bear with the poor formatting and grammar.

Friday Development Update

Hello community @everyone

What we done this week:

I spent this week in working on deck shuffling for multiplayers(>2).  So basically im able to shuffle the deck for more than 2 players but like the way im handling the backend communications needs to be changed.

I created an issue regarding the same and you can post any suggestions on the issue.
https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/issues/205

For 2 players I worked on fixing some some dealer node crash issues, and you can track the progress of alpha release which aimed to deliver a stable 2 player poker here:
https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/milestone/1

Next week:
We focus on closing the minor GUI tasks and testing for the stable 2 player release.
Working on Multiplayer issues.

[31-Mar-21 02:41 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
@everyone

I hope you are all doing well. I thought I'd write a monthly wrap-up to give you an update of where we are at.

**Q1 roadmap review**
<https://tokel.io/roadmap/>
The three items we wanted to achieve in Q1 were all achieved:
1. Discord Launch
2. Website launch
3. Tokel Test chain launch

**Q2 review**
- Tokel main chain launch
- All-in-one application release v1
- All-in-one application release v2
- Tokel explorer v1


**Tokel main chain**
Unfortunately we have not hit our goal of launching the Tokel main chain in March. We have purposely delayed this to give us time to improving upon the current version of tokensv2CC and assetsv2CC. If we launched the chain in the current state, it would require a hard fork for every update we make. 
    We have been working alongside the KMD team to test and develop improvements to the current versions of the CC. An example of this is the addition of 'royalties' to NFTs. Dimxy from the KMD team is in the process of adding a royalty option when creating an NFT. This is a change to both the tokens and assets CC. The option will allow NFT creators to set a royalty % for every trade of the NFT in the future. This allows content creators to make a small % of revenue when the NFT is traded in the future. 
    We have also conducted multiple tests and found a few small issues that were quickly rectified. I can't say a big enough thank you to Dimxy and the KMD team for the work they have conducted up until this point.
    The final reason why we have delayed the main chain launch, is that we would like to couple the main chain launch, with the Release 1 of the Tokel application. This release will enable a Tokel coin wallet, and will give a teaser for what is yet to come in the application.


[31-Mar-21 02:41 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
**Tokel application**
The Tokel application development has slowed this month with the sickness of our lead dev. We wish her all the best in her recovery and look forward to having her back soon! The application is in the early stages of Tokel coin wallet development. Currently the app enables nSPV and allows you to login and see the main dashboard. From there, we are working on the coin wallet specifics: address/seed/WIF generation, coin display, coin transfer and receive options and general wallet handling.
    We are currently on the look out for another developer to assist with application development. Daria will broadcast the position description over the coming week.

**Others**
I have been on the search for an exchange to list Tokel. I currently have a list and will seek them out over the coming weeks, prior to chain launch. I would like to partner with an exchange and to have them integrate tokensCC into their ordermatching protocol, to enable Tokel tokens to be listed on their exchange with ease. If you'd like to recommend an exchange, let us know in the #deleted-channel chat. We are in discussions with the KMD team to enable Tokel coins to be swapped on AtomicDEX. At the moment, it will be limited to Tokel itself, as tokens cannot be atomic swapped at this stage.
    Along with exchanges, I have been searching for 3rd party coin wallets that we may want to be added to, as well as writing a list of bounties that we would like to achieve. If you have a specific feature or application that could be created using the Tokel platform, please discuss it in #deleted-channel. I will be looking for things that are achievable in the near term, and would like an estimation of costs associated with your idea (I can help estimate if need be).


[31-Mar-21 02:42 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
As mentioned late last month we published the Tokel Paper. If you haven't had a read, I'd urge you to give it a few minutes, to truly understand what we are trying to achieve. You can find it at the link below.
<https://github.com/TokelPlatform/tokel_web/blob/development/static/TokelPaper1stEdition.pdf>

Please check out the website and keep your eyes peeled in the discord. If you have any thoughts or comments on the project, please let us know!

**Announcing Verus Mobile 0.2.1-beta with Z-addresses*, Multi-chain ID Shortcuts, and Complete UI Redesign**

@everyone Announcing the new Verus Mobile, now with private address support. Private addresses, also known as z-addresses can be entered both as direct z-addresses using copy/paste, or even using friendly name, private addresses based on VerusIDs, like name@:private. Send funds, encrypted messages, and more, mobile to mobile with privacy protected by Verus zk-SNARKs. We have done a lot of work (thanks @michaeltoutjr, @Asher, @Max@, @Diesmaster, @VirtualSoundNW, and others!) to improve lite z-address performance/scale, and we expect to soon support other zk-SNARK capable blockchains as well. Z-addresses are also now included in payment requests, addresses, and invoices presented as VerusPay QR codes.

In addition to z-address support, the new Verus Mobile includes a complete UI redesign, with a new concept called ‚Äúcards‚Äù. With cards, you can hold one currency across multiple cards in Verus mobile, and a card can represent transparent addresses, z-addresses, IDs, or in the future, when Verus Mobile is white labeled or co-branded and released by companies like Valu, centralized insured accounts and even virtual debit/credit cards. Many screens and interactions across Verus Mobile have been redesigned as well.


[10-Apr-21 08:08 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
.
Finally, the new Verus Mobile supports ID shortcuts, which is not yet full VerusID support, but treats the Verus blockchain the same as it will continue to treat other blockchains, such as Bitcoin, Zcash, Komodo, and others, once full VerusID capabilities are supported. If you enable the feature in settings, you will be able to send currency to the transparent primary address of a unisig friendly name ID or the private address of any VerusID, simply by entering the idname@ or idname@:private. In an upcoming release, when Verus Mobile supports full VerusID capabilities, attestations, and the ability to sign and prove attestations on mobile, it will continue to support ID lookup for non-Verus, non-PBaaS blockchains.

We hope you enjoy the new Verus Mobile! We are continuing to run the new release of Verus PBaaS and DeFi through its paces, which is going well in private testing, with public testnet release expected very, very SOON(‚Ñ¢Ô∏è)!

**Z-address support is for iOS only at first*

@everyone 
<http://tkltest.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/57fefeeadbf77b301cf6ab7e467110917cd78ec31ba548ffe1acc63b4cbe5ffb>
https://i.gyazo.com/44764c1c14e9e456d5975281c425dfa7.png

What you see in that transaction is the first NFT to be sold on the TKLTEST chain with the new royalties function! This function went from concept to reality in about 3 weeks.
The NFT cost 1000 TKLTEST coins, and you can see the seller receives 900 TKLTEST and the original creator of the NFT receiving 100 TKLTEST (10% royalty). The 1 sat output value is the NFT UTXO itself, and the 0.0001 TKLTEST output is the tx fee for the order.

The Tokel and KMD team have been working together to improve the tokensv2CC. When creating NFT's, for those looking for ultimate flexibility, creators can have their NFT 'data' field contain completely arbitrary data. 
With what I am dubbing the "Tokel Standard 1" (TS1), creators can add the following fields:
```
ID
URL
Royalty fee (x/1000)
Arbitrary Data```

Royalties allow the creator to set a percent(x/1000) in NFT creation, which they will receive if their token is sold using the Assetsv2CC (the on-chain tokenDEX). Creators can continue to generate revenue from follow on sales of their NFT's, for the rest of time.

At the moment, we are testing on an isolated branch of the komodo. Once we have finalised polishing off what we wanted to adjust, this will be PR'd into the main Komodo github and we will look to launch the main Tokel smart chain.

Friday Development Update

Hello  @everyone 

This week we made quite a good progress on porting the ln upstream changes and thanks to @grewalsatinder for your efforts and soon we will be ready with the latest ln upstream.

I majorly worked on the multiplayer development part, as I was posted few backs I was able to test the multiplayer with three players. I'm spending my time in improving the redesigning of the backend communication protocols and for which i'm experimenting with DHT repo(which we eventually replace nanomsg with DHT to remove the dependancy on the IP).
Apart from that I created couple of issues and discussions are being happening on pot rake split and some we hopefully have a sortout approach soon.

Happy to see the buzz creating around this project, and you can see the efforts are going on to liquidate CHIPS.  Thanks to all the efforts putting by team.

We are also planning setup some time to play the poker with the community and we also been active in providing the support in setting up the nodes and play the poker. We welcome people to setup the nodes and ideas on how we can involve the community to have more people playing using and testing our platform and playing poker.

Happy weekend!

@everyone 

Some of you may have noticed that coinpaprika has updated CHIPS markets to include atomicdex! Accompanied with the recent increase in volume on adex, you can now check out the current price and volume right on the coinpaprika site.

<https://coinpaprika.com/coin/chips-chips/#!exchanges>

As coinpaprika is the only coin stats site that identifies atomicdex, it is the only one with the adex market on it. We are working to get listed on a few smaller exchanges at the moment and will chase up both coingecko and coinmarketcap when those listings come to fruition.

Happy Trading!

Friday Development Update

Hello  @everyone 

In continuation to last week developments on ln, a PR is made to the tor branch by @Biz, i tested the peer-channel-state and i see its working fine. The full game yet to be tested on the newly made PR which I do this weekend.

@ejuliano published an article on CHIPS price discovery on the CHIPS blog and you can find more details of it here: https://blog.chips.cash/chips-distribution-and-price-discovery-blog-post/ and its good to see 
CHIPS price is stabilising around $1.5 and we can be very hopeful that this can much higher. And I also recommend reading his article on CHIPS Pangea Poker(https://blog.chips.cash/chips-pangea-poker-revolutionizing-virtual-poker/) which is very informative and well articulated.

I made a major progress in debugging some of the issues related to the multiplayer part. 

Some quite fruitful discussion is happening on the pot split and we almost at a certain conclusion on the pot split share and you can find the discussion here: https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/issues/209 and I'll update this issue with the summary of the discussions periodically.

Thanks to @Chief Crypto for making some cool gifs and thanks to all others for their active contributions and being around.

Happy weekend!

@everyone I want to announce that we have found one issue which does not affect mainnet at all in the GUI release, and we recommend to wait on using the GUI release with testnet until tomorrow, as people who are necessary for the release process will need to sleep. This issue does not affect mainnet or any other currency system in Verus Desktop, and since this is also a critical mainnet release, we are going to leave this available for people. Although the issue shows up in GUI, it is actually an API used by the GUI that was not used in many other cases and has an issue on testnet, so my issue, not the GUI developers. ALL releases work fine on mainnet and CLI will still work fine on testnet. We do recommend that on testnet, you avoid using the sendtoaddress command if you have tokens in your wallet. If you are using the CLI and do have tokens in your wallet, please use sendcurrency or z_sendmany instead. We will update releases tomorrow to resolve this issue.


[07-May-21 11:54 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
We're talking about this issue, as part of wanting to start with a clean testnet launch, which was our intent all along, although it is possible to continue tomorrow, we expect to reset tesnet in the morning. You can use it today if you'd like, as all of the features do work with CLI, except that API with tokens in your wallet in some cases, but please understand that we will almost certainly reset testnet in the morning for a fresh start before the update and community meeting.


[10-May-21 02:50 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
@everyone We have found an issue that after discussion leads us to recall this last release. The testnet will remain as is, but we ask that everyone, for your own benefit, downgrade to v0.7.2-8 for CLI and v0.7.2-9 for GUI until the next release is available, which will be today. This next upgrade will now be a MANDATORY upgrade. Please downgrade when you can and wait for the coming update. We apologize for the inconvenience. Thank you.

@everyone Announcing v0.7.3-4, NON-MANDATORY update for mainnet and the testnet upgrade everyone is waiting for, whether they know it or not. AS OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE STOPPED USING THE PRIOR VERSION ON TESTNET, AND BEFORE RECONNECTING TO TESTNET AGAIN, YOU SHOULD FIRST UPGRADE. This release will not require that you reset your testnet at all, as long as you have stopped or stop using testnet now and do not try reconnecting with an older version than v0.7.3-4.

This version has no significant updates to mainnet functionality in CLI and some minor usability fixes in GUI. The main reason you will want this update is to use the most advanced testnet of any cryptocurrency on the planet, start developing on your own PBaaS chains, see how easy it is to operate in a multi-blockchain, interoperable, inherently DeFi platform, and to keep up with the latest capabilities.

In additional to all of the capabilities of the last testnet and fixes that will unstick any transactions that were attempted and had not completed yet on testnet, this version also adds a new API, `getreservedeposits`, which when passed a currency or PBaaS chain name, will display the total of all assets held on behalf of the currency, if it is homed on the current chain, or the total of all deposits for all currencies on a PBaaS chain specified.

Since our last video introduction of the testnet was marred by some demo-related technical difficulties, we are planning a new community meeting with demonstration, so we can share knowledge of the new capabilities that are both unique to Verus and that many of us believe will change the way that people use and relate to crypto and even money in general.

As far as learning about and sharing why this may be bigger than most yet realize, here is a primer on the new capabilities available on testnet. Please share this article with people who have a basic understanding of crypto and want to learn more about Verus. More important than everyone getting excited about what they don't yet understand is key crypto enthusiasts realizing what they can now start working with to enable their own business or project üôÇ

[24-May-21 05:11 AM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
@everyone

I would like to provide an update to the community on what we have been up to and what our plan is moving forward.

I know this may be a lot of information to unpack, so please start a discussion in any of the chats in the discord; I am sure somebody else is thinking of the same questions as you, if you have them.

To start, a list of the things the project has achieved over the last few months:
- As @daria mentioned, the project welcomed @acnebs to the team. He has been doing an incredible job on the all-in-one app.
- We have worked with the KMD team to create and add to the tokens/assets cryptocondition. This included adding a token creator royalty option on token creation, as well as the new "Tokel Standard 1" on-chain evaluation standard for Non-fungible tokens (in simple turns, the format of the data that goes into an NFT is checked by the consensus code to ensure every NFT follows the same format).
- Tested and provided feedback on these updates
- The Tokel all-in-one app is taking shape! The initial release (the Tokel coin wallet), has been tested and is ready to be released once we launch the Tokel blockchain. This is a huge achievement as it will be one of the only nSPV (super-lite) only wallets available (the only other one I know of is @pbca26's).

Whats next?
As we are working closely with the KMD team, they have kindly created a specific branch of Komodo for the Tokel project. This is not yet ready to go, and the final additions are ready to be added and are being audited as we speak. Once this is ready to go, we will conduct our final testing to ensure everything is working as we expect, then we will be launching the Tokel main chain.

Once the main chain has launched, we will then conduct the following:
- Announcements made in the Tokel discord, BTT and on the tokel.io website
- The addition of Komodo's delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) blockchain security mechanism
- The initial release of the Tokel application on github for all operating systems
- The release of a TokelQT wallet (this may take a few weeks)
- The release of a web token/chain explorer (thanks to @pbca26)
- The addition of Tokel onto atomicdex (watch this space for specific details!)
- The creation of a TKLTEST repo within the Tokel github for the testing of CC updates/additions (the main chain will continue to be launched from the Komodo github repo)
- Updates to the Tokel Roadmap for the rest of the year (we are moving to a feature based development cycle/process via 2 week sprints)
- Continued development of the Tokel application (release 2 will be the Token wallet)

Please reach out to any of the team on the Tokel discord or email contact@tokel.io for any further information.

@everyone Announcing v0.7.3-5, NON-MANDATORY update for mainnet and MANDATORY upgrade for testnet. AS OF THIS ANNOUNCEMENT, EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE STOPPED USING THE PRIOR VERSION ON TESTNET, AND BEFORE RECONNECTING TO TESTNET AGAIN, YOU SHOULD FIRST UPGRADE. This release will not require that you reset your testnet at all, as long as you have stopped or stop using testnet now and do not try reconnecting with version older than v0.7.3-5.

v0.7.3-5 resolves an ID wallet sync issue for mainnet that could occur when recovering a revoked ID, causing the wallet to double count some amounts. This issue could not result in either loss of funds nor a security issue.

This release fixes all known testnet issues on the current testnet and does not require a testnet reset. If you've continued running testnet through this release you may need to sync from scratch. Come help us move the chain forward by mining on the new version!

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

This week we majorly worked on the ln porting, tor setup.

Things finished this week:
- Merged the ln upstream changes to the ln master branch.
- Completed testing the game on the new ln upstream changes.
- grewalsatinder completed setting up the chips and ln tor nodes, the game is tested over the tor network and is working fine.
- Here is the tutorial to setup tor network for chips and ln nodes: https://github.com/chips-blockchain/lightning/blob/tor/doc/Tor-setup-notes.md
- Completed the development of malking changes to the bet repo, which is now compatible with the latest ln upstream changes.
- With the latest ln changes the lightning channels can be created with the max of 2^24-1 satoshis, which approximately 0.167 CHIPS, so we made changes accordingly and to play game the ln node needs to be funded with 0.167 CHIPS instead of 0.25 CHIPS.

Currently we are working on the following areas/planning to start next week on: 
- Adding support in bet repo to dynamically check the tor setup and connect accordingly.
- Look into removing the static ip dependency of the cashier and dealer nodes.

Note: Please pull latest lightning and bet changes to test and play.

@everyone Announcing MANDATORY UPGRADE v0.7.3-6, REQUIRED FOR KOMODO NOTARY SEASON 5. Notaries, pools, and exchanges should upgrade to this version as soon as possible, before notary changes take effect on block 1562500. Failing to update will not prevent connection to the network, but updating in a timely manner will ensure a stronger, notarized connection to the Verus blockchain. There are no other Verus changes in this release besides the Komodo notary season 5 update. This version continues to be suitable for Verus testnet usage.
While previous releases also included the Komodo notary updates for Komodo and Pirate currencies as well, this GUI update also includes the latest version of the Zcash native wallet, version 4.4.1, released yesterday, which fixes a Zcash chain sync stall issue. Please update as soon as you can, especially if you are a notary, operating a pool, or operating an exchange. Thank you!

@everyone CRITICAL NOTICE - DO NOT MAKE ANY TRANSACTIONS ON THE VERUS NETWORK UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE!
Someone has found a way to game the PoS on the chain and is driving forward much too fast, which is driving up the difficulty too high. We have a fix, but cannot get notaries updated until we reach them and may need to roll back the chain if we do not get in touch with @ca333 and the Komodo notaries in time to stop this. AGAIN, DO NOT MAKE ANY TRANSACTIONS AT THIS TIME. WE EXPECT TO HAVE A RESOLUTION WITHIN 24 HOURS, AND WE WILL ANNOUNCE WHEN ALL IS CLEAR.
If anyone can reach the Komodo notaries at this time, please let us know.

@everyone I see that there are a lot of questions, and we'd like to provide some information to all about today's events and where things are.
1) @michaeltoutjr called me early this morning about an issue on the network, and some time around 5am PDT, I started looking into the issue. By that time, people had started to notice that the network was under attack by black hats, and I was able to get a quick update from @ùôäùôûùô£ùô†, @Chris - Monkins and others offered to help as well. Figuring out the bug the attackers exploited was quick work, and the rest of the time was spent making sure it was addressed. Thanks to everyone who helped move quickly today, and though we still have work to complete, I want to thank @ca333 , @dudezmobi , @PTYX , and @smk (dragonhound) of the Komodo notaries (and in @dudezmobi 's case ex) for responding quickly and making themselves available for this release rollout.
2) I want to be clear. Today's attack was exploitation of a bug for personal gain, whether reputation or money, vs. reporting a bug for a bounty, like we have a culture of doing across the community. There was no exposed weakness in the algorithm itself. There was a bug in the code that allowed the attackers to violate the protocol and run the network forward due to a missing check that was implemented, but not used as intended. As everyone knows, we are a worldwide community, and in the past, people in the community have always worked together to write code, find, report, and fix bugs, rather than focus on attacking the community network or claim that a bug found is an indictment of the community developers or the technology. What this does teach us, and for that single thing, I appreciate that the timing was now, is that we need to tighten code reviews, add a better set of regression tests, and get more help from constructive members of the worldwide crypto community.


[17-Jun-21 10:15 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
3) Finally, as @jl777c noted, the block community members chose as our initial fork target was expected to be tomorrow when we chose it and when it was added to the code. It was definitely well after announcing the exploit. Once we saw the exploit ongoing, community members immediately notified all centralized exchanges to protect the community, and that enabled us to ethically agree on a target block for the release, even though the chain was moving faster. We could have chosen to roll back until before the attackers stole the bulk of their funds. Instead, we decided to target a block that, given normal diff adjustment, would have been tomorrow, well after the software release. The exploit caused the network not to function as intended, driving the chain forward much too fast and precluding PoW blocks from being mined. For functional decentralization, and because the entire community would be better served by fixing the bug in the network protocol, we will continue the chain shortly after the chain stopped functioning according to the protocol. Though we are a decentralized community, even decentralized things should be fixed when bugs are found. Just ask BTC about the double input bug, or Zcash about Sprout counterfeiting. Luckily, world community members brought those things to their attention before attacking their networks.
4) We have prepared and tested releases with a fix for the bug that activates on block 1567999, which will be out shortly along with bootstraps. The attackers are welcome to try to move the network forward from there on the new version. Perhaps, rather than exploiting the community, they might choose to only help us in the future.

OK, @englal , @quipacorn, and @Asher are moving the build pipeline forward. Komodo notaries are updating based on the source trees, as are all foundation nodes. If anyone wants to build and update using the master VerusCoin source tree, feel free to get a head start. It may take another hour for the signed releases. If you haven't already shut down nodes on the current version, please do so. When the release comes out, if you shut down early in the day, within an hour or two of the first notice above, you should be able to just start up and continue without concern. If you waited longer and followed the chain while they were exploiting it, you may need to bootstrap. The good news is that the GUI has an easy bootstrap option, which you can select via the little gear by the Verus coin rectangle on the left hand panel of Verus Desktop.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone

This week we finished working on the integration of chips-ln tor in the back end, im exploring the use tor sockets to remove the back end dependency on the static IP. @grewalsatinder worked on building the repo using configure and automake tools, the changes are tested and pushed to the master repo. Few changes to use the third party repos are made, like rather than using the local forks we using parent repos while building the bet which I feel make the code base looks more clean and formal.

We created few issues to write the test cases for the chips and ln API's used in the bet, to make future integration of upstream changes smooth. 

We going to be working on the following things next week:
- Writing a test application using tor sockets and look into the possibility of integrating it into the bet to replace nng.
- Writing the test cases for chips and ln integration.
- On the GUI coming up with some solution to connect to the backend node without static IP.

@everyone TL;DR - as a result of the exploit mitigation, we are in PoW mode until an upgrade, likely tomorrow, and its activation, at least 4 days from now.
As @michaeltoutjr said, the chain is moving forward just fine, on the ~1 minute average schedule, and is being notarized correctly by the Komodo notaries. You may also have noticed that there is a current issue with staking, which will only be temporary. While we were able to test the exploit mitigation code on a testnet, we were not able to test moving the mainnet chain forward with legitimate mining and staking given the invalid state of the chain difficulty. The mitigation that was mainnet specific needs a change before it can resume accepting legitimate PoS blocks.
We are planning one more update, and since the chain is now functional for use again and not subject to such an attack, we will be more deliberate to ensure that we can get a full test pass with help from our new, trusted group of community testers, who have volunteered their services and to also to give the Komodo notaries more time to upgrade. We will allow for at least 3 days from the time of that release before staking blocks will be accepted again by the chain. At that point, Verus Proof of Power will be live with all checks verified and in place, including the fix for the one that the attacker's were able to exploit.

@everyone Announcing MANDATORY UPDATE v0.7.3-8, which will re-enable full Verus Proof of Power, including staking, at block 1576200, occurring Thursday at approximately 5:00PM UTC time. YOU MUST UPDATE BEFORE THEN TO FOLLOW THE MAIN CHAIN.

This release should put the recent blockchain issues thoroughly behind us. What we won‚Äôt put behind is the additional learning, resolve, and strengthened community that we have responded with to our recent event.

This release was the first of many to come where release testing by core developers, the usual testers and builders was aided by a new group of community volunteers. This approach, which was offered by community members enabled us to get round-the-clock progress on tests which have been a bottleneck in the release process. We also got participation to run forward on a simulated mainnet for community test volunteers to directly test the staking transitions that will activate on mainnet at block 1576200.
.


[21-Jun-21 11:30 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
In fact, although this is the earliest of days in setting up such a community test process, we were so encouraged by how much people‚Äôs participation helped ease the process and how much more is possible, that we are working to make this a powerful new decentralized tool for continuous improvement of our community QA and build pipelines. Some of us who have been testing and using processes that we have evolved over time, but are not setup for broader use or documented well, are working on the start of community test plans that can be broken into bite sized pieces to parallelize testing, share across the community testers, and get broader coverage in shorter time. We are taking the development of this decentralized test process seriously, and while it will take some time to get this ready in full, we hope to roll out more of it and improve the process with each release.

We feel very good about this release, and look forward to a happy staking community in just a few days working together towards PBaaS on mainnet. Thank you for being the supportive, helpful community you are.

@everyone Congratulations üéÜ !!! Full Proof of Power with staking is now successfully operating with all validation confirmed on mainnet. It may take an hour or two to smooth statistically between stake and work blocks and possibly a bit longer to smooth to average 1 minute block times. The network looks healthy and in sync across all upgraded nodes!

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone

The major development this week is the progress on the porting of the upstream changes to CHIPS. @barrystyle is working on the bounty to port the changes and satinder is working on setup and testing of the upstream changes. This week I was bit on/off due to travel, I spent time in writing the functional test cases to test the API's of the CHIPS used in bet. 

@dimxy developed a dice game using CHIPS smart contract, and i see some testing going on. Apologies for not digging in to elaborate much about that, will cover about it in the coming weeks.

There isn't much changes in the work we need to do in the coming week.

We going to be working on the following things next week:
- Working on porting the upstream changes and testing
- Writing a test application using tor sockets and look into the possibility of integrating it into the bet to replace nng.
- On the GUI coming up with some solution to connect to the backend node without static IP.

[28-Jun-21 04:51 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
@everyone 

I would like to publically announce the Tokel & Komodo platform strategic partnership.

It should come as no surprise that the blockchain technology stack that Tokel platform is using has been created by the developers of Komodo, and is open source and free to use. The Tokel Paper is explicit in mentioning "Tokel  aims  to  be  the  best  decentralized  token  platform  on  offer. It will provide a solid foundation, using existing Komodo Technologies, for token projects to launch and succeed from by offering end-to-end token solutions  for  fixed  supply  and  non-fungible  tokens."

What this partnership brings to the table is a mutual understanding and agreement towards further collaboration and continued development of both the blockchain technology stack that is within Komodo, and the decentralized applications that are being built on top of it.

As transparency is one of the Tokel teams core values, I will broadcast the specific details that are agreed to through this partnership. This list should provide people the opportunity to understand how this collaboration effort will benefit both projects and the combined community. It should be taken as a non-exhaustive, ever evolving list of benefits. I also make no apologies for not providing timelines for any of the listed developments or application features; this is an ongoing discussion and details will be released when we plan for them.


[28-Jun-21 04:51 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
Tokel platform benefits:
- Tokel will be an exclusively supported and endorsed NFT/token platform on top of the Komodo technology
- Continued higher level two-way discussions with members of the Komodo team. This may include, but is not limited to, discussing project direction, onboarding, organic growth strategies, development direction and other general strategy guidance.
- Initial Dex Offering (IDO) on the AtomicDEX application and associated marketing efforts
- AtomicDEX integrating the Tokel smart chain for a token dex/NFT marketplace (an NFT marketplace within ADEX that is "Powered by Tokel")
- The ability to re brand and update the atomicDEX mobile application to incorporate Tokels token wallet, tokenDEX & NFT marketplace
- Ongoing partnership marketing/PR assistance
- Development assistance. A dedicated cryptocondition (CC) developer to further enhance and create cryptoconditions & blockchain technology specifically for the Tokel project, that will be open sourced and kept within the Komodo tech stack for all Komodo platform users to have available.


[28-Jun-21 04:51 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
Komodo platform benefits:
- An organic, dedicated token platform within the ecosystem that showcases the Komodo tech stack
- Ongoing token, CC & nSPV related development that is kept within the Komodo tech stack
- The onboarding and funneling of people that are interested in token technologies, into the Komodo ecosystem, further increasing network effect
- The ability to integrate an ecosystem token/NFT platform into AtomicDEX (further showcasing and solidifying Komodo as a platform and solid ecosystem for projects to build within)
- Continued higher level two-way discussions with members of the Tokel team. This may include, but is not limited to, discussing project direction, onboarding, organic growth strategies, development direction and other general strategy guidance.
- 10 million Tokel coins for the Komodo team to assist with development and ongoing support. This allocation will come directly out of the Tokel Team premine allocation. (all premine will be time-locked until post IDO)
- A Tokel airdrop to KMD holders post IDO


[28-Jun-21 04:51 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
I'd personally like to thank @jl777c @ca333 @dimxy @pbca26 @Alright for the ongoing work and assistance that they have put toward improving the relationship between the two projects and the technology improvements that Tokel will greatly benefit from. I look forward to a successful, mutually beneficial partnership and collaboration that helps thrust both projects upwards and keeps them on the leading edge of blockchain & cryptocurrency technology.

A moment of silence for our dearly departed Pirate John McAfee who fought till the end when they captured him. He may have been a bit crazy but he was our brother fighting the tyranny of taxes brought upon him apparently by ourselves. SO the government feels we need to chase people to the point of death in order for us to take his money for the government to do good by us. Make sense yet ?  I cried for my fellow pirate who I looked up to as one of the last cowboys around. Our deepest condolences to Janice who is currently devastated. We lost one of our strongest pirates in this fight for freedom, but with his loss more will be born out of anger and righteousness. Privacy is freedom, and freedom will win one day. John where ever you may be you will be missed, and the tales of your story will echo though into my childs tales as he grows.  https://soundcloud.com/cryptoradio/crypto-radio-john-mcafee

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone

This week i majorly worked on fixing the pot split issues w.r.t to the multiplayer testing and working on fixing the crashes in the code base. W.r.t to multiplayer and i tested playing the game with 3 players, and i see the game is getting played without any crashes.

Since we talked much about tor setup in our development channel, you can read bit about it here: `https://github.com/sg777/pangea/blob/master/tor.md`. 


Couple of things which we focusing on the coming weeks is.
- Working on the issue `https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/issues/232` which will let the player connect from both the GUI and CLI by some simple configurations.
- Setting up at least 5 nodes and test multiplayer with at least 5 players.
- Pulling up the CHIPS upstream changes.

[03-Jul-21 03:26 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
@everyone Announcing immediate availability of NON-MANDATORY, RECOMMENDED ESPECIALLY FOR NOTARIES, HIGH PEER COUNT NODES, AND POOLS, v0.7.3-9 Verus CLI and Desktop.

In addition to more immediate and effective bad node banning behavior, v0.7.3-9 includes a fix for signrawtransaction that could sometimes result in failure of countersigning a multisig, ID-based raw transaction, and as a result of community volunteer testing contributions, this issue was exposed and fixed.

We were not content to just improve basic ID multisig capability, given @allbits suggestions of how he believed multisig could be easier. With the benefit of his ideas and testing support, we were able to upgrade Verus multisig capabilities to an ease of use and level of capability beyond other cryptocurrency networks we are aware of today.

While the Ethereum bridge on testnet or PBaaS going live on mainnet are both milestones likely to wake many up to the power of Verus, ease of use for otherwise impossible or extremely difficult and important use cases will keep users who discover Verus on our shared community platform as collaborators in its continuous improvement.
.


[03-Jul-21 03:27 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
In this release, it is now possible, on both mainnet and testnet, to issue any ‚Äúsendcurrency‚Äù command with the source being a multisig ID, for which you do not have all the keys present in your wallet. If you do, there will be a return error in operation status, from both GUI or CLI, and in that error will be the partially signed transaction, which can be used by applications or with copy and paste to send to other signers with partial authority over the source ID. On mainnet, destinations for such a transaction can include IDs, private addresses with memos to a z-address or ID:private, and transparent addresses. On testnet, such transactions can include all that is possible on mainnet as well as multiple currencies, currency conversions, and cross-chain sends.

To our knowledge, this release raises the industry standard for multisig capability and its ease of execution on the blockchain to a new level, even before considering the multisig revocation and recovery capabilities. What‚Äôs even more exciting is that while finishing this, we invented a new multi-level multisig syntax for sendcurrency that is not yet implemented, but is actually already enabled by the mainnet protocol. When we, or anyone starts taking advantage of that capability, I believe it will be a boon to organizational cooperation and commerce using the Verus network. These may not yet be the hot items of the day, but when we developed our solution for MEV, which was almost two years ago now, most people in the industry didn‚Äôt understand the problem.
.


[03-Jul-21 03:27 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
Now that this release further sensitizes and hardens the network against nodes behaving badly, our immediate priority is the Ethereum bridge to testnet, followed by a completion of testnet hardening and mainnet. As usual, we are a community, and though we cannot provide a specific date target for the upcoming testnet reset and following mainnet releases, your help, whether in development, testing, learning using and writing, or contribution in one way or another will help us get to that finish line sooner than later.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone

As we see the lots of discussions about taproot activation, after Satinder coordinating with the komodo team and with miners and devs here we go with 21st October for the taproot activation for the CHIPS. Blockheight will be decided near to that date. Now the code review is going on for the changes done by @barrystyle. 
  
You can see the progress of code review and the new milestones created here: https://github.com/chips-blockchain/chipschain/projects/1, thanks to Satinder for streamlining and coordinating the things with tor and now with taproot activation.

Couple of things which we focusing on the coming weeks is.
- Major focus on code review and functional testing
- Writing the documentation to join and use the testnet.
- Need to test torv3 support with the latest upstream changes for CHIPS.

v0.7.3-10 has very minimal updates targeted at networking robustness - faster response to notary inconsistencies and a check for detecting a corrupt index that if present, might otherwise prevent a node from staying synced.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone

The review of upstream changes are going on and you can track the progress here: `https://github.com/chips-blockchain/chipschain/pull/4`. Along the way @Biz  and @SHossain  are working on setting up testnet and addressing the issues relate to it.

@barrystyle integrated `nyorain/dlg` into the bet, I worked on classifying the logs based on the context and closed the issue #231. Since our idea of bet is to be a generic platform to support any sort of betting, I opened an issue #244 for bet to support prediction based betting. Since we have the system of cashier nodes which rely on reputation it could be easy to develop a system around them to have support for prediction based betting, also we got to know from @dimxy that  we can send external data to chain using oracleCC, so with the help of oracleCC and cashier nodes we can come up with a protocol on how the data can be fed into the chain in a reliable way.

We generating API documentation using doxygen, we have well written API documentation for the deck creation, shuffling, player join part. @grewalsatinder  is working on restructuring the doc section and we further work on this to have API documentation generated using doxygen.

Right now only few API's are exposed, which are related to DRP(dispute resolution protocol), we eventually expose the API's which are necessary to support any card game to start with.

[17-Jul-21 10:10 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
@everyone 

I have a few small updates that should start to get you excited! (well I am anyhow)

**Documentation**
Thanks to @gcharang for helping us get github pages working and launching the documentation website. I present <http://docs.tokel.io/>. We are currently in the process of updating all documentation. If you are interested in learning more about what Tokel offers and how you will be able to create tokens once we launch, I highly recommend having a read (check out the `tokenv2creatokel` explanation).

**Website**
You may or may not have noticed, but @daria has done a great job updating the website. Go and check it out and give us some feedback. 
<https://tokel.io>

**Marketing**
I'd like to officially welcome @+dreamTim as our marketing guru. We have been working away on a marketing focused release plan for maximum effectiveness. This includes simple things like creating social media profiles, improving information flow on the website and working alongside the Komodo marketing team to leverage their expertise and mutual PR efforts.

We have also created a brand package for people to use as they see fit. We will continue to update this as we create more graphics and content.
<https://github.com/TokelPlatform/tokel_app/tree/development/brand_package>

**Blockchain Specifics**
Keep your eyes peeled! The Komodo team are currently reviewing the Tokel specific blockchain updates before they accept it into their github repository. This means we get a second and third set of eyes on the code to ensure there are no issues and to make it as efficient as possible. Once this has been completed, we will be making initial chain launch preparations (having dPoW enabled) and then we will announce the launch to the public. My estimations (no promises), are that the chain will launch within the next 4 weeks.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone

Seems bit of dull week, i majorly worked on making bit of changes to dlg repo to display logs as per our need and made minor changes to suppress the lws logs and added dlg logs while making lws calls. Now you can see logs are neatly formatted with nice color coding(thanks to barrystyle). Satinder is working on reorganising the docs section, the API and protocol documentation is available at `https://developer.chips.cash/` and it will be further organised in a better way.  I see the work is going on review of the CHIPS upstream changes. 

From here on:
- The external repos which bet is dependant on is mostly updated,  so i'll be majorly work on fixing the issues related to multiplayer release.
- If CHIPS upstream review is done, torv3 and existing game functionality needs to be tested.

@everyone 
As you have all been eagerly awaiting, I have Tokel blockchain launch news!

After many hours spent testing and ensuring the blockchain and associated cryptocondition technology is as streamlined and secure as possible, we are now at a stage where we are happy to launch the blockchain into the world. This does not mean we are completing the blockchain development there. We will continue working with the community and the Komodo team to improve and further develop the technology behind the Tokel platform. With that in mind, as we add new features or upgrade current features, I ask the community keep an open mind to the ongoing development, and assist us with smooth transitions if hard or soft forks are required.

That being said, we are currently implementing the delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) mechanism to the Tokel chain. Once this has occurred, we will be releasing the chain parameters into the wild. From that point, we ask you, the community, to join us in this exciting adventure.

The official parameter launch time:
9pm UTC Friday the 30th of July (this Friday!)
<https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/?qm=1&lid=100,2147714,2759794,4164138&h=100&date=2021-7-30&sln=21-22&hf=1>

For anybody looking to prepare their servers/computers to launch or mine the chain, I'd suggest building the repository below in preparation for the chain launch parameters.
<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/tree/tokel>

Coupled with the blockchain launch on Friday, we will also be launching the first release of the Tokel all-in-one GUI application.
The first release will showcase the nSPV super-lite wallet technology to bring you a fast, easy to use wallet to access your Tokel coins. You can expect to see more releases within the coming months that bring more and more features as they are developed. The next release giving you the ability to see and interact with the Tokens within your wallet. Keep your eyes peeled!

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone

This week I majorly worked on CI integration using github actions to the bet repo, fixed the broken links and updated the documentation. As it was mentioned last week now the major focus is on for multi player release, the target is to have a usable multiplayer release with priority.

Apart from that, w.r.t taproot activation, Biz and Satinder will take a call on merging the upstream changes and taproot activation.
 
Major things to work in coming weeks:
- CHIPS upstream changes merging
- Multi player release

@everyone Whilst many cryptocurrency projects try to find utility for their coins, few actually make successful steps in that direction. Pirate Chain has been making considerable headways both with technological support for merchants and service providers.

As part of that community effort to increase adoption and utility, Pirate Chain is now seeing the launch of a new online and fully on-chain based casino that utilizes ARRR as it's currency. It's first game, Roulette, is available now.

To play, head over to https://piratelife.casino/ and click on the  play now button on the top right of the page. Click on create account (or, you can login using an existing account from polarity via seedphrase or email), enter in a password and copy down your seed phrase. After registering, you can go to your account by hovering over the user image on the top right and clicking account. From there, you can deposit and withdraw. All wallets, just like in polarity, are non-custodial. (Also, you can click on the "Chaos Mode" button in game to see all the bets placed on the table). 25% of the casino profits go towards Pirate Chain marketing!

The time has come, I introduce the Tokel blockchain!

<https://tokel.io/blockchain/>

Chain parameters:
```./komodod -ac_name=TOKEL -ac_supply=100000000 -ac_eras=2 -ac_cbmaturity=1 -ac_reward=100000000,4250000000 -ac_end=80640,0 -ac_decay=0,77700000 -ac_halving=0,525600 -ac_cc=555 -ac_ccenable=236,245,246,247 -ac_adaptivepow=6 -addnode=135.125.204.169 -addnode=192.99.71.125 -addnode=144.76.140.197 -addnode=135.181.92.123 &```

Please have a read of the documentation listed on our website and github for instructions on how to run the chain. If you have any questions, join our discord and join in on the conversation!

<https://docs.tokel.io/>

<https://github.com/TokelPlatform/>

<https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5352009.0>

I'm also extremely excited to launch the first release of the Tokel all-in-one(AIO) GUI application. Although we haven't talked too much about this in discord, @daria and @acnebs have done a fantastic job over the last few months to create an incredible experience. This first release incorporates nSPV super-lite wallet technology to bring you an incredibly fast way to access your Tokel coins. Keep your eyes peeled for further releases; the next release will allow you to access and manage your Tokel tokens from within the app (token wallet).

<https://github.com/TokelPlatform/tokel_app/releases>

To access and use all of the features of the Tokel platform, you will need to use command line interface (CLI), or wait for further releases of the Tokel AIO application.

We look forward to seeing what masterpieces and what applications are created that utilize Tokel token technology!

:Tokel:  Tokel facts! :Tokel: 

'The Tokel Platform' is everything on the platform.
'Tokel' is the name of the blockchain (ac_name=TOKEL).
'Tokel' is the name of the currency/coin on the blockchain.
'TKL' is the currency ticker. For use on exchanges and/or referring to the currency/coin specifically.

'1 TKL' is pronounced 'One Tokel' or 'One T-K-L'
'25 TKL' is pronounced 'Twenty-five Tokel' or 'Twenty-five T-K-L'

Example 1:
"I bought some Tokel! All I had to do was search for TKL and I found the exchange pairs."

Example 2:
"Can you send me some TKL? I need some to create my first NFT!"

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone

Majorly i'm been working on the changes needed and fixing the issues related to the multiplayer release, Biz is working on the PR. 

A brief summary of the items which we worked on this week are:

- Biz is working on testing the CHIPS API's for the PR and fixing the issues along the way.
- Implemented randomly choosing the BVV node for deck shuffling, earlier the player node picks the BVV node from the available nodes since the BVV nodes are predetermined nodes so always the node first in the list is get picked.
- Fixed the issues in making transactions on the node where the same node is also been a miner(the mining creating lots of dust transactions in the wallet so put some checks in making the tx).
- Improvised the debug logs and classification.

Point to Note:
If anyone facing the issues with CHIPS-QT wallet on windows the solution provided by ComputerGenie worked for me i.e just run the command `chips-cli getwalletinfo | jq .txcount` and see if the txount is greater than 10k, if so follow the link to clean the wallet https://gist.github.com/DeckerSU/e94386556a7a175f77063e2a73963742

Major things to work in coming weeks:
- CHIPS PR which is close to completion.
- Multi player release
- Satinder pulled the bitcoin 22.0 changes, it will be tested and PR will be raised once the ongoing PR is finished.

@everyone 

**__Introducing the Tokel IDO on AtomicDEX__**

https://tokel.io/ido/

Tokel will be conducting an Initial Dex Offering (IDO) on the AtomicDEX (a decentralized, non-custodial exchange) application.

There will be a total of 20 million TKL listed on AtomicDEX, split over 2 phases. As anybody that conducts trades with TKL during the IDO will be considered an Early Adopter of the project, these TKL will come from the Early Adopter allocation as listed in the whitepaper.

**The IDO will start at 8pm UTC on August the 30th.**
It will run until all offers are filled or for roughly 16 days total, 2 days for Phase 1, 14 days for Phase 2.

Phase 1 - Price Discovery
This phase of the IDO, as the name suggests, will facilitate a level of price discovery. 500k TKL will be separated into 50 orders of 10,000 TKL each. The orders will start at 1 TKL for 0.01 KMD to 0.402 KMD increasing in increments of 0.008 KMD per order. These orders will be available for a total of 48 hours. Following that time, the orders that haven't been filled will be removed, and the next phase will start.

Phase 2 - IDO
In this phase, the remaining TKL (any left over from price discovery and the previously unlisted 19.5 million) will be listed on AtomicDEX at a single price. These TKL will be listed at 70% of the final Phase 1, price discovery, price. This order will remain available for 2 weeks or until the order is fully depleted. Shall the order not be fully depleted.

For more information, please check out our website, and read the bitcointalk post (it has all the details!)

@everyone 

Tokel will be conducting an airdrop onto Komodo holders. 

A total of **8 million TKL** will be airdropped onto KMD holders.

The snapshot for this airdrop will occur on a random day 1 week (7 days) prior to the start of the IDO (30th of August) and will be airdropped in October.

In order to participate in this airdrop, all you need to do is hold Komodo in your wallet at least 1 week prior to the IDO. If you do not have custody of your KMD (have the privkey to the address you hold funds in), it should be assumed that you will not have access to your airdropped TKL as we cannot guarantee 3rd party custodial holders will know about the airdrop, or pass it on to you.

We will inform the community once we have completed the airdrop. The airdropped TKL will go to the same address that you held KMD in at the time of the snapshot. All you need to do is open that address on the TKL blockchain and your TKL will be there. You can do this via any wallet application; Tokel App, AtomicDEX, CLI.

If you have any questions, please join the Tokel discord üôÇ

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone

The major work done this is week towards fixing the bugs and adding minor changes needed for the multiplayer game stabilisation and towards testing CHIPS API's for merging the upstream changes PR.

Some notable issues fixed this week are:
- Added support to handle concurrent request on bet database.
- Added support to handle multiple dealers scenario at the BVV node.
- Fixed the issues in auto loading of funds from CHIPS to LN wallet, when LN wallet doesn't have enough funds to establish the LN channel.
- Added Satinder nodes as cashiers for testing, so the presence of more cashier nodess provide greater availability for testing atm.
- Biz created the issue, to track the CHIPS API's that being tested(https://github.com/chips-blockchain/chips/issues/11)

Major things to work in coming weeks:
- CHIPS PR which is close to completion.
- Multi player issues, there is some issues in setting up more than two nodes on my network, once this is done I'll finish the pot split testing and few multiplayer scenarios.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone

@dimxy published update on the dice app, you can find more details here: https://github.com/dimxy/chips3/wiki/Dice-example-implemented-with-a-new-scripting-opcode.  I'm been testing the game with 3 players and single dealer and the game is stable without any crashes. There exists a couple of issues with more than one dealer(I often see the game is hanging due to some crash in cashier nodes) which yet needs to be fixed.

Major things to work in coming weeks:
- CHIPS PR which is close to completion.
- Will come up with a video tutorial and step by step instruction in setting up the dealer to play the multiplayer release.
- WOrking on the issue #232 to provide text based interface.

[21-Aug-21 01:32 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
@everyone IT‚ÄôS TESTNET RESET TIME üôÇ !

ANNOUNCING HIGHLY RECOMMENDED NON-MANDATORY, CRITICAL FOR NOTARIES AND POOLS, v0.7.4

Version v0.7.4 can improve a mainnet node‚Äôs synchronization and this version also upgrades and resets the Verus testnet, preparing it for the testnet launch of the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge and bringing Verus PBaaS multi-chain, multi-currency, Verus Vault ID timelocking, Verus MEV-resistant DeFi, and the Ethereum bridge much closer to a mainnet ready state.

This release fixes all known functionality issues reported from the previous testnet including some related to currency and blockchain launches, as well as being incorrectly able to reduce the timelock period on a Verus Vault locked ID. It also includes the ability to export an ID from one chain to another, using the ‚Äúexportid‚Äù:true parameter in sendcurrency, enabling cross-chain use of VerusIDs. With this release, we will be resetting the Verus testnet. To use the new testnet, you must make sure to delete the vrsctest and .verustest/pbaas or VerusTest\pbaas folders beforehand.

While the new testnet is fully prepared and ready to launch vETH as the Ethereum gateway, which will be directly connected to the Rinkeby testnet, there is still work on the Ethereum side to complete. We do not have an exact day that we expect to launch the gateway on the new testnet. We have confirmed the bridge connection and transaction transfers between VerusTest and Rinkeby, and we do not expect the bridge to be much longer until we can launch it on this testnet.
.


[21-Aug-21 01:32 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
In addition to being prepared for the Ethereum bridge launch, this release adds some new testnet capabilities, including the ability to send to IDs cross chain and export IDs from chain to chain using the `‚Äúexportid‚Äù:true` parameter with `sendcurrency`. IDs only need to be exported once and can then be used and managed directly as a forked ID on the destination chain.
.
Thanks to all who have been using the testnet and reporting issues. Although the testing on this release took a bit longer than usual, we need to make sure that we release the best quality possible. I want to also thank the dedicated community members who participated in release testing, including the new people who joined this time around. As always, this is a community project with community contributors in everything from design to development to testing, website, marketing, and literally everything else. All of us who contribute are community members who mined, staked, bought, or earned coins from contribution like anyone else could. If you would like things to go faster, we encourage you to contribute where you can on things that are needed to get to release and we will leverage that help to go faster together.

Early Adopter Token Drop!

In case you missed the announcement in the Tokel AMA.

An "Early Adopter" token will be dropped onto all addresses that participate in the IDO.

Hold a piece of Tokel history, encapsulated in this digital memorabilia token. 

Keep your eyes peeled for the token wallet release of the Tokel all-in-one application. All you'll have to do is participate in the IDO (transact with the IDO addresses), and check your token wallet post IDO (give us a few weeks to conduct the drop, we will let you know when it's there!).

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone

This week we majorly worked on testing and debugging the CHIPS RPC's. Some of the RPC's are very new to me so im learning and testing. You can track the progress of PR here(https://github.com/chips-blockchain/chips/issues/11) . We seen issues with very few RPC's related to komodo notarization and fee estimation. @Biz  is looking into them providing workarounds. @pbca26 helping us to test `enumeratesigners`.  

Also please check #deleted-channel channel, lots of cool logos and design stuff is going on there.

Major things to work in coming weeks:
- Closing CHIPS PR. This is the main priority.
- Will come up with a video tutorial and step by step instruction in setting up the dealer to play the multiplayer release.
- Working on the issue #232 to provide text based interface.

AtomicDEX v0.5.0 has been released!

This release incorporates the TKL coin and will be required to participate in the IDO. You can find the download here:
<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/releases/tag/0.5.0-beta>

If you are a windows user, you will need to manually download this version as the automatic update does not currently work for windows. Don't worry though, your v0.4.3 accounts will still be available in v0.5.0.

Once you have downloaded it, use as you would normally and don't forget to add "TKL" as an asset.


[29-Aug-21 10:01 AM] Pirate #announcements#0000
@everyone the anniversary meeting just started ! :piratesmile:


[29-Aug-21 04:24 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
We would like to share the details and specifics of the premine allocations, where they have gone, and what TKL have been time-locked to what time.

The Tokel premine was decided as a necessary function to secure funding for the project. Both to get it off the ground and to ensure future development. Many projects have suffered from lack of proper development due to almost non-existent funding mechanisms; we did not want to fall into this trap. Tokel will give everybody, inexpensive access to create and utilise tokens, and all the token features on the Tokel blockchain. Although a fair launch, no premine, is noble in concept, it would have been prohibitive for any development in practice. To that end, the details are as listed below.


[29-Aug-21 04:24 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
All allocations are set out within the Tokel paper and should be referred to as the primary reference.

Total premine: 100 million TKL

Of this total, the allocations are as follows.
Initial Adopters allocation (20 million TKL) - Timelocked until 1st of October 2021
Early Adopters allocation (20 million TKL) - IDO TKL, No timelock
Trading incentive/liquidity allocation (10 million TKL) - No timelock
Bounty/Incubation allocation (10 million TKL) - No timelock
Team allocation:
10 million TKL (Komodo Team allocation) - Timelocked until 1st of October 2021
30 million TKL (Tokel Team allocation) - Timelocked until 1st of February 2022

As you can see, the Initial Adopter and Team allocations have been timelocked and will only be accessible from the dates listed above. A time lock is a condition given to the transaction that disables the recipient from spending those funds until the time specified within the transaction. So although the funds may be in the recipients address, as seen on the blockchain, they are unable to use or spend these until the specific date/time has passed.

Why did we do this?
We made the decision to lock the team funds until the 1st of February 2022 as this aligns with our goal of releasing the feature complete All-In-One application. This provides an incentive to the team over time and will ensure future development efforts can continue to be made.

As always, if you have any questions, please join our discord and we would be happy to answer them.

:Tokel: All price discovery orders were filled within **30 minutes **so thank you for your amazing participation. ü•≥

500k TKL was purchased 

Do not forget the main IDO event on AtomicDEX is on **September 1, 8pm UTC** and we recommend you wait until then to purchase $TKL.

**Phase 2 IDO**
In this phase, the remaining TKL (any left over from price discovery and the previously unlisted **19.5** million) will be listed on AtomicDEX. 

These will be listed at 70% of the final Phase 1, price discovery, price. This order will remain available for 2 weeks or until the order is fully depleted. Shall the order not be fully depleted, any TKL remaining will be kept for follow on bounties and early adopter initiatives.

You have the option of using the Tokel All-In-One (AIO) GUI application to manage your Tokel coins, or keep your coins within the AtomicDEX application itself.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone

This week we almost done testing the CHIPS PR RPC's. We tested all major functionalities, including wallets, mining and other RPC's. The only issue  out there is fixing the komodo notarization related stuff(the issue is komodo notarization related fields are populating with all zero's). We still be working on this issue.  @pbca26 is working on setting up the env to test  enumeratesigners.

If anyone missed out the announcement,  CHIPS is added to the atomicdex mobile app.

Major things to work in coming weeks:
- Fixing the komodo notarization related issues.
Couldn't able to work on the following issues last week, so will close them this week.
- Will come up with a video tutorial and step by step instruction in setting up the dealer to play the multiplayer release.
- Working on the issue #232 to provide text based interface.

[05-Sep-21 02:46 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
@everyone 
:Tokel: **Tokel presents the Early Adopter Initiative: Time-Lock Reward Plan** :Tokel: 

Per the whitepaper, ‚Äú[The Early Adopter] TKL will be for the people that were not able to assist in initial development, but would like to make a contribution to continued development. These people will make the ongoing development and establishment of the Tokel platform possible.‚Äù That is precisely why we allocated this TKL to the IDO. The funds gained will ensure the continued and increased rate of development of the Tokel platform and associated technology and dApps.
As part of the Tokel IDO process, we announced that any unsold Early Adopter allocated TKL would be used for further Early Adopter initiatives. We are now a few days into Phase 2 of the IDO and have been considering what exactly we should do with any unsold funds. Based on current trends, there would be a large amount of TKL leftover.

It is important to the team that these funds are used in a fair and fun manner, ensuring current IDO participants are happy with the follow on initiatives whilst also maintaining the integrity of the whitepaper. As mentioned, these funds are to ensure continued development (increase tech output), as well as to help develop and grow the community (increase network effect) and give access to those that want to create and utilize tokens on the Tokel Platform (increase adoption). The best way to do all of these things is by incentivising more people to participate in the IDO.

**Introducing the TKL time-lock reward plan**

This reward plan will effectively reduce the overall cost per TKL for IDO participants, but also greatly incentivize people to join the community and help develop and increase platform adoption at large. The reason for this is that participants will reap the future rewards of any assistance they provide to help the project now.


[05-Sep-21 02:46 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
For those that have already participated in the IDO, they will be happy to receive extra unexpected TKL that doesn‚Äôt reduce the % of supply they expected to hold (in fact, they are the best off because if we sell no more TKL during the IDO, they would receive a significantly large portion). This will also further incentivize those people that have not yet participated.

The whitepaper allocated 20 million TKL to Early Adopters. These were all listed on AtomicDEX as part of the IDO. We will be removing 5 million TKL from these orders to be reserved for this TKL time-lock reward plan. Along with that, any TKL that are leftover (unsold) at the end of the IDO will also be added to this ‚Äòtime-locked pool‚Äô of TKL.

TKL holders will be receiving additional TKL over a period of time, proportionate to the amount of TKL they hold at 8pm on the 15th of September. All premine addresses, apart from the 20million Early Adopter allocation, will be excluded from this airdrop.

This ‚Äòtime-locked pool‚Äô of 5 million TKL (plus any unsold TKL), will be airdropped to eligible TKL holders via two time-locked transactions. The first transaction being time-locked for 9 months, and the second being time-locked for 18 months. Each time-locked transaction will airdrop 50% of the total ‚Äòtime-locked pool‚Äô reserved funds.


[05-Sep-21 02:46 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
Half of all pooled TKL will be time-locked for 9 months, the other 18 months.
Timelock1 unlock date = 15th of June, 2022
Timelock2 unlock date = 15th of March, 2023

The requirements to participate:
Acquired and be holding TKL at 8pm UTC on 15th of September.

Excluded funds:
All other premine funds apart from the 20 million Early Adopter allocation.

We will be conducting a snapshot at 8pm UTC on the 15th of September. The addresses that hold the eligible coins at that time, will be the addresses that receive the airdropped, time-locked, coins.
Some examples are written below to help clear things up. Feel free to use this excel calculator to see how many extra TKL you could expect, depending on how many TKL are sold total during the IDO. 

Please use it as a guide only.
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iS_XS3FgAHPLjjEmxYO4ufekNhM7tu5zwJL9RTBfpF8/edit#gid=0


[05-Sep-21 02:46 PM] Tokel #tokel-announcements#0000
As there are many combinations and permutations of how many funds are sold vs how many are leftover, we cannot guarantee a specific amount. The above two examples should give you a good idea of each scenario; all IDO funds are sold out vs not too many TKL are sold during the IDO. Please note that once you receive your time-locked funds, they will show in your address but will not be spendable until the after the dates listed. This means that you will have custody over these funds for that entire time, but you won‚Äôt be able to use them until they are unlocked.
It should be noted that based on any reduction in effective price per TKL, a market correction post IDO is highly likely. Please consider this if you are looking to purchase TKL once the IDO has completed.

I mined some funds before the IDO, are my mined funds eligible?
Yes. We are considering all early miners ‚ÄòEarly Adopters‚Äô. Without them, the IDO wouldn‚Äôt have gone so smoothly.

@everyone 
You can now purchase TKL from the IDO with BTC in AtomicDEX. 

It came to our attention that people were looking for another option to purchase TKL during the IDO. Our intent was always to incentivize KMD usage, but we have now decided it would be beneficial for both the team and participants if we opened up another avenue of purchase. We are now offering a portion of the IDO TKL against BTC (check it out below!). 

The price for these orders will be actively stabilized to the price of 0.2814 KMD per TKL. This means that no matter what pair you decide to trade with, it will be relative to the price of 0.2814 KMD for each TKL you purchase. The minimum order to purchase using BTC is set at 0.05BTC. This is to reduce the overall cost due to BTC transaction fees.

[10-Sep-21 06:10 AM] CHIPS #announcements#0000
Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone

@dimxy  improved the dice game with an extended scripting functionalities, you can find the details of it here: https://github.com/dimxy/chips3/wiki/Dice-example-implemented-with-a-new-scripting-opcode. 
The same has been tested by @SHossain and provided the guide to setup and test here:  https://gist.github.com/himu007/8417d72bf5fd4593b08d8c683cdc2df3

 @pbca26   tested the enumeratesigners RPC, he done the setup with nanoledger h/w wallet and tested that using HWI he was able to sign the tx's using external signers(nanoledger). 
Here are some important links to setup HWI and to sign the chips tx using external signers
1. https://github.com/pbca26/HWI/commits/master
2.  https://github.com/pbca26/HWI/blob/master/external-signer-test.sh#L22 

@Biz  is working on the notarization issue,  it was found out that the notarisation values are not written to the notarizations(~/.chips/notarizations) file properly,so the issue has been corned out and hopefully it will be fixed soon.
 
@grewalsatinder  added the github action to automate the release of bet binaries and working on cross-compiling and testing bet binaries on windows and mac platform.

I added logs to chips to check the notarisation issue, but couldn't able to make not much progress on that front due to the limited availability this week.

Please check the #deleted-channel  channel to check the new logo design.

@everyone 

The Tokel Team would like to sincerely thank and congratulate everyone who participated in the IDO! The IDO has now officially come to an end. 

This IDO was the very first to ever be conducted on the AtomicDEX application. As a Komodo ecosystem project, with many KMD ecosystem community members at our core, we would like to thank the Komodo team for facilitating this endeavor.

To everyone that is now a TKL holder, I congratulate you and hope that you are able to help the platform grow by using and showcasing what you can do with your TKL. The biggest thing one can do to assist the project is to create, trade, and actually utilize tokens on the Tokel blockchain. You are now, and will forever be a Tokel Early Adopter; those who ensured the continued development of the Tokel Platform. 

:atomicDEX:  **The Tokel IDO statistics** :atomicDEX: 

:Tokel:  TKL Sold :Tokel: 
2,695,306 TKL

6.258 TKL total

3.129 unlocked on the 15th of June 2022

This week I majorly worked on fixing the issues relate to bet compatability to test with CHIPS upstream changes. I'm pushing the changes to `new_chips_test` branch. I see im getting some strange erros when making tx's with the data part, so looking into the CHIPS code and debugging this issue.

wARRR FAQ - Pirate Chain (ARRR)
What is wARRR? wARRR is a tokenized version of ARRR on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) ‚Äì and potentially other platforms in the future. wARRR allows users to exit transparent platforms and make their funds private by sending their wARRR through a bridge and converting it to ARRR (also known as unwrapping). Users convert their ARRR [‚Ä¶]

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone

This week i majorly worked on stabilizing the bet repo with the new chips upstream changes. We created `new_chips_test` branch to test poker on the barry's chips changes. So to play poker with the earlier version of chips please use the following repos(lightning is same in both the cases).

1. https://github.com/chips-blockchain/chips (master branch)
2. https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet (master branch)

To test the poker with the new chips upstream changes please use the following repos.
1. https://github.com/satindergrewal/bitcoin (barry branch)
2. https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet (new_chips_test branch)

There isn't any change is game functionalities in using any of these repos.

W.r.t to komodo notarization issue Biz is working with barry on it, and thanks to barry for promptly fixing the OPRETURN size issue in tx making.

Next week plan
1. Since we almost have stable multiplayer game tested on 5 nodes, I'll focus on removing the static IP dependency.

Hello @everyone!

We are about 180 blocks (3 hrs) away from the block reward increase! The block reward will be going from 1TKL up to 42.5TKL per block. 

As part of maintaining the integrity of the IDO, the team elected to reduce the block reward for a period that encompassed the time of the IDO. Now the IDO has completed, the block reward will go back to it's natural state. 
For every year after block 80640, the block reward will reduce by 23%. You can see the total supply curve over a 10 year and 25 year period in the linked graphics.

10 years

25 years
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TokelPlatform/tokel_brand/main/Random/Tokel%20Coin%20Emission%2025%20Years.png

```Coin Emission Schedule
Initial supply: 100 million
Maximum (fully mined/issued) supply: ~200.25 million
Block time: ~60 seconds
Starting Block Reward (Era 1): 1 TKL (80640 blocks or ~8 weeks)
Block reward after 80640 blocks: 42.5 TKL
Block reward reduction time period: Every 525600 blocks following Era 1 (roughly every year)
Reduction amount: 23%```

Happy mining!

@everyone I see people on various channels asking about an issue that has cropped up in the GUI Verus Desktop in recent days. It shows "certificate expired" and does not show currency prices or stats on staking. Just so everyone knows, this issue does not affect actual staking, just reporting of staking.
The issue was caused by the Electron library, which we use along with many, many other applications, having one of the root certificates in it expire. This has affected applications across the Internet, many who depended on these certificates for critical function much worse. For Verus, it affects GUI and display, nothing else.
We are testing a new Verus Desktop and wallet release now that may take another day and will include both an update to the Electron library, which will fix this issue as well as a testnet reset and which we will use to launch the Ethereum bridge to Rinkeby. A number of people across the community are working hard to get this release out as soon as possible.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

Update on couple of things we working on this week:

1. As we see there is communication going on to replace the dependancy on the public IP address, we analyzed few possibilities and you can find the detailed description here(https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/issues/285)
    a. Write a c binder on top of {golang,rust(since these two contains the pubsub implementation)} and integrate into bet.
    b. Using OpenDHT and simulate the pubsub behaviour on the bet side.

Out of which, I ran some sample examples using OpenDHT I see I'm confortable with it, On libp2p part I yet to test the things. 

2. Since my testing nodes are down from two weeks(which acts as cashiers also), we updated the new cashier nodes. Thanks to Satinder for setting up the nodes and allocating some nodes for my development and testing purposes.

3. Barrys changes moved to chipschain repo, Biz is working with barry to fix the komodo notarization validation issues.

Planned things in the coming weeks:

1. Fixing issues relate to multiplayer in the coming weeks(I'll update the issues fixed on week by week).
2. On CHIPS front, getting new upstream code fully functional and ready.

@everyone Announcing immediate availability of GUI and CLI for all platforms of the NON-MANDATORY, RECOMMENDED v0.8.0 UPDATE.
This release is mandatory for those who want to use the testnet, which will be reset as of v0.8.0.

Updates include:
1. Testnet reset with fixes for all reported PBaaS, DeFi, and advanced VerusID user issues. If you had reported issues, please verify that the issues you reported are addressed in this release.
2. Support for the bidirectional Ethereum gateway/bridge, which has been testing on private networks and which we hope to launch on public testnet in the next day or two after confirming it on the release testing network with community testing contributors.
3. Support for the new `getvdxfid` RPC call, used along with your ID and published names to generate VDXF (Verus Data eXchange Format) keys, which community members used to create the world‚Äôs first self-sovereign, completely decentralized, rent-free, non-cancelable social media profiles, such as this one: https://luckpool.net/profile/identity/mike. Work is underway to document the VDXF keys defined and used for profiles as well as the process of setting up your own. While the capability is already extremely powerful, we should remind everyone that Verus is a platform, not a social network. The core technology is exciting, but what will be even more exciting is when businesses and entrepreneurs leverage it to enable new, self-sovereign user experiences, applications, and new business models to build the future, truly decentralized web.


[11-Oct-21 09:36 AM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
4. Fix for the Electron certificate issue in the GUI wallet, which has been affecting prices and preventing BTC fee calculation.
5. Support for some additional, popular ERC20 currencies, in anticipation of more usage after release of the ETH bridge.
6. Fix in GUI for calculated balances of specific addresses sometimes showing lower than actual, even though wallet balance displayed correctly.
7. Additional hardening, fixes and improvement focused on mainnet and the Ethereum bridge.

To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):
Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`
Mac OS: `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/VRSC`, `~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest`
Windows 10: `%AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\VRSC\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest` or `%AppData%\Komodo\VRSC\`, `%AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest`

A quick update to let you know that we will not be using Kudelski Security for the code audit as we first planned, due to their WEF (World Economic Forum) connections.

We are still raising funds for further audits here: https://pirate.black/donations/peer-review-code-audit/ and will update you Pirates when we find more suitable companies to perform additional audits.

@everyone Announcing immediate availability of GUI and CLI for all platforms of the NON-MANDATORY v0.8.0-1 UPDATE.
This release includes a testnet fix for the Ethereum bridge and is required for those who want to continue using the current testnet after its launch. You do not have to delete your testnet folders, as the testnet will not be reset, but you do need to upgrade. We will launch the Ethereum bridge to the Rinkeby testnet, along with a website for using it with metamask later today. Once this reaches mainnet, the Verus DeFi protocol will be the best scalable, MEV-resistant, fairly-priced liquidity protocol available to Ethereum users for all their favorite Ethereum and Verus currencies. Of course, those who use it and store all their currencies on the Verus network will also get much more reasonable transaction pricing, all the other currency capabilities, and the unmatched security model of VerusIDs.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

Update on couple of things we worked and issues fixed on this week:

1. Adding the command usage info with the detailed descriptions and usage examples(try running ./bet help to see list of commands and ./bet help command for a specific command).
2. Handling the following scenarios 
    a. when the LN channel failed to establish
    b. One player failed to provide decrypted shard of the other player or provided the wrong shard.
    c. When the player get to decrypt its own shard required to form a card.
The above scenarios occurs after making the payin_tx, so if the game stops due to any of the above reasons using DRP(dispute resolution protocol)    the payin_tx will be credited back to the players CHIPS wallet.
3. It was observed few issues with the latest LN repo, now all the issues relate to LN are fixed.

@everyone Announcing immediate availability of GUI and CLI for all platforms of the NON-MANDATORY v0.8.0-2 UPDATE.
While the Ethereum bridge has been in testing on the community release test network, we did find another issue in the contract, which we have fixed and confirmed in testing. We believe we are ready to launch the Ethereum bridge on the public testnet. This daemon release includes a fix that simplifies some bridge transactions, and is the version you should run on testnet when the Ethereum bridge does launch to ensure a good experience. Due to the time tonight and to let other developers just waking up review our fixes as well, we hope everything will be confirmed by them and we can launch the bridge on testnet in the morning.

@everyone Announcing immediate availability of GUI and CLI for all platforms of the NON-MANDATORY v0.8.0-3 UPDATE.
THIS UPDATE IS ONLY NEEDED FOR THOSE COMMUNITY MEMBERS USING TESTNET. THERE ARE NO MAINNET CHANGES IN THIS VERSION.
After a number of people started sending currencies across the ETH bridge, it hit an error today and stopped sending transaction bundles from Rinkeby to VerusTest.  You will need this update to stay connected to testnet once we restart bridge traffic in about an hour. If you do stay connected on the old version and fork away from testnet, you should still be able to start with a reindex and rescan after upgrade. All transactions that have been waiting on the Ethereum side of the bridge should come across once bridge traffic resumes.

@everyone Announcing immediate availability of GUI and CLI for all platforms of the NON-MANDATORY v0.8.0-4 UPDATE.

FOR YOUR BENEFIT AND EVERYONE ELSES, PLEASE WAIT UNTIL 1:00AM UTC BEFORE YOU START MINING ON THE NEW VERSION. ONCE THE NEW VERSION BEGINS MINING AND STAKING A MAJORITY OF THE NETWORK POWER, ALL OLDER VERSIONS WILL FORK AWAY. AFTER 1:00AM UTC, PLEASE MINE AND STAKE TO YOUR HEART‚ÄôS CONTENT. THIS REQUEST ONLY APPLIES TO TESTNET. FOR MAINNET, PROCEED AS USUAL.

This release has no mainnet changes, resolves issues that people using testnet have reported with the Ethereum/Rinkeby bridge, and is mandatory for those who wish to continue using testnet after transactions between the Verus and Rinkeby testnets resume flowing.

If you have pending transactions on the bridge, some requested conversions may come back as refunded, and you should receive all amounts expected, less fees. We will not reset the testnet, but within an hour after this availability, the network will resume transaction imports/exports to and from Rinkeby, and anyone who continues running the old version may need to resync to testnet from scratch to continue. If you have upgraded to v0.8.0-4 or do so before connecting again to testnet, you should only see improvement without disruption.
.


[21-Oct-21 04:44 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
I want to thank everyone who participated already in using this testnet and bridge release. I hope we can keep that level of participation or more up, as it has been extremely helpful. Because of all that‚Äôs happened on this testnet to date, we were able to make a lot of progress in finding and resolving the following testnet issues in this release:

1. Enable support for much larger proofs than was previously possible from systems that either have large proofs required or significantly variable length proofs. Having this capability in the daemon will pave the way for more types of cross-chain proving in the future as well.
2. Fix failed refunds of conversion transactions attempted after a fractional currency launches, but before it‚Äôs preconversion phase is complete. If you sent transactions during this time, you may have stuck refunds that should flow after this upgrade.
3. Ensure that currencies are marked as ‚Äúlaunch complete‚Äù immediately after all preconversions have been processed, enabling normal conversions in all directions from that point forward.
4. Fix an issue that left some import notarizations incomplete and caused cross-chain transfers to wait longer than expected after some imports.
Improve and validate hardening.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

Update on couple of things we worked and issues fixed on this week:

1. Fixed the decryption and decoding error scenarios during deck shuffling in multiplayer gameplay. 
2. Fixed issues relate to betting and pot split.
3. Earlier BVV and player node threads run on the same thread, since im been using the same nodes for BVV nad players, to isolate the BVV functionalities made changes to BVV and now dealer handles the communication with BVV in a separate thread.
4. Done some cleaning, interms of removing the same hardcoded ports and constants at multiple places and clubbed them at a single place for readability.
5. Tested multiplayer with 3 players with shoshain, and with 5 players with my friends. The dealer can handle up to 9 players, but due to availability of players and nodes i tested with 5.
6. Biz is working on issues relate chips upstream changes.

Planned things in the coming weeks:
1. Fixing issues relate to multiplayer in the coming weeks while testing(I'll update the issues fixed on week by week). 
2. Finding out the details to host table for community testing, and explore the possibilities of hosting a small poker tournament within the community.
3. On CHIPS front, getting new upstream code fully functional and ready.

Note: If anyone is not aware, anyone can be dealer and anyone can host the private tables and play with your friends. Being a dealer you can set your own incentive on the pot amount, so if anyone interested in poker please invest sometime understanding this platform.

:Tokel:  MANDATORY FULL NODE UPDATE :Tokel: 

We kindly ask that everybody that is running a Tokel full node (including Notary Nodes), please update their nodes with the latest code. These updates are not hard forking changes, but they are required for nSPV to provide the information for our token wallet (and subsequent dapp features) to work correctly. Along with some nSPV changes, we have also enabled nodes to identify time-locked transactions, created customized `tokeld` and `tokel-cli` commands for people to use, and changed what were previously 'cc addresses' to 'cc index keys', meaning they will have a 'C' prefixing them instead of what was an 'R' and could be confused with a users coin address. A full list of updates can be found in the github and summarised below.

- added 'requestId' field into nSPV protocol v5 messages to provide multiple endpoints in the nSPV client app
- better error handling in nSPV protocol v5 
- bitgo-kmd javascript library updated for nSPV protocol v5
- Build of customised tokeld, tokel-cli binaries (Tokel chain params are passed in configure)
- nspv maxrecords param added to listunspent, listtransactions
- missing cs_main locks fixed in nspv
- nspv rate limiter allows N req/sec
- new gettransactionsmany nspv method
- new C-prefix added for cc index keys (former 'cc addresses')
- added support for CLTV transactions to the daemon wallet and nSPV protocol

@everyone Announcing immediate availability of GUI and CLI for all platforms of the NON-MANDATORY v0.8.0-5 UPDATE - ONLY REQUIRED FOR THOSE CONTINUING TO HELP GET TESTNET READY FOR MAINNET -- We want to thank the Verus Community for bearing with the number of updates we've had to get the bridge to Ethereum working smoothly. This release both fixes the remaining known bridge issues and adds security to ensure that you don't send to an unspendable address on any network by using the wrong format for a destination.
The good news is that throughout the whole process of this first bridge release on testnet, we've been able to update through the issues we've seen without a reset and have not lost a single satoshi of test funds (which is not to say it is fully hardened quite yet). At this point, we hope and believe that this is the last update in this round of testnet, which will allow us to get back to focusing on the mainnet release and not asking those testing to update until we are very close to a mainnet release.
Once more, we will ask that you shut down the old version now, and **FOR YOUR OWN BENEFIT AND THAT OF THE TESTNET, PLEASE DO NOT MINE ON TESTNET USING THIS VERSION UNTIL 5:00 AM UTC** we will restart the notarizations and transaction flow between Ethereum and Verus at 5:00 AM UTC.
Thank you to everyone who helped with all the testing and exposing of issues that enabled us to make maybe even inconveniently quick progress.

:Tokel:  Komodo hodler airdrop:komodo: 

Dear Tokelers, Tokelists and Tokelites,

As promised, the 8 million Tokel ($TKL) airdrop for all participating KMD holders is underway and you should be able to see your airdropped TKL funds in the same address that you hold KMD in.

The airdrop rewards amount is based on the Komodo blockchain snapshot that occurred at 1:17pm on the 26th August 2021 UTC.

For every 1 KMD you held at the time listed above, you would receive ~0.06277 TKL.
You can use the following website to check your address and see how much TKL you received as part of the airdrop.
<https://dexstats.info/assetviewer.php>

These are exciting times for the Tokel and Komodo Platforms. Not just because of the growing community but also because of the anticipated All-In-One application releases that will enable the easy creation, storage and movement of tokens and NFTs. This smart UTXO, gas-less, inexpensive, easy to use technology is brought to both the Komodo ecosystem and to the wider cryptocurrency/blockchain ecosystem as a whole. 

The Tokel Team.

**nSVP Application Update**

The development team at Tokel is super excited to announce the alpha release of the token wallet. 

This release took longer than we anticipated mainly due to major backend changes while integrating bitgo-komodo-cc-lib, which is developed by dimxy in collaboration with the Tokel Platform. 

This release allows you to: 
1) Hold tokens in your wallet and
2) Send tokens between wallets

Please download the latest version here: https://github.com/TokelPlatform/tokel_dapp/releases

--- In case you experience any issues with transactions, always make sure you double check what happened using the explorer https://explorer.tokel.io/. You can search by transaction id, address or token id.

The application is an Alpha version and you should expect to see minor bugs. Please report all of your findings here in the discord, or create a github issue. You can check https://github.com/tokelPlatform/tokel_app/issues to see if the issue you came across has been already reported. If not, feel free to create a new issue and ping us.

We are planning for quick iterations with bug fixes and other updates soon after this release.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

Update on couple of things we worked on this week.

1. Added `./bet help` with detailed examples for every command.
2. Integrated the iniparser from barry's config repo, created ini configuration files for better readability.
3. Added documentation about various components on bet, you can follow the readme, below are some important links. With this one can setup and run their private tables.
    Steps to setup player node: 
    https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/blob/master/docs/protocol/player_setup.md
    Steps to setup dealer node: 
    https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/blob/master/docs/protocol/dealer_setup.md
4. @Biz made a good progress on komodo notarization issue, which he is testing with shoshain.

Planned things in the coming weeks:
1. At the moment we are handling bet backend using multiple threads with mutex'es. I'm going through details about libevent, which is apt for bet to implement event based mechanisms. I see adding this will improve more user experice as I can notify & respond to the player at any point in the game & setup.
1. Fixing issues relate to multiplayer in the coming weeks while testing(I'll update the issues fixed on week by week). 
2. Finding out the details to host table for community testing, and explore the possibilities of hosting a small poker tournament within the community.
3. On CHIPS front, getting new upstream code fully functional and ready.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

Update on couple of things we worked on this week.

1. Added more systematic approach of error handling in bet. So far the error handling mechanisms were implemented for all the player side functionalities.
2. Added password based private table setup, where dealers can configure the password in dealer_config.md and share to players and players use that password(configured in player_setup.md) to join the private tables.
Link: https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/blob/master/docs/protocol/player_setup.md#joining-the-private-table
3. Satinder provided the precompiled binaries for chips, ln and bet. I tested chips and bet binaries and those are working as expected.
4. Added the guide to download the precompiled binaries and to download the bootstrap node, with this the CHIPS setup on linux is almost instant.
    Link: https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/blob/master/docs/protocol/release.md
5. Updated bet documentaion, doing bet code reviewing and cleaning parallely.
6. We started testing poker with community members, today I tested with Shoshain, this weekend hyperDEX and more community members are joining for testing.

Planned things in the coming weeks:
1. Finishing error handling of remaining modules of bet repo.
2. At the moment we are handling bet backend using multiple threads with mutex'es. I'm going through details about libevent, which is apt for bet to implement event based mechanisms. I see adding this will improve more user experice as I can notify & respond to the player at any point in the game & setup.
3. Fixing issues relate to multiplayer in the coming weeks while testing(I'll update the issues fixed on week by week). 
4. On CHIPS front, getting new upstream code fully functional and ready.

Note: This weekend, Saturday at 8 AM UTC, we doing the poker testing among community memebers, interested members can participate.

[06-Nov-21 09:47 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
@everyone We are preparing to release the Verus Vault upgrade to mainnet in days, with the ability to lock your funds in a VerusID so they cannot be spent but can still stake while locked. This upgrade will also include the worldwide, on-chain, VerusID and NFT Marketplace Protocol upgrade to mainnet, while adding it to the PBaaS testnet as well.
.
We want to let everyone using testnet and the Ethereum bridge know that it is a good time to start sending any Rinkeby Ethereum or USDC that you may have sent to the current Verus testnet back to Rinkeby if you intend to keep using those coins after the testnet reset. If testnet were a mainnet with actual value in the coins, of course we would upgrade and maintain the same bridge, but since it is not, it is much less work and more efficient to reset testnet and create an entirely new bridge. Since we don't intend to continue running nodes or Ethereum notaries on the old testnet after reset, any test coins not sent back to Ethereum should be considered burned if you don't get them off of Verus testnet before reset. Any that you do send to Rinkeby before the reset can then be sent back to the testnet after the new bridge is launched.
.
In case you haven't heard of the new VerusID and NFT Marketplace protocol, this is a brand new Verus-exclusive, z-address capable, peer to peer transparent or private on-chain atomic exchange protocol, which will allow listing, buying, selling, auctions, and trading of VerusIDs with or without NFT content entirely on-chain with no middleman besides the blockchain and no fees besides transaction fees. On testnet and when PBaaS goes live, it will also complement the Verus DeFi protocol AMMs with atomic P2P exchange of any currencies.
.
Payments and offers can use z-addresses for native currency, and legal contracts and rights can be bound to IDs and/or NFTs, making Verus the first network we know of to offer private, middleman-free, on-chain commerce of all forms.

I want to clarify based on some questions we've had... we expect the release with this mainnet upgrade to come out in the next 1 or 2 days, barring any surprise. The actual upgrade height for the Verus Vault and Verus ID/NFT marketplace to go live on mainnet is currently set to block 178700, which is expected on Monday, November 22nd. That block height and target date will be confirmed when the release is available.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

Update on couple of things worked on this week.

1. Error handling for the entire bet repo is completed. Addressed all the known possible scenarios.
2. Provided the option to configure BB to the dealer and enforced 200BB as table stack size for every hand, so now at the start of every hand each player will be having 400 table chips to play.
3. Added support for the customized player names in the BE, player now can configure the names in the BE at player_config.ini file which can be visible to other players during the game play, the corresponding support on GUI is yet to be added, logged the issue regarding the same: https://github.com/chips-blockchain/pangea-poker/issues/505
4. Added support to multiple tables, which means player now can choose one dealer from the list of available dealers. Since the GUI support for this is not added yet, the BE now takes the first dealer in the list of available dealers and joins its table. 
    Corresponding GUI issue is here: https://github.com/chips-blockchain/pangea-poker/issues/504
5. Fixed the crashing issues relate to debain, pushed the corresponding changes.
6. Been exploring the possibility of playing bet on ln, we got some suggestion from ln dev, so now from windows using linux shell i can able to connect to the remote ln node, though it doesn't fully solve the problem but we now have at least the possibility of using bet on windows.

Planned things in the coming weeks:
1. Focus is to fix the remaining logged issues in this weeks testing.
2. Getting hands on with libevent code to integrate it into bet.

@everyone **Announcing MANDATORY Verus v0.9.0 Mainnet Release of Verus Vault and the on-chain NFT and ID Marketplace**
TO REMAIN CONNECTED TO THE MAINNET VERUS BLOCKCHAIN, YOU MUST UPGRADE FULL NODES TO v0.9.0 OR LATER BY BLOCK 1796400, which is expected to occur on or around Monday, November 29th at 6:15PM UTC.

**Verus ID and NFT Marketplace**
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don‚Äôt worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It‚Äôs the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure funds storage model in the digital world.

**Verus Vault**
With Verus Vault you can now protect funds on a VerusID, even from theft of a private key! If you lock your VerusID with Vault you cannot spend funds from that identity at all until it is again unlocked. While locked, you can still stake those same funds on the Verus network and earn by doing so. Of course, you can also still receive funds. 

**IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT ENABLING REVOCATION, RECOVERY, AND ALL VERUS VAULT CAPABILITIES REQUIRE YOU TO HAVE ONE PRIMARY IDENTITY, AND AT LEAST ONE REVOCATION/RECOVERY ID CONFIGURED.**


[15-Nov-21 12:11 AM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
A locked VerusID can always be revoked and recovered by its revocation and recovery authority identities, which circumvents the lock. At the same time, anyone with only the primary keys, even a multisig of primary keys must first unlock, then wait for the predetermined unlock time before they can spend or access funds. This gives you, or maybe a company that specializes in watching the blockchain to whom you've assigned the revocation ID time to revoke and recover whenever an unauthorized unlock occurs. That means that like a bank, setting a 24 hour unlock delay on your locked IDs actually provides the first decentralized solution to the infamous 5 dollar wrench attack.

In addition to a new level of blockchain protection and decentralized funds recovery, Verus Vault provides the same security for your IDs and NFTs as well as time locks for other purposes, such as vesting schedules, trusts, and inheritance. With Verus Vault, you can now protect and recover your funds, preserving all your assets and generational blockchain wealth from common forms of crypto loss or theft, no bank required.

**Testnet Reset**
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

- Linux: ~/.Komodo/vrsctest, ~/.verustest
- Mac OS: ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/vrsctest, ~/Library/Application\ Support/VerusTest
- Windows 10: %AppData%\Roaming\Komodo\vrsctest\, %AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest or %AppData%\Komodo\vrsctest\, %AppData%\Roaming\VerusTest

[16-Nov-21 04:28 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
@everyone We clearly underestimated the demand for the Verus Self Sovereigns. Our plan to date was to enable the community and early contributors to have access to the first Verus Gold NFTs with all of their capabilities while still being able to afford them, since this project was made by its community. We worked in recent weeks to understand how many community members really wanted one by asking in every recent marketing meeting, where we could only explain plans in progress and expected pricing, not final numbers.

After 15 people committed, we established a plan to make a shared identity model, make 20 available to the community in case others committed, sell any that the community didn't buy, and auction 5, donating proceeds the Foundation at prices some of us expected would be out of reach for many community members.

As a result of the overwhelming response from the meeting today and the fact that we far exceeded demand for 20 from the community, we are changing the plan. We do have a real limit of 25 in this round, given the NFT and shared ID model. That is not something we can change without changing more than we plan to do.

As a result, we have decided to forego the auction of those 5 additional physical NFTs to benefit the Foundation and instead make 5 more from this round available to all we can who have said they want to commit to one today. Since we have more demand than even that will satisfy, VerusGear will make another run of 25 with all of the same features, same design, and a different shared identity than the first. Please contact @rozo to secure your spot on the second run of physical gold NFTs. To ensure that everyone has a fair chance, they had previously limited purchase to one per person and will keep that limit in place at least until we plan for a next run in the future. If any coins of this round are not committed to community members by November 23rd, all remaining physical NFTs will be sold at public auction.


[16-Nov-21 04:28 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
We have also agreed with @rozo that Verus Gear will increase the pre-sale availability of Silver Self Sovereigns to 200 available instead of 100 and the bronze to 300 instead of 250. This increase will only apply to community demand for pre-sales, since we're seeing more demand for all of the physical coins than we expected. With these changes, @rozo says he should be able to have the site for ordering live at 10:00AM PST / 1:00PM EST / 6:00PM UTC tomorrow. If you want to secure a Gold Self Sovereign of the second 25, it is important that you let @rozo know. All people who committed in this round but couldn't get in have priority for the next, and after that, all orders will be first come first until November 23rd. Thank you!

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

Update on couple of things worked during this week.

1. Provided an option to configure min, max table stake in BB to the dealer, the default min table stake is set to 20 BB, max table stake is set to 100BB in dealer_config.ini and those values can be changed. Player can then set any amount b/w [20-100BB] in player_config.ini to join the table.
2. Fixed the -ve balances appearing after the player rejoin issue bet#issue#310
3. Fixed the game stuck issue mentioned in the bet#issue#310
4. Handled all the pot split scenarios and created a follow up issue for GUI that need minor changes: https://github.com/chips-blockchain/pangea-poker/issues/506. 

Planned things in the coming weeks:
1. Focus is to fix couple of issues left related to gameplay. 
2. Getting hands on with libevent code to integrate it into bet.

[29-Nov-21 10:18 AM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
@everyone Thank you to all who have helped us get here!
We are waiting the imminent activation of Verus Vault and VerusID Marketplace technology on mainnet. We expect activation in just a few minutes at block 1796400. All looks good on the network, and as some of you know, we have been working hard in the background on a final upgrade to make both use of the marketplace and Verus Vault easier and a better experience for everyone, even with some inevitable user errors. While we expect both protocols to activate and operate just fine on the network, we have finished our testing on an upgrade with easier Vault usage and GUI support for seeing and accepting ID offers. We hope to have v0.9.0-2 out within the next 1-3 hours, and we are recommending that for the best experience with these new technologies, you wait to upgrade before you start exercising these functions on mainnet yourself. This will ensure that you can use the new command ‚Äúsetidentitytimelock‚Äù, which is intended to make setting and unlocking VerusID timelocks easier to use and understand and also that command errors return errors rather than try to enter offers. This release also exposes the marketplace in your GUI, so that you can see and accept network-wide offers on the IDs you currently hold. All of us have been trying to bring this to our community over a weekend that has included holidays, and we appreciate your patience in waiting just an hour or two to ensure that you have a better experience yourselves. Thank you!


[29-Nov-21 11:50 AM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
Due to some hard coded variables in nanominer and SRBminer, two projects which I and many other community developers are not familiar with, those miners have stopped working on this network upgrade and will need to be updated with likely a one line change before they resume being used. If you are using those miners, please choose an alternate, such as CCMiner, Hellminer, and NHeqminer for now. If you happen to know the developers of those miners, please ask them to reach out to me or core community developers, so that in the future, they can ensure that their miners are not hard coded and can continue to maintain normal operation with coming upgrades.

@everyone Announcing NON-MANDATORY, RECOMMENDED Verus v0.9.0-2. This release is considered non-mandatory but IS RECOMMENDED for mainnet users, Komodo notaries, and is mandatory for testnet users to ensure reliable connection to the current testnet.
TO REMAIN CONNECTED TO THE MAINNET VERUS BLOCKCHAIN, YOU MUST UPGRADE FULL NODES TO v0.9.0 OR LATER. IF YOU HAVE NOT UPDATED AND ATTEMPTED TO STAY CONNECT TO MAINNET, YOU MAY NEED TO BOOTSTRAP OR RESYNC YOUR NATIVE WALLET OR NODE AFTER UPGRADING.

**New Command and API for Verus Vault - setidentitytimelock**
v0.9.0-2 introduces a new command and RPC API, "setidentitytimelock". setidentitytimelock may be used to set a time unlock delay, set a lock until a specific block height, or unlock a delayed timelock on a VerusID under your control.

You can use setidentitytimelock in one of two ways, using the native client terminal under coin settings:
`run setidentitytimelock '{"unlockatblock":1796500}' (returntx)`
or
`run setidentitytimelock '{"setunlockdelay":1440}' (returntx)`
or
`run setidentitytimelock '{"unlockatblock":0}' (returntx)`

The first example will lock the ID until the block specified. If the block specified is in the past, the ID will not be locked. (returntx) is an optional true or false parameter that provides an option of returning the transaction to be signed by other controlling keys.

The second example will set a 1440 block unlock delay, which will be needed to wait before spending funds controlled by the ID after unlocking the ID (about one day unlock time).
The third example will unlock an ID that has been locked with an unlock delay, and the unlock time will be set to the block height at which the ID was unlocked + the originally set unlock delay.


[29-Nov-21 04:02 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
**Verus ID and NFT Marketplace**
Buy and sell VerusIDs on-chain, advertising your offer directly to the owner of an ID or NFT, or posting the sale of your NFT on the worldwide blockchain for all the world to see. Execute transactions in a completely decentralized way. Pay or offer to pay from a transparent or zero-knowledge private address, still auditable by you. Accept payment to either as well, and best of all, execute your transactions directly, peer-to-peer without any intermediary necessary. Don‚Äôt worry the on-chain model still makes room for owners to select and share proceeds with value added agents, marketing organizations, or other participants in a new economy of provable digital ownership. It‚Äôs the next step in the evolution of VerusID, the most powerful self-sovereign identity and secure storage model for funds in the digital world.

**GUI support for offer acceptance**
Offers for identities are viewable under ID info under the "Offers" tab

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

Update on couple of things worked during this week. 

1. A dull week from my end due to bit sickness. I Majorly made few changes to improve the code readability like adding swtich to handle strings to replace if else ladder based string comparisons, removing the magic numbers across the repo with defined constants, etc...
2. Started working on incorporating event based handling of backend communication using libevent.
3. Handling the issues relate to the LN address mismatch, the LN command getinfo, returning NULL in the addresses when the LN is bind to more than 1 IPv4 address. Hnadled this special case scenarios with defining and handling ERR_LN_ADDRESS_TYPE_MISMATCH.
4. Biz is working on taproot activation.
5. cipi helped in listing the chips at nomics, you can track the chips price here  https://nomics.com/assets/chips6-chips/markets
6. You can also find the discussion on addressing the dependency on the static IP is here: https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/issues/285

Planned things in the coming weeks:
1. Integrating libevent with the BE.

@everyone The Pirate Chain team has secured a new code security review by an external third party for Treasure Chest Wallet. 

Reviews are part of the development process and occur occasionally to ensure that all parts of the code are scrutinized as much as possible. 

**Read more here:** https://pirate.black/code-security-review-pirate-wallet/

*Are More Audits Needed?*
*The short answer is, yes. To complete the audit cycle Pirate Chain needs to undergo one final external audit of its core code. To do this a total of $145,000 is required for cybersecurity experts Halborn to do the review. So far 32% of the total has been already raised.*

*To contribute to this audit, donate here:* https://pirate.black/donations/peer-review-code-audit/

@everyone Last night, Safe.Trade opened both USDT and DAI stable coin trading pairs for VRSC, making it even easier to go from USD to Verus and back. In fact, it is now possible to use Verus Mobile to wire from your bank account to your wallet and with Safe.Trade alone, go from there to Verus, no other exchange or even BTC needed. Since these pairs were just opened last night and announced today with no artificial liquidity, there is a tiny bit of ask volume and no bid volume to speak of yet. Hopefully, our community can help with that and also spread the word. If you're looking to purchase VRSC, please consider spreading your orders between BTC and stable coins to get better overall results and help provide market liquidity at the same time. Thank you!

Tokel is happy to announce a new listing for tokenization cryptocurrency TKL on the DEX-Trade exchange.
DEX-Trade is a centralized exchange based in London, UK that features many cryptocurrencies and tokens.

https://dex-trade.com/refcode/uk7ztz

Note: Whilst some centralized exchanges are necessary for the advancement of the project we always recommend using decentralized exchanges such as https://atomicdex.io/ when possible, because you can hold your funds using your own keys.

1/ Privacy-by-default helps with better anonymity and privacy. It gives the choice of doing shielded and transparent transactions. It is pretty-good-privacy. @ZcashFoundation's efforts are strongly moving towards "Privacy-by-default".

[24-Dec-21 04:11 AM] CHIPS #announcements#0000
Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

Made some progress on libevent integration. 

1. Added the timer functionality in the backend, which has been integrated in the following scenarios at the moment
        a. In finding the dealer nodes when the player node starts. So with that the player won't wait indefinitely, after period of wait(10 s) with max number of retries(3) the player node exits on failure.
        b. In the Dispute Resolution Protocol, where in scenarios player nodes interact with the cashier nodes. This can avoid hangout of the players if any of the cashier node gets crashed.
2. libevent integration into bet - WIP.

Planned things in the coming weeks:
1. Continue working on libevent integration.
2. Adding nSPV support to CHIPS.

Repos to track our development
GUI - https://github.com/chips-blockchain/pangea-poker
BET - https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet (master, multiplayer, pred_bet, libevent branches)

Anyone think $KMD could pull off a wicked pump to $10, kinda like $ARRR did in May? They have about the same coin circulation and #ARRR is built on #KMD platform but has a bigger market cap. KMD very undervalued rn, using z-knowledge proof.

Exchanges are the biggest threat against Bitcoin.
Exchanges stole your money.
Exchanges destroy the real UX beside Bitcoin.
Exchanges will cooperate with States when they will ask to block your cryptocurrencies and give you paper as replacement. https://t.co/m5hINc2LQ4

[31-Dec-21 04:03 AM] CHIPS #announcements#0000
Hello @everyone 


Timeout future in the backend, some hangout scenarios are addressed with the event based approach. So mostly we done with the part of libevent integration. I feel we have very stable backend and GUI, easy scripts and setup to install.  So we should chalk out the ways to organize and play poker tournaments. 

Planned things in the coming weeks:
1. Work with gui dev to fix the GUI related issues.
2. Adding nSPV support to CHIPS.
3. Expose the API's needed to for blackjack in the backend.

Repos to track our development
GUI - https://github.com/chips-blockchain/pangea-poker
BET - https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet (master, multiplayer, pred_bet, libevent branches)
CHIPS - https://github.com/chips-blockchain/chipschain (master, dev branches)

bridging spreadsheet is done, these are what I've found to be the best routing for slippage/fees and liquidity

please feel free to comment on the sheet if you think a particular routing is better, I'll be updating somewhat frequently

@TheDesertLynx Hey Joel
Why not add the Komodo atomic swap feature to the Dash?
Why not use this feature? So that we too have atomic swaps.
I talked to them and they agree. They even create atomic swaps in our name.
They provide atomic swap capability for our core network

@coinexcom We'd be happy to setup a call and walk you through the @AtomicDEX. It already features crosschain swaps between Polygon, BSC, ERC, AVAX, and many more ecosystems. It even let's you swap EVM for non-EVM coins like BTC without bridges.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

I'm mainly been working on the following topics:

1. Libp2p integration, which solves the problem of dependency on IP with openDHT(https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet/issues/285).
2. Understanding and design the message flow for blackjack.

Planned things in the coming weeks:
1. Work with gui dev to fix the GUI related issues.
2. Adding nSPV support to CHIPS.
3. Expose the API's needed to for blackjack in the backend.

Repos to track our development
GUI - https://github.com/chips-blockchain/pangea-poker
BET - https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet (master, multiplayer, pred_bet, libevent branches)
CHIPS - https://github.com/chips-blockchain/chipschain (master, dev branches)

**Development update** @everyone 

Dear Community! ‚ô•Ô∏è 

Long time no see üòä 
We hope everyone had a good break and is already settled back in the work mode. We certainly all have and are ready to climb new ‚õ∞Ô∏è  this year. 

**Login system**
One big feature which is nearing its completion is the Login system. Currently we are working on adding multi-account functionality so you can add different accounts and tie them with different wallets. This is an important feature and we have to make sure it is well done and secure. Among other security measures we are also creating brute force protection and local password encryption. We will have the Login functionality QA'd and tested by a few Komodo team members to ensure it is thoroughly checked before we release it.

**Website re-design**
We are also working on website re-design, as our current website does not communicate well what we are trying to achieve. It will include information for individuals, businesses and developers. We will create integration tutorials for developers and will give examples of business use cases that businesses can implement.

**Time Lock transactions**
We will be modifying wallet design to take into account that some funds can be time locked. 

*Following are the features we want to work on in this sprint, but it depends how the above goes.*

**Localization**
As per your requests we will be adding support for different languages.

**App support and maintenance** 
There are various repeating errors haunting the dApp, which we will address as soon as we have capacity for it. If you experience an error, please have a look in github if it is already tracked and if not, please report it.

[19-Jan-22 10:03 AM] Pirate #announcements#0000
@everyone We are currently crafting a response to the DMCA notice filed by a competitor project to our pirate repository on GitHub. 

While we work through the process, we created a new repo (https://gitlab.com/piratenetwork_mirror), removed all of the cited code, and released an updated version based on that code. Website wallet links already reflect this temporary change.

GitHub follows a standard procedure regardless of the validity of the claims. To maintain its safe harbor status it must remove the cited repository within 1 business day until the repository has been changed or a counter-notice has been filed. After a counter-notice has been filed. The original filing party must initiate legal action or the repository will be restored in 10-14 days.

FAQ
Q-1: What is a DMCA takedown?
A-1: Read more here: https://www.dmca.com/FAQ/What-is-a-DMCA-Takedown

Q-2: What happens now?
A-2: For end-users nothing changes, the Pirate team will work through the standard processes the DMCA takedown claim requires and wait for GitHub to restore our repository since no license or law was broken. Everything will continue to operate as before. Users don't have to take any action.

Q-3: Is guilt being admitted by making a new repo on GitLab?
A-3: NO, the new repository on GitLab was simply made so users can continue to access our code uninterruptedly. We've also removed all of the cited code and released an updated version based on that code there. That action was taken so the new temporary repository on GitLab won't be taken down as well until the DMCA claim has been dealt with.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

I'm majorly exploring the ways to make the game easy to play. I repeat we have the fully developed game, what we lack is how we can bundle all these repos into one and some easy setup. 
The more I read about the claims of decentralized poker games, I have this FOMO of why its not been happening despite we have game tested and played on the main chain. 
To this date I have tested, played 414 games and here is the link where you can see the settlement transactions of it: https://explorer.chips.cash/address/RSdMRYeeouw3hepxNgUzHn34qFhn1tsubb.

Apart from this I see there is some development going on nSPV, hopefully it brings light clients to the ecosystem.

Planned things in the coming weeks:
1. To make poker usable and playable.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

I'm majorly working on possible ways to improve the CHIPS usability and studying the existing claims of decentralized platforms. I worked on couple of things this week:
1. Tested the curve25519 player side crypto operations in browser to evaluate the possibility of rewriting player poker logic in the web. I didn't see much complications of developing player side of bet as webapp.
2. It's very important for us to know how we want this game to be played, if at all can we do it in the browser or not. Please have a look into the architecture document attached and please share your views on it. 
3. Satinder and dimxy are exploring the chips light client stuff.

Planned things in the coming weeks:
1. To make poker usable and playable.

‚ú® **NEW dAPP VERSION RELEASED!** ‚ú®

Hi @everyone  üëã

This is a minor, but very important release, of the Tokel dApp. It includes lots of bug fixes that the community raised and helped us track down:

- üì° nSPV/network connection should work better now, with less timeouts. Let us know!
- üñºÔ∏è IPFS media for tokens and NFTs should always load now (provided there‚Äôs someone broadcasting the file), even if your local IPFS node doesn‚Äôt work, as we added a gateway fallback
- ‚õèÔ∏è Some wallets containing lots of miner inputs were having problems to login. This should be fixed now.
- üí∏ The fee estimation for token creation in the dApp now accounts for the marker fee as well
- üí∞Ô∏è The huge transaction values you see on your activity are fixed now _(sorry, I guess?)_
- ‚úèÔ∏è Some typos found and fixed
- ‚õîÔ∏è If you create a token with no collection or number, we'll now omit this data from being written the blockchain instead of writing empty fields
- ‚õìÔ∏è TKLTEST is gone! Selecting TKLTEST as your network will now default to TKLTEST2 (where we‚Äôre testing new exciting stuff)

Thanks to all community members for engaging in raising issues and helping us track them down. We're busy working on new features behind the scenes, but please do let us know of any new shiny bugs for us to hunt. üêõ

**Also, this is another reminder that full nodes must update their codebase from the Tokel Github repo ASAP. There are currently about 15 nodes that have not updated and need to.**

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

In continuation to the discussion on the proposal to develop webapp and to proceed any further, i didn't see much response. So i'm back to looking into libp2p and to integrate into bet. Apart from that i'm writing the high level architecture documentation(which I feel i should have done it much earlier).

I tested playing poker purely on chips blockchain without using the lightning network for invoice payments, so what i tested is this, whatever the lighning invoices which we pay is to record the player move for non-repudiation purpose, so for this what i done is i created a data tx whenever player made the move so with that all the moves during the game are recorded on the blockchain and it comes with a cost that is for every move there is a chips tx fee and chips block time wait(considering the chips block wait time and chips tx fee, i see both are very good trade off if we can improve the usability considering we have now only bet and chips).  

Planned things in the coming weeks:
1. To make poker usable and playable.

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

In continuation to the discussion of removal of ln and make every game of poker recorded in the chips blockchain, here is the progress made so far on this topic.
1. Replaced the ln API calls mentioned here(https://github.com/sg777/bet/blob/master/docs/protocol/upgrade.md#ln-upgrade) and add the method `bet` which contains the player bet info during the round. So on every bet a chips tx with the data part containing bet is recorded on the chips blockchain.
2. Adding the mechanism to filter out the specific gaming related tx's based on the table id(so this info further can be used to resolve any disputes) - WIP. 

Planned things in the coming weeks:
1. To make poker usable and playable.
2. Release of bet without ln, I see its much easier to play this time.
    a. Demo of bet without ln, by showcasing the moves on chips mainnet - Feb 3rd week.
    b. Release of binaries, usage and testing guide - Feb 4th week.

Friday Development Update (1/2)

Hello @everyone 

Now the game is available to test without ln. In order to test please take the following repos.

CHIPS - https://github.com/chips-blockchain/chipschain (use `allow_dust` branch)
BET - https://github.com/chips-blockchain/bet (use `chips` branch)

Use the below mining script by placing the your address to mine the dust transactions incase if those are stuck in mempool(This is for temporarily, we soon provide the permanent fix for it)
```
#!/bin/bash
  
date
echo started in ${DIR}

while true; do
        chips-cli generatetoaddress 200 'bShmT4pRfT694Zb7SxKz3Bnk2543NLtLeA' 1000000
done
exec bash
```

So with this, we majorly eliminated the setup risks, will check with Satinder and share the binaries soon to test directly with the binaries on both windows and linux.

@pbca26 completed the showcasing the gaming transactions on the explorer.So with this one can see info about all the games played on the explorer. Right now the explorer is updating the info in batches for every 5 mins, it will soon be updated instantly on every block mined.(copy pasted what pbca26 said)

i've added extract_tx_data to CHIPS explorer as you asked http://explorer.komodoplatform.com:20000/gameinfo/CHIPS
i wasn't sure how to represent all data in each transaction so i'm just rendering it in blocks one by one
i guess in future we can do something fancy like https://camo.githubusercontent.com/6bc2ab04628c7881e6920d53d4c771ade17b58a0896a0a3c0393e0e040d86402/68747470733a2f2f6e6f72626572742e6465762f63686970735f706f6b65724032782e6a7067
if anyone has comments/suggestions for layout and/or how to make it look better/clearer do let me know

@everyone Pirate Wallet for iOS developed by Meshbits Team is running much stabler than before, and we are now focusing on translating it's interface to as many languages as possible. There has been already efforts towards this, and @SHossain has been coordinating with several community members to translate the English language file to different international languages.
Earlier on Pirate Wallet for iOS's development I managed the translation by coordinating with some amazing Pirate Chain community members, but since then the wallet has been refactored so much that it needs the translations done fresh. So, anyone who would like to help translate this wallet to their own language, please be in touch with me or @SHossain.
We will be much thankful for your help and efforts. üôè 
Thanks a ton for helping so far in our journey to fill the gaps to make Pirate Chain accessible to people on more possible devices/Operating Systems. üòÉ 

Cheers,
- Satinder

Hello Hello!

First of all apologies for the lack of updates.

Our team has been sick and some of us went down with Covid ü¶† so the progress has been a bit slow lately. I personally was out for a week while some of other team members for longer. 

Nevertheless ‚≠êÔ∏èwe do have some **exciting news** for you.Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è  

üöÄ **New website**
We are going to launch  our **updated website** in the coming weeks. We wanted that to be a surprise therefore the designs or the progress wasn't publicly shared. Of course we want your feedback once we launch it to make sure we communicate all of our values.

üï∫üèº**Collection Manager**
We are currently working on **improving user experience when creating collections **as that has been a frequent request from the community. 

The new Collection Manager designs will be shared with the community soon in order to get your feedback!

üß™ **Community testing **
We have been posting about the testing a while ago but it had to be  postponed due to the circumstances mentioned above. We are still going to conduct testing in the coming weeks and I will reach out to everyone who was interested and who messaged me that they want to participate.

Stay tuned for more news and updates.

We hope everyone is safe and sound in these uncertain times! ü§ó

Following things have been finished this week.

1. Handling the errors and bug fixes in bet_without_ln
2. Raised the PR to allow dust tx's for chips.
3. Made changes in providing all the tables hosted by all the dealers in the system with the status of the each table(This has to be implemented on the GUI side for the player to chose a table from multiple available tables).
4. Biz raised the PR's to handle the compilation issues on chips repo which has are been tested and merged.

Note: Since the changes are made to allow the dust transactions, I request the miners to please update their chips mining nodes.

[05-Mar-22 10:08 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
@everyone **ANNOUNCING NON-MANDATORY, RECOMMENDED FOR MAINNET, MANDATORY FOR TESTNET PBAAS UPGRADE v0.9.1**

**Testnet Featuring Verus PBaaS -- The most powerful and interoperable currency, blockchain, and ERC20 launch, scale, and MEV-resistant DeFi platform to exist, all with no programming required!**

*v0.9.1 improves mainnet bootstrap and GUI backup/restore user experience but does not upgrade mainnet protocols and is not a required update for mainnet-only users. It is required to use the public testnet. IF YOU HAVE ALREADY USED TESTNET WITH PRIOR VERSIONS, MAKE SURE TO DELETE AND CLEAR ANY EXISTING TESTNET DATA FOLDERS AS DESCRIBED BELOW.*

**Verus PBaaS Features Live on v0.9.1 Testnet**
- Provable or pseudonymous, identity-based currency, liquidity pool, NFT and multi-blockchain, fully decentralized network.
- On-chain 100% decentralized, launches with fair launch and/or crowdfunding options, on-chain auto-refund option for missed targets, automatic Ethereum ERC20 contract deployment, auto-created, MEV-resistant, liquidity baskets and even auto-bridged, merge mineable, fully independent rent-free PBaaS blockchain launches.
 - All DeFi AMM conversions are verified via mining and staking as part of the L1 consensus protocol. All conversions in a single liquidity basket are calculated simultaneously for all transactions in any given block, meaning all participants get the same price in all directions of conversion, with a minimum conversion fee of 0.025% and a maximum of 0.05%.
 - All currencies and identities are primitives at L1 and are validated and verified on UTXO transactions, which check all inputs and outputs just as single currency L1s, such as Ethereum or Bitcoin check the native currency inputs and outputs of transactions.
 - All currencies on all independent connected chains, once launched can be sent back and forth to other multi-currency capable networks (currently other independent PBaaS chains and Ethereum as ERC20s).


[05-Mar-22 10:08 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
- Currencies on Verus can also be defined as "mapped currencies", which map 1:1 to an existing currency on Ethereum (eg. DAI), and can then be sent from Ethereum with simple transactions and received and used as the new "mapped currency", or sent back to Ethereum and used there as the original currency. For example, I could make a currency called MyBucks and map it to DAI. It will always be provably mapped and convertible 1:1 to and from DAI by sending it to and from Verus to Ethereum.
 - Currency launches can raise funds in 3 ways. Each of these fundraising options creates a currency that is not 100% backed, and has a price that responds to market forces. 100% backed currencies do not change their relative price to the underlying basket reserve when they are converted to or from reserves. Fractionally backed currencies, which result from fundraising or endowing launch grants/pre-allocations to DAOs or entities such as foundations, whether time-locked or not, take their funding from a percentage of the reserve backing. Except in the case of a new blockchain launch, which creates new native currency for operating the proof of stake of the blockchain, any currency that uses fundraising options will be a fractionally backed currency which will appreciate when more people convert to it and depreciate when more convert from it. If a launch is refunded due to minimum participation options that are not met, no fundraising is received:


[05-Mar-22 10:09 PM] VerusCoin #announcements#0000
.
    - **Pre-launch discount** - all participants contributing to the launch before it goes live on its start block get a discount to the initial on-chain price of the currency. This is usually accompanied by a maximum cap on pre-conversion participation to ensure that the currency would still be in demand when it goes live.
    - **Pre-launch carve-out** - this enables a percentage of each of the initial participation currencies to be carved out of the launch and total reserve ratio in a price neutral manner and sent directly to the launching identity upon successful launch.
    - **Pre-allocation** - this enables some of the newly launched currency to be pre-allocated to one or more identities. If the currency is fractional, this happens in a price neutral manner, and again is subtracted from the reserve ratio. Recipients can optionally be time locked IDs for vesting or unlock periods.

**Testnet Reset**
To reset your testnet make sure Verus is closed (and no testnet daemon running) and delete the following directories, then restart the testnet daemon (or relaunch Verus Desktop, deactivate verustest and re-add verustest native):

Linux: `~/.Komodo/vrsctest`, `~/.verustest`

What is Pirate Chain?
Pirate Chain (ARRR) is a 100% private send cryptocurrency. It uses a privacy protocol that cannot be compromised by other users‚Äô activity on the network. Most privacy coins are riddled with holes created by optional privacy. Pirate Chain uses zk-SNARKs to shield 100% of the peer-to-peer transactions on the blockchain making for highly anonymous ...

Friday Development Update

Hello @everyone 

Following things have been finished this week.

1. Fixed all the errors related to bet_without_ln. Now one can play bet without needing ln. 
2. Added more fields while storing the game info onto the blockchain. Locally added the logic to filter out all the tx's based on the table_id. So what it mean is if you extract all the tx's data that contains the same table id, one basically can view all the bet and game info in the block chain. Showcasing this on the explorer is yet to be figured out.
