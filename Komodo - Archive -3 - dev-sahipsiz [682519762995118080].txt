this channels is for SAHIPSIZ -dexp2p network development. the goal is to be able to freely broadcast 5 minute video clips to all "subscribers". probably there wont be any coins needed for this usecase, but i will generate 1 million coins just in case, so we can have them setaside. due to the highly variable bandwidth and computer speeds of all the nodes at scale, i think it is best to use the file publish and subscribe method. the file sizes to test are 100 MB, 200MB, 300MB and we can see how big a file we can transfer reliably


[27-Feb-20 01:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i imagine most all users will be using windows, with a few using mac. so we would need an end user installer for windows and osx that get the SAHIPSIZ -dexp2p chain running. then there will be a few special pubkeys that will have a broadcast ability, so some way to specify a file to broadcast. then the rest of the nodes need a way to see what files have been published and to obtain that file. so the GUI should be quite simple. we will assume that once a user has a file on their computer they will be able to use a video player to view it


[27-Feb-20 01:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i think we have all the core tech needed to support this and since we arent using the streaming, it should just work as long as the file isnt too big

once we have an end user installer available, he will help recruit 100+ testers to verify the p2p network scales to that level and if it does, we can keep increasing the network size. also, he might be able to obtain several high performance servers that can be -addnode= in the commandline

sounds very interesting!
am I understand correct that some re-broadcasting in loop of same file is needed because of purging?


[27-Feb-20 02:25 AM] TonyL#3577
lets say we got purgetime 1 hour (or 24 hours) - publisher broadcasted file and nobody downloaded it. publisher will need to track this case and rebroadcast the file?


[27-Feb-20 02:26 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, broadcaster would just broadcast every 50 minutes


[27-Feb-20 02:26 AM] jl777c#5810
or maybe it is a settable parameter


[27-Feb-20 02:26 AM] TonyL#3577
`yes, broadcaster would just broadcast every 50 minutes` it might create duplicates if I understand correct


[27-Feb-20 02:26 AM] TonyL#3577
when we get list of all available files


[27-Feb-20 02:27 AM] TonyL#3577
now we want something more youtube-like if I understand correct


[27-Feb-20 02:28 AM] TonyL#3577
there are channels (pubkeys) - channels upload files and subscribers watch


[27-Feb-20 02:28 AM] TonyL#3577
I got an idea - what if there will be some "files_list" and each publisher can file_add file_remove to his fies_list


[27-Feb-20 02:29 AM] TonyL#3577
and then dapp on publisher side trying to broadcast files according to files_list


[27-Feb-20 02:33 AM] TonyL#3577
but it should not just rebroadcast permanently all files from list probably but check if it already purged from RAM or not


[27-Feb-20 02:35 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, something like that


[27-Feb-20 02:36 AM] jl777c#5810
can just check if a file is in the files DEX_list and if it isnt, then and only then publish again


[27-Feb-20 02:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i use this logic in subatomic dapp for handles


[27-Feb-20 02:37 AM] jl777c#5810
it checks to see if the handle is there already and if not, it broadcasts


[27-Feb-20 02:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess there can be a file like subatomic.json that has a list of approved pubkeys, due to bandwidth reasons, i think each -dexp2p network should be just for a single broadcaster


[27-Feb-20 02:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be good if the GUI can be localized and translated into turkish


[27-Feb-20 02:42 AM] jl777c#5810
this basic single broadcaster -dexp2p dapp can then be used as a template for any language and anybody that wants to set up a channel can easily do it. i guess the broadcaster would need to add the ip addresses of seed nodes and maybe that is the only broadcaster specific customization needed

For peers data we need a chain param first. then, we need participants to launch the chain. then, all nodes will be interconnected and peer IPs will be available.

@Tylor zkFS as I understand from the primary requirements, the idea is to directly broadcast videos to the user to load from the local computer.
m3u makes a playlist of both types, with local relative path to the media files and remote URLs. I don't understand how it will be good in this case.


[27-Feb-20 12:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And if someone from YouTube is moving to such p2p video sharing, to my views, that's to be sure that their content is accessible no matter what censorship is forced by host companies such as YouTube.

looks like it works on windows - but noticed strange behavior, after DEX_publish daemon stops to response on RPC calls (even if I publish 1 fragment file) until I press Ctrl+C in console with daemon - after I press this keys combination everything works fine


[29-Feb-20 10:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a something waits for a SIGINT


[29-Feb-20 10:37 AM] TonyL#3577
@Sir Seven it sounds somehow similar to the issue you've faced on windows with stop call - could you please try to press `Ctrl+C` in console window in which daemon was started next time you reproduce it manually?


[29-Feb-20 10:39 AM] TonyL#3577
So tomorrow will try to implement file uploading for windows via GUI and then if uploading works fine will proceed to downloading part


[01-Mar-20 01:55 AM] TonyL#3577
ok so uploading works on windows too

@jl777c 
Works just fine on both Win and Ubuntu for me.
One question:
Why not use fallback if %APPDATA%\dexp2p directory does not exist?
Looks like fallback `C:\tmp\dexp2p\filename`  atm works only if `%APPDATA%` env var is empty.

@TonyL the RPC should be up in 5 minutes

replace 130297024 with the id of the locators datablob
it can be found by filtering tagA= <filename> and tagB="locators"

this option worked for me and full file downloaded


[01-Mar-20 11:28 PM] TonyL#3577
does it mean "download from locator 0 till the end" ?

```
"kkk1" 0 0 013d344108b464875fadfb339cb41279e096b8b37c76d52bcc03600ab5cf8dce54
```
 it means the "locators datablob's id" is not supplied by the command
just the name of the file and publisher's pubkey is enough to find and download the file

it used to be that locators datablob's id was mandatory, but looks like jl changed it


[01-Mar-20 11:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it seemed that nobody could find the right id, so i made automatic. set id to 0 have the pubkey and it finds it for you

so now it's possible to upload and download files and files list refreshing automagically


[02-Mar-20 12:44 AM] TonyL#3577
in todo list: 
- fix progress bar for uploading on Linux (on windows it works fine but on linux not refreshing if user uploading > single file per session)
- add progress bar for downloading
- add few validations
- arrange elements some UX friendly way (now it's just packed automagically)
- add some configurator which starting daemon / checking if it started for needed P2P chain and etc

and now also it's not cleaning dexp2p folder with files because of funny crutch


[02-Mar-20 12:48 AM] TonyL#3577
but in general it's usable already for files transfer between multiple computers and I can make test .exe in a few hours

https://github.com/tonymorony/P2PFileShare-Py/releases/tag/0.0.1 bundled for Windows what I have now (tried on totally clean Windows 10 and it worked fine)

To test (on Windows):
1) Download zip archive https://github.com/tonymorony/P2PFileShare-Py/releases/download/0.0.1/komodo_p2p_filesexchange_v0.0.1.zip and unzip
2) Start FILET1 chain (there is precompiled daemon in zip archive):
`.\komodod -ac_name=FILET1 -dexp2p=2 -ac_supply=999999 -addnode=95.217.44.58`
3) Start application in console as `.\main.exe`
4) Try to upload/download files (files downloading to same folder with daemon as filename.publisherpubkey)


ac_name `FILET1` is hardcoded in this one (chain naming is not about the meat but "file test one")

`it seemed that nobody could find the right id, so i made automatic. set id to 0 have the pubkey and it finds it for you` hmm, interesting how it'll behave in such case if two+ different publishers will try to broadcast file with the same name (added to "to test" list)

@jl777c when two different files are being published at the same time, the `progress` key in the DEX_stats response is showing the progress of one or the other "randomly"


[02-Mar-20 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[02-Mar-20 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
this is expected


[02-Mar-20 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
you are only expected to publish one file at a time


[02-Mar-20 08:09 AM] gcharang#6833
got it. sending the stop command to the node while it is in the middle of publishing a file kills the RPC server
i.e., sending any command gives the error
```
error: couldn't connect to server: unknown (code -1)
(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)
```
 but the daemon keeps running


[02-Mar-20 08:09 AM] gcharang#6833
I guess till the file is completely published, but haven't verified that yet

[02-Mar-20 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
stop doesnt send a kill signal, for obvious reason


[02-Mar-20 08:19 AM] gcharang#6833
got it. the daemon exited by itself  sometime after stop command has been sent while a file is being published. but, looks like there is a `.lock` file leftover which will interfere with starting it again


[02-Mar-20 08:27 AM] gcharang#6833
^ that was not an issue


[02-Mar-20 08:28 AM] gcharang#6833
there was a file called `komodod.pid` along with `.lock` that prevented new instance from launching while the old one is running


[02-Mar-20 08:37 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c from what I can see, if we send a stop command while a file is being published, the daemon finishes braodcasting the datablobs with the data, but doesn't publish the one with the tagA "files" or the locators datablob


[02-Mar-20 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
best to not issue a stop command while you are publishing


[02-Mar-20 09:06 AM] gcharang#6833
got it


[02-Mar-20 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
think about it


[02-Mar-20 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
you are doing some command that takes a long time and in the middle you say "stop"


[02-Mar-20 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
so it goes until the first chance it can stop


[02-Mar-20 09:15 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, I get that. these are issues the gui dev needs to consider to make the UX smooth (cc: @TonyL )
for example, if the gui allows the user to issue stop while a large file is being uploaded, 
 the user will have to wait for the daemon to exit after publishing all the datablobs
 but also, won't have any reward for waiting that long which might be frustrating
so, I am going to document this behavior


[02-Mar-20 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
we might want to put up warnings if you are publishing files over a certain size, the idea is that it should finish in a reasonably short amount of time

Okay I'll push night mode changes. I haven't looked too much into the subatomic py yet, but I'd also like to do some price fetching. It's always a plus when people can see a 3rd value for a swap.

I'll see if someone in the ecosystem has a price data API, maybe the Antara coin cap group, if not I'll probably use CP or CG. Worst case I can run my own API with data, but I don't want to build it to rely on an unreliable endpoint

so what was the deal about the activity recently in #üé∞‚îÉask-jl777 that seemed to have something to do with people streaming videos over some KMD sidechain?
I wonder why this was never discussed and preseented elsewhere, what was this about in the first place?
Reason I am asking is because there is (another) project doing decentralized video platform, they are on steem, and now they seem to realize that steem is trash..
>This could be a really good opportunity for KMD platform to attract some important use case

we have tested streaming and it works in some networks, not on the other. it can be made more robust with fancier retry algo, i just did it as a basic proof of concept, so it is still rough around the edges for streaming. however with a bit of work, i dont see any reason why a personal dexp2p network cant be used for streaming

Could you relay stream websites? I guess you could with requests...use dexp2p like VPN- that might help the live stream architecture- just kinda use the 8 node army/worker math - content provider <-8 nodes-> subscribers . The live streaming doesnt seem difficult, just maybe cumbersome with the relays causing a delay in the feed -- hmmm - time to draw up the flow. Do I have to hire devs to add more tags and or another unencrypted payload?

2a is solvable however it becomes centrally hosted and target for DoS.

@Mylo i can probably help with removing the zcash param check, if i know the situation it needs to work in


[07-Mar-20 11:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c perhaps ac_public=1 chains should not load zcash params, or there could be another CLI param to not load them


[07-Mar-20 11:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
if we can be sure there will never be a ztx to validate in a block and we never want to make a ztx, we never need to load the zcash params


[07-Mar-20 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, we can hinge it on ac_public=1 with first block having a recent timestamp!


[07-Mar-20 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
that would be very good

WLC21 seems to work with that code. Looking at nTime of height=1 would be possible by deferring zk param loading until height=1 I guess, but I am not sure it is needed. What edge case does that catch?

I am not in favour of using and/or associating blockchain technologies such as dexp2p with/within a specific/personal political agenda and within official Komodo channel. As I told before, p2p broadcasting should be carefully studied and made a good business case as what Bittube does. We need to define the business requirements first. This will help better to achieve Komodo vision for a peaceful decentralized World.

I think dexp2p might be a good opportunity to create such a generic Komodo based TV platform. But it is really challenging as you can imagine.

Bittube is based on Monero fork and since they have no smart contract such as CC they did many things centrally. This is my guess.

How To Earn Money With Bit.Tube : Review, Best YouTube Alternative
Bit.Tube review : The content creators or publishers can earn rewards from visitors watch time. Users can earn for watching videos.

[08-Mar-20 04:48 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Miners produce and from miners they do somehow distribute certain amount to people. Instead of that, there may be smart contract to make content creator, watcher to earn. Also there will be videos to be shared. People who provide storage may also be given incentives. The idea of staking as in Marmara might be useful.


[08-Mar-20 05:16 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I think the most critical part is to meet the gigantic amount of storage needs in such a project. Who will provide the storage? How will they be incentivised? Will there be adds? If so how will rewards be distributed? There are many cases to be decided.


[08-Mar-20 05:17 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Decentralization in storage might be solving problem.


[08-Mar-20 05:18 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I think providers of storage should be incentivised as much as content creators. I think This issue is not solved in Bittube.

[08-Mar-20 07:45 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Content provider also get paid in the parallel payment- viewers are leachers and only get paid when their node also shares the "data"

The tech is already here, it just needs assembled.


[08-Mar-20 07:51 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
There will/could even be a payment to the founders of such system - pretty simple actually. Architecture of the live streams and the growing network of Viral data needs built. Looking for DEVs to help with the back end including playlist organizing, Ad integration, and parallel payments to the 8 closest selected nodes to the leacher.


[08-Mar-20 07:58 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Maybe you can get devs from the big Dtube and Bittube to help


[08-Mar-20 08:17 AM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
we are in discussion with  developers to help build  project around p2p streaming. hope we may get on track soon with no more delays.need to bring positive ideas and talent. Buddy developers who are unaware of blockchain world may need some time to get on the code and need some guidance to mould them.


[08-Mar-20 08:33 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I guess plug in ad network and parallel payments to existing file share system. Then we can work on architecture for live data streams - just a good MVP to start the ball rolling

I don't believe that Bittube will be successful- I had 2 or 3 BTC worth of it ~2yrs ago and I hung out on the discord:
it is a Berlin registered company, and there were censorship battles raging on there even 2 yrs ago, plus an echo chamber of deluded fanboys, so I bailed out with a nice green zero, and then it dumped..
maybe they got a solid plan going since then, but I'd be surprised...

with the p2p file sharing, might be a solution.
nginx+rtmp can also work for live streaming somewhere to look


[09-Mar-20 12:42 PM] Regnar#6164
I might not be following right now, the app is a way to upload/download p2p files, for that any 3rd party video software should work. What would be the goal for integrating video software into the app?

How different are downloads vs streaming?


[10-Mar-20 10:11 PM] hakan aygun#8844
Once user download the app, then cencorship doesn‚Äôt work inside it also by the help of the p2p system... that‚Äôs the po≈ünt i guess:)


[10-Mar-20 10:16 PM] hakan aygun#8844
And also just like utorrent system, if user automatically becomes a peer when start watching, that will be very user friendly... :)) @TonyL  @jl777c


[11-Mar-20 04:07 AM] Mylo#8306
Simply product development.

1. Files p2p 
2. Payments
3. Watch
4. Rating
5. Discoverability

Leaving it as files p2p and sending payment during this iteration may be enough for 100 testers.

I guess I mean I don't know how the app supports streaming right now? I get if you are downloading a video file, you could view in the app with VLC, but wouldn't it be lighter and make more sense to just let them use their native video viewer software?


[11-Mar-20 05:21 PM] Mylo#8306
streaming not gonna work p2p without more app work tbh.  webtorrent works, but streaming was a (web) server solution for hosting files.
the app, watching vid simply to have the file browser & viewer in same app.  then be able to add further functionality (payments, ratings, download progress)

"lighter" yes.  depends what the goals for this project are in what timeframe.
for a proof-of-concept, adding video watching i thought was a good idea.
for 100 testers, video watching can be done in external viewer, get user feedback. find funding/partners.

depends on direction of projects & who wants what for how much resources/effort spent.


[11-Mar-20 05:57 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
If you are talking live streams the serving nodes will need organized by ping times / internet speed / rating and retry logic needs improved


[11-Mar-20 06:00 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Thinking outside the box I will guess joe q public probably wouldnt be a great candidate for helping serve live streams at high quality. So completely random probably isn't the best solution for the architecture


[11-Mar-20 06:03 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Up and down Speed tests to distribute to best 8 candidate nodes to start then spread it to 64 when demand is needed... then 640,000 if its viral... I have some logic thought about but no devs to talk to abour implementation yet


[11-Mar-20 07:34 PM] Mylo#8306
live streams & streaming in general adds a lot extra.
a single web host, streaming a pre-recorded file is as far as i've looked into.
ivanontech are looking at p2p streaming options, but looking at eth ecosystem for solutions because of market & defi space there.

VLC includes a fairly easy-to-use streaming feature that can stream music and videos over a local network or the Internet. You can tune into the stream using VLC or other media players.

@hakan aygun as far as I understand it, there is no way for a website alone to use this technology to stream videos. You can publish instructions to your viewers on your website and they will have to install software on their desktops to view any live stream.

btw, @Regnar the streaming solution is not robust enough for general use right now. jl recommends the publish/download flow for sahipsiz

>  i think it is best to use the file publish and subscribe method
<https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-tutorials/publish-download-files-dexp2p.html>
create a video file using whatever means. The file can be published, downloaded p2p using dexp2p. this works well

I am not familiar with Tkinter or anyother py gui framework. so, I am starting work on a vuejs/nuxt/vuetify/electron GUI right now. I am familiar with  vuejs/nuxt/vuetify but not electron(the thing that lets web pages be desktop apps). so, not sure how long till a working prototype

That's good, I've been working with tkinter because I know Python and TonyL had been cruising along with proof of concepts built in tkinter

GUI is coming along nicely. only the publish page is done. will upload to github after every page (settings/downloader/dashboard) gets the bare minimum functionality. should be able to do that by the coming monday. once packaging for different OS's is figured out for this one, GUIs for all the available Antara modules can be created very easily as well. only requirement is be able to code in js and know some vue. Vue is very easy for someone who already knows js and it is fun to work with

Disclaimer: this isn't anything secure, but should be good enough for quick prototyping and showcase of new tech. None of our cc are supported by a GUI right now and that results in the majority of our community not being able to experience them

Some of the CCs have GUIs (subatomic, channels, sudoku, dice) but yea not all of them. I think having a consistent themed Komodo GUI for various CCs would be awesome. Maybe we should just make a GUI dashboard for all Komodod...

> Maybe we should just make a GUI dashboard for all Komodod
that's in my todo list as well


[01-Apr-20 06:52 AM] Regnar#6164
@gcharang what did you use to make that GUI?


[01-Apr-20 06:53 AM] Regnar#6164
I feel like I should learn some js


[01-Apr-20 06:59 AM] gcharang#6833
<https://github.com/michalzaq12/electron-nuxt>
this is boiler-plate code that creates your initial directory. it will already have most of the dependencies needed to make a desktop gui .
on top of that, you need to know vuejs.

the specifics:
the programming language -> js
cross platform GUI creation -> electron
frontend logic and interface with komodod & sqlite(db) -> vuejs
something to make working with vuejs easier -> nuxt
UI components -> vuetify (this is the thing responsible for the perfectly arranged tabs and theme. I'm aesthetically challenged, so couldn't design those components if my life depended on it üòÖ )

the list is large, but the only thing you **need** to know is js lol. the rest are there to make your life easier


[01-Apr-20 07:09 AM] Regnar#6164
cool, going to take a js course on codecademy today and read the w3 tutorial lol


[01-Apr-20 07:11 AM] gcharang#6833
I would suggest this: <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Tutorials>
w3 is kinda bad/outdated for js

cool I'll take a look now. I like w3 based on how simple the site is set up. plus I like the w3.css framework

and thx @Mylo for suggesting vuepress for the docs and suggesting vue/nuxt/vuetify as UI enhancements


[01-Apr-20 04:39 PM] Mylo#8306
all good brother. it's a complete set of tools/ecosystem to build on in an iterative and upskilling way.
next thing to keep your eye on is https://deno.land/
it will be released more public sometime this Q.  it will somewhat appease the javascript-phobiacs.
integrates with v8 and rust.  keep it on your radar for the rest of this year imo.

@hakan aygun welcome back - there is progress in the p2p streaming in tests.


[10-May-20 05:35 AM] Mylo#8306
what software do you currently use for live streaming?


[10-May-20 05:35 AM] Mylo#8306
to control your camera & sound.

@gcharang where GUI? is it connected to subatomic payments? can you get a MVP started so I can get some DEVs on it? explaining all this would take weeks..  PLEASE


[07-Sep-20 08:55 AM] gcharang#6833
@Tylor zkFS it is stalled for a long time now. will take a look this week and give you the source for a MVP version. I started working on it for just the file share though. but, it can be extended to do file vs coin swaps as mylo pointed in the other channel. 

it is a js/electron/vue app, and I was making it as something for demos and community testing btw, not as a end user product


[07-Sep-20 04:07 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Please if you find time - content provider sets price dexp2p gets paid, 8 seeders get paid (if they are picked). Content providers get paid.All with micropayments subatomic with zCoinage.....i can pm you my basic thoughts for "EdgeP2P" ....i have it all written somewhere... @gcharang
