[04-Oct-18 05:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
You don't need a degree in fact o would say not having any formal training has helped me learn this block chain stuff faster, because there is no prior knowledge making me think things should be a certain way, and I I can just learn from 0 with block chain concepts.

Hello , Dr Datta from invited me to join this channel.

I am very much interested in block chains and have been exploring few uses cases from  past one year. Komodo has really interesting concepts and I am really looking forward to work on it.  Right now I am just going through the github link . Let's see where it takes me


[10-Oct-18 11:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yes the mastering crypto conditions is a great place to start. #kmdlabs  we make all kinds of cool things, and provide a way for test chains to have notarisation, if your project or needs that... for example to use multiple blockchains that can interact with each other.


[11-Oct-18 08:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/contracts/index-contracts.html is a good resource as well

Hey guys, I'm Preston. I help out in the Verus discord, mainly basic issues.

Lol when guys say I shill KMD my response is, you know everyone that dev team is as sharp as a tack..
They can't help but laugh.. Good to be here. See you around


[12-Oct-18 10:41 AM] sja5225#5867
I've been having some trouble building and running Komodod on Mac. The build-mac.sh file in the zcultils directory only recognizes gcc@6. I had gcc@7 and it did not recognize the compiler. If that is a bug, I can fix the build-mac.sh to recognize version >= gcc6 on Mac.


[12-Oct-18 10:41 AM] sja5225#5867
Running zcutils/fetch-params.sh gives the following errors `./zcutil/fetch-params.sh: line 112: flock: command not found
Only one instance of fetch-params.sh can be run at a time.`


[12-Oct-18 11:05 AM] DG#6934
Thanks for the feedback , haven't tried gcc7 will test this and let you know from our side


[12-Oct-18 11:24 AM] DG#6934
@sja5225  Currently we have seen that gcc6 is working with no issues , this is why still is the version that is in the guide , unless we see that it presents an issue there's no i need to change it.


[12-Oct-18 11:33 AM] sja5225#5867
@DG ok.Im having trouble with this step also. Running zcutils/fetch-params.sh gives the following errors ./zcutil/fetch-params.sh: line 112: flock: command not found
Only one instance of fetch-params.sh can be run at a time.


[12-Oct-18 11:36 AM] DG#6934
inside the komodo directory right ? Just in case this is the most updated guide for Mac users , make sure you have the complete dependency packages that are previous to this part of the installation https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html#installing-komodo-on-osx


[12-Oct-18 11:42 AM] sja5225#5867

My idea is for each dev to come up with a custom CC to implement


[16-Oct-18 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
I am happy to help with implementation questions and even basic design issues as I understand this is totally new territory


[16-Oct-18 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but you need to be creating and come up with a unique consensus rule change that will change the world! or at least be useful to some specific set of people


[16-Oct-18 02:58 PM] sja5225#5867
I tried this command `./komodo-cli faucetfund` it gives me an error `o use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet`


[16-Oct-18 02:58 PM] sja5225#5867
It started the demon with `$./komodod -pubkey=file.pub`


[16-Oct-18 03:08 PM] sja5225#5867
Does it read the publickey from the given file?


[16-Oct-18 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you need a valid pubkey in the -pubkey= parameter


[16-Oct-18 09:03 PM] jl777c#5810
use validateaddress <taddr>


[16-Oct-18 09:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the "pubkey" field starts with 02 or 03, 66 chars for a 33 byte secp256k1 compressed pubkey

[17-Oct-18 05:22 PM] sja5225#5867
What is a z address?


[17-Oct-18 05:31 PM] Chipmoon#7477
komodo is a fork of Zcash and Zcash has two kinds of address: a z-addr is a fully private address that uses the zero-knowledge proving system to shield a transaction and balance privacy. A t-addr (aka "transparent address") is similar to a Bitcoin address.


[17-Oct-18 05:31 PM] sja5225#5867
Ok. How do i create a wallet so that I have an address?


[17-Oct-18 05:32 PM] sja5225#5867
Should I get a zcash address and  validate it with komodo-cli?


[17-Oct-18 05:33 PM] Chipmoon#7477
a lot of your questions probably can be answered from here https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/search/solutions?term=cli&authenticity_token=LfoqrYfEGaIHkS%2Bk9ZhSQCtPlDJ9a2J0uP3I%2BO4kfbA%3D


[17-Oct-18 05:38 PM] sja5225#5867
Is it payingkey or transmissionkey the pubkey?

I still get the same error `to use CC contracts, you need to launch daemon with valid -pubkey= for an address in your wallet`


[17-Oct-18 07:45 PM] cipi#4502
`komodo-cli validateaddress xxxxxx` shows you the pubkey of  the address xxxxx, if it is in your wallet


[17-Oct-18 11:46 PM] gcharang#6833
@sja5225 this doc might help you: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc/test-use-write-integrate-cc.html


[17-Oct-18 11:46 PM] gcharang#6833
the asset chain should also have the `-ac-cc` parameter to test cc contracts


[18-Oct-18 11:02 AM] sja5225#5867

[18-Oct-18 11:14 AM] sja5225#5867
ok

In this wallet


[18-Oct-18 11:15 AM] gcharang#6833
If it was from a previous wallet, you will have to import it's privkey in this chain's wallet


[18-Oct-18 11:16 AM] gcharang#6833
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=Origin validateaddress RHczSAiLa1nmUSWFYUiXUZjggoeWPQZPr7`  does it give `ismine:true` and `pubkey:0244ab0355c208f707c465d7acd021ef30dce227e9b0b0ec3973bd80535b789b28` ?

@SHossain  which branch should i clone to get the compiling version for macOS 10.14?


[20-Oct-18 10:27 AM] SHossain#0007
macOS 10.14 is not supported yet


[20-Oct-18 10:42 AM] sja5225#5867
ok


[20-Oct-18 10:43 AM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 is working on it. we will let you know once we have macOS mojave support.


[20-Oct-18 10:53 AM] sja5225#5867
@SHossain  ok. I can do some help on the fix if required.


[20-Oct-18 10:54 AM] SHossain#0007
that would be nice @sja5225


[20-Oct-18 10:54 AM] SHossain#0007
all other version prior to mojave works


[27-Oct-18 01:45 PM] sja5225#5867
@jl777c  running `./komodo-cli  faucetfund 100` it returns `{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "couldnt create faucet funding transaction"
}`


[27-Oct-18 01:46 PM] sja5225#5867
server deamon output `extractdestination failed`


[27-Oct-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to do it for an assetchain that has a faucet funded


[27-Oct-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
like KMDICE


[27-Oct-18 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
#kmdice


[27-Oct-18 08:34 PM] sja5225#5867
@jl777c what is an asset chain? And what is a faucet fund. It’s confusing to me.


[27-Oct-18 09:27 PM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
@sja5225  
faucetfund amount - donate/send your funds to the faucet
```faucetfund allows anybody to add funds to the faucet
faucetget allows anybody to get 0.1 coins from the faucet as long as they dont violate the rules.
And we come to what it is all about. The rules of the faucet. Initially it was much less strict and that allowed it to be drained slowly, but automatically and it prevented most from being able to use the faucet. ```
Please go through our documentation for Asset chain  and other technical features here

How can I re-build only a particular file when I'm working on it?


[30-Oct-18 12:32 AM] jl777c#5810
make


[30-Oct-18 11:28 AM] sja5225#5867
What are the parameters that needs to added to faucet2?


[30-Oct-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
would be up to the designer of faucet2, but for starters all the paramaters that need to be tunable


[30-Oct-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
amount given, rules about repeated usage


[30-Oct-18 11:40 AM] sja5225#5867
How do you get the rpc request parameters on the server side?


[30-Oct-18 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
it would do the rpc side like reward CC does, using its rpc calls with parameters


[30-Oct-18 11:45 AM] sja5225#5867
is there a documentation to this function ? `evhttp_make_request`. I need to understand how this function works.


[30-Oct-18 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
look in rpcwallet.cpp there are the functions that process rpc calls


[30-Oct-18 12:07 PM] sja5225#5867
Ok. Thanks


[30-Oct-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it just parses the command line args and calls internal functions to implement the rpc method


[30-Oct-18 12:18 PM] sja5225#5867
That's what i was looking for.


[30-Oct-18 12:39 PM] sja5225#5867
how long does the command `./assetchains` take to complete?


[30-Oct-18 12:42 PM] SHossain#0007
depends on your system spec and how many chains you want to run. generally done within 15 minutes max


[30-Oct-18 12:51 PM] sja5225#5867
how do i run kmdice as an assetchain?


[30-Oct-18 12:56 PM] SHossain#0007
`./komodod -ac_name=KMDICE -ac_supply=10500000 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=144.76.217.232 &`


[30-Oct-18 12:56 PM] SHossain#0007
every chain has their own start command which you always should use to use the same chain. if you change any param, that will be a fork or another chain


[30-Oct-18 12:57 PM] SHossain#0007
you can use #kmdice to get more info about that chain

How to add a contract to the chain?


[30-Oct-18 01:05 PM] SHossain#0007
you want to code new contract?


[30-Oct-18 01:05 PM] sja5225#5867
No use an existing one.

ok. Thanks


[30-Oct-18 01:10 PM] sja5225#5867
To test can i use my localhost?


[30-Oct-18 01:11 PM] SHossain#0007
what do you mean by that? without internet connection?


[30-Oct-18 01:12 PM] sja5225#5867
Yes. For the last parameter where it says `addnode=` can i give 127.0.0.1?


[30-Oct-18 01:14 PM] SHossain#0007
no


[30-Oct-18 01:15 PM] SHossain#0007
it has to be an ip of your local network, KMDICE will not work like that. you have to create your own assetchain


[30-Oct-18 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the seednode needs to have the KMDICE chain, though for notarized chains, it might pick it up from the DNS seeds


[30-Oct-18 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you are not connected to the internet, then you cant sync to a chain that is on the internet

where can i get the list of public nodes that are available?


[30-Oct-18 01:18 PM] SHossain#0007
you can use `getpeerinfo` call


[30-Oct-18 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
./komodod -ac_name=KMDICE -ac_supply=10500000 -ac_reward=2500000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=144.76.217.232 &


[30-Oct-18 01:18 PM] SHossain#0007
the seednode is already on chain param


[30-Oct-18 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
how about 144.76.217.232


[30-Oct-18 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
like it shows in the reference invocation?

I am trying to install komodo manually on ubuntu 16 running in virtual box. It installed correctly the first time. But I had to make some changes to the  to  the virutal box so I cleaned up everything and tried to install  komodo for the second time. But the build has been failing every time  "./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)"


[31-Oct-18 07:42 PM] SuSC135#6248
I am getting couple of error messages like  "make *** [all - recursive] Error 1"


[31-Oct-18 07:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
Regarding the `./assetchains` to start  assetchains, I have a slight mod to those sctipts that allow you to add the name of the chain you want to start, so it doesnt start them all.


[31-Oct-18 07:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think it came directly from lukechilds, who wrote all those scripts, it just adds an extra parameter to `listasetchainparams`


[31-Oct-18 07:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
seems thos might be useful to be pushed into the offical branches...

do i have to wait till my daemon is completely synced before I test my CC?


[02-Nov-18 09:51 AM] SHossain#0007
@SuSC135 which chain you are syncing?


[02-Nov-18 09:51 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, you need to use native mode to test CC


[02-Nov-18 10:45 AM] SuSC135#6248
I am trying to sync entire komodo blockchain. when daemon is started


[02-Nov-18 10:55 AM] SHossain#0007
you can't test CC with Komodo chain


[02-Nov-18 10:55 AM] SHossain#0007
CC is not activated on that chain.


[02-Nov-18 10:56 AM] SHossain#0007
please check pinned posts on #dev-modules for test chains


[02-Nov-18 12:05 PM] SuSC135#6248
but doesnt it automatically start syncing when i start the komdod server?

How do I mine for coins? I have done komodo-cli -ac_ame=KMDICE setgenerate true -1. But I am not getting anyfunds


[02-Nov-18 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
-ac_ame is not valid


[02-Nov-18 01:32 PM] SuSC135#6248
sorry it should be name   komodo-cli -ac_name=KMDICE setgenerate true -1.


[02-Nov-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
CPU mining wont be very effective


[02-Nov-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
if you just want to test, you can get some coins via faucetget


[02-Nov-18 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
or just ask for some coins


[06-Nov-18 03:41 PM] sja5225#5867
when adding faucetfund i receive an error on client side `couldn't create faucet funding` and server output `nValue too small or already spent in mempool`


[12-Nov-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the exact rpc call you are doing?


[13-Nov-18 11:15 AM] sja5225#5867
Thanks. I actually found out the issue.


[13-Nov-18 11:17 AM] sja5225#5867
@jl777c  When starting a new komodod it requires a default config file to be created by the user. I would be nice if the system could look for a config file, if not present, should automatically create a new config file with default configurations. If it is required i can implement it.


[13-Nov-18 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
it does create a default config file for assetchains


[13-Nov-18 12:16 PM] sja5225#5867
I'm always prompted to create a default config file.


[13-Nov-18 12:16 PM] sja5225#5867
Let me cross check it again.

Hi, I am trying to install Komodo in my Ubuntu 16.04 (4gb ram). 
when I issue the command: ./zcutil/build.sh -j4 (using 4 threads), its ran for more than 1 hour and hung my laptop. 
Is my laptop memory too low to install Komodo?


[19-Nov-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe -j1 for a low mem system


[19-Nov-18 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
just run build.sh again, it should resume where it stopped
