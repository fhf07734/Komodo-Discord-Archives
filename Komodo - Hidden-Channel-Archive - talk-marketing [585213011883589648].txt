Komodo Evolution
The blockchain industry must evolve and Komodo is leading the charge.

[03-Jun-19 02:20 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I am currently looking for people to help spread the word of Komodo on a unofficial basis. There are many crypto youtubers out there that accept donations in the 1-5$ range that will read out questions or look at projects.

I am looking for people to compile a list of youtubers / sub counts / view counts and if you can send in donations. I will refund anyone that does it in KMD

Let‚Äôs create a donation address


[03-Jun-19 02:36 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So we need someone that watches the youtuber so they know how they work and the best time to send in donations


[03-Jun-19 02:36 PM] Malti#3948
Like a general donation address here


[03-Jun-19 02:37 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I can make one later if people are ok with me holding it or a team member can do it. I am happy to chuck in the initial chunk myself to get this rolling

We shouldn't throw out instagram either. We likely won't get any luck with some of the bigger maximalist pages but there are quite a few altcoin and blockchain in general that will do paid stories or even posts (even if it's just updates on branding etc)


[03-Jun-19 03:27 PM] Regnar#6164
I can't say they all will do paid promo's or stories, but they're likely good areas to push content and have community members engage them with Komodo related stuff. Also helps our reach get beyond twitter and youtube.

[04-Jun-19 06:01 AM] Malti#3948
so indeed, IG must not be forgotten to speak to the 20-30 y/o age range


[04-Jun-19 09:34 AM] Llama#1330
I can probably connect you with a lot of "influencers." I used to help them find promotional content


[04-Jun-19 09:36 AM] Regnar#6164
I think instagram has been a relatively untapped market for Komodo, though I can't say if it's necessarily our target market. If we're looking for projects to build within Komodo ecosystem there might be better places to reach them in, but for KMD value as a speculator/investor, Instagram has some reach


[04-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Llama#1330
how often do we send people to conferences?


[04-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Regnar#6164
Knowing @hyperDEX set this channel up, I assume a target market would be the trader who may be interested in using HyperDEX and MM2.


[04-Jun-19 09:37 AM] Llama#1330
That's what I would assume to be the #1 marketing method


[04-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Regnar#6164
I'm not 100% sure on that, it seems it often comes down to a coincidence of locale. If a team member is in the area then they go.


[04-Jun-19 09:38 AM] Regnar#6164
Though there is this too <https://twitter.com/0xca333/status/1135915458316492801>


[04-Jun-19 09:40 AM] Regnar#6164
So sometimes, and I know @PTYX is doing conferences and events in Latin America for Chainzilla which benefits Komodo.


[04-Jun-19 09:44 AM] Llama#1330
I think getting booths at conferences might be a good idea


[04-Jun-19 09:47 AM] Regnar#6164
That seems more official team, but I agree. I think they have started doing that a bit more.


[04-Jun-19 09:49 AM] Llama#1330
"trickle down marketing"?


[04-Jun-19 09:49 AM] Regnar#6164
If the team is focusing on one method of marketing, adoption by developers and projects, there's likely room for other types of marketing for community members (this channel) that can help that, or help KMD valuation via exposure and increase in trading volumes. Should that be the goal here


[04-Jun-19 09:49 AM] Llama#1330
market to the top people and hope that it finds its way through the space


[04-Jun-19 09:49 AM] Llama#1330
but im not a marketer so maybe that's stupid


[04-Jun-19 09:49 AM] Regnar#6164
Not what I'm saying


[04-Jun-19 09:53 AM] Regnar#6164
Marketing isn't a generic thing. It should be designed to target specific groups and for specific reasons. Just like I don't see marketing for Ferrari, Maersk, or the obscure producer of Nuclear control rods, I'm not the market for those products are services.


[04-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Regnar#6164
So if you market something to someone, it should be something that that someone wants, needs, or will use.


[04-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Regnar#6164
Komodo is no different.


[04-Jun-19 09:54 AM] Regnar#6164
Right on the Komodo website it says ```Driving Value To Our Customers
Komodo is committed to empowering developers to accelerate their journey to blockchain technologies.```


[04-Jun-19 09:59 AM] Regnar#6164
So they market products and services to developers to grow the ecosystem and increase the value of KMD as well. Marketing to speculators, traders, or investors, is not the goal of Komodo, while it could also increase the value of KMD. That's where I think the community can step in, since much of our (as investors and traders) interest lies in the value of KMD, so should our efforts be in increasing that value. If Komodo is marketing to empower developers with blockchain tech, we could approach it from a different angle, with similar end goals.

For example, HyperDEX generates revenues on trades. That helps the ecosystem grow and helps KMD valuation, as well as DEX value. But that requires different marketing than to developers. IMO that would require marketing to investors, traders, and speculators like who I believe is often on Instagram

[11-Jun-19 02:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Looks like @KomodoWorld is on board to try to win http://binancecup.tronbet.io/ @polycryptoblog  get the passport ready.

Is anyone else looking to help fund such a effort? We need to get some TRX but if we dont win we will get the TRX back to KMD (so there might be a risk of less or more funds than we started with). I think the exposure of KMD/CHIPS from this even might be worth the 10k we chuck into this. Justin being a serial hype machine and our mate CZ being there too with Charlie Lee. I am sure there would be enough coverage to be worth the effort.

Hit me up if you want to contribute to this community marketing effort.

Only small holder, but can chip in a bit, can also help buying the TRX needed, have fully verified accounts on exchanges that list TRX

This is interesting idea, will CHIPS benefit from extra exposure without GUI though, or is this setting up brownsheet part two? Asking for a friend..

I am hoping to raise 500k TRX, beyond that i think it may not be worth it. It is up to 280k with 2 days left

[16-Jun-19 01:51 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
it would be useful for KMD and assets and also other original projects which do not sound like pure scam (to me every coin that is created for the purpose of selling one kind of a thing like MusicCoin, PotCoin, ... is kind scam - for example, but real utility tokens like Arrr, Beam/Grin, KMD are true tech with applications)


[16-Jun-19 01:52 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so I think it might be nice to review other projects and unit to list / special website


[16-Jun-19 01:52 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
SEO-like marketing + educational value / shitcoins out


[16-Jun-19 01:52 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
some works need to be done to review


[16-Jun-19 01:53 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
and actually even such page could be monetized the way scientific articles are - you need to paid to get review and get listed üòõ


[16-Jun-19 01:54 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
or even better this could be shitcoinornot.com where crypto is split into 3 parts (not shitcoin, controversial, shitcoin)- reviewed with pros and cons


[16-Jun-19 01:55 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622

[16-Jun-19 02:04 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I think some people are doing such things already, just not publish this infomration is a special form sorted by utility or sth


[16-Jun-19 02:05 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
some people already writing kind of reviews, even jl777 sometimes writes kind of ntoes here that are almost reiview


[16-Jun-19 02:06 AM] ! ‚õ©‚öî house of TThugs#8741
You are right though, it really is needed


[16-Jun-19 02:06 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
plus a review is also a work - you spend time on it, so taking money to make honest review (some noble comitee to accept it, radix? jl777? dukeleto?) listing for review for free (or actually a must whatever the result)


[16-Jun-19 02:06 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
while you have such page and publish dailyu review you get a lot of traffic + make good marketing - educational


[16-Jun-19 02:07 AM] ! ‚õ©‚öî house of TThugs#8741
Big job to cover all coins


[16-Jun-19 02:07 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622

[16-Jun-19 02:07 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
3-6 months daily articles would do the work


[16-Jun-19 02:08 AM] ! ‚õ©‚öî house of TThugs#8741
I am thinking just positive coins/reviews ... narrow down the work load


[16-Jun-19 02:08 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
initial stage - some projects we like might be reviewd for free, but later could be like 0.1BTC or so :pirate:


[16-Jun-19 02:08 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@! ‚õ©‚öî house of TThugs when only positive you hide information

good / bad all sohul be there


[16-Jun-19 02:09 AM] ! ‚õ©‚öî house of TThugs#8741
I get that ... but is a massive undertaking


[16-Jun-19 02:09 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
if no info = people think you didnt do review, you forgot about the project, so they may think it's good or some conspiracy you are not there


[16-Jun-19 02:10 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
massive undertaking - that's why after you make free review of fav coins you get 0.1BTC per coin review or sth


[16-Jun-19 02:12 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
that would be good long term marketing, educationl based, cheaper then google ads, and better too; I think @jl777c could support such more then adds and paid articles?


[16-Jun-19 02:51 AM] ! ‚õ©‚öî house of TThugs#8741
point taken üëç :


[16-Jun-19 03:38 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
obviously true shitcoins wont pay for review or will try to bribe to get listed as good projects üòÉ


[16-Jun-19 03:38 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
in such cases 2 additional tabs like "trie bribing" or "not interested in review" (with all not yet reviewd) cold be added


[16-Jun-19 03:38 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
full info in 1 place


[16-Jun-19 05:01 AM] Lennart#9331
a project like DigiByte wouldn't pay anything. They're not a shitcoin though


[16-Jun-19 05:02 AM] Lennart#9331
True decentralized non-ICO project won't be able to pay, that makes this list then worthless


[16-Jun-19 05:03 AM] Lennart#9331
a list without shitcoins though, would be very nice...


[16-Jun-19 06:10 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@Lennart in scientific world it works - to publish your paper to almost any kind of well known journal you need to pay üòÉ even when you are 100% your project is unique - they give 0 shit about it - but of course it is a matter of brand, like CMC - when you make the page informative, projects will get money to list


[16-Jun-19 06:10 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
and be serious, to get listed on CEX you need 3 BTC, 0.1BTC is no prise in comparison for few hours work to investigate project and review it


[16-Jun-19 06:11 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622

so it's not true decentralized projects cannot get money - if they cannot fund dev or marketing they simply die


[16-Jun-19 06:30 AM] Lennart#9331
i can only speak for DigiByte. They have never paid for anything. No listing, no reviews. Yet they're still here, and among the better altcoins IMHO


[16-Jun-19 06:31 AM] Lennart#9331
I get your point though, all I'm saying is that when you charge a project money to prove that it's not a shitcoin.. that won't work IMO


[16-Jun-19 09:03 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
wow, then this is persistence to admire, but I doubt there is many projects like DigiByte that never pays anything


[16-Jun-19 09:04 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
in that case the would deserve a free listing imo üòÉ


[16-Jun-19 09:05 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
btu generally there is no such thing as free - you dont have to pay for marketing, but in that case you need to do marketing using our own hands and your ownd time - and then you pay - with your time, and time is money


[16-Jun-19 09:05 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so even is DigiByte decides not to pay, they still pay, with more work they need to do themselves

some categories or total points for categories would be informative too for example  - possible to sort projects by "practical value" ? for example a project would get value by having real life application + partially being utilized already (feature that is in real use not just for the future) more categories like this could come, community size/activity, dev team size/activity, age ... + links to related projects (copy paste or better realisation of same idea or just relevant)

@passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã  IMO all info should be listed without any value attached to it, let people make up their own minds about what is good and bad... A profit miner has a different point of view on a valuable coin than a developer or a company wanting to utilize that chain.

Paying to be listed on a site that reviews you, seems to me generating conflicts of interests and therefore could be percieved as not trustworthy.

It all depends what demographic you focus on... Too general information  and you'll alienate the serious people, too technical and you'll loose the big audience.
The balance is a very narrow path, and in my humble opinion I've seen information about coins on Exchange sites about coins that walk that line perfectly.

I think people that are willing to go the extra distance to do there own investigations, will end up with the coin that matches their needs. People that rely on 'ready-chewed' bite-sized chuncks are beyond help.

It will be biased if you do so. We pay rewards for users who write reviews, make predictions, create articles and publish reports. We plan to monetize with ads that doesn't disturb user experience like twitter. We will also provide Buy/Sell Analytics for a paid subscription for investors.

@Sri good to hear. Regarding biased - not necessarily. I recall my argument from sci journals. Reviews are paid no matter what, not for biased reasons - to pay reviewers time. Ok here it might be tempting to diregard not your fvorite projects, but in open society with discussions it wont survive critics from the actual community... so still I believe getting payment for review (not matter positive or netagive outcome will be) is fine. You could reward reviewer with delay - if many rightful complaints from project community - then he could be rewarded less.


[29-Jun-19 09:20 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Regarding your monetization model - ads are known to be poor monetization for info portals with < 1mln views per day.


[29-Jun-19 09:22 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Review payment I duscussed was not about monetization, just lowering production costs üòÉ If you charge this for real monetization they ok might be biased as you would expect more reviews to come, and for that you would give people more positive reviews ... this is how "normal" media works...


[30-Jun-19 08:23 AM] Sri#6686
The core idea of Utrum is to provide a platform for people to write reviews and other content without any influence. So we built features based on this concept. I agree with monetization part about ads, It might take sometime for generating revenues.

Torsten did a great job in the interview. Maybe for additional talking points, dPoW could have been included as well as to tie it back to, different parts of Komodo are trying to solve different problems and that the sum of all these parts is what makes Komodo unique.


[12-Jul-19 03:19 PM] hyperDEX#6586
If we overlap what KMD is trying to do over what BTC has done, we are building out all the blockchain/altcoin (assetchains) infrastructure, we are building a DEX, we are building ethereum, we are building out a decentralized bitmex and many others. This is contrast to other projects that want to build a ETH killer or they want to do a prediction market or they want to be a DEX.

[15-Jul-19 08:10 PM] nymkappa#9440
Well IMO, it looks quite the same but for any logo you will probably find something similar somewhere else...


[15-Jul-19 08:11 PM] nymkappa#9440
It's the same idea, but it's not the same logo, slightly different shape, different colors. So I don't think there is any issue with it.


[15-Jul-19 08:11 PM] nymkappa#9440
And finally, both projects are not at all in the same market.

I know a guy whom worked for state farm insurance company and he was on the natural catastrophe team that delt with hurricanes wild fires earthquakes and what not.  They called it the NatCat team.  Well they got sued by Catapiller (the heavy equipment company) and lost and couldn't use the name NatCat ever again.  Finicky world we live in


[15-Jul-19 08:18 PM] yorklab#7270
They are different. They have some similarities but some differences too.


[15-Jul-19 08:19 PM] ryman112#0068
Yeah like insurance and heavy equipment.  Way different and one sued the other for using the word cat


[15-Jul-19 08:19 PM] Jimm B.#9993
for me these are 2 different logos...


[15-Jul-19 08:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the simple shaped logos might resemble in industry/corss-industry, but if they are not same, I guess they are legal. it's just my understanding. of course I'm not expert on this subject matter, and can be corrected.


[15-Jul-19 08:56 PM] grumpygoron#4320
How about an explanation behind the inspiration for this logo?  Would help squash the call of being a duplicate if we know the original thought process that led to it.


[15-Jul-19 08:57 PM] ryman112#0068
Yes what he just said


[15-Jul-19 08:58 PM] ryman112#0068

[15-Jul-19 11:00 PM] dan.#2473
my bg is dev/marketing. sites actually really good, I just think the home page needs to be readjusted. the homepage seems to be not selling to devs, and not selling to potential users; somewhere inbetween... which really is not an audience worth selling to


[15-Jul-19 11:01 PM] Mylo#8306

[15-Jul-19 11:06 PM] dan.#2473
wait who is antara composer for?


[15-Jul-19 11:06 PM] dan.#2473
its mentioned on the for developers page, but not linked to it


[15-Jul-19 11:07 PM] dan.#2473
A lot of that antara stuff on the home page could probably be on the dev page too


[15-Jul-19 11:10 PM] dan.#2473
all im saying, is, lets pretend youre an average end grandma user who stumbles upon the kmd site through an article or cmc. i might bounce after seeing the home page copy, not because its _super confusing_ but because i might feel like komodo isnt for me, but for people who play with blockchains


[15-Jul-19 11:12 PM] dan.#2473
btw im being critical, the site is really good. but the home page is important to get right

[17-Jul-19 02:43 AM] Malti#3948
some small remarks from my side in the composer:

- Price is just a total. You don't see what is due one time and what is due yearly (in the end balance at the bottom)
- I know I can launch a chain, but where/how will I manage my chain?
- The shopping cart shows immediately the most expensive option and I have to delete. If you add, you have a nice overview of modules that are possible. Might be a good idea to bring that into the user flow before you see the total balance due?
- The explanation on the 'expensive' chain modules is rather limited. 2 lines of info on somehting I would pay for on a recurring basis. (Although that the one that Im referring to in particular is the dashboard one and that one is only 37 dollars.. still)
- Even If I take the cheapest chain available, I don't know what it does in the end. Maybe a 'basic' package would be a good idea with a 14 day free trial that people can play in?

==> amazing job guys!


[17-Jul-19 02:47 AM] Malti#3948

I (Dr. Agonhound) needed a secure and reliable way to find my constantly escaping dog, so I used GPS enabled IoT hardware and a K9 tactical vest to send encrypted coordinate pings to an Antara smartchain using the Oracles module, then read and decrypted the pings via Django for display on a Leaflet map.

I really need to get back to that project, since the PoC was done, I've been busy AF. In 3 weeks, I'll have much more spare time, and have caught up on enough sleep to get the demo site back up and running (at the moment the domain is serving as a place to develop a related supplychain logistics project).

plan is to have rebranded materials ready for the meetups, whatever is needed, like presentation template, handouts (for bigger ones). It should be also possible to get atomicdex beta invites for people on the events, and so on.

Plus I can ask around and try to find team members if some meetup wants to have a live interview/discussion with a team member / community member. (anyone willing to explain KMD can also sign-up for that).

[19-Jul-19 07:23 AM] Malti#3948
also on the pioneers topic; to plan a Komodo meetup: @jorian and myself were talking to do so at the K64 expo. That was great to bring the community together and thus a pure KMD expo could be great. Challenges are that it must be more than a meetup imo, because that's just spending money without a goal.

That's why I would propose to crowdfund a fund that would allow komodo team/trusted community members to go to bigger general blockchain/new technology events and reserve a 'stand' there. That way we would be able to target general blockchain public and thus grow our audience instead of meeting with our existing audience. ROI could be that projects notice KMD as a platform to build on

I was reading about the Kazakhstan story and found this article: https://diode.io/burning%20platform/Kazakhstan-MITM-can-be-prevented-with-Decentralized-PKI-19200/
the author Dominic Letz has published his idea in the following paper: https://twitter.com/diode_chain/status/1132824847883689985
it seems he's going to try that on Ethereum but Komodo would be a far better choice, the paper mentions forks and eclipse attacks as possible issues and dPoW could help with that.

Then have a talk about "chain sovereignity" "custom modules" "dPoW" and "Gas-free".

hey, @Malti , we can certainly contribute to such efforts too, if there are great event opportunities where we could mix in with other projects. 

We can also try to get to existing meetups/events and convince them to have a 'Komodo theme' in one of their meetups. That's something what happened on a meetup in Greece where they had several Komodo fans and they wanted a Komodo themed meetup.

If anyone regularly participates in normal bitcoin/blockchain meetups let me know. We could have Komodo/Pioneers as a sponsor.

@KomodoWorld idk sorry.  Initially I thought it was cool.  I don‚Äôt know what they are delivering that would benefit kmd.  Marmara with openrouter software and libnspv that is currently being written would be better to target imo - eg https://openwrt.org and mikrotik custom software install may be better established communities to engage with.

[29-Jul-19 11:09 PM] Audo#5667
Two biggest use cases for KMD

 - DEX base trading pairs ... the more users our DEX has the more demand there is to get KMD.
 - Money for the Ecosystem ... it will have a function as the other money (BTC) is slower and KMD can have advanced functionality that is powered by the Antara Framework. Thus my thesis is that KMD will find more and more usage the bigger the Komodo ecosystem grows.

Plus you never know what innovations await us in the future üòÉ


[29-Jul-19 11:14 PM] Mylo#8306
Yes, KMD will be the easiest base currency to use for ecosystem services.  as ecosystem grows, usage of KMD grows.
- blockchain security service
- 5% staking

@CHMEX all SmartChains are compatible once cc gets added to nSPV

Yes thanks ( it was a retorical question because James invented it )


[30-Jul-19 01:26 AM] jl777c#5810
only komodo/komodo forks with dPoW can get nspv


[30-Jul-19 01:27 AM] jl777c#5810
komodod with nSPV=1 already supports almost all CC

{Reactions}
üëç 

[30-Jul-19 01:27 AM] jl777c#5810
libnspv is not supporting CC yet, but it is a matter of porting the c++ code that implement CC support in nSPV=1 mode into libnspv which is 100% C


[30-Jul-19 01:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the usecase of nspv is that if you want the speed of an electrum wallet with the security that is more than headers only SPV wallet and nearly as secure as a fullnode, then a superlite nspv wallet is needed


[30-Jul-19 01:29 AM] jl777c#5810
nspv superlite can even withstand a total eclipse attack where all its peers are evil. like PoW, you just cant fake the data to fool a node, so it will know that it is not seeing notarized tx


[30-Jul-19 02:14 AM] Alexfrog#1338
incorrect, only top 55 coin with nspv üòõ


[30-Jul-19 02:14 AM] Alexfrog#1338
there are no top 50 coins with it

KMD is a top 50 coin for most of the time. ranges between 40 and 60

the sidechains are up-and-coming tech that we haven't had time time to really dwell into yet, in terms of marketing.

well. couple of days would probably make more sense, but i totally get your idea of providing more value to email subscribers. perhaps something else can be found to provide more value for them. until then, it's fine to delay them a bit for general population

We can rank for higher volume keywords if we target them but the higher volume keywords normally don't jive with TT updates

But in general SEO is a great way to get more traffic to the site. We've had luck with a few posts in this regard in the past (cryptographic hash functions post, UTXO post, and Merkle trees post, among a few others)

[07-Aug-19 08:00 AM] Mylo#8306
thanks for bringing up the TT @crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy 
there is a replacement series of posts that will be made, that will also help with biz dev for partners (chainmakers @siu  , chainzilla @PTYX , redfox @Bitcoin Benny ) and komodo in general for use cases.   idk, maybe consider it an upgraded version of TT, like applied komodo or something.

it's not at all close to being ready.   we are still in internal scorecard research on picking the 2-3 standout topics/solutions to build including a running scaling solution (for any use case) via a smaller notary network (6 notaries, 2 signers) as an enterprise would likely want for their own control to notarize to KMD.

stuff like working out the best product/market fit for KMD (there are many) that can reasonably be built in the next 12 months:  if a few solutions can be carved out per quarter - more power to everyone involved.   so by xmas, if there are 2-6 solutions that can be blueprinted, it gives everyone involved a demonstratable use of multi-chain architecture. 
e.g.
 - payments
 - exchanges
 - document notarized
 - supply chain
 - digital identity
 - blockchain 2fa
 - IoT (automotive, agriculture, healthcare)
 - fraud (telecom)
 - manufacturing (related to supply chain)
 - retail (loyalty, product certification)
 - real estate
 - gaming


[07-Aug-19 08:02 AM] Mylo#8306
other projects have strengths & head starts and larger teams to make things work a little smoother, especially with regards to regulations - so this also needs to be taken into account.


[07-Aug-19 08:02 AM] Mylo#8306
then there are integrative research - like, is it possible to atomic swap / bridge with new networks that are not bitcoin & eth.


[07-Aug-19 08:03 AM] Mylo#8306
marketmaker integrations like for hummingbot, and the legal contract template of the accord project which targets hyperledger.


[07-Aug-19 08:13 AM] Mylo#8306
my particular areas of interest are telecom fraud (because i know it well) & streaming payments.   where the streaming payments is applied - well this is a big topic, anywhere streaming data/media exists.   before streaming payments, need to establish some simpler use cases, like gaming, play some game get tokens etc.   trade them.   but being able to stream payments...changes gameplay imo.  e.g off the top of my head, think about a timed chess game.  every second you're not moving you're giving away a stream of payments to your opponent.
but first the low hanging fruit.


[07-Aug-19 08:41 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
does "replacement series of posts that will be made" mean that TT-s will be discontinued? i had a long talk with @Daniel CP about why it is a good idea to have them posted regularly

my point i guess, is that until those new formats come TT-s should stay. in addition to just providing information, more importantly they have enhance the trust factor.  that is regular updates on official project homepage that show ongoing progress

[10-Aug-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
we showed that TPS grows with the number of chains in a cluster. it would take 10000 chains to achieve the million tps


[10-Aug-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
this would cost a fair amount to do and it seems that it can be done anytime, but not sure it makes sense until there is someone that actually needs such high TPS


[10-Aug-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no magic needed for us to achieve this level of combined TPS, and we know each blockchain is independent and does 100 tx/sec (maybe 200 for normal taddr tx)

KMD-ZERO  Smartchain proposal


Abstract: This post describes a Komodo ecosystem decentralized censor-resistant network, that combines Zeronet, KMD Smartchain, and the functionality of Namecoin. This will allow any Smartchain with the Antara module described to secure and interact with serverless content. This is accomplished with a fork of Zeronet that accepts KMD Smartchain addresses and accepts top level domains hosted on smartchains (ie:  .kmd or .xxx)
This will allow any Komodo Smartchain to act via Zeronet protocol to secure the content ownership of the decentralized zites(websites) created using that address structure. It will also allow each Smartchain to issue it's own top level domain and save relevant content.json files.


[11-Aug-19 08:30 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
How:
"ZeroNet uses Bitcoin cryptography and BitTorrent technology to build a¬†decentralized censorship-resistant network"

Zeronet uses bip32 encryption for site content control. Sites can also receive btc via site addresses but are subjected to Bitcoin network limitations.

KMD-ZERO will use KMD Smartchain addresses allowing payments to be cheaper, faster, and more powerful (Antara modules). 

Top Level Domains:
Kmd-zero will use namecoin functionality (register names and store associated values in the blockchain)
 to create .kmd domains that are stored on chain.

Dominate issues of Namecoin that can be solved.
-Needed an infinite block reward
-Domain squatting. A solution to this is raising the registration fee to prevent spam and the multichain architecture with infinite domain choices changes the game theory of squatting.


[11-Aug-19 08:30 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Secure site content with dPow:
Zeronet sites use a file called content.json that holds filenames, hashes and signatures 

KMD-ZERO will optionally store Content.json or a hash of it onchain.
-This is to help make sure most recent site version
-Offers extra tamper resistance.
-Spam control
-Potentialy allows blockchain and blockexplorers to act as an index browser and site access jump start.


Future: 
-Antara modules can help add paid site access and other payment or site features.

-nSPV lite clients to help  chain access due to size issues, and wallet features to websites.

-Compatibly with zeronet addresses.

-DNS encryption?

-z addresses?

-sell domain or site via DEX


[11-Aug-19 08:31 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Distribution and coin details of KMD-ZERO:

Cpu minable
Low block reward
Infinite block rewards


The premine would consist of a
development and community fund equal in size. 2.3082 M total

Multisig held be trusted members

Dev fund is to be used for bounties and Dpow
 
Community fund is airdropped to kmd addresses at a rate of 1/100 of address balances or 1.1541 M total

This sounds very very interesting, is zeronet already working or still in development? do you mean make them move to a smartchain or do a separate thing?


[11-Aug-19 09:06 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Zeronet already is working.  Step 1 should be very simple. Change the btc addressing to kmd addressing

[11-Aug-19 09:08 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I admit it's somewhat over my head, I need to read more


[11-Aug-19 09:09 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Basically, I'm proposing to create Namecoin 2.0 using Antara framework and make it work with a few simple changes to zeronet


[11-Aug-19 09:11 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
ok that is indeed a good idea, how did it scale so far using btc?


[11-Aug-19 09:12 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Zeronet is block chain free. My proposal would allow it to work with (but not necessarily exclusively) a block chain for extra features.


[11-Aug-19 09:14 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Instead of passwords, zeronet uses btc keys just not block chain. The keys are real though and could also have btc sent to them.


[11-Aug-19 09:15 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
That's why I envisioned the keys to be kmd ecosystem compatible.


[11-Aug-19 09:21 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
in general using the coin for users to access content is non-starter, absolutely no. But it makes sense to have a coin to create domains, to renew them after 1 year and to trade them. You need domains that expire and can be traded like nft.


[11-Aug-19 09:21 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
for the rest is an excellent idea


[11-Aug-19 09:30 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Thanks. Also the mention of storing the content.json file is not for access content but to add extra verification (if needed) to make sure content is current

Some  market  data   describe  KMD  as   "privacy-focused cryptocurrency"   " Komodo is a platform forked from zCash. It incorporates the same zero-knowledge proof protocol, so transactions are anonymous and private "   etc

Perhaps marketing team should contact these resources and clarify the current status of the project. New users will simply be misled.

[06-Sep-19 12:26 PM] Regnar#6164
What is the current status of those rewards @Deleted User? Does an exchange already have those funds being claimed and they just dont anything with them? Or they CAN claim but don't claim them. Can you explain the flag more, the wallet acknowledges itself as an exchange and any reward is sent to the donation address? So if an exchange doesn't do the flag, they can claim rewards themselves or distribute to their users?


[06-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Regnar#6164
Can they still do `--exchange` to give to miners if they want? And add the `--donation` along with it if they want to give to NPO?


[06-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Regnar#6164
Basically both options


[06-Sep-19 12:30 PM] Regnar#6164
They currently are giving to miners.


[06-Sep-19 12:31 PM] Regnar#6164
The way I see it is they can give to miners, keep for themselves, distribute to their users, or donate it. Will those 4 options be available still?


[06-Sep-19 12:32 PM] Regnar#6164
Are most of them using`--exchange` already?


[06-Sep-19 12:36 PM] Regnar#6164
I do like the donation idea, I don't think we should be changing what a tag they are already using, does. I think the right way to go about it is to get them to activately change to a `--donation` flag.


[06-Sep-19 12:37 PM] Regnar#6164
Which would be harder to do in order to get the end result of exchange rewards going to a donation address, but would be more intentional on their part, and less like we just swapped out some coding to manipulate the way they set up their exchange


[06-Sep-19 12:41 PM] Regnar#6164
I think changing what `--exchange` does is going to cause us PR headaches and potentially call into question the NPO itself, people may call it a shell or w.e. What if the NPO supports a cause an exchange doesn't want to, or cannot support, if they have their flag set like they currently do are we putting them in a position they could face legal issues.


[06-Sep-19 12:42 PM] Regnar#6164
Did binance change other exchanges underlying code functionality to fund their donation address? I don't know


[06-Sep-19 12:46 PM] Regnar#6164
Idk man, we're talking about changing where money goes, not by changing the flag, but changing what a default flag does simply because we know it is used by default and that exchanges might not change it.


[06-Sep-19 12:48 PM] Regnar#6164
The flag the exchange sets is providing additional block rewards for miners right? Do exchanges know this when they set it?

a few exchanges use a custom daemon they made that doesnt support rewards at all


[06-Sep-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
you missed my point


[06-Sep-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
if they run their own custom software, what does it matter what our code does??


[06-Sep-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
one of the bigger ones, that i know of. i think only bittrex is using the -exchange flag


[06-Sep-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i took almost 2 years for hitbtc to change from 4 decimal places to 8, so BTC trading was useless there.


[06-Sep-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
the exchanges basically wont do anything


[06-Sep-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
from what i have seen, NOTHING pushes them at all


[06-Sep-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
they simply dont care


[06-Sep-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
i think they use the standard daemon


[06-Sep-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
most all the exchanges claim for themselves


[06-Sep-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
after binance announce they will payout to users, a total of ZERO other exchanges decide to follow


[06-Sep-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
not your privkeys, not your coins, so not your rewards


[06-Sep-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
the standard daemon claims whenever the funds are moved


[06-Sep-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
if they dont use the funds, there is lost rewards due to the one month cap


[06-Sep-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
then when they do move it, they get the one month rewards


[06-Sep-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
adding a donation address to -exchange, would only change bittrex

but changing this is changing a basic rule about how the blockchain works. txfees going to the miner


[06-Sep-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
it is better to convince bittrex to directly use -donation=


[06-Sep-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
push them to stop collecting rewards?


[06-Sep-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if you think that has any chance of happening, you are seriously misunderstanding what the exchanges are doing


[06-Sep-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
they charge hundreds of thousands of dollars to add a new coin. they wont stop collecting the rewards


[06-Sep-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i am only aware of bittrex using -exchange


[06-Sep-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i think all other than bittrex and huobi


[06-Sep-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe huobi is also claiming for themselves now


[06-Sep-19 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
huobi is the one with a totally custom implementation


[06-Sep-19 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if they ever added claiming and if they did, they likely will be keeping it


[06-Sep-19 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
seems only bittrex is the candidate and in their case -donation is the way to go


[06-Sep-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, they might decide to just -donation to their own address as that avoids most of the accounting issues


[06-Sep-19 01:16 PM] Regnar#6164

The exchange is the one who does the transaction , that is the criterion for the reward , do they not have the right to decide what to do with their proceeds


[06-Sep-19 01:37 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Why stir the pot with exchange users?  Their users should petition the exchange for the rewards if they feel so strongly about it.  But this isn‚Äôt our fight to take To the exchanges.

Okay I get you don't like that they keep the rewards their users "should" receive (if they owned the keys themselves) but why should we get to decide that we get to take and use those rewards? The exchange owns the keys, people deposited funds there knowing they didn't own the keys. If an exchange uses those funds for themselves, for their users, for charity etc who are we to decide what it gets used for, we don't own those keys.

there's also sidechain tech on Komodo powered by the gateways module if I'm not mistaken.

"Smart Chain"

This should be our MAIN POINS for marketing to attract big corporations & developers to develop on our platform. Because sadly many big corporations & developers still doesn't know about Komodo, so they still want to develops their business on ETH even though it NOT scalable and very slow. So hope our Marketing Team will consider this STRONG POINS when promoting our KOMODO Platform to the public & Blockchain Conferences...

I have an idea for twitter.
Maybe we can create small DID YOU KNOW or KOMODO FACTS tweets.

Like this one for example:

DID YOU KNOW: 
Smaller projects can have the same security as Bitcoin if they adopt Komodo's  delayed proof of work. dPoW recycles this energy to protect other chains from 51% attacks.
- Add links with info about that subject.
- Add a picture.

Example:
KOMODO FACTS:
If projects do the smart thing and buy roughly 6000 kmd up front, they can use their 5% to pay for their annual dPoW cost.
- Add links with info about that subject
- Add a picture

We are still on the Beta phase and our recommendation still is not to use it as a main wallet nor store large amounts of crypto there.

Once we are ready to come out of Beta we will have a full launch and then can start to advertise it in order to get a sizable user base to use it.

What is the estimated timeline for beta phase to the full version?


[18-Sep-19 10:22 PM] Audo#5667
we don't publishe timelines because they never hold.


[18-Sep-19 10:24 PM] Audo#5667
it's complex tech, although everything seems to be working. However, there maybe optimization and maybe even new attack vectors found that need to be fixed before it gains a lot of use.

Then there's the UX/UI side too which need to be optimized as well before we can push the wallet use hard


[18-Sep-19 10:24 PM] Audo#5667
so, a lot of work

Why deadlines are killing your productivity
Yes, you read that right: when it comes to matters of project implementation and agile workflows, deadlines actually do more to kill‚Ä¶

Use Deadlines to Boost Your Productivity and Reduce Stress
Deadlines can be a struggle, but they don‚Äôt have to be. Think of it this way: Deadlines are a prioritization tool that tell you a given project is important to focus on. They make it easier to honestly assess your workload ‚Äî if you have something due on Friday and you kno...

[19-Sep-19 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems unclear the actual effect of deadlines


[19-Sep-19 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i think a better metric is if the product is continuously improving (or not)


[19-Sep-19 04:23 AM] jl777c#5810
atomicDEX is now having 99% success rate for swaps that are started, this is up from 95% just a few weeks ago


[19-Sep-19 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
there are also aspects that are independent, yet related, like the automated marketmaker, which is also in the works, in addition to several other aspects.


[19-Sep-19 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
should there be some impossible to meet deadline at a certain date, which would guarantee that tradeoffs will be made


[19-Sep-19 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
atomicDEX is not just some website where if there is a bug, people would have to refresh the page or something minor like that. real money will be at stake and we need it to be as good as it can be.


[19-Sep-19 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
but how to define that?


[19-Sep-19 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
if we cant specifically define something, how can you make a deadline for it


[19-Sep-19 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so, i go back to the continuous improvement metric


[19-Sep-19 04:26 AM] jl777c#5810
there are literally thousands of different mobile phones out there. thousands. getting it to work on all of them, likely is not even possible


[19-Sep-19 04:27 AM] jl777c#5810
so the real question is if atomicDEX has been continuously improving or not


[19-Sep-19 04:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems the marketing of it can be happening in parallel along with the other related projects


[19-Sep-19 04:27 AM] jl777c#5810
and all of these things need to continuously improve

but atomicDEX is a critical component to most of the other aspects, as a low friction way to exchange coins is needed

üëÜ this is the biggest tech breakthrough since cross chain atomic swaps in 2014 or for internet comparison going from 56k to broadband internet.

re: `Do we have many Japanese KMD owners?`
Hi @hyperDEX ,
KMD isn't well known here, in my experience.  Even among crypto-people with a good level of English skill.  To change that, info in Japanese is a giant must.
The AtomicDEX app and site has had a Japanese translation so that is a good start.
There is a great deal of opportunity here.
Of course there are KMD holders here, but I would guess that it would be a very small percentage in various ways.
