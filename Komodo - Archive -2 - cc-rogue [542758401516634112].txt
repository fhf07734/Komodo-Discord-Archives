Roguelander - using highlander competition between rogue players
 anybody can create a game by specifying maxplayers and buyin. Buyin of 0.00 ROGUE is for newbies and a good way to get experience. All players will start in the identical level, but each level after that will be unique to each player.
 
 There are two different modes that is based on the maxplayers. If maxplayers is one, then it is basically a practice/farming game where there are no time limits. Also, the gold -> ROGUE conversion rate is cut in half. You can start a single player game as soon as the newgame tx is confirmed.


[06-Feb-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810 (pinned)
If maxplayers is more than one, then it goes into highlander mode. There can only be one winner. Additionally, multiplayer mode adds a timelimit of ROGUE_MAXKEYSTROKESGAP (60) blocks between keystrokes updates. That is approx. one hour and every level it does an automatic update, so as long as you are actively playing, it wont be a problem. The is ROGUE_REGISTRATION blocks waiting period before any of the players can start. The random seed for the game is based on the future blockhash so that way, nobody is able to start before the others.

rogue is not an easy game to win, so it could be that the winner for a specific group is simply the last one standing. If you bailout of a game you cant win, but you can convert all the ingame gold you gathered at 0.001 ROGUE each. [In the event that there arent enough globally locked funds to payout the ROGUE, you will have to wait until there is. Since 10% of all economic activity creates more globally locked funds, it is just a matter of time before there will be enough funds to payout. Also, you can help speed this up by encouraging others to transact in ROGUE]
 
 Of course, the most direct way to win, is to get the amulet and come back out of the dungeon. The winner will get all of the buyins from all the players in addition to 0.01 ROGUE for every ingame gold.
 
 The above alone is enough to make the timeless classic solitaire game into a captivating multiplayer game, where real coins are at stake. However, there is an even better aspect to ROGUE! Whenever your player survives a game, even when you bailout, the entire player and his pack is preserved on the blockchain and becomes a nonfungible asset that you can trade for ROGUE.


[06-Feb-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810 (pinned)
Additionally, instead of just being a collectors item with unique characteristics, the rogue playerdata can be used in any ROGUE game. Just specify the txid that created your character when you register and your character is restored. The better your characteristics your playerdata has, the more likely you are to win in multiplayer mode to win all the buyins. So there is definite economic value to a strong playerdata.


[06-Feb-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810 (pinned)
You can farm characters in single player mode to earn ROGUE or to make competitive playerdata sets. You can purchase existing playerdata for collecting, or for using in battle.
Here is how to play:
 
 ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 \"[3,10]\" -> this will create a hex transaction that when broadcast with sendrawtransaction will get a gametxid onto the blockchain. This specific command was for 3 players and a buyin of 10 ROGUE. Lets assume the gametxid is 4fd6f5cad0fac455e5989ca6eef111b00292845447075a802e9335879146ad5a, most all the other commands will need the gametxid.
 
 you can always find all the existing games with:
 
  ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib pending 17
 
 and info about a specific game with:
 
  ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib gameinfo 17 \"[%224fd6f5cad0fac455e5989ca6eef111b00292845447075a802e9335879146ad5a%22]\"
 due to quirks of various parsing at the shell, rpc and internal level, the above convention is used where %22 is added where " should be. also all fields are separated by , without any space.


[06-Feb-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810 (pinned)
When you do a gameinfo command it will show a "run" field and that will tell you if you are registered for the game or not. If not, the "run" field shows the register syntax you need to do, if you are registered, it will show the command line to start the rogue game that is playing the registered game.
 
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib register 17 \"[%224fd6f5cad0fac455e5989ca6eef111b00292845447075a802e9335879146ad5a%22,%22playerdata_txid%22]\"
 If you want to cash in your ingame gold and preserve your character for another battle, do the bailout:
 
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%224fd6f5cad0fac455e5989ca6eef111b00292845447075a802e9335879146ad5a%22]\"
 If you won your game before anybody else did or if you are the last one left who didnt bailout, you can claim the prize:
 
 ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib highlander 17 \"[%224fd6f5cad0fac455e5989ca6eef111b00292845447075a802e9335879146ad5a%22]\"
 The txid you get from the bailout or highlander transactions is the "playerdata_txid" that you can use in future games.

The community will soon understand the impact of this "little" blockchain game on Komodo. Whoever understands the tech will also understand that this is yet another proof of Komodos capabilities.
Rogue does  utilize fungible tokens (unique cryptoassets) which can technically represent digital cryptographic collectibles - remember the cryptokitties? Well with ROGUELANDER your character becomes the collectible and no longer remains a useless cryptographic key but rather an avatar/character that can be used for gameplay and even traded.


[06-Feb-19 03:14 PM] ca333#0333
This is even a proof of concept for more future game implementation. multiplayer games, etc.

[07-Feb-19 12:18 AM] LocoMB#8593
quite interesting how so far blockchains have _not_ yet been adopted in the gaming industry,
although using decentralized in-game currencies is an obvious major use case.
The sad answer is that gaming is incredibly centralized and that gaming companies fear any whiff of real-world monetary connection like Count Dracula fears the sunlight.
Just imagine Blizzard issueing WoW tokens fungible other than through _their_ servers - the thought alone keeps corp execs shivering awake at night...
So again, it is up for grabs for independent start ups


[07-Feb-19 12:21 AM] LocoMB#8593
Sure, these humongous playgrounds like WoW require _constant_ monitoring and fussing about of an army of nannies, caretakers and maintainers, not only in regard to patching updates and all that, but also in respect to keeping it clean and preventing cheating, so creating games worlds that run mostly on their own is quiute a challenge


[07-Feb-19 12:22 AM] LocoMB#8593
Bitcrystals and their card game looked promising- but they have crashed badly on CMC.
Seems the game is popular and well, but as I understand they are using a countzerparty token, which was a very bad choice... naturally, I posted on Bitcointalk about Komodo, but I am not suprised that they stick with their bad choice of platform


[07-Feb-19 12:26 AM] LocoMB#8593
Same goes for mobilego... in fact, as soon as a regular gaming company only so much as touches a blockchain, a shrieking mob of bloodthirsty bureaucrats and taxmen will pounce on them so hard, they wont even know what hit them...
so the only way to avoid that will be a wholly decentralised game develeopment


[07-Feb-19 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
ROGUE chain is its own self-sufficient universe. it is an ac_perc chain, so the more rogue players, the more ROGUE is created. the ingame gold -> ROGUE at 0.1% to 1%, so each ingame gold is like 0.001 ROGUE coins (0.01 if you win). Based on the time cost of finding the ingame gold, it creates some sort of baseline for the value of ROGUE. I think about one hour to get 1 ROGUE is a rough estimate.


[07-Feb-19 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
given that each ROGUE has externally linked value, then a high level character will have value as it is able to win the multiplayer games, which means not only are the nonfungible characters a collectible, but they have some sort of intrinsic value


[07-Feb-19 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
all that is needed is for a decent gui to be made to enable managing the playerdata and game lobby, so no need for any large game company. And the methods used for rogue CC will work for any single player game that has a deterministic RNG. So it isnt applicable to all games, but a decent percentage of it. surprised that so few are seeming to understand the potential represented by rogue CC

throught the pioneers i've been chatting with a young gamedev.   he's keen for some work which we'll provide some writing work to help him with his own dev - but i'm making a list of things to pick and choose from, one of them which we will hopefully fund him some extra incentive is to create a C# plugin that works in unity3d.  he'll hopefully begin doing some work late next week for pioneers.

that is in the channel topic, isnt it?


[07-Feb-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
but tobuild it you need a libcc.so that has rogue in it, that is why to ./makerogue


[07-Feb-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
can someone post get started instructions?


[07-Feb-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to build jl777 branch, with rogue libcc.so


[07-Feb-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
makerogue builds the rogue libcc.so


[07-Feb-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
normal building process builds the komodod


[07-Feb-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
then you can run the above line

you just need to run ./makerogue in the cc dir BEFORE you build the komodod

[07-Feb-19 01:44 PM] Mylo#8306
@FishyGuts not as much as i'd like.   it's a new collaboration so results might vary.   although with the unity store asset pretty much out of the box simple GUI, it might be an easy integration but it might not be worth it.  multiple GUIs would be interesting though.   also what would be interesting is a % of ROGUE going to the cclib dev or a % going to the GUI dev.    with many GUIs, and with a popular game, it could really become a passionate contest of artwork etc.   add in some VR for the same game blockchain artifacts then you really have different experiences for everyone.   it's another new angle to amazing tech...


[07-Feb-19 01:48 PM] FishyGuts#5085
@Strob has knowledge in 3d graphics and assets.  Perhaps he can help or knows someone to refer you to for your needs.

Yes I could maybe help. So there will be some graphics in that blockchain game?

yes, graphics required for the GUI.

btw @SHossain - there is the `rogue.html` in src/cc/rogue which might be of a help.

@SHossain about the part in your guide where you set a new pubkey, there is an actual RPC called `setpubkey`. you don't have to restart the daemon anymore. so it's just a matter of `getnewaddress`, `validateaddress` and then `setpubkey <pubkey>` and you're good to go.

capital S?


[08-Feb-19 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
when I get the playerdata working, you can start with a preexitng character

preexisting


[08-Feb-19 05:42 AM] jorian#4555

[08-Feb-19 05:42 AM] jorian#4555

the ingame gold is worth 0.001 ROGUE


[08-Feb-19 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
0.01 ROGUE if you win


[08-Feb-19 05:45 AM] jorian#4555
but when you die, your character is dead and cannot be revived or anything right? so that character you sell, must have been alive for all the levels etc.


[08-Feb-19 05:45 AM] jorian#4555
do all the items you scavenge transfer with the character too?


[08-Feb-19 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
you can 'Q' at anytime to preserve the playerdata


[08-Feb-19 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
dying is not good


[08-Feb-19 05:46 AM] jorian#4555
Q being quit


[08-Feb-19 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
so to cash in your ingame gold and preserve your pack items do a 'Q' and then a bailout tx


[08-Feb-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
then that txid can be used in a future register and the same character will be the one you start with. I dont have this part working yet, but I think I found all the changes needed

To start a new game i just - ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 "[1]" and then use Hex again?

yes, you always need to send the hex


[08-Feb-19 06:25 AM] SHossain#0007
anytime you see HEX for any CC, you need to broadcast it

[08-Feb-19 06:37 AM] gcharang#6833
`pgrep komodod` will give you a number
`kill -9 <the above number>`


[08-Feb-19 06:38 AM] SHossain#0007
just use `pkill -15 komodod` or `pkill -9 komodod` if you only have ROGUE running in the test computer


[08-Feb-19 06:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c may I suggest/request you make this rouge game with your own custom hard to solve puzzles? and linked them with KMD as reward?
hard as if only the blockchain educated and more technical people can crack them.
idea is to make people learn about the capability you have coded to a truing complete game and make more technical people look into this.
as more technical eyes see this work, the higher the hope is we get more devs onboard.

@jorian if you try to play the same game again after you died, the punishment is the daemon goes into an infinite loop


[08-Feb-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
dont have a check to prevent that yet, once you die or quit, you cant play that seed again

Not yet. Too tedious and not enough time :/

@Pumtchak you need to register new game each time after you die (for now)


[09-Feb-19 08:11 AM] siu#3920
So from this game a type of blockchain based DOOM can be done? Or a Zelda game?


[09-Feb-19 08:13 AM] Alright#0419
@siu if it's deterministically random


[09-Feb-19 08:13 AM] Alright#0419
as in same seed, same user input, same outcome

It was the games that got me to figure out how to use the ole vic20 and comodore64. Thanks to that banging guide, I just built Komodo in order to play rogue, and killed by an emu.

updated jl777 branch with new version. it works now much better and has nonfungible token data for the playerdata, also a new rpc "players" that will display all your players. you should be able to register with the playertxid and start the dungeon with that character. side effect is that all the magic is deciphered. if this makes the game too easy, I can make it so only things that are actually known can be seen

using the latest version, I am able to create a nonfungible asset, that theoretically can use the tokenbid/ask mechanism, though that needs to be verified. just got the basics working with the invaluable help of dimxy

character data is creating the token when you 'Q', but not if you get killed

you can register with it and earlier I was able to play a new game with the playerdata, but i am waiting to mine a block to test it out

latest now works with playerdata. you can register the txid of the bailout assuming it has playerdata and then you can continue developing your character with the next game


[10-Feb-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it should also work with tokenbid/ask, but that definitely needs to be tested


[10-Feb-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
with this ROGUE is very close to feature complete. of course assuming no major bugs and the DEX functions work. I added some error checking, but I think it is still possible to end up in some bad states

cp -r * ~/komodo/src
cd  ~/komodo/src
 ./rogue_tui.py ```

Would be good to backtrace daemon and rogue in such situation I think

Trying to reproduce on my side


[11-Feb-19 06:15 AM] SHossain#0007
no backtrace data from my computer as the daemon didn't actually crash


[11-Feb-19 06:15 AM] SHossain#0007
unless there is a way i can get that


[11-Feb-19 06:15 AM] SHossain#0007
this shows up on the stdout when i killed the daemon with -15

so something that happens at level 4+ on stairs? what is stairs


[11-Feb-19 06:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Stairs is `%`

`%`

i got killed on level 1 and  daemon didn't hang


[11-Feb-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
so when you do a >


[11-Feb-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
does the next level appear?


[11-Feb-19 06:30 AM] TonyL#3577
I did `Shift + >` then next level appeared, then it hanged


[11-Feb-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
rogue exe is ok?


[11-Feb-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
did the keystrokes tx go out?


[11-Feb-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810

Latest one


[11-Feb-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
the strange thing is that komodod is not involved in much when you are using the rogue dapp


[11-Feb-19 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
so a single player game around level 5 when going to next level puts komodod in an infinite loop with high CPU?


[11-Feb-19 06:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems like this yes


[11-Feb-19 06:35 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[11-Feb-19 06:35 AM] SHossain#0007
dying on level 1 or 2 doesn't produce this issue


[11-Feb-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
could it be that the prior keystrokes tx was not confirmed yet?


[11-Feb-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it is getting stuck trying to find baton


[11-Feb-19 06:38 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. will  wait for new block after each level


[11-Feb-19 06:38 AM] SHossain#0007
to make sure tx is confirmed


[11-Feb-19 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
let me change the logic a bit. I can make it do keystrokes on every third level, I would imagine it would get confirmed by then


[11-Feb-19 06:40 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, that may resolve if this is the case


[11-Feb-19 06:43 AM] TonyL#3577
I go rest - will continue to work on multiplayer TUI stuff tomorrow

Use S to search for hidden doors or passages

@SHossain duplicated the 100% komodod, it was when the keystrokes tx was unconfirmed and you do a bailout


[11-Feb-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
for now avoid doing that. i will fix the bug after I get playerdata DEX working

after killing and restarting, was able to the bailout tx, so it is not fatal but sure annoying


[11-Feb-19 08:12 AM] jorian#4555
@SHossain you need to 'find' it


[11-Feb-19 08:12 AM] jorian#4555
press 's' to search, especially in those dead-end tunnels


[11-Feb-19 08:12 AM] jorian#4555
do it repeatedly, move around


[11-Feb-19 08:12 AM] jorian#4555
it sometimes shows up after a couple of 's'earches


[11-Feb-19 08:13 AM] SHossain#0007
yeah, i did `S` and didn't work. will try next `s` when i see it


[11-Feb-19 08:13 AM] jorian#4555
also, doors may appear in seemingly empty/dead-end rooms

@jl777c yes, it was just annoying to restart each time. but, with latest, i didn't face any infinite loop


[11-Feb-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
doing much fewer keystrokes tx minimizes the problem, but still it is there and could happen if 5 minutes between blocks. when I get time to investigate it should be able to fix it

died on level 1 and daemon is on infinite loop


[11-Feb-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
is the keystrokes tx unconfirmed?


[11-Feb-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if so that is the same bug


[11-Feb-19 10:03 AM] SHossain#0007
it was just a new game after update.
is there a new keystroke on level one upon starting the game?


[11-Feb-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
was the register confirmed?


[11-Feb-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
it makes a linked list from the newgame -> register -> keystroke -> keystroke ... -> bailout


[11-Feb-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
likely nothing has confirmed as mining is very slow now


[11-Feb-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are mining, plz keep updated to latest as otherwise the diff goes way up and we get stranded

yes, my mining node is updated too. probably the tx wasn't confirmed

It is a small step for jl777 but a HUGE step for blockchain history. This is the worlds first player data swap via #KMD #DEX. #Komodo just atomic swapped non-fungible tokens that represent your game avatars player data. Its like trading your avatar from WoW for BTC/KMD! #K...

i think no one really understands what this technological innovation means for the blockchain (gaming) industry. we just did a proof of concept for blockchain gaming and avatar trading. 

Its basically like if you would play World of Warcraft ON the blockchain and also if you would trade your avatar ON the blockchain! all through blockchain based technologies and KMDs DEX!

without this, people could just edit their character data and put whatever info they want into it

in this usecase it represents "just" an avatar. but we all know what else it could represent. literally endless possibilities to utilize non-fungible tokens tech.

tokenized playerdata can now be used with register, at least if you created it. when you bailout it creates the playerdata and the txid is the playertxid. this appears in tokenlist as it should, since it is a token


[11-Feb-19 06:44 PM] jl777c#5810
when you register with it, you burn the playerdata and it is recreated inside the dungeon, but you are recreated without wearing any armor or wielding any weapon, so make sure to w and W


[11-Feb-19 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
after the playerdata is burned via the register, it properly disappears from the tokenlist. Maybe there are hardforking changes from a few hours ago. not sure. updating daily is a good idea anyway, especially at this stage and pace of development. I will test the using of traded playerdata, but is uses mostly the same codepath as using a self created, so it has a decent chance to work


[11-Feb-19 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
once that function is there, I think it is just the bug fixes remaining and then adding validation and dPoW. the latter 2 are not really game play visible so I am doing it last


[11-Feb-19 06:51 PM] jl777c#5810

[11-Feb-19 06:57 PM] jl777c#5810
just confirmed a sync from scratch works, so if you cant sync to mainchain, just do a total resync


[11-Feb-19 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, there is a inifinite loop i havent fixed yet that happens if you issue a rogue tx when a dependent one is not confirmed. that is an important one to fix, but for now, be patient and wait for confirmations, the Hobgoblin can wait for a minute

[12-Feb-19 06:03 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
then entered and died


[12-Feb-19 06:03 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
then pressed 2 to check players


[12-Feb-19 06:04 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
back up and running after crash now - restart solved


[12-Feb-19 06:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Trying to reproduce


[12-Feb-19 06:04 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ill try again also


[12-Feb-19 06:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Btw if you exited once without death now you should be able to choose warrior to go dungeon with


[12-Feb-19 06:05 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ok , then if i just started a game as normal would that give me that player?


[12-Feb-19 06:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Yup, just start by [3] as usual


[12-Feb-19 06:06 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
so thats what i did then died.


[12-Feb-19 06:06 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
retunr to menu and pressed 2 - hanged and crashed


[12-Feb-19 06:06 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i obvs shouldnt have had a character as he died


[12-Feb-19 06:07 AM] TonyL#3577
If after survival trial you played again and died without warrior choose it means that previous bailout wasn't mined yet - I guess it caused the crash


[12-Feb-19 06:07 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Right ok ,


[12-Feb-19 06:07 AM] TonyL#3577
When bailout with alive warrior is mined it will ask like this

i have just bailed again so ill enter again in a minute


[12-Feb-19 06:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, I can add to TUI waiting for bailout transaction mining to get back into main menu


[12-Feb-19 06:15 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Maybe a standard countdown ?


[12-Feb-19 06:15 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
"returning to menu in 30 secs ......"]


[12-Feb-19 06:16 AM] TonyL#3577
If transaction not mined in 30 seconds waiting will not have sense - it's easy to check if transaction in mempool each X seconds and print "Waiting for transaction to be mined" (same as when you start new game)


[12-Feb-19 06:16 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Makes sense


[12-Feb-19 06:16 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ive just timed out again


[12-Feb-19 06:17 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
just after a regular death this time


[12-Feb-19 06:17 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
3 new game - hangs time out


[12-Feb-19 06:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Will add waiting for `bailout` transaction mining now to check if it will help make things stable

[12-Feb-19 06:35 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i died b4 i could bail lol


[12-Feb-19 06:39 AM] TonyL#3577
As I understand it happens on very short games on `bailout` transaction attempt


[12-Feb-19 06:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Played whole day - no issues (but games were never less than block), now entered dungeon, moved fast to lvl2 and exited with bailout transaction (all took 20 second or so) and daemon hanged


[12-Feb-19 06:41 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
ive just bailed on lvl 3


[12-Feb-19 06:42 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
timed out


[12-Feb-19 06:42 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Seems it didnt send a tx - http://rogue.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RP48H2AupnnSaLqwL1aN8ddk2KcFzQZcni


[12-Feb-19 06:44 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
That killed it , hanging again


[12-Feb-19 06:45 AM] TonyL#3577
I see, so daemon deadlocking on `bailout gametxid` transaction sending attempt in some cases


[12-Feb-19 06:46 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah tht tx never went


[12-Feb-19 06:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Will try to wait one block before send `bailout` to ensure that keystrokes mined


[12-Feb-19 06:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Added such check - testing


[12-Feb-19 07:02 AM] TonyL#3577
@CryptoNinjaa could you please update TUI and try now?


[12-Feb-19 07:03 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
yes ill try now


[12-Feb-19 07:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Played few fast games - `bailout` seems broadcast if wait for a next block. Now waiting for a `bailout` transaction to be mined seems like overkill but from other hand it will help to avoid the questions like a "why I don't see warrior in warriors list"


[12-Feb-19 08:26 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
im getting time outs just after dying and pressing continue :/


[12-Feb-19 08:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Did you replace TUI files in `src` folder?


[12-Feb-19 08:27 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

ive had to wipe and start again a few times today


[12-Feb-19 08:31 AM] TonyL#3577
If daemon hangs in TUI it probably will hang in non TUI mode since TUI just issuing RPC calls


[12-Feb-19 08:31 AM] SHossain#0007
will wipe and start again if manual play has issues

[12-Feb-19 08:34 AM] SHossain#0007
somehow my TUI is sending daemon to infinite loop?


[12-Feb-19 08:35 AM] TonyL#3577
When you starting new game TUI not interacting with daemon at all after register transaction is mined ü§î


[12-Feb-19 08:36 AM] SHossain#0007
cloned new TUI from source and trying again


[12-Feb-19 08:36 AM] TonyL#3577
It's just starting rogue executable and everything else doing rogue executable until game is ended


[12-Feb-19 08:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Just as an idea - maybe TUI files in folder with other daemon


[12-Feb-19 08:37 AM] SHossain#0007
it's at the same folder

@SHossain Aha, it hanged on `gameinfo 17 c22cf9d7bc9c431e309179a3e34af0bb5e1b319e72fdbdf6c947ca6987659064` call

On your side I mean - not sure why üòÉ


[12-Feb-19 08:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Or on `players 17` call


[12-Feb-19 08:42 AM] SHossain#0007
@CryptoNinjaa seems to have the same issue as well ^^


[12-Feb-19 08:42 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
it didnt see 2 new blocks


[12-Feb-19 08:44 AM] SHossain#0007
i'm running the TUI executable file from inside `~/komodo/src/` dir and the daemon works fine when i use manually


[12-Feb-19 08:45 AM] SHossain#0007
maybe something changed since last night


[12-Feb-19 08:45 AM] SHossain#0007
it was working fine for me


[12-Feb-19 08:45 AM] SHossain#0007
it was also number 2 which had the single player game. today moved to 3


[12-Feb-19 08:46 AM] TonyL#3577
When playing manually can you issue `bailout` for your game after game is finished and then try to call `gameinfo` for same game and `players 17` before `bailout` is mined?


[12-Feb-19 08:46 AM] TonyL#3577
This way we detect on which RPC call daemon deadlock. I hope


[12-Feb-19 08:49 AM] TonyL#3577
What TUI calling:
1) "newgame", "17", "[1]" - to start new game
Waiting for this transaction to be mined
2)  "players", "17" - to check if player have any warriors to choose
3) In case if there no any players it calling "register", "17", gametxid
In case if there is any player it asks for player txid then calling  "register", "17", gametxid + playertxid


[12-Feb-19 08:50 AM] TonyL#3577
4) After it TUI calling "gameinfo", "17", gametxid to get the seed
5) subprocess.call(["cc/rogue/rogue", str(game_info["seed"]), str(game_info["gametxid"])]) - game executing and all business on rogue executable side


[12-Feb-19 08:52 AM] TonyL#3577
After game is finished (first Enter press) - it sending ``` "bailout", "17", gametxid``` (now there is testing version which waiting for a one block before bailout and waiting for bailout transaction to be mined)


[12-Feb-19 08:56 AM] TonyL#3577
[2] moved to [3] because I've added new menu item to get  "players", "17" list of players
TUI doing sequence of RPC calls - if daemon hangs when you using TUI it's possible to reproduce by manual same RPC calls issuing
As I understand now there are some cases when daemon hangs on `players` and `bailout` calls


[12-Feb-19 08:56 AM] SHossain#0007
new game doesn't do bailout until played, right?


[12-Feb-19 08:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Yup bailout doing after game is finished


[12-Feb-19 08:57 AM] TonyL#3577
New call which in TUI logic before game start is `players 17`


[12-Feb-19 09:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Is `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib players 17` working fine manually on your side @SHossain ?


[12-Feb-19 09:05 AM] SHossain#0007
just a sec. let me restart the daemon


[12-Feb-19 09:05 AM] SHossain#0007
this is the call sending daemon to infinite loop


[12-Feb-19 09:05 AM] SHossain#0007
happened just after fresh start


[12-Feb-19 09:06 AM] TonyL#3577
As a suggestion maybe there were hardforking changes after your yesterday trades with James


[12-Feb-19 09:06 AM] TonyL#3577
So personally yours players list is corrupted at the moment


[12-Feb-19 09:06 AM] SHossain#0007
Yes, James did a lot of rework since then


[12-Feb-19 09:07 AM] TonyL#3577
With fresh wallet it should work fine I think


[12-Feb-19 09:08 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. let me clone totally fresh


[12-Feb-19 09:10 AM] SHossain#0007

[12-Feb-19 09:12 AM] TonyL#3577

If you have time - try to play some fast, some a longer games, some with death some with player saving  and some with player reusing from your saved players list

Daemon hanged on your side on `bailout 17 gametxid` call

need to go slow


[12-Feb-19 09:31 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm waited for a next block before issue bailout not sure what I else can do from TUI side @jl777c


[12-Feb-19 09:33 AM] SHossain#0007
give an option for manual `bailout` rather than automatic


[12-Feb-19 09:35 AM] SHossain#0007
if the previous txs (i.e.: keystrokes) are not confirmed, using bailout will send the daemon to infinite loop for now


[12-Feb-19 09:36 AM] TonyL#3577
TUI waited for one block after game is finished before execute `bailout`


[12-Feb-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
I need to reliably duplicate the hang and fix it. or maybe I can just put limits in all possible places that can infinite loop first and that will help narrow down the problem and avoid forcing a daemon restart


[12-Feb-19 09:42 AM] SHossain#0007
limiting all possible places sounds a good idea to narrow it down


[12-Feb-19 09:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Can't not only hang it reliable way but even hang it at all now so limits sounds good üòÉ

Made hang on bailout on my side as well


[12-Feb-19 09:59 AM] TonyL#3577
What I did - run quite fast to lvl3 and quit game staying on lvl3 stairs


[12-Feb-19 10:00 AM] TonyL#3577
So early game quit and bailout then seems reliable way to reproduce üòÉ


[12-Feb-19 10:00 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, on different level, currently we need to wait for the previous keystrokes tx to be confirmed


[12-Feb-19 10:01 AM] SHossain#0007
as far as i remember, James made it not to have keystrokes tx on every level


[12-Feb-19 10:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so maybe clue is to not quit lvl X when Z blocks not passed since level Y


[12-Feb-19 10:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Something like this


[12-Feb-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you do early quit and immediate bailout it hangs most the time?


[12-Feb-19 10:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Not even immideatly - TUI waiting for one block  now before `bailout`


[12-Feb-19 10:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Waiting for one block before bailout in any case (death or quit)


[12-Feb-19 10:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Just bailout after early quit hangs most the time


[12-Feb-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
is there anything in mempool at the time?


[12-Feb-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
can I just start a game and bailout?


[12-Feb-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
does it need a playertxid? I tried just immediate bailout and it worked fine


[12-Feb-19 10:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Games without playertxid


[12-Feb-19 10:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Try to quit right after you reached lvl3


[12-Feb-19 10:07 AM] TonyL#3577
And bailout then


[12-Feb-19 10:08 AM] TonyL#3577

[12-Feb-19 10:09 AM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c given my situation from the last game where bailout didn't work. now i tried after more than 10 minutes and `bailout` command made it infinite loop.

aha! dying is a different code path.


[12-Feb-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
so does it matter if you bailout right away or wait till keystrokes is confirmed?


[12-Feb-19 12:25 PM] SHossain#0007
i bailed out right away. will wait for mempool to be cleared before using bailout next


[12-Feb-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
also if you can confirm that bailing out right away hangs, that will help


[12-Feb-19 12:27 PM] SHossain#0007
i did bailout twice right away after i was killed and both time the daemon went on infinite loop


[12-Feb-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why I never run into this! I always Q if I am in danger to preserve my playerdata

even when mempool is empty, daemon goes on infinite loop after bailing out if you were killed for that game


[12-Feb-19 12:32 PM] SHossain#0007
same behaviour mempool empty or not empty

ok, thanks. I will investigate and if it is 100% of the time, shouldnt be too hard to find and fix

pushed fix that allows to use purchased playerdata, or even if it is just transfered to you. both cases should be tested

but if you dont update, you wont be able to use externally made playerdata

`externally made playerdata` is from another user that is purchased or transferred?

did it make a keystrokes.log?


[12-Feb-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
should have been created a few seconds after you got killed

i played another game and did bailout command
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%224b59846c0682b5b04cd9f06e287209b3830de372f754cdc66fd6d5ef5db0f985%22]\"
```
stdout showed the following as soon as i issued the above command

looking for the keystrokes.log now

the full file


[12-Feb-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the timestamp on keystrokes.log


[12-Feb-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
was it updated right after you died?


[12-Feb-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
did the last txid confirm?


[12-Feb-19 01:53 PM] SHossain#0007
txid confirmed. mempool was empty


[12-Feb-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
if you do a bailout now, does it crash?

[12-Feb-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it updated with keystrokes tx after you died


[12-Feb-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
then bailout got to the first part, but then stuck in replaying the game


[12-Feb-19 01:55 PM] SHossain#0007
restarted the daemon and issued the same bailout, daemon went on infinite loop again


[12-Feb-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
aha! is this a node I can remote into?


[12-Feb-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
or I guess I can use the privkey if it is for testing


[12-Feb-19 01:57 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, you can. i need to setup port forwarding on router and install openssh


[12-Feb-19 01:57 PM] SHossain#0007
can send you the privkey as well


[12-Feb-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
privkey sounds easier


[12-Feb-19 01:58 PM] SHossain#0007
just a min. will DM you


[12-Feb-19 01:59 PM] SHossain#0007

[12-Feb-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems it must be a game engine issue. I need to refactor it anyway, so go ahead and make several more games where the bailout tx hangs everytime. this when when I make a new gameengine release you can test to see if the bug is gone


[12-Feb-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
these non-100% reproducible bugs I like to wait until the very last to troubleshoot as it can be easily fixed when fixing something that appears unrelated


[12-Feb-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, it seems other than this bug, single player mode is looking pretty good. i guess the tokentransfer problem, too. maybe some bugs in multiplayer mode


[12-Feb-19 02:10 PM] SHossain#0007

for now dont bailout if you died. maybe that works around the issue until it is fixed

ok. no bailout


[12-Feb-19 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
and your system is behaving strange the playerdata transfer should have worked fine and it did on my node. so maybe something about that node specific?

that means that -ac_cclib=<name> does not match the libcc.so name


[12-Feb-19 08:11 PM] jl777c#5810
since you launched with -ac_cclib=rogue that means you are not using the rogue libcc.so

there are 2 libcc.so right now, one with sudoku and another with rogue


[12-Feb-19 08:12 PM] jl777c#5810

you can Q, y to quit the game


[12-Feb-19 10:32 PM] jl777c#5810
then do a bailout rpc call


[12-Feb-19 10:33 PM] jl777c#5810
that will create playerdata


[12-Feb-19 10:33 PM] jl777c#5810
then you can use that same player for the next game

@TonyL pushed new version that supports pname (player name) in the nonfungible data. setname rpc call sets the name to put into characters with noname. once named, a playerdata should retain it

[12-Feb-19 10:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it totally breaks all existing characters, but with the chain name in it it can support crosschain (in theory) and it should be stable


[12-Feb-19 10:43 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c
Interesting case: 
When placed ask order to sell warrior - warrior is not in players list. From other side I can't get all tokenorders now to scan. So if I not pre-saved tokenid of warrior which put on sale - I can't find my order


[12-Feb-19 10:45 PM] TonyL#3577
So only way which I see now - scan all tokenlist, then check if any tokenid is my warrior, then check if there is any my bids for this tokenid


[12-Feb-19 10:48 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, interesting. putting it up for sale removes it from the handy lists


[12-Feb-19 10:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Seems quite complicated to just show list of my orders which I can cancel.
Best way as I think maybe add call `mytokenorders` to tokensCC?
Or just wait till `tokenorders` without args works and I'll scan if tokenid in order is a warrior and then if it mine


[12-Feb-19 10:49 PM] jl777c#5810
isnt there a way to get a list of all your token orders?


[12-Feb-19 10:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Nope, at least I don't know about such way


[12-Feb-19 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
given a tokenorder, can you determine if it is your character?


[12-Feb-19 10:52 PM] TonyL#3577
Seems like `mytokenorders` can help to avoid a lot of scans if build DEX


[12-Feb-19 10:54 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, ok @dimxy can you make a mytokenorders rpc call? it should just return a list of txids for all orders the Mypubkey has made


[12-Feb-19 10:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Nope actually I can't check if it mine @jl777c


[12-Feb-19 10:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Let's imagine that somehow I wrote down tokenid so can find my sell order for it:
``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE tokenorders 856c98ecd347fcf644b7764a25bb2288559869023275b85a23ed260e4d3572eb

[12-Feb-19 11:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha so scan tokenslist first to check if it a warrior, then for warriors tokenids checking tokenorders, then if there any tokenorders checking if origaddress is mine


[12-Feb-19 11:03 PM] dimxy#2587
let's make mytokenorders call


[12-Feb-19 11:04 PM] dimxy#2587
Maybe we can do it as existing tokenorders with no params?


[12-Feb-19 11:04 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is good


[12-Feb-19 11:05 PM] jl777c#5810
just make sure to check for 's', having a 'b' doesnt mean you ownit


[12-Feb-19 11:21 PM] dimxy#2587
Seems, 'mytokenorders' rpc is better, because 'tokenorders tokenid' outputs all orders, mine and others
but 'tokenorders' with less param would output more restricted content (not guite logical).

One more tricky interesting thing: when show all "incoming request" from people who want to buy my warriors: warrior might be not warrior at this moment (if I already placed it in ask) so I'll not get him from playerslist. On this place I'll use `mytokenorders` as well to check incoming bids for warriors who are tokens and not in playerslist at the moment üòÉ

So in any place (related to DEX, not game process, since non-warriors  state warriors not possible to use in game)  where I need to display my warriors - I'll keep in mind to scan my orders to not miss anybody

Hmm in general I think DEX logic in TUI is ready for gentle testing. I not merged it yet so possible to test from `rogue` branch of TUI. 
Issues it have now: 
- printing all as it is without formatting and dropping unnecessary data
- not possible to cancel your order or check your placed orders
- if you put warrior on sale you'll not see incoming bids for it (other words if warrior not  in `players` call output )
- in menu where placing bid order to buy someones warrior or checking if somebody selling warrior - you'll see your warriors and your orders in list - add filter here is in priority. Now if you'll try to buy your warrior TUI will probably crash.


[13-Feb-19 02:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Menus added:
```[3] Check if somebody wants to buy your warrior (incoming bids)
[4] Place order to sell warrior
[5] Place order to buy someones warrior
[6] Check if somebody selling warrior
```
[3] - checking for incoming bids for warriors from your players list. Asking if you want to fill any bid (other words to sell any your warrior for incoming bid)
[4] - showing your warriors list and offer to place sell order
[5] - Scanning blockchain and showing all existing warriors of all players. Then offering you to place buy order for any if you want
[6] - Scanning blockchain for warriors selling orders - if you want you can buy warrior


[13-Feb-19 02:05 AM] TonyL#3577
With `mytokenorders` call I'll add `My orders` menu with possibility to cancel selling order and also will scan myorders to track incoming bids for warriors which you placed in ask.

But in general if you know what do you want to do - it's already possible to trade warriors

@dimxy just realised that maybe previous version of `tokenorders` which shown all orders on chain "not worked" because of the same ROGUE specific reason

@SHossain , that probably seems like easy steps to you :-). But when you don't really grasp all the technical stuff, then it's quite easy to get stuck at a certain point. I've tried (not this one, yet ; ).  I think Komodo would thrive a lot more if 'they' would make these kind of applications a lot easier accessible.

@TonyL  please note: mytokenorder outputs both fungible and non-fungible tokens. Is it ok?

@dimxy Sure, I'll check if each tokenid is warrior anyway

Now it's just superb way to get warriors orders list for cancellation + track warriors which not persists in `players` list because placed in order. Thanks a lot for this call!

Ouch, not sure why but ujson don't like output of mytokenorders call:
```     71             conn.setopt(conn.POSTFIELDS, postdata)
     72             conn.perform()

'mytokenorders  17'  does that?

Both `mytokenorders` without params and `mytokenorders 17`

how does one play rogue? is there an installer or do you have to go full linux?

@nocturnal as of now you need to use it on a unix based OS (OSX or linux for example) to use it according to the current tutorials/documentations. 

For windows there are some differences in executing the commands, etc. May i ask which OS you are using? We might be able to provide you a custom installer script to offer a smooth starting process.

@Axionesti if its a very long error output post it into gist.github.com or another place like pastebin.com


[14-Feb-19 02:13 AM] ca333#0333
otherwise here is fine like Shossain said


[14-Feb-19 02:14 AM] ca333#0333
And yes - Rogue on OSX works, like aforementioned by @jl777c


[14-Feb-19 02:16 AM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL @jl777c is there a way yet to change Warrior name yet?

@SHossain i have a player called joebob

can you do a cclibinfo and see what it returns


[14-Feb-19 02:21 AM] ca333#0333
@Axionesti - have you built Komodo before building cclib/rogue ??

I guess it's this method - not tested it yet

this error from above is related to missing boost header which gets built as part of the komodod dependency compilation.

nice @jl777c - that s a very useful func() `cclibinfo`


[14-Feb-19 02:25 AM] ca333#0333
@Axionesti but you are using OSX - correct?


[14-Feb-19 02:26 AM] Axionesti#5437
correct


[14-Feb-19 02:40 AM] ca333#0333
ok - the above instructions are for linux. you will first have to install a few OSX specific dependencies via homebrew (brew.sh) before building KMD and rogue on OSX.


[14-Feb-19 02:40 AM] ca333#0333
@SHossain can you plz provide @Axionesti the OSX build infos.


[14-Feb-19 02:42 AM] SHossain#0007
sure. let me install in OSX first on my end to see if everything is working fine and will post the steps.

need to make some more testing and then can make it a GUI App


[14-Feb-19 02:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
at least for Linux, it's very much doable

no problem mate.... took me good amount of duckduckgo search


[14-Feb-19 02:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was looking for web shell solution via golang, but it was something idependent


[14-Feb-19 02:54 AM] ca333#0333
@SHossain have you built komodod before


[14-Feb-19 02:54 AM] ca333#0333
or did you call makerogue straight


[14-Feb-19 02:54 AM] SHossain#0007
`./makerogue` is the first step


[14-Feb-19 02:54 AM] SHossain#0007
before compiling komodod


[14-Feb-19 02:55 AM] ca333#0333
you wont be able to build rogue first without building komodod which has the db_cxx.h as part of the dependency build


[14-Feb-19 02:55 AM] ca333#0333
so the path to go is initiate the komodod build


[14-Feb-19 02:55 AM] ca333#0333
once you see libboost has been built


[14-Feb-19 02:56 AM] ca333#0333
like once you see the dependencies have been built you can build rogue


[14-Feb-19 02:56 AM] ca333#0333
also need to include the osx dependency libs into the build process


[14-Feb-19 02:56 AM] ca333#0333
i will quickly look into makerogue


[14-Feb-19 02:56 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. i tried to follow the steps we use for Linux .


[14-Feb-19 02:56 AM] ca333#0333
you working on jl777 branch?


[14-Feb-19 02:57 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[14-Feb-19 02:57 AM] jl777c#5810
so build komodod first, then makerogue, then build komodod again, might work

I only ran rogue binary


[14-Feb-19 03:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It will do anything you think a Terminal application can do


[14-Feb-19 03:47 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is a Terminal over Web interface


[14-Feb-19 03:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but only the specific application or binary.


[14-Feb-19 03:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
advantage for me using this Go based web TTY is that I can manage to make a mix of Terminal and Web application, a Desktop Application.

are you able to do a bailout tx and collect gold ?

no issue as I understand it's usage, can manage komodo-cli commands too


[14-Feb-19 03:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I should try the play, and just verify that


[14-Feb-19 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it is inside rogue dapp

if you did makecclib after makerogue,it overwrote the rogue libcc with the sudoku one


[14-Feb-19 04:36 AM] jl777c#5810
there can only be one libcc


[14-Feb-19 04:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh! I thought I had to make the libcc after makerouge.
will try again only with makerogue and then kmd src make


[14-Feb-19 05:05 AM] jl777c#5810

Published massive UX improvement for TUI warriors trading
Beside of prints beatifying warriors scanner is improved and it's not showing your warriors anymore when prints all warriors on chain


[14-Feb-19 05:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Incoming bids scanner improved also and warriors choosing when starting new game more informative now.
Still struggling to make `mytokenorders` call works with RPC lib so for now cancel/check orders is possible only via CLI, and warriors not tracking as warriors after you place it in order


[14-Feb-19 05:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Would be great if someone will try to play, exchange warriors each other and left feedback

@Crabby Paddy  Get virtual box, install ubuntu, update it, install komodo (this takes the longest) then use the getting started with rogue doc to install rogue, then you can play.


[14-Feb-19 05:51 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Start with the updated version of ubuntu, when you make your virtual box machine, use 4 gigs of ram and a 20 gig HD to avoid any obnoxious install problems as a  linux noob. I just did all of this and didnt know how to do any of it 4 days ago.

don't get killed. just use `Q` to quit (capital letter) on more than level 2. wait for mempool to be cleared, then use `bailout` command


[14-Feb-19 06:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, let me try again


[14-Feb-19 06:48 AM] SHossain#0007
just change `gameinfo` to `bailout` with same other params.


[14-Feb-19 06:49 AM] SHossain#0007
make sure that you have some gold. bailout will give you ROGUE converted from gold


[14-Feb-19 06:49 AM] SHossain#0007
0.1% i guess


[14-Feb-19 06:49 AM] SHossain#0007
then, if you did quit a lot of things in your pack and high level, put a sell order of your player.

you need to quit from current game first

use `SHIFT + q` then `y` then `ENTER`


[14-Feb-19 06:58 AM] SHossain#0007
after that, wait for mempool to be cleared

I also played with web interface and it works


[14-Feb-19 07:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
as I understood so far, game playes fine with web interface


[14-Feb-19 07:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the APIs are all from the komodo-cli


[14-Feb-19 07:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that means I just need to add the cc API to my kmdgo package and can just give control to user in mixed window.
like with buttons and form for komodo specific actions
and an iframe or just a `<div>` with the web terminal showing that web shell in it.


[14-Feb-19 07:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and user can just execute all what the user wants with both clicks and keyboard actions in web shell


[14-Feb-19 07:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain anything misunderstood in that understanding?

you are right


[14-Feb-19 07:06 AM] SHossain#0007
are you going to add DEX of player data as well?

give me a command to test that and I'll let you know üòÑ


[14-Feb-19 07:07 AM] SHossain#0007
DEX uses `tokens` API commands


[14-Feb-19 07:07 AM] SHossain#0007
i.e.: `tokenorders`, `tokeninfo`, `tokenask`, `tokenfillask`


[14-Feb-19 07:07 AM] SHossain#0007
`tokenbalance`


[14-Feb-19 07:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess that's for later, the first basic task is then just making the game accessible via web interface along with clickable komodo-cli actions

@Pumtchak Please ensure that you started daemon with `-daemon` at the end not forwarding of stdout to /dev/null


[14-Feb-19 09:19 AM] Pumtchak#0362
oups... ok


[14-Feb-19 09:20 AM] TonyL#3577
To save your brave warrior you still can quit dungeon manually after daemon restart `without stdout forwarding to /dev/null`:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22 f73b10c3d8ced2573a7c3cef8f76cc7ac03be18ebc0afdabc061be5d302920ee%22]\"```

Great, as soon as bailout transaction mined you should see your warrior in list and be able to use it in a new game

yeah i was waiting for it to appears in the TUI. It's working üòÉ

TUI will gentle ask you if you want to choose a player to go dungeon with after game transaction is mined

it is weird, i have in my inventory the things i drop before quiting...


[14-Feb-19 09:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm might be a bug, let me also try to drop, quit and track stuff


[14-Feb-19 09:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Realised why mytokenorders not worked for me - seems I was tired and called it as `cclib mytokenorders`. What a shame.


[14-Feb-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it is possible some of the last things that happen get skipped. let me know if this happens even if you have a bunch of keystrokes after the last drop


[14-Feb-19 10:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Also TUI now not waiting for a next block to broadcast bailout - tested now few quit exits from dungeon and seems it's better to wait for a next block to mine keystrokes


[14-Feb-19 10:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Because in case of very fast bailout it not generates hex and generates it only after keystokes mined


[14-Feb-19 10:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Dropped stuff, walked a little - quit


[14-Feb-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it could miss the last part of the game play


[14-Feb-19 10:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Dropped stuff not saved


[14-Feb-19 10:10 AM] TonyL#3577
But I've pushed update already so waited for one block before bailout


[14-Feb-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
worse would be to find two-handed sword in a treasure room and have that missed


[14-Feb-19 10:11 AM] TonyL#3577
What if player dies and broadcast bailout before keystroke with death is mined?


[14-Feb-19 10:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Interesting will he survive or not ü§î


[14-Feb-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, there is some small amount of cheating that can likely be done


[14-Feb-19 10:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, seems I've just saved one


[14-Feb-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it is powerful magic to bring back the dead


[14-Feb-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810

Hey guys I'm going to start writing some articles and building social media accounts and other things for marketing today. 

Need some info.
How does the chain work? Is it mineable? Any info here, specifically enough to write a blurb to explain the Blockchain side of things and tokens would be helpful... 

What's the official name? 
CC Rogue? 
Crypto Rogue? Kmd Rogue?  Rogue Chain ?

@TonyL this time i quit the game without any error msg, but my warrior still isnt visible... anything to do except Q + y + Enter ??


[14-Feb-19 11:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe bailout not broadcasted 
Try to call:
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib games 17`


[14-Feb-19 11:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Then if there any games in `games` call bailout manually as you did before when restarted daemon


[14-Feb-19 11:16 AM] Pumtchak#0362
no games, only pastgames...


[14-Feb-19 11:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Is bailout transaction mined?


[14-Feb-19 11:17 AM] Pumtchak#0362
not sure


[14-Feb-19 11:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm mempool is empty


[14-Feb-19 11:18 AM] Pumtchak#0362
i can try manually ?


[14-Feb-19 11:21 AM] TonyL#3577
If there are only pastgames in `cclib games 17` output it means that you sent a bailout tx in game from which you expect warrior back


[14-Feb-19 11:21 AM] Pumtchak#0362
did it manually...


[14-Feb-19 11:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Is there any playerdata in

0.0.3 will be with multiplayer so üòÉ


[14-Feb-19 12:36 PM] SHossain#0007
that would be a version for @ca333 and we can put a high score contest with that version

[14-Feb-19 12:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Highscore contest actually possible to make with singleplayer one
Multiplayer have natural way to compete by "room" buyin


[14-Feb-19 12:42 PM] SHossain#0007
i mean to start a contest after the next version


[14-Feb-19 12:42 PM] SHossain#0007
when we have more resources and source is more stable (it is already stable as of now)


[14-Feb-19 12:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, it's better to test more for sure + make it cross-platform üòÉ 
Btw would be insteresting to add option for freerolls creation @jl777c When there is prize in multiplayer game but players no need to buyin (game prize funding by game creator)
Nice way to bring attraction for multiplayer battles on early stages and grind some ROGUE in PVP clashes

James made a change in `players 17` RPC call and added `playersinfo` but your daemon is without these changes, so TUI receiving full info about player where only player id is expected

`cclib newgame maxplayers buyin`


[14-Feb-19 09:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what is the meaning of `buyin` in this command?


[14-Feb-19 09:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I see the example says `[3,10]`


[14-Feb-19 09:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Understand that 3 is multiple palyer


[14-Feb-19 09:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
10 is confusing


[14-Feb-19 09:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
can someone please clear?


[14-Feb-19 09:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Buy-in to multiplayer game: maxplayers players compete - last survival or player who complete the game first taking all buyins


[14-Feb-19 09:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, how does 10 fit in this explanation?


[14-Feb-19 09:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Each player will need to pay 10 coins to start the game, so if there are 3 players prize pool will be 30 coins in total


[14-Feb-19 09:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

Hmm just thinking - Heroes of Might and Magic on blockchain should be possible
https://github.com/vcmi/vcmi there is some opensourced engine written on C++ 
https://github.com/ciplogic/fheroes2enh - opensourced second heroes engine

And step by step mechanics should allow to do it similar to rogue way

[14-Feb-19 10:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Playertxid of saved warriors which you have (when you do bailout for game where your warrior is not dead your warrior state saving) will be in playerdata list


[14-Feb-19 10:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Then you can check detailed info about warrior by `cclib playerinfo 17 [%22playertxid%22]`


[14-Feb-19 10:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh since I haven't played and crossed level 1, I don't have any players showing....


[14-Feb-19 10:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
correct?


[14-Feb-19 10:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Since you not executed bailout for game with alive warrior. 
In general it's possible to save warrior from level1 as well. You just need to play a little, wait until some keystrokes mined, press `Shift + q, y` to quit the game, then broadcast `cclib bailout 17 [%22gametxid%22]`

In general you can check TUI codedump from this line https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui/blob/master/lib/tuilib.py#L944 till the end it's ROGUE TUI code

have to play the game to make API data üòÑ


[14-Feb-19 10:43 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
was trying to avoid playing and coding the go code üòÑ


[14-Feb-19 10:44 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib setname 17 tonyl
{
  "name": "rogue",
  "method": "setname",
  "result": "error",
  "error": "couldnt get name"

I've not set any name before and all my warriors are freds. @jl777c Am I doing something wrong?

agree on that

all I needed the JSON data to just setup the go methods, and then put conditions as I play etc


[14-Feb-19 10:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I played a game, was about to be killed, then I quit the game


[14-Feb-19 10:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
now I need to execute bailout command to show players call showing that array value?

```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib setname 17 \"[%22tonyl%22]\"

```mkdir ~/komodo_rogue
cd ~/komodo_rogue
git clone https://github.com/jl777/komodo 
cd komodo
git checkout jl777
cd src/cc
./makerogue
cd ../..
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)```

investigating name issue


[14-Feb-19 11:24 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix


[14-Feb-19 11:36 PM] TonyL#3577
key name changing broke TUI :troll_compadre: 
Did:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib setname 17 \"[%22TonyL%22]\"
{
  "name": "rogue",
  "method": "setname",
  "result": "success",
  "name": "TonyL"
}
```
Still fred ```"pname": "fred"```


[14-Feb-19 11:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Do I need to make new warriors?


[14-Feb-19 11:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Pushed fix for TUI to work with `pname` key


[14-Feb-19 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it was just a JSON change to pname


[14-Feb-19 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
found another place that was "name" instead of "pname"


[14-Feb-19 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
the default name is now ""


[14-Feb-19 11:43 PM] jl777c#5810
but existing pname is preserved


[14-Feb-19 11:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha so probably just need new warriors which aren't freds


[14-Feb-19 11:43 PM] jl777c#5810
and it was a string in the opreturn


[14-Feb-19 11:43 PM] jl777c#5810
so the logic is if your warrior has no name, it sets it to the setname pname


[14-Feb-19 11:53 PM] TonyL#3577
New warrior arrived with name which I've preset:
```Warrior 1
Name: TonyL

Player txid: 95f68db9e81aad2af6d05c4b1c098eb1e398515f16dfdf919b64b18893b37654

[15-Feb-19 12:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Added possibility to set warriors name to TUI - anyone who wants to have very custom warriors have to rebuild jl777 komodod with latest commits and update TUI


[15-Feb-19 12:17 AM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind you can make clones of yourself, as seen by all the freds


[15-Feb-19 12:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Yup once I've set name all  new warriors are TonyL upon I set new setname


[15-Feb-19 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if TUI wants to be fancy, it can track new playertxids and require a different pname


[15-Feb-19 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
the setname is used during bailout tx to set the pname if the character doesnt have one already


[15-Feb-19 12:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I can add possibility to setname when player going to dungeon with "fresh" warrior


[15-Feb-19 12:19 AM] TonyL#3577
On this stage


[15-Feb-19 12:19 AM] TonyL#3577
So each time new warrior will be with different name if player wants


[15-Feb-19 12:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the user can use different names for different strategies


[15-Feb-19 12:22 AM] jl777c#5810
then over time the best strategy will have the strongest characters


[15-Feb-19 12:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a new game preset: "What name do you want for legends and tales about your brave adventures?"


[15-Feb-19 12:23 AM] TonyL#3577
There is an option to go with existing warrior or go with fresh one, if player go with fresh one will ask it and set name so will be super smooth


[15-Feb-19 12:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Done:
When go dungeon choosing the name if warrior is newcomer:
```Do you want to choose a player for this game? [y/n] n
What warrior name do you want for legends and tales about your brave adventures?: Warrior1
Warrior name succesfully set
Result: success
Name: Warrior1
```
Then after bailout you'll have warrior with such name:
```Warrior 6
Name: Warrior1

Player txid: 50395973c2e06ef2fa5a4e75985353dbe4222ee0f89261515a7f9babc58f12e9
Token txid: 50395973c2e06ef2fa5a4e75985353dbe4222ee0f89261515a7f9babc58f12e9```


[15-Feb-19 12:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so if they choose a warrior and he has a pname vs no name, it is handled differently?


[15-Feb-19 12:37 AM] TonyL#3577
If you choosing to go dungeon with already existing warrior it will not ask to set name at all


[15-Feb-19 12:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Asking  for name only if ```Do you want to choose a player for this game? [y/n] n```


[15-Feb-19 12:39 AM] jl777c#5810
but playerdata might have no name


[15-Feb-19 12:40 AM] TonyL#3577
```Warrior 6
Name: Warrior1

Player txid: 50395973c2e06ef2fa5a4e75985353dbe4222ee0f89261515a7f9babc58f12e9
Token txid: 50395973c2e06ef2fa5a4e75985353dbe4222ee0f89261515a7f9babc58f12e9```


[15-Feb-19 12:40 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm taking it from playerdata


[15-Feb-19 12:40 AM] TonyL#3577
It's like a new warrior creation


[15-Feb-19 12:40 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it will see a noname playerdata as the same, perfect


[15-Feb-19 12:41 AM] TonyL#3577
And if all GUIs and TUIs will ask for name on warrior creation stage there will be no nonamed warriors at all


[15-Feb-19 12:41 AM] TonyL#3577
So shouldn't worry that player have some unnamed warriors in inventory and it will change name for all on new warrior creation stage


[15-Feb-19 12:42 AM] jl777c#5810
just put the check for pname is "" after playertxid is loaded


[15-Feb-19 12:42 AM] jl777c#5810
and if no playertxid pname defaults to "" so both cases bring up the same


[15-Feb-19 12:43 AM] TonyL#3577
```{"Set warriors name (if there any unnamed warriors)": tuilib.set_warriors_name},``` there is utility to execute `setname` manually if player have some unnamed warriors from other interface let say


[15-Feb-19 12:44 AM] jl777c#5810
good enough, as you say if all TUI/GUI have a default name, this problem will not be there anyway


[15-Feb-19 12:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, now all warriors created by TUI will be with names


[15-Feb-19 12:45 AM] jl777c#5810
the only bug I can think of now is that multiplayer mode allows to start any open spot at anytime. it really needs to refuse if it is not registered by a certain time


[15-Feb-19 12:46 AM] jl777c#5810
its a bit unexpected that it is working so solid after so little time and with so much functionality


[15-Feb-19 12:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Thinking about multiplayer implementation in TUI - will need to add some threading / messages queuing to polling permanently if someone joined room so player will no need to refresh


[15-Feb-19 12:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Same polling want to add for incoming bids so player will see notification if there any incoming bid


[15-Feb-19 12:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes it's works so smooth - player 100 games and no any problems


[15-Feb-19 12:52 AM] TonyL#3577
```the only bug I can think of now is that multiplayer mode allows to start any open spot at anytime.``` is it possible to give the seed only when room filled?


[15-Feb-19 12:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a room filled, then 5 blocks passed, then players can see the seed to start the game


[15-Feb-19 12:53 AM] TonyL#3577
After room filled some status is_filled changing and blocks countdown counter starting 5-4-3-2-1


[15-Feb-19 12:54 AM] TonyL#3577
So I'll say player: room not filled yet, X from Y players joined
Then when room is filled I'll say: 5 blocks left till game start, 4 blocks left till game start... press Enter to start - get seed and start rogue


[15-Feb-19 12:55 AM] TonyL#3577
And if room isn't filled after Z blocks - game cancelling and players receive buyins back


[15-Feb-19 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
possible, but adds the need for refunding and also the game might not start...


[15-Feb-19 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the way it is now, you can start for sure in 5 blocks


[15-Feb-19 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
after say one hour, you will know all the participants


[15-Feb-19 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, and we can test the highlander tx with multiplayer. it is basically the same as bailout, just that it wins the buyins. it will be easier to test the condition of last man standing


[15-Feb-19 01:07 AM] jl777c#5810
so start 3 players, or even 2, have all but 1 bailout


[15-Feb-19 01:07 AM] jl777c#5810
then the last one can do the highlander


[15-Feb-19 01:07 AM] jl777c#5810
in order to prevent just waiting forever for the other player to bailout, if you dont do a new keystrokes tx within an hour, it becomes invalid and you are basically dead


[15-Feb-19 01:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh not rapid games at all üòÉ


[15-Feb-19 01:08 AM] jl777c#5810
we assume for small stakes, players wont resort to clock waiting


[15-Feb-19 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so rapidly it goes to last man standing


[15-Feb-19 01:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's possible to modify rogue code to track deathes and force bailout tx in such case?


[15-Feb-19 01:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Just as assumption


[15-Feb-19 01:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i tried that but it was causing the hangs...I can restore it and see if it works better. as it is the keystrokes that lead to death are sent


[15-Feb-19 01:14 AM] TonyL#3577
From my experience waiting for one block after game finishing before bailout helps in many cases


[15-Feb-19 01:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Actually if there will not be "Press [Enter] to continue" from rogue side after game end I can force bailout process by TUI after player died :troll_thuglife:
So If someone will play multiplayer from CLI - will wait them for one hour if they are so not good people to send bailout after death. And from TUI side I'll try to not left a possibility to be a bad slow guy in multiplayer game

[15-Feb-19 01:25 AM] actionslacks#4072

```du -h -d1

[15-Feb-19 01:26 AM] TonyL#3577
+ ROGUE blockchain (is very tiny so far) + TUI just kilobytes


[15-Feb-19 01:27 AM] TonyL#3577
ROGUE blockchain taking 77M atm


[15-Feb-19 01:27 AM] actionslacks#4072
so multiplayer is not yet functional?


[15-Feb-19 01:27 AM] TonyL#3577
It's not tested yet


[15-Feb-19 01:29 AM] actionslacks#4072
cool, this looks awesome. I'll try to get it going. You're on OSX? do I need to update python?


[15-Feb-19 01:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I'm testing everything on Ubuntu atm since there is no OSX ROGUE compatible daemon right now


[15-Feb-19 01:32 AM] actionslacks#4072
ahh, I thought I saw something about osx


[15-Feb-19 01:32 AM] TonyL#3577
You can spin Ubuntu virtual machine and test - I may share pre-compiled compatible Ubuntu daemon


[15-Feb-19 01:32 AM] TonyL#3577
In case if you'll not have enough computer power to compile


[15-Feb-19 01:35 AM] actionslacks#4072
I need  to look into it. Probably time to to build a linux box anyway.


[15-Feb-19 01:36 AM] TonyL#3577

Did you restart the daemon?

You have to start ROGUE chain with this freshly compiled daemon

Do `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE stop` and then restart

Since you started it with -daemon param daemon will not interrupt in case of Ctrl + C, it might be good to ensure that you synced first by ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE getinfo```

It's folder with super old daemon

You have to start daemon from folder where you did `makerogue`


[15-Feb-19 02:01 AM] TonyL#3577
If you followed my instructions it's should be `~/komodo_rogue/komodo/src`

@TonyL When should I execute setname command?
after newgame->register?


[15-Feb-19 02:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Crabby Paddy should be fine I guess... but in case your compile doesn't complete, if failes, shutdown your vm and update it's vcpu and ram


[15-Feb-19 02:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if limited on ram, then make bigger swap

@grewalsatinder I do it before register, possible to do after - not very matters. Most important to do it before bailout if you want your new warrior to have this name


[15-Feb-19 02:53 AM] TonyL#3577
`H` hobgoblins don't like arrows üòâ


[15-Feb-19 02:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Or maybe setname -> register order matters actually, not checked it yet but setname before register definitely works as expected

after makerogue, komodod needs to be built again


[15-Feb-19 03:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Definitely not recommend to fight in melee with `A` Aquators - they break armor. It might be difficult to fight centaurus `C` also if you're not well prepared.
On lvl12+ you may find really bad `T` trolls - they can one hit 20-30 hp ez. Not recommended for melee at all.  Also there are `H` who stealing stuff and `L` who stealing gold - better to kill on range as well.

You have a bow on start - can equip by `w` and then throw arrows


[15-Feb-19 03:08 AM] TonyL#3577
It usually one hits `H`


[15-Feb-19 03:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh! so just press `w` ?


[15-Feb-19 03:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what's the key combination if I'm standing right side of H or K or B ?


[15-Feb-19 03:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like 1 or 2 steps distance?


[15-Feb-19 03:09 AM] TonyL#3577
in 1 step distance you'll not have enough time to equip bow since equipment change spending move


[15-Feb-19 03:10 AM] TonyL#3577
So if you not have some magic stuff only way is to fight and pray for luck

@Crabby Paddy in addition to backing up your wallet.dat, `dumpprivkey` will get you privatekey.  `getinfo` can be useful to check chain info.

Hi, Everyone ‚Äì Good Morning/Afternoon/Evening! Before I ask tons of questions,I should officially introduce myself. I'm Mike O, I've been helping Fishyguts on Pirate for the last few months. I saw the opportunity to work on Rogue yesterday morning, chatted with JL for a bit and will be working on some marketing endeavors. I'll be gathering info and getting together ideas for over the weekend, then rolling out what I can this upcoming week. This will include building a timeline going backward from a tournament event.  Any and all info, insight, and collaboration I can get is very much appreciated. I am excited to help showcase this tech and its value to the gaming and crypto communties!

@TonyL to play the bailout games again,  I use the register command using the id from the players command output?


[15-Feb-19 04:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
register command asks for gameid, so that id from games output?


[15-Feb-19 04:40 AM] TonyL#3577
If you did bailout you can't continue game - it means you quit it


[15-Feb-19 04:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
do I just pick any gameid and use any player id with it?

If your player is alive you'll able to re-use him in next game (register accept playertxid as arg)

so if we die do we get anything

or only if we bail outw


[15-Feb-19 04:50 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
was it 50% or something in gold


[15-Feb-19 04:53 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
I think it converted to 0.0001 rogue per gold on bailout and 0.001 per gold on successful completion of the game?


[15-Feb-19 04:56 AM] siu#3920
i think i got to a dead end and im dying


[15-Feb-19 04:58 AM] siu#3920
is it possible to get to a dead end? what should i do then?


[15-Feb-19 05:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@TonyL if I get killed in a game, do I have to execute the bailout command?


[15-Feb-19 05:10 AM] Cryptofist#7504
If it's not removed, you should be able to save your character. You can in the original and other versions from what I have read and played.  Not sure what's been changed though.  I suppose JL knows.

Some Q's : 
1. How can someone mine ROGUE, I only have 1 ROGUE for block reward, no other info. 

2. Does Komodo need to fully be synced before running Rogue to play? 

3. RogueCC is the smart contract that runs on the Rogue Chain, Rogue is the game. Is this all correct? 

4. I saw we will be having a Dev competition, can I have please have some more info @ca333 ? 

5. Can devs can make other versions of the game as long as it's fully based on Rogue (as the engine?)  

6. The in game gold is equal to 0.0001 ROGUE. Is this correct?

7. Is anyone opposed to the logo I made for Rogue Chain (for now) if so, may I please have some input?


[15-Feb-19 06:09 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
2 = No you just need to build komodo first but do not need the komodo chain

[15-Feb-19 06:13 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Bail out gold is worth 0.001 Rogue and win the game gold converts at 0.01 rogue per gold, Thats how i understand Jls big pinned post anyways


[15-Feb-19 06:14 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok, so if you do 26 floors down and 25 up you get more ROGUE


[15-Feb-19 06:15 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
to win you have to find the amulate and escape so that will get the 0.01


[15-Feb-19 06:15 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I wonder if the items convert to gold (like normal) or if the character saves?


[15-Feb-19 06:16 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Everything your character picks up and levels up like strenghth etc stays with the player upon bailing out or winning. this character can then be sold on chain


[15-Feb-19 06:17 AM] Cryptofist#7504
At the end of the game of the original Rogue, when you win, all of your items are converted to Gold.

the keystrokes tx does the equivalent, along with bailout for the character, though it is a bit different as you need to start over


[15-Feb-19 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
0.001 gold -> ROGUE, highlander gets all buyins + 0.01 gold. if you got the amulet and escape then all items are converted to gold and you get the 0.01

can it be mined Jl? for fees?


[15-Feb-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
but the collectibles market will ultimately be the wild card as a strong character is able to win buyins via multiplayer

it is a normal coin with 1 ROGUE blockreward,maybe miners will dump at mining cost

[15-Feb-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, so did KMD actually


[15-Feb-19 06:41 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
interesting fact


[15-Feb-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
just keep in mind the chain might get reset back to genesis


[15-Feb-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
or not


[15-Feb-19 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810

real lucky


[15-Feb-19 06:42 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
looks good so far odds of being full chain 80/20


[15-Feb-19 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[15-Feb-19 06:46 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I feel there could be some backlash later if it isn't fairly started as a new chain. As much as I want to start farming gold now....  a new chain with the releases might be best.


[15-Feb-19 06:46 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Could be but everyones been free to join in

oh, it seems it has been announced already


[15-Feb-19 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
the vast vast majority of rewards will be going to the players who play


[15-Feb-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
i expect miners to play a relatively small factor in ROGUE


[15-Feb-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
especially since it is a 10% -ac_perc chain

I will say that because there is NO ROGUE from pre-mine in team hands, farming gold for promotions for the community might be good too. ü§î

I mined about 7000 ROGUE before releasing the chain params


[15-Feb-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
since then I mined less than 1000 ROGUE, so someone else is mined 10,000 or so ROGUE

Genie !! Usual suspect lols


[15-Feb-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
as chain activity goes up, this will be diluted down 10x, 100x, etc


[15-Feb-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no cap to coin supply


[15-Feb-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
each time 10 ROGUE is transacted, 1 ROGUE appears out of thin air


[15-Feb-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not your ordinary chain

once there is a decent market for playerdata, I think that will easily absorb whatever cheap ROGUE that miners will dump close to mining cost


[15-Feb-19 07:27 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
A nice flashy GUI with different looking avatars and weapons etc will bring that to reality i believe


[15-Feb-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
having a graphical player DEX is fully compatible with the ascii gameplay, so for people that only do the collectibles side of things, it can be a fully graphical experience

[15-Feb-19 08:43 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@jl777c correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't Pixel Dungeon require a new chain since it's vastly different from Rogue? 

But we could use the graphics and make a *similar* GUI

i think damage is 1 roll of 8, 1 roll of 8, 3 rolls of 10, so possible to get hit with damage of 46

I only knew of Roguelike as a genre.

at the dawn of the modern age, there was rogue


[15-Feb-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
which spawned roguelikes

Potion of poison can throw to monsters if I remember correct


[15-Feb-19 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
2handed sword is the most effective,as long as you are strong enough


[15-Feb-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, that is good to know


[15-Feb-19 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Only problem is no food - so probably some grind on low levels will be needed


[15-Feb-19 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Until find enough food for long run


[15-Feb-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
some levels seem full of food


[15-Feb-19 11:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, it's totally random - sometimes I have 10 in pack, sometimes a lot of levels without food

getting gold and bailing is alot better tho

no

I guess it allows people to play in multiplayer buyin games


[15-Feb-19 12:10 PM] SHossain#0007
so, this wouldn't let users create giant amount. right?

i dont see how it would. if you ever see anything bigger than txfee, let me know

sure. of course


[15-Feb-19 12:21 PM] TonyL#3577
After quit dungeon and enter again potions detecting (at least potions have to track other items)


[15-Feb-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i could preserve the hidden/known attributes of items but if there is to be a market for these characters i figured people would need to see what they were getting. also the attribute it in the playerdata, so advanced users would write decoders and get an advantage over the users that dont


[15-Feb-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
the penalty for bailing out is that you have to start all over again, which becomes a bigger and bigger issue, the deeper you are, so I think it is a good tradeoff, since there doesnt seem to be any obvious point where you can just get any unfair advantage


[15-Feb-19 12:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes have sense, it's not big advantage to know what potion or ring you have if you need to grind tens of levels again

Lost pretty good warrior in this game.
What happened: I've started it on level1 fully surrounded by enemies around 20hp and have to spend move to put armor and weapon. Did few keystrokes in attempt to fight. (I think whole game was around 5 keystrokes) Then 9 hp remained and I've decided to quit.

all ROGUE rpc calls autobroadcast


[16-Feb-19 02:03 AM] TonyL#3577
And game hanged... 
Seems like there are some bugs after ncurses removement.
Also after last update sometimes when quit of inventory double press of Enter needed to get focus back

[16-Feb-19 02:08 AM] TonyL#3577
When you pickup item label assigning (key by which you can use it then) - I've highlited on screenshot


[16-Feb-19 02:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Usually it's a letter like `a`, `b`, `c` ...


[16-Feb-19 02:08 AM] TonyL#3577
But by some reason `{` assigned and game immediately hanged


[16-Feb-19 02:10 AM] jl777c#5810
this might have been there before? how did you assign key?


[16-Feb-19 02:10 AM] TonyL#3577
It's assigning automatically on pick-up


[16-Feb-19 02:10 AM] jl777c#5810
cat you play on rogue 777 and duplicate the problem?

@jl777c Is my unexpected death of `LeBron James` about which I've reported above means that if let's say no or very little of keystrokes mined before bailout CC think that player died? He had very good loot üòê


[16-Feb-19 02:44 AM] jl777c#5810
did the keystrokes tx go out?


[16-Feb-19 02:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems you landed in a treasure room


[16-Feb-19 02:45 AM] jl777c#5810
is the latest consistently behaving wonky, or was it just that one time?

updating


[16-Feb-19 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, if inventory is full that would be a new codepath, so this bug is likely there for a while

As I understand there is no check now on inventory overflow as before


[16-Feb-19 03:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Before when you step-up on item and there is no place in inventory printed error that "Item X" laying and you have no space
I think easiest way to reproduce just throw a lot of arrows and pick up


[16-Feb-19 03:10 AM] jl777c#5810
yes { is after z. i didnt change that


[16-Feb-19 03:11 AM] jl777c#5810
but I will see if I can fix it


[16-Feb-19 03:11 AM] TonyL#3577
`rogue` hangs when `{` appears


[16-Feb-19 03:11 AM] TonyL#3577
It's when inventory full - before there was message that you can't pickup


[16-Feb-19 03:12 AM] TonyL#3577
But now rogue just hangs


[16-Feb-19 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, I will add guards against that.

@CHMEX please update daemon and restart ROGUE explorer when you get some time.

i dont think there were recent changes to daemon that need updating?


[16-Feb-19 03:27 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL does the printout match the number of items in the pack?


[16-Feb-19 03:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i know it is hard to see but hopefully you can see if it mismatches. I can add a print to the inventory command instead


[16-Feb-19 03:29 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, updated so only when you do inventory should it print and it will print the inpack (total in pack global) along with a counted value (n_obj)

i wonder where it gets off by one...


[16-Feb-19 04:01 AM] jl777c#5810
the inventory should be printing inpack vs n_obj

[16-Feb-19 04:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Then when picking up second food it's `inpack.6 vs MAX.23`


[16-Feb-19 04:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Suspicious that counting starting from 2


[16-Feb-19 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
what about with inventory command?


[16-Feb-19 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
you start with food and mace, arrows


[16-Feb-19 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
and armor.. that should be 4


[16-Feb-19 04:03 AM] TonyL#3577

Hanged after `{` again


[16-Feb-19 04:15 AM] jl777c#5810
what was n_objs vs inpack during this?


[16-Feb-19 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
if it starts at 5 vs 5 and then becomes 8 vs 9, that is not good


[16-Feb-19 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
they should be the same, at least same difference between them


[16-Feb-19 04:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Isn't food a single object in inventory which can be stacked? (n_objs.8 vs inpack.9 is after I pickup second food)
Let me try to check ` n_objs vs inpack` before I pick-up this `{`


[16-Feb-19 04:20 AM] TonyL#3577
n_objs is amount of inventory titles as  I understand:
Let's say when I want to wield:
```n_objs.4 vs inpack.9```
Since only 4 items will be shown as items legit for wield and I have 9 items in my pack in total


[16-Feb-19 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
some things you can have multiples of, like arrows


[16-Feb-19 04:22 AM] TonyL#3577
```n_objs.26 vs inpack.9```


[16-Feb-19 04:22 AM] TonyL#3577

[16-Feb-19 04:24 AM] TonyL#3577
And next arrow I pickup is `{` and rogue hangs with 
```Illegal command '^@'--More--```


[16-Feb-19 04:24 AM] TonyL#3577
You may try on your side - it's pretty fast:
```./rogue 777 gui```
Then pick up food and staff in first room and go to the right room, pick up stuff here and start to shoot arrows to wall


[16-Feb-19 04:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Then pick up arrows and it will hang after `z` arrow


[16-Feb-19 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so its these arrows that are not being added to the 20, seems the issue


[16-Feb-19 04:25 AM] TonyL#3577
It hangs on other `{` items pickup now - but maybe unpacked arrows is the reason


[16-Feb-19 04:26 AM] TonyL#3577
But I'm 99% sure that few days ago it worked correct


[16-Feb-19 04:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Before I've updated yesterday. Since I not changed my gameplay style and unpacked arrows before as well and when inventory is full it printed that it's full (last item was always `z`, never `{`)


[16-Feb-19 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
do you remember having 20 arrows like that?


[16-Feb-19 04:30 AM] TonyL#3577
No, but I can hang it without this test with arrows


[16-Feb-19 04:30 AM] TonyL#3577
On poision or something else - when just play usual and have inventory full


[16-Feb-19 04:30 AM] TonyL#3577

[16-Feb-19 04:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, so I bought both

[16-Feb-19 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
and use FSM branch, assuming that one is not crashy. jl777 branch will be under construction until I say it is stable


[16-Feb-19 05:18 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Latest is not crashy and full inventory works as expected. Will use FSM in future


[16-Feb-19 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i remember seeing arrows make their own inventory spot. maybe it changes when you throw it, vs drop?


[16-Feb-19 05:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Arrows unpacking after you throw it


[16-Feb-19 05:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a when you have pack with 30 arrows and throw one now there are two packs: pack with 29 arrows and pack with 1 arrow when you pick up


[16-Feb-19 05:30 AM] TonyL#3577
A little bit strange logic imo - better if when you pickup arrow it adding to ",main" pack with arrows


[16-Feb-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
you can try the rogue from the repo I got it from, pretty sure it behaves the same way


[16-Feb-19 05:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, it's original logic


[16-Feb-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, then not a bug


[16-Feb-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
no idea how the inpack is out of sync now though


[16-Feb-19 05:31 AM] TonyL#3577
And it's worked like this whole tests time - but by some reason just max inventory was broken


[16-Feb-19 05:31 AM] TonyL#3577

Ok, been fighting to get things running the last couple of days, this is where i get stuck after running zcutil.build


[16-Feb-19 08:31 AM] Cryptofist#7504
started with origin/jl777 like in the guides, then genie recommended FSM.


[16-Feb-19 08:33 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I started with the rogue guide, then went back through after finding a komodo guide


[16-Feb-19 08:33 AM] SHossain#0007
jl777 branch is the latest for ROGUE


[16-Feb-19 08:33 AM] SHossain#0007
did you install all dependencies properly?


[16-Feb-19 08:34 AM] Cryptofist#7504
i dont have komodod


[16-Feb-19 08:34 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, your build failed


[16-Feb-19 08:34 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm not sure  on dependencies , I did use the commands to install that i found


[16-Feb-19 08:35 AM] SHossain#0007
what is your system spec?


[16-Feb-19 08:35 AM] SHossain#0007
you can try deleting everything and start following the guide from the beginning https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Get-Started-with-Rogue-Game

[16-Feb-19 08:35 AM] Cryptofist#7504
ok


[16-Feb-19 08:36 AM] Cryptofist#7504
so just delete all the directories ?


[16-Feb-19 08:37 AM] Cryptofist#7504
and 4 cpu  38 gb drive  and like 8 ram


[16-Feb-19 08:38 AM] SHossain#0007
delete just the `komodo` dir


[16-Feb-19 08:38 AM] SHossain#0007
and start again


[16-Feb-19 08:38 AM] Cryptofist#7504
ok, thank you. I was wondering if starting all over would help.


[16-Feb-19 08:41 AM] SHossain#0007
just want to make sure that you have all deps correctly installed

genie helped me a bit last night, said it could just be the branch at the time. Had me raise the specs on my VM too


[16-Feb-19 09:09 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Welp, its doing new things i havent seen yet.


[16-Feb-19 09:10 AM] Cryptofist#7504
If it works , ill try to do it over on a new machine. I want to make sure there is a good noob guide, even if it is only useful for two weeks


[16-Feb-19 09:14 AM] SHossain#0007
this guide would work as it is specifically written for playing ROGUE in Debian/Ubuntu üòÉ


[16-Feb-19 09:25 AM] Cryptofist#7504
give or take 5 tries


[16-Feb-19 09:26 AM] Cryptofist#7504
So if it doesn't work, just delete the folder and start over, is that the best action?


[16-Feb-19 09:26 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I followed it all thursday 2x, friday 2x at different times.


[16-Feb-19 09:27 AM] Cryptofist#7504
What about VM specs?


[16-Feb-19 09:35 AM] SHossain#0007
your specs seems fine


[16-Feb-19 09:35 AM] SHossain#0007
not necessaarily you have to delete them all the time


[16-Feb-19 09:36 AM] SHossain#0007
to be honest, it works first time if i use it in any new computer


[16-Feb-19 09:40 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I'll blame it on newbness


[16-Feb-19 09:40 AM] Cryptofist#7504

from ~/komodo:
zcutil/build.sh


[16-Feb-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case komodod is in ~/komodo/src


[16-Feb-19 09:46 AM] TonyL#3577
```cd ~/komodo/src```

So there IS something else to do? I started from the top and did every point each time....


[16-Feb-19 09:49 AM] TonyL#3577
On screenshot you're trying to run daemon from folder where is no daemon
Try to do:
```cd ~/komodo/src/
./komodod -ac_name=ROGUE -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=5.9.102.210  -ac_cclib=rogue -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=60001 -ac_script=2ea22c80203d1579313abe7d8ea85f48c65ea66fc512c878c0d0e6f6d54036669de940febf8103120c008203000401cc -daemon```


[16-Feb-19 09:49 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok, unless it told me to change i didnt change


[16-Feb-19 09:52 AM] Cryptofist#7504
so ```cd ~/komodo/src/``` needs to be in the guide?  or  .... something else?  
Am I somehow using the wrong directory?


[16-Feb-19 09:52 AM] Cryptofist#7504
did that ran the command, yay progress.


[16-Feb-19 09:55 AM] Cryptofist#7504
is the daemon supposed to be in komodo?


[16-Feb-19 09:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm actually yes since `./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)` executing from `~/komodo`


[16-Feb-19 09:56 AM] TonyL#3577
So after `./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)`
`cd src` is needed


[16-Feb-19 09:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Because daemon placing in src folder


[16-Feb-19 09:57 AM] SHossain#0007
didn't realise. thanks for noticing. updated the guide


[16-Feb-19 09:57 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Could someone please take a hard look at the guide and figure out the point of failure here and update it?


[16-Feb-19 09:57 AM] Cryptofist#7504
yay!


[16-Feb-19 09:57 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok, so next, lets see if my 6 yeard old can install


[16-Feb-19 09:57 AM] TonyL#3577
We're just call daemon so much in everyday work so not realised that there might be problem on this stage üòÉ

Its my favorite thing to do


[16-Feb-19 09:58 AM] SHossain#0007
exactly @TonyL . overlooked that part


[16-Feb-19 09:59 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I had wondered if it was a case of you guys being so used to something that it wasn't noticed, that happens a lot i think, in this space.


[16-Feb-19 10:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Nice that now you're closer to game start üòÉ So did daemon started on your side?


[16-Feb-19 10:01 AM] Cryptofist#7504
yep and i am on the get an address part

Chain is syncing now but it's ok - you can restart with pubkey and sync just continue


[16-Feb-19 10:19 AM] Cryptofist#7504

If daemon prints make you stressed you can open new terminal, do `cd ~/komodo/src` and then follow guides above


[16-Feb-19 10:20 AM] Cryptofist#7504
ok, but whats the mormal way ? just enter the command?

@jl777c one gamer asking me if there is any time limit or abuse protection for macro or auto bots playing the game?


[16-Feb-19 10:23 AM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist Not sure what you mean by normal way. You need to execute commands from guides in terminal in `~/komodo/src` folder


[16-Feb-19 10:23 AM] TonyL#3577
All you need to get now is pubkey from validateaddress step


[16-Feb-19 10:23 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I meant do I just enter the commands in terminal while it prints or do I need to stop it to enter a command


[16-Feb-19 10:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes just enter commands while it prints


[16-Feb-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
it is expected that eventually bots will start playing for now it seems there are no bots

@TonyL I made an extract method, pass in gametxid and it saves the keystokes to a seed.0 file, also it tries to replay the game.


[16-Feb-19 10:25 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks.


[16-Feb-19 10:25 AM] Cryptofist#7504
JL at some point yesterday I wondered how easy it would be to make a farming bot for this game


[16-Feb-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so if it works, you can get the seed.0 file and use ./rogue seed to replay it


[16-Feb-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
might just crash though,untested

./rogue <seed>


[16-Feb-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810

It's like a one with whom I've started this deadlocked game and other one hmm

it got the playerdata. it is infinite looping which is bad, you shouldnt be able to make it do that


[16-Feb-19 11:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh now I can investigate what happened in game where I lost my best warrior


[16-Feb-19 11:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Other one


[16-Feb-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
you did a Q in that game? the replay shows you stuck in the first room


[16-Feb-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
something is very wrong with the replay


[16-Feb-19 11:54 AM] TonyL#3577
I did a Q in lvl3 in this game


[16-Feb-19 11:54 AM] TonyL#3577
And I've started it not as lvl1 player


[16-Feb-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810

When I've started this dungeon


[16-Feb-19 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe 2 scrolls of identify ring, wand or staff
created some confusion.


[16-Feb-19 11:59 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I died, then did 2 and it says I have 0 warriors


[16-Feb-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
did 2 what?


[16-Feb-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
if you die, warrier is dead


[16-Feb-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
no zombies allowed


[16-Feb-19 12:01 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Oh, so you have to save to keep your warrior? I saw people talking about quiting and bailout and didnt understand what that meant


[16-Feb-19 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c second game with other warrior where I quit alive but warrior counted as dead:

[16-Feb-19 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
Actually it was quite strong warrior, not lvl1 and he not died - I quit on 9hp


[16-Feb-19 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
And I've reused him as well - seems there is some issue when you reuse warrior in other game


[16-Feb-19 12:03 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Dang, wish I understood better I had all kinds of things from that glitching.  Does the gold save or convert to ROGUE ?


[16-Feb-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
aha! maybe that is the issue. the first use is ok,, but after that it gets confused?


[16-Feb-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
if you die, you die. cant take it with you


[16-Feb-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to quit before you die, then issue a bailout tx


[16-Feb-19 12:03 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok so how do you save?


[16-Feb-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe you should read rogue.doc?


[16-Feb-19 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
I've quit before I died


[16-Feb-19 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
And there is no death on replay


[16-Feb-19 12:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
S doesnt work for me for saving it does work for searching


[16-Feb-19 12:04 PM] Cryptofist#7504
if it saved, i would have like 200 saved games.


[16-Feb-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
s is not S


[16-Feb-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
S is disabled in blockchain mode


[16-Feb-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
Q for quit


[16-Feb-19 12:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So QUIT saves?


[16-Feb-19 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Last state on replay i'm with 10hp  - state in room is correct as I remember but warrior showing lvl1 (actually he was level 7) and loot not correct


[16-Feb-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
quit saves to the blockhain when you do a bailout


[16-Feb-19 12:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
s* is what i used


[16-Feb-19 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Aha, I have an idea - if it counting all warriors as lvl1 with 12hp - if I have 50hp actually and somebody hit me on 15hp


[16-Feb-19 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm like a dead


[16-Feb-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, at first level you need time to regen to full powers and also to wear and wield


[16-Feb-19 12:06 PM] TonyL#3577
But I was actually level7 not level1, but on replay I'm like a lvl1

./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib gameinfo 17 \"[%224dc60d3dc4c80ae0315cc750f3357bf132cde98f9d148e0a8106adf0adbf4ff0%22]\"


[16-Feb-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
did you quit on level 1?


[16-Feb-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the second time


[16-Feb-19 12:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes I've quit on level1 of dungeon in this game


[16-Feb-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
dungeonlevel would be set to 1, but player level should be preserved if it showed it on startup


[16-Feb-19 12:09 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist You may save your warrior by `Shift + q` and then press `y + Enter`


[16-Feb-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
there is something strange with the recreation of the dungeon too. I fixed the infinite loop


[16-Feb-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
but the replay is wrong


[16-Feb-19 12:09 PM] TonyL#3577
I bet it thinking that any player starting as lvl1 warrior even if you reusing him


[16-Feb-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt it show the proper level of character when you start?


[16-Feb-19 12:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
How do I use, bailout rpc ?


[16-Feb-19 12:10 PM] TonyL#3577
In rogue game yes - in replay nope


[16-Feb-19 12:10 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist TUI will issue it automatically


[16-Feb-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
aha! ok, investigating


[16-Feb-19 12:12 PM] TonyL#3577
I didn't pay much attention to such cases before because it's hard to check without replay - but now I think that if in warrior reusing game left dungeon with more than 12hp missing from maxhp amount it's counting as dead. Can play tomorrow to be totally sure


[16-Feb-19 12:13 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I did that then still 0 warriors when i checked


[16-Feb-19 12:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Bailout transaction should be mined first to see warrior in list (you can check mempool status in TUI Utility)


[16-Feb-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
wait for confirmation


[16-Feb-19 12:14 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok


[16-Feb-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL now you can extract keystrokes and replay you can verify if the replay is correct


[16-Feb-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
clearly if the replay is messed up, any sort of result is possible


[16-Feb-19 12:14 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Gotta extract all this from your brains so everyone else can figure it out.


[16-Feb-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the code seems like it should work the same for gameplay and replay...


[16-Feb-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe with many reusings of playerdata, something goes wrong


[16-Feb-19 12:17 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist üëç  I will add notification print after game finishing to TUI


[16-Feb-19 12:23 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c for this  second game actions on replay are correct (only not correct that I have lvl1 warrior since he was lvl7 and he had around 60max hp when on replay maxhp12) and in the end of replay warrior left with 10 hp - not dead

ok, that was a very fast game

i fixed the deadlock


[16-Feb-19 12:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, was quite fast - i've spawn with not much hp and a lot of of enemies around so tried to fight few moves without armor and weapon and then decided back to base for better roll


[16-Feb-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so if the deadlock is fixed, are there any bugs?

```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%224dc60d3dc4c80ae0315cc750f3357bf132cde98f9d148e0a8106adf0adbf4ff0%22,%22027d28d7d59ac499fac55f89b9e06933d66aaf74435c48326d83f8fbc6a7b14e85%22]\"```

doesnt seem dead to me


[16-Feb-19 12:59 PM] TonyL#3577
But he didn't back to me and in game info `alive:0`


[16-Feb-19 01:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Succesfully made bailout for deadlocked warrior. Yay - second bug hunt for `Leeroy Jenkins` today. Same warrior first detected this bug with full inventory hang and then deadlocked in the next game üòÇ


[16-Feb-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810

there were two real bugs though, the full pack causes by inpack variable not being right and the infinite loop

This replay function will help a lot now in case of any suspicious games


[16-Feb-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it will also be cool during multiplayer mode as we can see the progress each is making each time they submit a keystrokes tx


[16-Feb-19 01:08 PM] TonyL#3577
If ROGUE project will have B2C support for players - these replays will be everyday usage tool


[16-Feb-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i need to clean up the printouts though


[16-Feb-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
what is B2C?


[16-Feb-19 01:09 PM] TonyL#3577
business to customers üòÉ


[16-Feb-19 01:09 PM] TonyL#3577
It's just a model name

Customers here means players - business anyone who operate GUI


[16-Feb-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
with high stakes buyin games, people can do level by level commentary on each of the players


[16-Feb-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
also top players will be showing how to win to other players


[16-Feb-19 01:11 PM] TonyL#3577
Can prepare by watching top players replays and own to find any mistakes or places where you can play better


[16-Feb-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess a function to scan the blockchain for top warriors would be cool

[16-Feb-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
then find their pubkeys and watch them play. I guess I need to put pause, forward/backward controls in the replay. but that actually seems not so hard to add

Keystroke by keystroke would be great, and also ability to check what warrior have in inventory on this moment


[16-Feb-19 01:12 PM] TonyL#3577
To understand which possibilities he have now


[16-Feb-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be a bit harder, i will see what I can do. I guess if it is just looking at inventory that is ok


[16-Feb-19 01:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe possible to permanently print it let's say on right side of the screen (without watcher interaction)


[16-Feb-19 01:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Will make now top20 warriors rating ranged by experience

Whats the minimum amount of gold needed to Quit and save your warrior?


[16-Feb-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
1


[16-Feb-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as you also kill 1 monster


[16-Feb-19 01:18 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Noted


[16-Feb-19 01:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504

Any other Rogue Chain specific things that should be mentioned to new players, please please let me know.


[16-Feb-19 01:19 PM] SHossain#0007
@Cryptofist are you planning to release a blog post with the info you are taking notes of? would be good for new users.


[16-Feb-19 01:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I think I have the basics from A-B now.


[16-Feb-19 01:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Yep


[16-Feb-19 01:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I want to make sure getting the game going and playing for the first time is  clearly presented.


[16-Feb-19 01:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Or we are all gonna be answering the same questions for a few weeks.


[16-Feb-19 01:27 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok so when I quit: It then says I quit with 56 Gold, What happens? Does the Gold convert to Rogue automagically?


[16-Feb-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
when the bailout tx confirms you will get 0.0005 ROGUE per gold for a single player game


[16-Feb-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
0.001 for multiplayer


[16-Feb-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
0.01 if you win the multiplayer


[16-Feb-19 01:28 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Multi-player is not working yet, correct?


[16-Feb-19 01:29 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I finally saved a warrior! üèÅ


[16-Feb-19 01:29 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Losing that glitched game warrior sucks, I had all kinds of crazy stuff.


[16-Feb-19 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
multiplayer has been coded but not sure if anybody ever tested it


[16-Feb-19 01:30 PM] Cryptofist#7504
OK


[16-Feb-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe it works flawlessly, or maybe it will crash and burn


[16-Feb-19 01:34 PM] SHossain#0007
added couple of good info to the guide


[16-Feb-19 01:35 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Awesome!!!


[16-Feb-19 01:36 PM] Cryptofist#7504
How do I load a  saved warrior to play?
Will he remain saved as it is now IF I play then he dies?


[16-Feb-19 01:36 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Im using the TUI at the moment.


[16-Feb-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
he is a collectible until he is put into a game


[16-Feb-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
he is on the blockchain so will be there


[16-Feb-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
only if you play a game with him, is he at risk. just need to get some gold, kill a monster and bailout before you get kille


[16-Feb-19 01:41 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Got it!


[16-Feb-19 01:42 PM] Cryptofist#7504

Alright so I'm rolling. Just bailed out. When I was playing I had a "brown potion" and a scroll that said "blah blah something". Once bailed out, my inventory reveals what these things really were (1 - yay I managed to bail out, 2 - they were potion of magic detection and scroll of remove curse, resp.). Should that be the case?

@jl777c If warrior max strength more than 16 (possible to permanently increase max. strength by strength gain potions) and you quit game (let's say with max strength and current strength 18).
When start next game with this warrior: max strength will be 18 but current strength is always 16. 
Is it possible to transfer current strength between games same as hp? It might be not a big clue when your max strength is <20 but if you improved max strength much - should be quite annoying

Yea, there's always something to spark the curiosity. For me it was barterdex stress tests

I'm learning some things, seems like ill be real limited unless i find some more things to learn about


[16-Feb-19 07:47 PM] Alright#0419
#kmdlabs a good place to learn


[16-Feb-19 07:47 PM] Alright#0419
literally the purpose of the coin is to foster a learning environment

[16-Feb-19 07:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ah ok!


[16-Feb-19 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
you just need to think of something worth coding and put your mind to it


[16-Feb-19 07:48 PM] Alright#0419
start simple


[16-Feb-19 07:48 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I want to connect game devs to KMD so I feel i need to learn alot to be of use to both sides of that

[16-Feb-19 07:51 PM] Alright#0419
There are some things you could do right now with LABS, but right now it's mostly focused on people who have notary spots. There should be much more to do for non-notaries after launch such as testing/breaking/creating CCs and dapps


[16-Feb-19 07:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Nice.


[16-Feb-19 07:52 PM] Alright#0419
I'd recommend you try to get a notary spot +2 months after launch. That would be the quickest way to learn as it almost forces you to


[16-Feb-19 07:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Is that the election time thats coming up?


[16-Feb-19 07:53 PM] Alright#0419
you could begin to build/test a dapp or CC right now with current testnet infrastructure


[16-Feb-19 07:54 PM] Alright#0419
every 2 months we will hold a lottery for open notary positions. 75%(subject to change) of top performing notaries keep their positions. The other 25% if they wish to try to keep their spot will be put into a provably random lottery with any new sign ups.


[16-Feb-19 07:54 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ah, I see, excellent idea.


[16-Feb-19 07:55 PM] Alright#0419
do believe we're adding 2 spots every 2 months as well as we're only at 20 notaries total right now


[16-Feb-19 07:56 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I just signed up here (Rogue) for marketing,  so maybe by then I'll know if I will have the time + attention or not.


[16-Feb-19 07:57 PM] Cryptofist#7504
But working on Rogue, Pirate and learning /running a NN for a bit sounds wonderful.

@TonyL good bug,pushed fix. now the players current strength is preserved and when respawned it should be both the current and max strength. so if you have 17 when max is 18, on bailout and new game cur and max should be 17

I had a warrior die, but he was still playable for another game afterwards. I used him and quit two more times. Then all of a sudden he was gone.

Figured I'd mention it since it was odd.

[17-Feb-19 12:19 AM] jl777c#5810
likely the tx that recorded the death was in mempool. I guess there are some outside of game magics that can sometimes work

yeah mempool is what i was thinking

TUI unlikely will allow to life after death since it's waiting for one block before bailout - manually it's possible (but need to be lucky a lil bit) to resurrect if broadcast bailout super fast after death

Let me check


[17-Feb-19 04:05 AM] jl777c#5810
so all 14 levels were ignored?

No, warrior not dead


[17-Feb-19 04:05 AM] TonyL#3577
I can re-use it - just progress not saved


[17-Feb-19 04:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Are latest keystrokes on bottom or top of `keystrokes.log` ?


[17-Feb-19 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
in the replay it stops very quick, so that is what the daemon is seeing

[17-Feb-19 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL each bailout does create a new token, each register should be burning the old token

http://rogue.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RCGXh1vQHcHKPmSk7XERZimqXdAufn3vK9 ok, seems I've found burning address
Now have to find out how to check `tokenbalance` for it

This address seems like a nice way to track global "total games played" (1 satoshi = 1 game)

rogue used the curses screenbuffer for gamestate!

so I couldnt just stub out all curses calls,but had to implement enough to the rogue gamestate is preserved

[17-Feb-19 06:47 AM] TonyL#3577
For each token in tokenlist I'm checking first if it warrior by output of playerinfo, then checking if it alive by `tokenbalance deadpubkey`


[17-Feb-19 06:48 AM] TonyL#3577
If it match both then it adding to warriors list


[17-Feb-19 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
is it ever in tokenlist if it is dead? it shouldnt be


[17-Feb-19 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is unspent, it is alive


[17-Feb-19 06:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes burned tokens are in tokenlist


[17-Feb-19 06:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Only thing is changing after burning (after register transaction) is that it's transferring from my balance to deadpubkey address balance


[17-Feb-19 06:52 AM] TonyL#3577
If dead not in tokenlist my initial fast scanner will not show dead since it's checking all tokens from tokenlist


[17-Feb-19 06:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Btw are warriors tokens have 10000 supply by design?
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE tokeninfo babe44e3bc746b976f02906a2317234ab583e863b0304a444c1cb606adf6be5c

[17-Feb-19 06:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Warriors tokens have 1000 supply, and player have 1 of them
Then after register player have 0 and pubkeydead address have 1


[17-Feb-19 06:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's a bug that creating 10000 supply tokens instead of 1 supply


[17-Feb-19 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
yes that is a bug, where it is creating 10000 of them? or even 1000?


[17-Feb-19 07:02 AM] TonyL#3577
You can check tokeninfo for any warrior tokenid


[17-Feb-19 07:02 AM] TonyL#3577
All of them have 10000 supply


[17-Feb-19 07:02 AM] TonyL#3577
To create token with 1 supply needed:
``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE tokencreate TestSupply 0.00000001 ```
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE tokeninfo 7050b82b0385eb4858b609e539b4aa633f2e0e53585be3d742183ee426983ac5

babe44e3bc746b976f02906a2317234ab583e863b0304a444c1cb606adf6be5c has 1 satoshi output, seems tokenbalance might be wrong?


[17-Feb-19 07:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe hmm


[17-Feb-19 07:05 AM] TonyL#3577
Because `tokenbalance` for pubkey is 1 for warriors


[17-Feb-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a bug for dimxy to fix


[17-Feb-19 07:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Strange that when I'm creating token manually it have   "supply": 1. So I'm not sure which bug to report dimxy now


[17-Feb-19 07:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Is rogue creating tokens some special way?


[17-Feb-19 07:08 AM] TonyL#3577
If no warriors specified token is creating on newgame stage?


[17-Feb-19 07:09 AM] TonyL#3577
There are  "value": 0.00010000, 
10000 satoshies vouts in newgame transaction


[17-Feb-19 07:09 AM] TonyL#3577
And no 1 satoshi vout so bug is definitely on newgame side I think.
 UPD: oh no, token is creating when register as you said, sorry

If use as tokenid baton of game which I didn't start yet (only registered)


[17-Feb-19 07:17 AM] TonyL#3577
For non-existing tokenid there is other error:
```{
  "result": "error",
  "error": "cant find tokenid"
}```


[17-Feb-19 07:21 AM] TonyL#3577
In general I think 10000 supply token creating somehow when `newgame` (since only newgame have 10000 sat vouts) and then 1 token sending to player on register


[17-Feb-19 07:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Thats why `tokenbalance` is 1 but `tokensupply` is 10000
If create token with 1 supply manually it have 1 supply


[17-Feb-19 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
register spends token, bailout creates


[17-Feb-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i think tokeninfo is assuming specific vout, seems it might need to scan for valid CCvout


[17-Feb-19 07:34 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c vouts of bailout of first game are 10000 sat as well, there is no output of 1 satoshie

@jl777c  I think I did drink a brown potion, it said some thing like "everything feels cosmic"  then I assume it had no effects i could see at the moment.  When I got a couple of rooms over things got weird.     At that point  I thought it was just the game.   

Later I thought it could be the potion, I looked it up online for a while,  the reaction text was hard to find anywhere, not in any game item guides online.   I DID find it in github with an "LSD" effect near it in the code..... but thats not something I understand well,  maybe you can look and see.    

 I DID get a lot of gold and treasure rooms, not actual teleporting though, character didn't jump around.  The items I got were high level, plate mail was one.

brown potion i think


[17-Feb-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
and you should be in tune with the universe and find a lot more than usual treasure rooms


[17-Feb-19 08:06 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Yeah pretty sure its the potion

How is the pack size calculated?  It seems at some point i dropped a piece of armor after it being full, then could pick up 2 more things?  I played with it for a bit, didnt figure it out.


[17-Feb-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
some dual items take up more than one spot in the pack


[17-Feb-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe you ate some slime molds?


[17-Feb-19 08:11 AM] SHossain#0007
slime molds are not to eat?


[17-Feb-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
it is your favorite food, unless you changed it


[17-Feb-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
talking about using up spots in the pack


[17-Feb-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess multiplayer mode is the next frontier


[17-Feb-19 08:21 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Maybe.... Do they show up as food or slime mold automatically?


[17-Feb-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
:


[17-Feb-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
that is food


[17-Feb-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
you can name it whatever, default is slime mold


[17-Feb-19 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
sounds slimey and moldy, but it works as food, regardless of what it is called. without it you faint and eventually die


[17-Feb-19 08:27 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Yeah did that a few times early on.

If not check ```           elif rpc_connection.tokenbalance(player_info["player"]["tokenid"], "02deaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead")["balance"] == 1:
                pass``` it's 200 times faster üòÉ


[17-Feb-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
do you do them in alternating order?


[17-Feb-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
or all playerinfo calls, followed by check dead calls


[17-Feb-19 09:47 AM] TonyL#3577
If I'm getting "error" from playerinfo I'm not doing anything else with this token from list anymore


[17-Feb-19 09:47 AM] TonyL#3577
And proceed to the next


[17-Feb-19 09:47 AM] TonyL#3577
If playerinfo return not error I'm checking tokenbalance on deadpubkey


[17-Feb-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it can be that you run out of memory, so try to do all playerinfo, then issue the dead check all at once


[17-Feb-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, so skip the dead check on the first pass


[17-Feb-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
that finishes in 0.11 seconds


[17-Feb-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so then it becomes how long does all the dead checks take


[17-Feb-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
performance issues often dont fit the normal logics


[17-Feb-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
it is all about fitting in to available RAM, or L1 cache


[17-Feb-19 09:49 AM] TonyL#3577

[17-Feb-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
in general if you do X that takes n seconds and Y that does m seconds, it should both take n+m


[17-Feb-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you change it so you are doing a bunch of xy things, even though total done is identical, the timing is entirely different

vs. making 200 sandwiches and delivering them one by one, but only across the city and back


[17-Feb-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
can be indeed 100x faster


[17-Feb-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
you would never think to make a sandwich, deliver cross town, come back and repeat


[17-Feb-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
as the whole delivery time is very noticeable


[17-Feb-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
when issue DB calls, if it incurs a HDD seek... that is milliseconds (cross town)


[17-Feb-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
and HDD are smart enough to do things out of request order in optimal ways, of course SSD will reduce this effect, but still SSD is orders of magnitude slower than RAM


[17-Feb-19 09:53 AM] TonyL#3577

Python interpreter may also decide that you need barbecue instead of sandwich - faced it when played with python threading

oh, there is a "smart" layer in between. then anything can happen


[17-Feb-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the only thing that you would know for sure are specific performance results with specific data sets on specific hardware


[17-Feb-19 10:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok made test, now I know what is the reason.
```rogue_player_info(rpc_connection, "babe44e3bc746b976f02906a2317234ab583e863b0304a444c1cb606adf6be5c")
--- 0.004049777984619141 seconds ---```
```token_balance(rpc_connection, "babe44e3bc746b976f02906a2317234ab583e863b0304a444c1cb606adf6be5c", "02deaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead")
--- 0.25556230545043945 seconds ---```


[17-Feb-19 10:10 AM] TonyL#3577
For single `playerinfo` call I'm getting response *much* faster than for single `tokenbalance` call


[17-Feb-19 10:11 AM] TonyL#3577
So during the apps architecting it's better to not use `tokenCC` calls in loops I think (or in this particular case with balance for pubkey getting)


[17-Feb-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
tokenbalance for dead address will continue to get slower


[17-Feb-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
it should be a lot faster if you just looked up the txid and see if its destination is the dead address

@jl777c  can the tokens store data for different games? 
So you could have your Rogue Warriors 
Then if another game is implemented on the same chain, say Stone Soup, could you have separate tokens for that as well?  If so do you think it would be super difficult to do so for some reason? 
I am trying to figure out what is possible on one chain and what is not.


[17-Feb-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
playerdata is just a token with supply of 1


[17-Feb-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
there can be arbitrary number of games that issue tokens


[17-Feb-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is probably best to keep most of them on their own chain for scalability


[17-Feb-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
we are working on crosschain transfers of the tokens


[17-Feb-19 10:29 AM] Cryptofist#7504
That was my next question!


[17-Feb-19 10:30 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I assumed multiple games on ONE chain would make the change HUGE and quickly.


[17-Feb-19 10:30 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I often wonder if my  HP recovery of  making my character run back and forth to heal is making the current chain tooo big. lol


[17-Feb-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
just do 99.


[17-Feb-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
3 keystrokes, like running 99 spots


[17-Feb-19 10:32 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Just type 99 ?


[17-Feb-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
or 33. for 33 times


[17-Feb-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810

or 23 for 23 times


[17-Feb-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
you can repeat any command


[17-Feb-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810

Last question for now. 
There has been some debate on developing the game.  This is what I think.
You can add graphics to Rogue, a GUI interface, outside features and even maybe some new ones with some development as long as it  is based on the actual game code of Rogue. 
You cant just turn Rogue into Pixel Dungeon with out serious amounts of development work, it would be better to start with Pixel Dungeon and  make a new chain from there. 

Others think you can just turn Rogue into  a similar Roguelike


[17-Feb-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
you are correct


[17-Feb-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case I wont have time to become a roguelike gamedev


[17-Feb-19 10:37 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I know, that was clear!


[17-Feb-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so we will have pure rogue plus whatever outside of game GUI


[17-Feb-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
all the player collectibles can be made very GUI graphical


[17-Feb-19 10:37 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I dont think a lot of people get that when they keep tossing game ideas around here, so I think it will help for me to clarify that in some media.


[17-Feb-19 10:39 AM] Cryptofist#7504
After Rogue is running well, where in your timeline is getting tools for Gaming Devs built? I only know of a few tasks you have coming up, but those seem laborious to me already.


[17-Feb-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
today I made cursesd.c, which has enough of libncurses that rogue uses to recreate gamestate


[17-Feb-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
there are many games based on curses


[17-Feb-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
granted it is ascii based, but still many interesting things are possible, but before getting carried away, we need to get ROGUE to production level

Trying to find this dead address to be 100% sure - as I understand I can get it from bailout txid?
Can I find it somehow if I only know tokeind?
Tried to start daemon with `-pubkey=02deaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddeaddead`
Change gone to some address which had 0 tx so far http://rogue.explorer.dexstats.info/address/R9VggpGePJcq2U3r9R49XAHAjgAbxbzbcn


[17-Feb-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
just look at any register tx


[17-Feb-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the one that gets the 1 satoshi output is the dead address, it will change from the normal pubkey address as it is a CCvout


[17-Feb-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
for release we also need consensus level validation and dPoW


[17-Feb-19 10:59 AM] TonyL#3577

in playertxid and tokenid


[17-Feb-19 11:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Exactly same info


[17-Feb-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
check the playertxid vouts


[17-Feb-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
vout1 should be 1 satoshi, so gettxout playertxid 1


[17-Feb-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if no result, it was spent (dead)

```we need 1000x games developed using komodo. not to spend huge effort on making out own games```
Yep,  in those discussions i tried to explain that they're inspired in the right way but the game development needs to come from outside of KMD and not to have KMD devs working on games.  I want to make sure that is clear. 

I know the goal is to use this as a showpiece for others to want to use KMD for their games, that is why i'm looking for timelines on the dev tools.  If its unknown, its unknown, I can just leave it all stated as development in progress.  I would like to be able to fully promote the  idea and potential along side the game.

So it seems fine now @jl777c - at least in short games


[17-Feb-19 12:01 PM] TonyL#3577
Let me try re-using of re-used also üòÉ

ok, so nothing totally broken, and there was always that problem with long games which we dont know for sure is fixed yet. anyway, many good progress today!!

True! Tomorrow can re-test long game and proceed to multiplayer


[17-Feb-19 12:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
@jl777c  I meant update of just the TUI ,some added something or another....  I know you change/update stuff constantly.


[17-Feb-19 12:06 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I don't think we were talking about the same thing either.


[17-Feb-19 12:09 PM] TonyL#3577
And in third short game Doomguy returned back with progress saved


[17-Feb-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i got the case of no playerdata from bailout and the keystrokes.log had error of not able to find baton


[17-Feb-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i think this is due to the saving every level. i will change it back to requring some min amount of keystrokes, say 1024


[17-Feb-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
in an hour that is probably not too hard to do if you are actually playing, for singleplayer there is no timelimit


[17-Feb-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure this is the cause for no warrier being saved during bailout

Ok for updating Rogue - Is this what I use?
``` cd ~/komodo

git pull
cd src/cc
./makerogue
cd ../../
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)```


[17-Feb-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, we are back to jl777 branch


[17-Feb-19 12:13 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I have just left it open since yesterday.


[17-Feb-19 12:13 PM] Cryptofist#7504
ok thanks!!


[17-Feb-19 12:14 PM] TonyL#3577
avg. 17 keystrokes per minute seems not much if actually playing yup


[17-Feb-19 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
and in multiplayer mode, you really should be playing active


[17-Feb-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so i think there is decent chance long play games will be fine now

[17-Feb-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe I will add a keystrokes backup which can be used in case of keystrokes tx error


[17-Feb-19 12:19 PM] TonyL#3577
I can add to TUI - if bailout return no txid to try to rebroadcast keystrokes if there any errors in current game keystrokes sending status


[17-Feb-19 12:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Would be cool if it will be stored in gametxid.keystrokes files or seed.keystrokes


[17-Feb-19 12:21 PM] TonyL#3577
There might be lets say temporary connectivity issue on player side


[17-Feb-19 12:21 PM] TonyL#3577
So rebroadcast can help maybe in some cases :PeepoThink:


[17-Feb-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i added gametxid field to the keystrokes JSON, but it wont be so simple... there is an assumption of complete data and consequtive. I will need to think about this a bit

{Reactions}
üëå 

[17-Feb-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, what I need is a keystrokes tx queue and something that retries until it works


[17-Feb-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
anything else will just be too complex. so as long as your daemon can get in sync and running you should be ok


[17-Feb-19 12:26 PM] TonyL#3577
I can poll for updates in file, queue and rebroadcast until success if it's complicated to implement on rogue side


[17-Feb-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it wont be hard, just need to do it. getting data from the file, etc. seems error prone


[17-Feb-19 12:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, yep more failure points definetly


[17-Feb-19 05:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if I need to move my test data for cc rogue from linux to mac, what files do I need to move?


[17-Feb-19 05:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess just the ROGUE wallet.dat and the keystrockes log file from src ?

If you have a window open with CC/ROGUE  open you can do this. Fun little idea.


[17-Feb-19 10:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
right click the settings gear icon, go to games, Add game, type in rogue, select rogue, then you can edit it.

@jl777c There is a bug with strength
warrior restored with maxstrength 8, but it had maxstrength 17 and just current strength 8

[18-Feb-19 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
well if current strength was 8, that is what is used


[18-Feb-19 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is to inherit the player attributes


[18-Feb-19 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
you complained if it was set to maxstrength, it didnt match the player strength


[18-Feb-19 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so i changed it


[18-Feb-19 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise, you can bailout to do a restore strength


[18-Feb-19 12:37 AM] jl777c#5810
how did you lose 10 strength points?


[18-Feb-19 12:37 AM] TonyL#3577
I meant a little bit different
There are max strength and current strength
Before if you left dungeon you every time start new game with 16 from maxstrength strength


[18-Feb-19 12:38 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, I can set maxstrength to a min of 16


[18-Feb-19 12:38 AM] TonyL#3577
I just asked to do start new game with `previous game strength from maxstrength`


[18-Feb-19 12:38 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure it is good to do an effective restore strength to full via bailout


[18-Feb-19 12:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Max strength possible to increase by potions and also strength is possible to restore by potions


[18-Feb-19 12:38 AM] TonyL#3577
No need to restore


[18-Feb-19 12:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Just need to transfer state


[18-Feb-19 12:38 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will add that


[18-Feb-19 12:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a same with HP


[18-Feb-19 12:39 AM] TonyL#3577
HP transferring with current hp and max hp


[18-Feb-19 12:39 AM] TonyL#3577
So I can restore hp to max hp


[18-Feb-19 12:39 AM] TonyL#3577
But now I can't restore my strength to previous max strength because I'm limited by 8


[18-Feb-19 12:40 AM] TonyL#3577

Yahoo doomguy not died because of this bug


[18-Feb-19 12:49 AM] jl777c#5810
for now i changed the cursesd to fprintf all messages. so if you do an extract it should show all the things it thinks happened. would be interesting to see if it just stops at the potion or keeps going to icemonster

gain strength, prevent afterlife for playerdata


[18-Feb-19 01:03 AM] TonyL#3577
```it stops for me right after you get to level2```
Same for me - but actually I've died on level3 or even level4


[18-Feb-19 01:04 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, investigating. this will take a while. better to test new area like multiplayer

It should stop on this frame - I've screenshoted when quaffed


[18-Feb-19 01:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont see the bulging muscles print


[18-Feb-19 01:04 AM] TonyL#3577
It's screenshot not from replay

To easy check if quaffing causing progress not saving


[18-Feb-19 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i know, now I have a 100% reproduced non-determinism bug!


[18-Feb-19 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i wonder if other potions (healing) have the same effect, but first let me track this one down. I might get a clean fix

it shows a 'Q' in the replay keystrokes


[18-Feb-19 01:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Previous game replay today was interrupted on point where I've quaffed potions of healing - so I wonder healing is causing bug as well. This game can be checked here if needed: ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%22f49c62e2c9e2f0c165b2f8e9e6142d949b8c897ccb199e9d030a71490e1b2269%22,%22027d28d7d59ac499fac55f89b9e06933d66aaf74435c48326d83f8fbc6a7b14e85%22]\"```
 but do not distract you from the current one üòÉ

I pressed `Q n` yup

[18-Feb-19 01:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah yeah, pressed `Q+n` in both games - in one just missclicked, in second thought to quit first but then decided to use healing potions and continue the fight üòÉ

it gets to icemonster

you can replay other strange results games


[18-Feb-19 01:40 AM] jl777c#5810
also ^c might cause problems

how long til multiplayer testing starts?

it has been ready for testing for a week


[18-Feb-19 01:51 AM] TonyL#3577
If this bug is resolved - I'll try few short and few long games, check if progress saving correct and proceed to multiplayer testing and implementation in TUI


[18-Feb-19 01:51 AM] TonyL#3577
I have some multiplayer code prepared already so probably will not take long for some "work at least once" version - probably tonight or tomorrow


[18-Feb-19 01:56 AM] TonyL#3577
@actionslacks DEX features were implemented in TUI but I've not received any feedback so far - you may start from this one if you want to contribute


[18-Feb-19 01:56 AM] TonyL#3577
```DEX features:

[6] Check if somebody wants to buy your warrior (incoming bids)

[9] Check if somebody selling warrior
[10] Check / cancel my warriors trade orders```

But seems it saved progress after both Q+n and potion quaff


[18-Feb-19 02:07 AM] TonyL#3577
And these prints `Got 'Q' next (n)` not disappear in game until you use inventory to cover by other print - but I guess it's for debug reasons here

before it was counting things that are in the pack and also not in the pack as using a spot

I think the original game maybe counted things in a different way, but the way it is now, it seems you can really load up a playerdata

Pinned a message.


[18-Feb-19 03:04 AM] TonyL#3577
But some items stacked (like a 9 item of food). You made a fix with such idea? Just want to double-check while I'm in this state


[18-Feb-19 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it should work fine. just counting the inventory letters


[18-Feb-19 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
before it didnt check if it was in inventory!

Inventory letters != items


[18-Feb-19 03:05 AM] TonyL#3577
a) 9 rations of food
9 items but 1 letter


[18-Feb-19 03:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Now it allow me to have 23 inventory letters but I can have as much items as I want if it not taking more than 23 letters


[18-Feb-19 03:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, let me try the fixed version and check how it behaviour now


[18-Feb-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
some interim versions might get validate errors. I will update FSM with current version seems pretty stable


[18-Feb-19 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810

[18-Feb-19 03:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Updated to latest FSM:
I still can pickup things if it match slot and stacking
```                                 a) 11 rations of food

[18-Feb-19 03:33 AM] TonyL#3577
I  only can not pickup if item will create new letter (because there is 23 letters max limit I wonder)


[18-Feb-19 03:34 AM] TonyL#3577
but letters != items amount, so I wonder code should check that items amount < 23 rather than letters amount


[18-Feb-19 03:35 AM] TonyL#3577
I can collect 100 food now or 100 same scrolls what is not the same as in original rogue


[18-Feb-19 03:38 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe especially this warrior is corrupted for sure, because his inventory was filled on previous version
 will try to fill new warrior inventory now


[18-Feb-19 03:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Also some new prints corrupting screen

[18-Feb-19 03:42 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as inventory goes are you sure originally rogue did not allow stacking of items?


[18-Feb-19 03:42 AM] jl777c#5810
looking at the code, it sure looks like stacking of items is allowed


[18-Feb-19 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
like 26 arrows


[18-Feb-19 03:44 AM] TonyL#3577
It allowed to stack but not allowed to have more than 23 items in total


[18-Feb-19 03:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Not letters, items


[18-Feb-19 03:44 AM] jl777c#5810
arrows?


[18-Feb-19 03:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Arrows worked special way


[18-Feb-19 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so weapons like arrows, daggers, shurikan is ok to have many


[18-Feb-19 03:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Stack with which you starting counted as 1 item


[18-Feb-19 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
everything else counted as 1


[18-Feb-19 03:46 AM] jl777c#5810
thinking about the playerdata and collectibles market... maybe having a character with 100 food and 100 healing potions is not so bad, but I guess it does need to have some reasonable cap, so I will count total items also and we can decide what the limit should be


[18-Feb-19 03:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Warrior should a have huge cart with him to move with all this stuff in dungeon üòÇ


[18-Feb-19 03:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Would be interesting if max amount of items you can carry scale from strength


[18-Feb-19 03:50 AM] TonyL#3577
But it's game dev already...


[18-Feb-19 03:50 AM] TonyL#3577
And if somehow possible to put arrows back to pack with arrows


[18-Feb-19 03:50 AM] TonyL#3577
It would be wounderful


[18-Feb-19 03:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a I have pack with 30 arrows - why if I miss, pickup arrow I can't put it back to pack and single arrow taking one letter


[18-Feb-19 03:51 AM] TonyL#3577
It's by original rogue design


[18-Feb-19 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
they are not pristine anymore and dont stack up perfectly?


[18-Feb-19 03:52 AM] jl777c#5810
strength bug is fixed?


[18-Feb-19 03:52 AM] TonyL#3577
In original rogue throwable items works this strange way - it's not related to your changes


[18-Feb-19 03:53 AM] TonyL#3577
So if I have 30 arrows on start I can just shoot to wall and fill inventory by picking up arrows because each arrow will take inventory slot


[18-Feb-19 03:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Anyway bow mechanics is needed on low levels mostly


[18-Feb-19 03:54 AM] TonyL#3577

if it was saved when it had reduced str/max it will inherit that


[18-Feb-19 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
for new chars it should properly set str/max


[18-Feb-19 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
for old chars max would be set to 16


[18-Feb-19 04:06 AM] TonyL#3577
RIP - anyway he was not strong enough to be good
Only pity is that he had 12 food in pack

Resolved dependencies problem by pycurl pip package re-installng

So you need python3 (brew install python3)
And pip3 packages
python3 -m pip install setuptools wheel slick-bitcoinrpc


[18-Feb-19 04:21 AM] TonyL#3577
This should be enough

I had to modify a bit of `makerogue`, since it was using `gcc`, and was complaining about boost missing errors etc.

```#!/bin/sh
cd rogue;
./configure # only need this first time
make; cd ..
gcc-6 -Wno-write-strings -DBUILD_ROGUE -std=c++11 -I../../depends/$(echo `../..//depends/config.guess`/include) -I../univalue/include -I../cryptoconditions/include -I../cryptoconditions/src -I../cryptoconditions/src/asn -I.. -I. -fPIC -shared -o librogue.so -c cclib.cpp -L/usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.68.0_1/lib -I/usr/local/Cellar/boost/1.68.0_1/include -L/usr/local/Cellar/libsodium/1.0.17/lib -I/usr/local/Cellar/libsodium/1.0.17/include -L/usr/local/opt/berkeley-db@4/lib -I/usr/local/opt/berkeley-db@4/include

Great, thanks for testing @SHossain ! https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui/releases/tag/0.1 published portable ROGUE TUI for MacOS (need to unzip files to komodod src folder and execute ./rogue_tui)

[18-Feb-19 07:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes it's interesting - and potions of gaining strength are more valuable now - 1 strength points = 3 inventory places (beside of damage)


[18-Feb-19 07:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Also there are rings of sustain strength - will be very valuable musthave as well


[18-Feb-19 07:51 AM] TonyL#3577

32 yeah

[18-Feb-19 08:53 AM] TonyL#3577
It convert on exit


[18-Feb-19 08:54 AM] TonyL#3577

[18-Feb-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
I figured dumping a few items is better than having the character explode

I thought it'll work a little bit different way - like a if you have strength 11 you can't pickup until your total items amount is less than 33


[18-Feb-19 08:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Not randomly losing items


[18-Feb-19 09:01 AM] TonyL#3577
In case of random items loosing there should be some asking of player which items he want to left on exit to fit strength. But it's really overcomplicating - maybe it's really better to return to 23 slots model on this point


[18-Feb-19 09:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Since there is even no counter in inventory and no any notification about allowed amount - player may be very confused

maybe when you throw the first one, it counts them separately


[18-Feb-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
like its in a one box, but to use it you open it and all are counted


[18-Feb-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont see any logic like that in the code, but not 100% up to speed with it yet


[18-Feb-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
got about one third validating from beginning, seems over half of recent ones


[18-Feb-19 10:21 AM] TonyL#3577
In original rogue box with arrows counted as one item


[18-Feb-19 10:21 AM] TonyL#3577
But as soon as you throw arrow, it miss, and you picking it up - this single arrow counting as separate from pack item and taking separate letter in menu

Entered dungeon with same player:

Nice that game is started üòÉ


[18-Feb-19 10:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Have 43 not 48 but definetly better that instadead


[18-Feb-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, so basically we went from losing Leeroy, to losing a few pack items if you are overfilled


[18-Feb-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
50% of very recent games validating, and the last 13 in a row


[18-Feb-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
since all these game changes changes the game, it would likely invalidate all the earlier games


[18-Feb-19 10:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Without suspicious items like arrows picking up ingame validation seems correct - only thing is that it printing "no more room in your pack" when you have 49 items and trying to pick up 50th


[18-Feb-19 10:42 AM] TonyL#3577
With different strength gaining/losing transfers between games with inventory of different sizes there are so many cases so more testers/testing needed


[18-Feb-19 10:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Loose scrolls is definitely better to lose whole warrior on which you've spent 1hour+ of gameplay


[18-Feb-19 10:46 AM] TonyL#3577
And 1000% better than  1hr+ of gameplay losing few times because accidentally pressed Q+n in game beginning


[18-Feb-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so we can keep the 3x strength as it is and see how it plays. with clear stats on where things are you can dump the useless items before bailing out

[18-Feb-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes and will help to see if validation issues are just due to different game rules or if still some bugs


[18-Feb-19 11:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Hahaha reading trough rogue source code - it's really funny


[18-Feb-19 11:16 AM] TonyL#3577
It can decide what type of player you're and generating new items depends of it

There are this o_group property checks in pack.c but can't collect puzzle pieces together so far


[18-Feb-19 12:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Interesting that on pickup there is no any check if it group https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/rogue/pack.c#L229
But on leave pack it's checking if obj->o_group
In original rogue such groups counted as 1

Will try to remove this o_group argument at all - maybe it's a clue
 Interesting how things will behave üòÉ

[18-Feb-19 01:30 PM] TonyL#3577
What I've detected so far (without code modifications) is that it counting initial arrows as one object when drop it and pick up
Playing by ./rogue 777 gui
When pickup food with initial pack:
```                           |...%@. strength*3 48 vs total.42 vs 5 inventory let
                           +...... a) 2 rations of food
                           ------- b) +1 ring mail [protection 4] (being worn)
                                   c) A +1,+1 mace (weapon in hand)
                                   d) A +1,+0 short bow
                                   e) 38 +0,+0 arrows
                                   --Press space to continue--```


[18-Feb-19 01:30 PM] TonyL#3577
When then drop and pickup pack with arrows it's counting as 1:
```                                   strength*3 48 vs total.5 vs 4 inventory lett
                                   a) 2 rations of food
                           ------- b) +1 ring mail [protection 4] (being worn)
                           |...... c) A +1,+1 mace (weapon in hand)
                           |...%.. d) A +1,+0 short bow
                           +...... e) 38 +0,+0 arrows
                           ------- --Press space to continue--```

But if shot one arrow, drop pack and pickup pack counting not as 1 items but as total arrows amount


[18-Feb-19 01:34 PM] TonyL#3577
So on pick up  arrows not recounting. There are really tricky state changes conditions on drop/pick-up packed throwable stuff. Mindblowing - easier just count these throwable items packs as 1 item imo and not even try to count/recount on pickup - just count any pickup as +1 item üòÇ

@jl777c true, in the end I just tried to understand why counters in max inventory limit count 1 more (it allows to take x3*strength + item) - seems it's connected to original game hardcoded rule that you can't have less than 1 item in inventory (it have validation if you'll try to drop last one). Was just interesting research - realised that can read C code if just imagine -> as . and {} as 4 spaces idents üòÇ

[19-Feb-19 12:17 AM] jl777c#5810
I changed it so ISMANY objects count as 1


[19-Feb-19 12:17 AM] jl777c#5810
but the maxtotal is 2x strength


[19-Feb-19 12:17 AM] jl777c#5810
whitespace having effect on code is quite crazy


[19-Feb-19 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
violates some basic rules about being unambiguous, eg. is 4 spaces the same as tab


[19-Feb-19 12:18 AM] TonyL#3577
But in python miss one space is quite same as forget { in C :)
Oh cool, ISMANY as 1  - it should eliminate this headache


[19-Feb-19 12:19 AM] TonyL#3577
Thanks god IDE converting tab to 4 spaces - one time I've edited python code in nano - pressed tab instead of 4 spaces and then troubleshooted for a while


[19-Feb-19 12:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just wrong to be able to look at the code and not know for sure what it says due to any ambiguity,let alone invisible things like spaces, tabs


[19-Feb-19 12:22 AM] TonyL#3577
https://bugs.python.org/issue22086 people even opening issues because of such problems lol


[19-Feb-19 12:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Cool, ISMANY as 1 working as a charm, even when I shot one arrow and dropped pack and picked up it's counting as 1
Player can just imagine that it's a magic quiver. Like a when you have ammo pack - in games it's usually just pack, not depends how many ammo you have


[19-Feb-19 12:33 AM] jl777c#5810
so it can take up many inventory spots, but just one maxstrength spot

[19-Feb-19 01:08 AM] TonyL#3577
But aren't players can't cheat this way? Just  play against each other with buyin 0.01 to grind gold and cashout


[19-Feb-19 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, there is the 5 block wait


[19-Feb-19 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and the strict time limit


[19-Feb-19 01:10 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it devalues ROGUE by 10x, but as it was likely few are selling ROGUE as it is so hard to get


[19-Feb-19 01:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Yep, some devalue was the point


[19-Feb-19 01:10 AM] jl777c#5810
the more ROGUE circulating, the more people will pay for playerdata


[19-Feb-19 01:11 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it shouldnt be 10x for a last man standing...


[19-Feb-19 01:11 AM] jl777c#5810
but only if you have amulet

[19-Feb-19 01:11 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, I will change to 2x if lastman standing


[19-Feb-19 01:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Abusing prevention


[19-Feb-19 01:11 AM] jl777c#5810
so 4x single player


[19-Feb-19 01:12 AM] jl777c#5810
still worth doing, but with 5 block wait time maybe not that much benefit as you can almost get killed in 5 blocks


[19-Feb-19 01:12 AM] TonyL#3577
If you're so cool to find amulet you earn a lot of gold


[19-Feb-19 01:12 AM] TonyL#3577
And it's stimulating playerdata market even more


[19-Feb-19 01:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Since players will want not only defeat opponent to take the buyin but also find the amulet


[19-Feb-19 01:13 AM] TonyL#3577
So will need strong enough warriors

Hi, could someone please tell me where the original game code comes from?

[19-Feb-19 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so now it is 2x for multiplayer, 4x for last man standing, 20x for amulet win (over single player farming)

{Reactions}
treasure 

[19-Feb-19 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it encourages multiplayer (real or no) with the 2x. at least there is a chance some random roguer will join and play against you


[19-Feb-19 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
also when you win, your pack items are converted to gold and I think it is many thousands of gold

[19-Feb-19 01:24 AM] TonyL#3577
After you trained in singleplayer


[19-Feb-19 01:24 AM] jl777c#5810
still the total won even with amulet should be less than 100 ROGUE


[19-Feb-19 01:24 AM] jl777c#5810
and considering some player play for years and never win, it seems the value per ROGUE cant be very low


[19-Feb-19 01:26 AM] ph03nix#3115
what is max supply of ROGUE


[19-Feb-19 01:27 AM] jl777c#5810
infinite


[19-Feb-19 01:27 AM] jl777c#5810
10% of all transactions goes into the main CC address, which pays out the gold -> ROGUE


[19-Feb-19 01:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so the more games played, the more funds available


[19-Feb-19 01:28 AM] jl777c#5810
"CCbalance": 1202386.13391190,


[19-Feb-19 01:28 AM] jl777c#5810
I estimate about 20,000 free trading ROGUE exists at this moment


[19-Feb-19 01:29 AM] jl777c#5810
a better store of value in ROGUE would be a high quality playerdata


[19-Feb-19 01:29 AM] jl777c#5810
but the inflation rate of ROGUE is designed to scale with usage, and the more usage, the more it is worth. Not sure if the -ac_perc 10% is the exact right value


[19-Feb-19 01:29 AM] jl777c#5810
but pretty sure it is within an order of magnitude


[19-Feb-19 01:34 AM] ph03nix#3115
so the main CC address will never run out of funds?


[19-Feb-19 01:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it might temporarily run out of funds. in that case, you would need to wait with your bailout/highlander tx, but it is self-replenishing based on usage

ROGUERS update to latest version (jl777 and FSM are in sync). there are "hardforking" changes in gameplay interpretation and I will be enabling strict validation soon. When I do, if you are not running the latest, you will go on a fork

I believe the ability for percentage of transaction volumes to go to a locked address is pretty unique, let alone where the release of funds is based on actual gameplay keystrokes


[19-Feb-19 01:40 AM] jl777c#5810

yes


[19-Feb-19 01:55 AM] jl777c#5810
with reward of 1, if no other tx, then 10% is 0.1


[19-Feb-19 01:55 AM] jl777c#5810
if there are other tx, then the 0.1 is increased by 10% of whatever other tx


[19-Feb-19 01:56 AM] jl777c#5810

@Cryptofist Yes, just be sure that you have latest daemon and update TUI

TUI have 3 new features: 
`[6] Create new multiplayer game` (you'll be asked for max players amount and buyin amount)
`[7] Join (register) multiplayer game` - it's scan chain for multiplayer game and asking for txid of game you want to join, then sending register
`[8] Check my multiplayer games status / start` - it's scanning for not finished multiplayer games you participating in, asking if you want to start any, if yes asking for game txid and starting rogue for this game


[19-Feb-19 02:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Then after you finish your rogue game it'll execute bailout if there is more than 1 player alive or highlander if you're last player alive

Anyone who wants to help with a promotion later on, please make "Komodo Warrior" characters.
Or something like that. I'm making level 3 ones. 
Granted they'll all die quick anyway.


[19-Feb-19 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, validation stuff. updating

Just tried to transfer warrior by tokentransfer - seems working fine


[19-Feb-19 03:10 AM] TonyL#3577
But recipient have to provide you pubkey since tokentransfer only to pubkey is possible

Seems so, I've played only 2 games but it worked as expected in both cases. Made calls in TUI to make further testing faster so will test more with careful gold tracking


[19-Feb-19 03:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a when I broadcast bailout by one player, active players amount immediately decrease. When I broadcast highlander from second he getting pot

Added warrior choice on multiplayer game register, beatified more multiplayer games lists prints


[19-Feb-19 04:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Thinking now how to implement these prints with exact amounts:
```"Extracting Gold from the Dungeons of Doom" 
"Converting game gold to ROGUE"
```
Since extracting printing on bailout in stdout


[19-Feb-19 04:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a 
"Extractid X Gold from the Dungeons of Doom"
"Converting game gold to Y ROGUE"

Or you just wanted to change message about next block waiting to these  without sums @Cryptofist ?

sorry, just fixed a validation error


[19-Feb-19 04:46 AM] jl777c#5810
probably best to make sure basic gameplay still works and make another release, FSM and jl777 are in sync


[19-Feb-19 04:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I've not bundled komodod anyway yet

It's just TUI so far


[19-Feb-19 04:46 AM] jl777c#5810
good. i dont expect more validation changes today


[19-Feb-19 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
what was confusing me was the tx were still onchain even though error. then i realized likely the miners are not updated yet


[19-Feb-19 04:52 AM] jl777c#5810
also if you just play in a different console than you run the komodod, the printouts wont affect gameplay


[19-Feb-19 04:52 AM] jl777c#5810
i really need to be having printouts during the debugging


[19-Feb-19 04:53 AM] jl777c#5810
latest version validates newgame tx and does a validation check and print for bailout/highlander tx

Ah, I saw ca333 say "WIndows build of komodo Rogue is fixed - we will push it online for testing shortly."

no one knows what this means when compiling komodo (macOS)
``checking whether the linker accepts -Wl,-z,relro... no``
``configure: error: Cannot enable RELRO`` ?

brew install boost


[19-Feb-19 09:55 AM] SHossain#0007
@Meyse maybe you used `./zcutil/build.sh -j8` instead of `./zcutil/build-mac.sh -j8`


[19-Feb-19 10:04 AM] Meyse#0952
@SHossain this isnt in the instructions, but yeah thanks!

@SHossain maybe good idea to add full komodod installation instructions or to add a link in the rogue instructions..


[19-Feb-19 10:13 AM] Meyse#0952
would be nice to put this also in the instructions üòÑ


[19-Feb-19 10:13 AM] SHossain#0007
sure. will do


[19-Feb-19 10:14 AM] SHossain#0007
so many changes üòÉ


[19-Feb-19 10:15 AM] SHossain#0007
@ca333 the instructions there are actually taken from our komodo build guide


[19-Feb-19 10:15 AM] SHossain#0007
does users need `xcode select install` commands?


[19-Feb-19 10:15 AM] ca333#0333
i see stuff is missing


[19-Feb-19 10:16 AM] ca333#0333
i will add it later today (OSX specific deps, etc.)


[19-Feb-19 10:16 AM] Meyse#0952
much appreciated


[19-Feb-19 10:16 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. thanks 
here is our current build guide https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/install-Komodo-manually.html#installing-komodo-on-osx


[19-Feb-19 10:16 AM] SHossain#0007
if you let me know the missing parts, i can get them updated in all places


[19-Feb-19 10:21 AM] SHossain#0007
@Meyse use this in terminal and try again please `xcode-select --install`


[19-Feb-19 10:22 AM] Meyse#0952
@SHossain ``xcode-select: error: command line tools are already installed, use "Software Update" to install updates``

same thing with xcode again


[19-Feb-19 10:45 AM] SHossain#0007
if you have xcode installed, that is good. did `brew upgrade` do anything?

yes it did

did you use these?
```

if you have any package that needs to be updated, use `reinstall` i.e.: `brew reinstall gcc@6`


[19-Feb-19 11:11 AM] Meyse#0952

@Meyse - current instruction should be ok. Can you please make a gist.github.com or pastebin.com of your error output


[19-Feb-19 11:12 AM] ca333#0333
the relevant output starts with `error:`

the above warning is "harmless"

Which OSX version are you running? And can you please check `gcc-6 --version` it seems outdated too. brew update and upgrade is a good idea in this case.

Do you want/need me to try and test it some more right now?


[19-Feb-19 12:43 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I was excited to join a game


[19-Feb-19 12:44 PM] TonyL#3577
If you found something working not correct -feel free to report


[19-Feb-19 12:44 PM] TonyL#3577
I noted this `Check if somebody selling warrior` item - will fix it tomorrow


[19-Feb-19 12:45 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I got my thoughts confused a bit here ^ that  last bit was about joing a multiplayer game with the  R + E entries and such.


[19-Feb-19 12:45 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Sorry it was abit ago and I have done a bunch of other things since.


[19-Feb-19 12:46 PM] TonyL#3577
E + enter = proceed to the next step (game txid choosing)


[19-Feb-19 12:46 PM] TonyL#3577
R + enter = refresh games list


[19-Feb-19 12:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Ctrl + C = back to main menu


[19-Feb-19 12:46 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ah ok so type ``e``


[19-Feb-19 12:46 PM] Cryptofist#7504
then enter


[19-Feb-19 12:46 PM] TonyL#3577
I can make prints more clear - just wanted to make list refreshable on this place


[19-Feb-19 12:47 PM] TonyL#3577
```R + Enter - refresh list.
E + Enter - to the game choice.
CTRL + C - back to main menu``` it's waiting for capital `E` input


[19-Feb-19 12:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I thought I was supposed to put a txid


[19-Feb-19 12:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
CAPITAL E ... ok


[19-Feb-19 12:47 PM] TonyL#3577
and printing what it waiting üòÉ


[19-Feb-19 12:47 PM] TonyL#3577
But if multiplayer list is clear you need to create some first by `Create multiplayer game`


[19-Feb-19 12:47 PM] TonyL#3577
And as I can see now - there is no multiplayer games


[19-Feb-19 12:48 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So i tried to join a few, no luck
then I made one, couldnt join it. üòÇ


[19-Feb-19 12:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Some errors or?


[19-Feb-19 12:48 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok I think i need to update again, because...

```something went wrong

[19-Feb-19 12:48 PM] Cryptofist#7504
fork?


[19-Feb-19 12:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha it means that daemon not returned txid after you tried to bailout


[19-Feb-19 12:49 PM] Cryptofist#7504
noob'n ?


[19-Feb-19 12:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Not sure why daemon not returned txid


[19-Feb-19 12:49 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I hadnt had any issues til I updated today. haha


[19-Feb-19 12:50 PM] TonyL#3577
TUI still broadcasting same bailouts as before üòÉ  Did you update daemon?


[19-Feb-19 12:50 PM] TonyL#3577

Can you try to:

cd ..
git pull
make clean
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)```


[19-Feb-19 12:57 PM] TonyL#3577
There are may be various reasons: let's say you didn't rebuild or you didn't clean before build or you didn't start daemon with fresh build. So this sequence should eliminate all these cases


[19-Feb-19 12:58 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Cool working on it


[19-Feb-19 12:58 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Does the ``make clean`` command work on dishes?


[19-Feb-19 12:59 PM] TonyL#3577
`make clean` cleaning previous build


[19-Feb-19 12:59 PM] TonyL#3577
It should work recursive from komodod folder so will clean rogue build as well


[19-Feb-19 12:59 PM] Cryptofist#7504
ok awesome

I'm very sorry


[19-Feb-19 01:00 PM] TonyL#3577
`make clean` just cleaning `build.sh` building


[19-Feb-19 01:00 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it can build building as well, not sure


[19-Feb-19 01:01 PM] Cryptofist#7504

right. i can play and bail out and get rewards but the tui says that i dont have any warriors even if i create one. is that a problem on my side?

@sgt-pot-smoker  Sometimes it needs some time before it will load, but if you are repeating the process over and over


[19-Feb-19 01:12 PM] Cryptofist#7504
it may be.


[19-Feb-19 01:12 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
ok ty


[19-Feb-19 01:12 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Doing everything tony and I just went over may be a solution

Im sorry to hear that, losing warriors, sucks.


[19-Feb-19 01:13 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
its just popped up as i have 1 now. so thats cool. ive only just got it running. started 8 hr ago lmao just doing bailouts on lvl 3 checking its working before i put time into it


[19-Feb-19 01:15 PM] TonyL#3577
There might be different reasons (you have not updated daemon and not passing some new validations, you died, you tried to quit without mosnters killing and gold collecting)


[19-Feb-19 01:15 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
i only started on linux last week so im guessing its deffo down to me lol


[19-Feb-19 01:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Did you update your komodod since last week?


[19-Feb-19 01:17 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
yes many times today XD


[19-Feb-19 01:17 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257
i have a warrior now so hoping its all ok


[19-Feb-19 01:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah also one more reason - warrior appears in list after bailout transaction is mined


[19-Feb-19 01:18 PM] TonyL#3577
If there any pending games you may find it manually by `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib games 17`


[19-Feb-19 01:19 PM] TonyL#3577
And try to execute bailout manually by `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22<GAME_TXID>%22]\"` to try to rescue the warrior


[19-Feb-19 01:19 PM] sgt-pot-smoker#1257

[19-Feb-19 01:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so seed showing after 5 blocks now - will add validation and game status field in list


[19-Feb-19 01:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Found out why `Check if somebody selling warrior` not showing orders atm.
 Validation in warriors scanner connected to specific txout to check if it dead. But if warrior placed in sell order on marketplace scanner detecting him as dead as well üòÉ Things starting to be interesting


[19-Feb-19 02:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Fixed this and also added some flags which showing if game is ready to start or not in multiplayer games start menu (also it shouldn't crash if you try to start not ready game). Updates are in TUI `rogue` branch

can you open a new terminal? then ```cd ~/komodo/src
./rogue_tui.py
```


[19-Feb-19 07:00 PM] Cryptofist#7504
If you installed TUI and it is runing, that should lead you to a game


[19-Feb-19 07:01 PM] Cryptofist#7504
You need to start a new single player game if you have no warrior tokens


[19-Feb-19 07:03 PM] Alright#0419
I think simplest way for windows noob may be a remote daemon that Tony's TUI connects to


[19-Feb-19 07:03 PM] Alright#0419
going to try it, if it works, I might be able to host other instances for people


[19-Feb-19 07:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok so I also have the same problems.
No warrior tokens to select from or see in TUI
```
Game is finished!

@Alright  that would be super super eamazing!

Could you somehow screencap record that being set up? That would be an excellent learning asset.


[19-Feb-19 07:22 PM] Alright#0419
@TonyL have you tried this TUI on windows yet?

@Cryptofist I can try to document how to set it up. Not sure how many instances of the daemon I can reliably run though


[19-Feb-19 07:39 PM] Cryptofist#7504
That'd be cool. If you cant no big deal. I'll look for some info on remote stuff myself sometime.

@Cryptofist just struggling to get the dependencies for TUI installed atm


[19-Feb-19 07:50 PM] Alright#0419
if I can at least get the TUI running on windows, the daemon can be ran on linux easily


[19-Feb-19 07:50 PM] Cryptofist#7504
So Rogue & TUI worked fine until I updated to the new  versions. now I cant get them to work at all.


[19-Feb-19 07:51 PM] Alright#0419
Ah is the TUI not usable right now?


[19-Feb-19 07:51 PM] Cryptofist#7504
probably something simple to devs that  I do not get


[19-Feb-19 07:51 PM] Alright#0419
something in the daemon change?


[19-Feb-19 07:51 PM] Cryptofist#7504
It aesthetically functions, but it isnt loading my tokens or saving them when i Q a game


[19-Feb-19 07:51 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I think so man, something like that.


[19-Feb-19 07:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504

Reinstalled Ubuntu. Working through steps. Made it to step 1 start chain. Terminal stalled at 'some-address' good 71 bad 24.  Tried to scroll up on terminal and it returned me to command prompt. System monitor says komodod is running and it appears is dl something. Guess I wait.


[19-Feb-19 10:35 PM] jl777c#5810
if it printed good 71 bad 24, that means you are most likely in sync

You can *try* the ubuntu terminal app from the microsoft store, but I have not had great luck wit it, it draws the maps weirdly and has some odd text issues when running commands

I mean folder from which you run it
There is a step in update `cp -r * ~/komodo/src`
So then you need to `cd ~/komodo/src` and then run TUI


[20-Feb-19 12:38 AM] TonyL#3577
It can't find path to rogue if you run it from let's say `~/komodo/src/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui`

[20-Feb-19 12:40 AM] jeezy#3408
how to quit alive?


[20-Feb-19 12:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Shift + Q, then y


[20-Feb-19 12:40 AM] TonyL#3577
But you have to kill at least one monster and collect not 0 gold if you want your warrior to be saved


[20-Feb-19 12:41 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c there are a lot of reports when `bailout` in singleplayer game not generating transaction - may it be connected to outdated daemon version?  TUI just sending `cclib bailout 17 gametxid`


[20-Feb-19 12:42 AM] jeezy#3408
how do you get coins?


[20-Feb-19 12:42 AM] jeezy#3408
is the gold I collect = $ROGUE?


[20-Feb-19 12:42 AM] TonyL#3577
When you playing singleplayer - each gold ->  0.001 ROGUE


[20-Feb-19 12:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it works for me, does it work for you?


[20-Feb-19 12:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Works for me as well


[20-Feb-19 12:43 AM] jeezy#3408
only if you quit alive or also if you die?


[20-Feb-19 12:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh sorry, actually it's not 0.001 but 0.0005 in singleplayer, but 0.001 in multiplayer


[20-Feb-19 12:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, should receive for dead or alive


[20-Feb-19 12:44 AM] TonyL#3577
But when you quit alive you may prepare really strong warrior


[20-Feb-19 12:46 AM] jeezy#3408
sometimes game creation takes a very long time


[20-Feb-19 12:46 AM] jeezy#3408
do we need more mining power on the chain?


[20-Feb-19 12:46 AM] TonyL#3577
game creation = mining of game transaction what is usually = next block


[20-Feb-19 12:48 AM] TonyL#3577
I don't think block-time will change dramatically in case of more mining power


[20-Feb-19 12:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Difficulty just adjust to keep blocktime


[20-Feb-19 12:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Blocktime is average thing - so some might be longer some might be faster


[20-Feb-19 12:50 AM] TonyL#3577

[20-Feb-19 12:51 AM] jeezy#3408
so on average you have to wait a minute  thats acceptable I guess


[20-Feb-19 12:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I think it's around minute
http://rogue.explorer.dexstats.info/charts/block-interval I believe shows interval between blocks


[20-Feb-19 12:52 AM] jeezy#3408
the important question being


[20-Feb-19 12:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Some 6 minutes, some 4 seconds


[20-Feb-19 12:53 AM] jeezy#3408
when lootboxes?


[20-Feb-19 12:53 AM] TonyL#3577
Lootboxes?


[20-Feb-19 12:53 AM] jeezy#3408
yes


[20-Feb-19 12:53 AM] jeezy#3408
buy  gamble boxes with loot for $ROGUE


[20-Feb-19 12:54 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder there is no any donation stuff planning


[20-Feb-19 12:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Point is that there are DEX features embeed


[20-Feb-19 12:54 AM] jeezy#3408
im kidding


[20-Feb-19 12:54 AM] TonyL#3577
So you can trade your warrior with very unique loot


[20-Feb-19 12:54 AM] TonyL#3577
But in general you might implement your very own lootboxes on top


[20-Feb-19 12:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Just farm a lot of warriors


[20-Feb-19 12:55 AM] TonyL#3577
And then sell it in boxes - user paying lets say 2 ROGUE

[20-Feb-19 12:58 AM] TonyL#3577
Try to bailout alive and track your balance. I've not carefully tracked my balance when played so may be wrong that gold collecting by dead player


[20-Feb-19 01:02 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
200-300 gold and a bail out gets you about 0.15 rogue ish from my experience. 1200 gold got me about 0.6 rogue on bailout one time


[20-Feb-19 01:03 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
do i need to update anything before trying today?


[20-Feb-19 01:03 AM] TonyL#3577

Wait until gametx is mined

@benohanlon sure - if you can push it towards end of week would be good (for sake of multi OS compatibility and potential non-techy installer scripts/bundles)


[20-Feb-19 02:43 AM] Alright#0419
@ronyi are you able to get the actual rogue app running?


[20-Feb-19 02:44 AM] Alright#0419
the `rogue.c` source needs to be edited it or we need a wrapper for when it calls `komodo-cli` so it will issue rpc commands instead

I am getting that as well, but I thought it was because of something I broke


[20-Feb-19 02:45 AM] Alright#0419
@jeezy is that after you tried a sp game?


[20-Feb-19 02:46 AM] jeezy#3408
yes


[20-Feb-19 02:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Can you provide games txids for which bailout not generating txid?


[20-Feb-19 02:47 AM] jeezy#3408
its up there


[20-Feb-19 02:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh right


[20-Feb-19 02:48 AM] jeezy#3408
whats the command to query the chain which characters are savecd on a specific pubkey?


[20-Feb-19 02:48 AM] TonyL#3577
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib players 17


[20-Feb-19 02:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Will display list of your players


[20-Feb-19 02:50 AM] TonyL#3577
```{'gametxid': '60e51f72679f34259698ecdeb5054d728703cefc11c44994088d416056c279b0', 'name': 'rogue', 'result': 'success

[20-Feb-19 02:52 AM] Alright#0419
Tony, this is happening after trying to start a sp game for me


[20-Feb-19 02:52 AM] Alright#0419
game never starts


[20-Feb-19 02:52 AM] Alright#0419
immediately goes to bailout


[20-Feb-19 02:53 AM] jeezy#3408
can I not see which characters are on a specific pubkey?


[20-Feb-19 02:53 AM] TonyL#3577
You can if you start daemon with `-pubkey=` param of pubkey for which you want to see it


[20-Feb-19 02:54 AM] jeezy#3408
I'm always using new characters, trying to level some up  and save them


[20-Feb-19 02:54 AM] jeezy#3408
I did that


[20-Feb-19 02:54 AM] TonyL#3577
In this case `cclib players 17` will display characters for this pubkey


[20-Feb-19 02:54 AM] TonyL#3577
`Tony, this is happening after trying to start a sp game for me`
With or without rogue source code modifications?


[20-Feb-19 02:55 AM] Alright#0419
both


[20-Feb-19 02:55 AM] jeezy#3408

I don't know all conditions when daemon not return txid in bailout


[20-Feb-19 03:29 AM] jeezy#3408
@ronyi  that hurts


[20-Feb-19 03:30 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes.


[20-Feb-19 03:30 AM] TonyL#3577
@ronyi Copy gametxid please


[20-Feb-19 03:30 AM] TonyL#3577
You may try to execute bailout manually in some time to see if it works:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22<GAME_TXID>%22]\"
```


[20-Feb-19 03:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Are you using latest jl777 daemon btw?


[20-Feb-19 03:32 AM] ronyi#5719
I think i updated ~24hr ago.


[20-Feb-19 03:32 AM] ronyi#5719
How to find this game txid?


[20-Feb-19 03:32 AM] TonyL#3577
It's in your print in screenshot which you shared (`gametxid`)


[20-Feb-19 03:33 AM] TonyL#3577
~24hrs ago it's quite old daemon for current things pace - please update


[20-Feb-19 03:34 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm playing on latest daemon and don't have such bailout problems


[20-Feb-19 03:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Try to update, restart daemon and bailout manually then

[20-Feb-19 03:36 AM] TonyL#3577
So 
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22 6fbde4aa874291057970bc25dcf304a71b51079abef944e5ee3b0d4a1eca96ea

[20-Feb-19 03:38 AM] TonyL#3577
So it's worked after some waiting?


[20-Feb-19 03:39 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes, i think.


[20-Feb-19 03:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I may try to add broadcasting of bailout until it gets txid if waiting resolve the probelm


[20-Feb-19 03:41 AM] jeezy#3408
I also play on latest pull and sometime get bailout error


[20-Feb-19 03:43 AM] TonyL#3577
If you see such cases please try to re-broadcast bailout manually ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22<GAME_TXID>%22]\"
``` this way in some time.
If it helps - I'll modify TUI code to handle such cases


[20-Feb-19 03:47 AM] ronyi#5719
thank you


[20-Feb-19 03:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Pushed patch which should handle such cases to TUI `rogue` branch


[20-Feb-19 03:58 AM] jeezy#3408
thx


[20-Feb-19 03:58 AM] jeezy#3408
will update and try latest

[20-Feb-19 04:10 AM] TonyL#3577
It will try to do bailout each 5 seconds until receive hex and txid back, so if there any cases when waiting not help to get txid from bailout - you will need to stop it manually by Ctrl + C and reopen TUI. Temporary brut-force solution since problem isn't determined yet


[20-Feb-19 04:31 AM] jeezy#3408
for the contest only selffarmed gold counts or also sold warriors?


[20-Feb-19 04:31 AM] jeezy#3408
what counts as gameplay here


[20-Feb-19 04:34 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c  wrote "legit gameplay farming or multiplayer" not sure if trades counting in this contest


[20-Feb-19 04:36 AM] jeezy#3408
if you save and want to return you start a fresh dungeon?


[20-Feb-19 04:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Any new game you start from lvl1 of dungeon - only warrior state is saving

Flytraps are tricky - sometimes they catch you by diagonal, and you need to hit them in diagonal direction

[20-Feb-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
if you die, you dont get any gold and playerdata is gone


[20-Feb-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
buying and selling playerdata is legitimate way of earning ROGUE


[20-Feb-19 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
what does not count would be mining or working around the rpc validations


[20-Feb-19 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
some windows issues identified, like system() call likely not working right and ./komodo-cli not being there


[20-Feb-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
so in addiition to the first 777 prize, there will also be a second one to allow windows uses a chance


[20-Feb-19 06:20 AM] Alright#0419
I think I have it working by using a wrapper named "komodo-cli"

I still need to test building rogue app on windows


[20-Feb-19 06:24 AM] Alright#0419
not saying I have it even close to done, but I think the concept of windows user just running rogue app and TUI and interfacing with a remote daemon will work

follow this guide and use the ROGUE start param instead of default komodo as the guide says


[20-Feb-19 07:52 AM] SHossain#0007
example
```
gdb -args ./komodod -ac_name=ROGUE -pubkey=0395c79875b36dab6e218f6315052754df8d7d8692b24342b2cce102c542c0de6d -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=5.9.102.210  -ac_cclib=rogue -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=60001 -ac_script=2ea22c80203d1579313abe7d8ea85f48c65ea66fc512c878c0d0e6f6d54036669de940febf8103120c008203000401cc -daemon

ok thanks...will try that if it happens again


[20-Feb-19 07:55 AM] Alright#0419
think it may need to be `--args` as opposed to `-args`


[20-Feb-19 07:55 AM] Alright#0419
both may work though, not sure

Good Morning Everyone.
Some responses.  Loot boxes are fun, we can figure some thing out. I did want to do some character drops to the community after OS installers are 100%.  That is kind of the same thing for what we are working with.  @jeezy 
Thank you for the RT and support @benohanlon !  Who is the interview with?

I have worked out some great engagement on twitter in the non-crypto community over the last few days, a decent sized game marketing account even shared Rogue. The reach of this account is doing quite well given the age of it.

[20-Feb-19 08:56 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Im a cli noob


[20-Feb-19 08:56 AM] Alright#0419
if you used `setpubkey` command in initial setup, you must run it each time you restart the daemon


[20-Feb-19 08:56 AM] Cryptofist#7504
So what command do I use?


[20-Feb-19 08:56 AM] Cryptofist#7504
ok


[20-Feb-19 08:56 AM] Alright#0419
or when you start komodod, add `-pubkey=<pubkey>` as a param


[20-Feb-19 08:56 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I tried something liek that too and think i made it go wacky. let me look real quick.


[20-Feb-19 08:58 AM] SHossain#0007
@Cryptofist if the privkey of the pubkey you are using is not in your wallet.dat, you need to import the privkey of that address

If I've gone further than the previous 10 times where I've died, how do I save my warrior or save my game? "S" is disabled, how do I use "bailout rpc"


[20-Feb-19 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
`shift + q`, then y + enter


[20-Feb-19 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
When you're in game and warrior is alive


[20-Feb-19 12:06 PM] TonyL#3577
TUI will broadcast needed transaction automatically


[20-Feb-19 12:06 PM] wookie#7663
and when I restart a single player game, it will pick this saved warrior?


[20-Feb-19 12:07 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup, as soon as bailout transaction is mined you'll see warrior in list


[20-Feb-19 12:07 PM] TonyL#3577
If you have any - on next singleplayer game start TUI will print the list and will ask if you want to choose any

./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE getsnapshot


[20-Feb-19 12:47 PM] wookie#7663
so when I quit, save warrior, and restart a new single player game with that same warrior, I lose all my gold?


[20-Feb-19 12:49 PM] Cryptofist#7504
it gets converted to ROGUE


[20-Feb-19 12:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Nope, gold cashing out to ROGUE each time when you quit dungeon. You save only inventory and warrior characteristics


[20-Feb-19 12:49 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Your ROGUE total is your scoreboard for the contest too


[20-Feb-19 12:49 PM] wookie#7663
great! thanks!


[20-Feb-19 12:50 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Maybe *in the future* we can do a contest for best  gold run without dying/exit, to showcase the replay feature or something.


[20-Feb-19 12:56 PM] TonyL#3577
Should be interesting. Blank warriors multiplayer contests might be kinda cybersport as well üéÆ

Very important to know: jump [nojump]
     If this option is set, running moves will not  be  dis-
     played until you reach the end of the move.  This saves
     considerable  cpu  and  display  time.    This   option
     defaults to jump if you are using a slow terminal.

@wookie happened with me as well today - please record such cases games txid (it's possible to check replay and see where it interrupted / saved progress not correct)

is it the same as my player txid?


[20-Feb-19 05:42 PM] TonyL#3577
There is a print in game start `New singleplayer training game succesfully created. txid:`

M not on computer right now, but want to ask.
Using kp repo and multios branch, if I get git pull update, do I need to use src make or zcbuild mac script? Yesterday I tried amd executed zcbuild, and it again took half+ hr to compile.


[20-Feb-19 06:27 PM] Deleted User#0000
get a faster computer :troll_cool:


[20-Feb-19 06:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Already fast enough


[20-Feb-19 06:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was on slower network


[20-Feb-19 06:31 PM] Deleted User#0000
was joking... it shouldn't take 30mins after doing once in my experiance...


[20-Feb-19 06:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes make is fast
Zbuild won't

i usulally use make, and it that fail


[20-Feb-19 06:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
then zbuild


[20-Feb-19 06:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Just want to confirm make will slso compile rogue updates


[20-Feb-19 06:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yep, I follow the same for non rogue branches


[20-Feb-19 06:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
hmm my guess is that you would need to rebuild rogue first


[20-Feb-19 06:33 PM] Deleted User#0000
then make ... but not 100% sure tbh


[20-Feb-19 06:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Nope zbuild compile rogue for mac too


[20-Feb-19 06:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
That's why the questions


[20-Feb-19 06:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
if zbuild works... guess just use that

[20-Feb-19 06:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Jk


[20-Feb-19 06:52 PM] Cryptofist#7504
But yeah that happened to me again a bit ago


[20-Feb-19 06:56 PM] Regnar#6164
hmm still getting no players available to select. I tried set warriors name and that said it worked, but still says I have none.


[20-Feb-19 06:58 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm assuming I need some rogue to start?


[20-Feb-19 07:05 PM] TonyL#3577
@Regnar check if you're in sync and have all blocks


[20-Feb-19 07:05 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I thought it gave you some to start too.


[20-Feb-19 07:06 PM] TonyL#3577
Behaviour which you posted happens when daemon isn't fully synced


[20-Feb-19 07:06 PM] Regnar#6164
hmm I think I figured it out


[20-Feb-19 07:07 PM] Regnar#6164
one sec


[20-Feb-19 07:07 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll add some chain sync validation in next version


[20-Feb-19 07:08 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Sent a PM Tony , whenever you have time. I walked away from it. Getting grumpy at the game. Lol


[20-Feb-19 07:09 PM] Regnar#6164
it said I was on a fork, reorg of like 156 blocks so it shut down the daemon. I'm thinking I tried to play before it sync'd

@TonyL that game where you had 7800+ keystrokes but died on level 1... toward the end of the replay you are fighting against H:
(h) hp.21
(s) hp.21
(j) hp.21
(s) hp.21
(j) hp.21
(s) hp.21
(h) hp.21
(s) hp.21
(j) hp.15
(s) hp.15
(h) hp.11
(k) hp.11
(s) hp.11
(h) hp.5
(s) hp.5
but duting the fight you are searching and hitting in different directions and then the H killed you


[20-Feb-19 11:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so I think what happened was one of the keystrokes files didnt get saved?


[20-Feb-19 11:29 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess it is time to add keystrokes tx queueing


[20-Feb-19 11:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I didn't search and quit with 5 hp (maybe autofight until someone is dead: f + direction arrow saving some special way)


[20-Feb-19 11:34 PM] jl777c#5810
is it first time you used autofight?


[20-Feb-19 11:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Nope, I'm using it for a week already


[20-Feb-19 11:34 PM] jl777c#5810
for now I made the keystrokes buffer 8x bigger, so even this entire game would have fit in a single keystrokes tx

Auto-fight allows to clear dungeons super fast üòÉ


[20-Feb-19 11:35 PM] jl777c#5810
that creates other issues, but until I get tx queuing fixed, it seems a decent workaround


[20-Feb-19 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL can you gather a lot of rogue.530623577502174316.0 keystrokes files (from extract) and make one big file out of it? just make a zip file for me out of all the extracted files you can get

how did you do that for windows btw? just replace it will komodo-cli.exe?


[21-Feb-19 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
you can use that one as it does the komodo-cli.exe

@ca333 does that build have komodo-cli.exe commands included? or should I use .exe from packaged release for that?

@Alright I've installed precompiled pip deps from wheels and then built --onefile executable  by PyInstaller (to question about TUI)


[21-Feb-19 01:57 AM] ca333#0333
@Alright that build i posted you is the "winyfied" rogue game using komodo-cli.exe - it will work on WIN. you d need to just add it to the dir you have komodod/cli.exe in.


[21-Feb-19 01:57 AM] ca333#0333
James will notify us when he has curl migration done - by then we will run another build test and merge all WIN related fixes to James (official) repo.


[21-Feb-19 01:58 AM] ca333#0333
if you re interested in the particular fixes: multiOS_nocurses branch has most WIN specific fixes puhsed.


[21-Feb-19 02:00 AM] Alright#0419
Thanks, will start playing with it


[21-Feb-19 02:00 AM] Alright#0419
btw @jl777c making a wrapper named `komodo-cli` worked on linux. This might be an easier solution for curl, not sure


[21-Feb-19 02:01 AM] Alright#0419
would just require a similar script for each OS

FSM branch has curl based rogue dapp. if to build with win, it could just work. also it is more reliable with playerdata and kinder too. regardless of game, your playerdata should be saved

Why I not see in TOP 20?


[21-Feb-19 06:21 AM] figgy132#7531
has anyone noticed the wee bug in rogue_tui.py when you lose your warrior because you have tried to mount armor (W) before moving? game becomes unrepsonsive but lets you press ctrl+c which gives you the quit prompt - this lets you leave the game cleanly but warrior is gone (no kills or gold)


[21-Feb-19 06:23 AM] SHossain#0007
@LuckyShadow are you running daemon with pubkey?


[21-Feb-19 06:57 AM] Strob#3417
How can we see the specs of our warrior?


[21-Feb-19 06:58 AM] Strob#3417
When  we finish a game what happen with the gold? Can we see it somewhere or are just the top 20 saved?


[21-Feb-19 07:04 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@Strob  it gets converted to ROGUE


[21-Feb-19 07:04 AM] Cryptofist#7504
As far as specs, in the TUI you can "check warriors" [2] and it will list the warrior tokens

only the char is stored on chain. game is seperate. Just got in touch with my mate, hes keen to dev his game with this too, We already had the idea ages ago, use the blockchain to store all found items and characters. Tradable items with the games crypto currency. Hes made a few RPGs n things, with like super simple games engines 2D, but we all start somewhere. I think this stuff  can be leveraged in a really smart way to monetize the game, without loot boxes, or micro transactions, and seill be free to play üòâ

Bailout not broadcasted yet by some reason. Let's wait. Repeating this in a loop. Is it possible to do a bailout transaction manually?

I have a lot of *.0,  * .pack  ,*.player files generated in my folder, is that normal?

So even though TUI hung up, I tried bailout command in a new terminal using the game txid. Seems it worked. This gave me a new game txid, though not sure yet what to do with this info

Hello,

I have had an error  when i try to rogue windows bundle : Error: Cannot find the Zcash network parameters in the following directory:
"C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\ZcashParams"
Please run 'zcash-fetch-params' or './zcutil/fetch-params.sh' and then restart.

How can i solve this problem?


[22-Feb-19 01:24 AM] TonyL#3577
@anyyna As temporary solution you might download my zcash params bootstrap from http://159.69.45.70/zcash_params.zip and unzip all files to `"C:\Users\User\AppData\Roaming\ZcashParams"` (if there is no folder - just create it)


[22-Feb-19 01:24 AM] anyyna#1521
@TonyL thank you i will try

[22-Feb-19 01:28 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
I bailed at level10, lots of gold


[22-Feb-19 01:28 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
It worked for several bailouts immediately before


[22-Feb-19 01:29 AM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22<GAME_TXID>%22]\"``` for manual bailout


[22-Feb-19 01:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Your screenshot not looks like hang


[22-Feb-19 01:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Sometimes rogue just breaking terminal


[22-Feb-19 01:30 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Then how to restart after bailout cmd


[22-Feb-19 01:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Start new session in new terminal window, if bailout was made with warrior alive - you'll see your warrior in your warriors list after bailout tx is mined


[22-Feb-19 01:31 AM] TonyL#3577
And on singleplayer/multiplayer game start you'll be asked if you want to use him


[22-Feb-19 01:37 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Option 2 on the TUI has not worked for me. Even after successful bailouts earlier. Option 6 was allowing me to enter player Id earlier but doesn't see player.  my manual bailout didn't work to save I guess. For the manual bailout I used the txid the tui provided from the new single player training game successful created txid


[22-Feb-19 01:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me check, maybe something was changed from daemon side


[22-Feb-19 01:39 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
This to time option 2 worked, but it is a brand new player


[22-Feb-19 01:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Option two just printing your warriors from `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib players 17`


[22-Feb-19 01:40 AM] TonyL#3577
So if your warrior wasnt saved by bailout or bailout transaction not mined yet it not showing anything

Just do the following after daemon start:

.\komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE validateaddress put_address_from_call_above_here
You'll get `pubkey:` ```
Stop daemon by .\komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE stop
and for next start change  -pubkey=03c0dff4c4ec057f256251c4a6c5dae92696ff956c214253d052af9287e6e21cb1 to -pubkey=pubkey_which_you_get_from_validateaddress

@jl777c thanks for clarifying curious about the implementation of this proof of concept, gonna dig in to the code. Very cool


[22-Feb-19 06:19 AM] TonyL#3577
@Hansie Please ensure that your ROGUE daemon is in sync. This error happening when daemon isn't sync


[22-Feb-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it used to send keystrokes tx every new level, but if any had an error, it would corrupt the playback so i changed to to be a big buffer for now.


[22-Feb-19 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
once a reliability layer is added to keystrokes tx, we can do more frequent keystrokes tx, though if it is getting very popular will need all the 200/tx sec capacity


[22-Feb-19 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
I guess we can always launch more fungible chains


[22-Feb-19 06:28 AM] Hansie#5439
@TonyL Thanks for your quick support. The app suggested to copy the ROGUE.conf file. This seemed to also help besides waiting for the deamon to sync. I can play now!


[22-Feb-19 06:31 AM] TonyL#3577
You're most welcome! @Hansie Oh, I forgot about this new requirement of config copying üòÉ Hope you can enjoy dungeon adventures now

what rogue CC uses is the actual gameplay keystrokes, it is pretty direct and literal proof of gameplay

I like that, "literal proof of gameplay".

Hi I'm working on adding the "What is proof of Gameplay?" section  to the ANN now.
``what rogue CC uses is the actual gameplay keystrokes, it is pretty direct and literal proof of gameplay``
What does RogueCC use the gameplay keystrokes for specifically? Any other tidbits that should go here to inform users of PoG ?


[22-Feb-19 09:46 PM] gcharang#6833
RogueCC rewards coins for submitting verifiable proof of game play with some limitations. like dead characters don't get ROGUE etc.,


[22-Feb-19 09:47 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Thank you @gcharang , I had "uses the keystrokes to convert game gold to ROGUE" but didnt think that was right, this helps a lot thank you!


[22-Feb-19 09:47 PM] gtm#2812
i was under the impression that ‚Äúproof of gameplay‚Äù is showing that you‚Äôve put in time (via playing via keystrokes etc) to be rewarded with gold which can than be exchanged for rogue coins


[22-Feb-19 09:49 PM] Cryptofist#7504
``Rogue CC rewards ROGUE to players by verifying the gameplay keystrokes, it quite literally is Proof of Gameplay. ``


[22-Feb-19 09:50 PM] gcharang#6833
And that happens when a character bailsout or wins, gold collected is converted to ROGUE in a pre-determined ratio for different modes


[22-Feb-19 09:50 PM] Cryptofist#7504
On bailout (quiting while alive) the game automataically converts your in game gold to ROGUE


[22-Feb-19 09:50 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Now that part I DO know. üòÉ


[22-Feb-19 09:51 PM] Cryptofist#7504

for now since game validation is only 90% and not 100%,   i made it so zombies are allowed. the dead can be ressurrected. not sure if this will remain this way, but without it people were losing valid players with lots of time put in


[22-Feb-19 10:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if the daemon is dead, nothing will work, that should be no surprise and it can be any sort of error

ROGUE started on node that was having `make` trouble.  Stuck on block 196.  Will try again.


[23-Feb-19 06:04 AM] jl777c#5810
196 means you didnt include the rogue libcc.so

think of the libcc file like a sim card for a phone

yes it is strange, i will need to investigate this specifically later today

are other times working ok?


[24-Feb-19 02:08 AM] ronyi#5719
I have noticed many times. I think is a high warrior and/or level bug/issue (above rouge lvl7).  Unfortunately, I don't know more.

Couple days ago, I had a high level warrior, was at dungeon lvl 10 , had around 2500 gold, two handed sword. Did a bailout, lost the guy. Haven't been back that deep since then.

I also have a warrior, got killed,screen showed the tombstone, however, for some reason I'm still able to play with him. And you can also find him listed for sale. The name is 'Captain Kirk is Dead' and he's a dashing zombie character that might not be killable, all for the low price of 1 rogue

Can someone please provide the cli command to list the current address that I'm using, the TUI doesn't seem to list current address. I'm trying to verify that the Rogue I'm collecting( per the getbalance cli) is listed on the explorer.

Hmm interesting. I'm still trying to understand the bailout mechanics. I started a new game with warrior the gingerninja, spawned lv1 next to an H. Got hit before equipping armour taking hp to 6. Bailedout. No tombstone death screen. Warrior is gone, not selectable. On another note, my zombie warrior Captain Kirk has disappeared (that I expected)


[24-Feb-19 09:58 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Of note, gingerninja was at least lvl7


[24-Feb-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
death tx needs to confirm


[24-Feb-19 10:08 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
So it seems that a bailout in middle of battle still allows monster to hit and is no guarantee of safe exit


[24-Feb-19 10:10 AM] TonyL#3577
I guess "0 monster kills, 0 gold" (in such cases warrior counting as dead) validation is still here and thats why this one (gingerninja) died

Just bailedout on dungeon lv 7. Had around 1200 gold, lvl 6 character, no monsters around. Character name 'elephant butt' has disappeared. No option to restart with this warrior, and not on warrior list.

[24-Feb-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577

Btw tried to make OSX TUI more compatible by building on older OSX but overkilled a little bit lol. Installed 10.6 OSX - but wasn't able to install deps on it because it's  way too legacy

how to save the game ?

There is no ingame safe - to save your warrior quit the rogue first by `shift + q` then y+enter


[24-Feb-19 01:19 PM] TonyL#3577
After it wait for one block and broadcast bailout for gametxid

As soon as order filling transaction is mined you should have more ROGUE

hmm not sure it worked then.  Of course I was never able to see the warrior from tui option 14  to verify that was even for sale. I've updated twice since then, and am pretty sure still have same address. That particular warrior did die and produce a tombstone screen so maybe something wacky is/was already happening.

```
ROGUEers who haven't updated daemon yet - you can do it by bundle downloading (it have pre-compiled daemon with latest fixes inside)
On non-updated  version without todays fixes your warriors might not save```

Windows is coming

In next version will update TUI to do these steps automatically, but for now you have to do it to start play. It's steps if you not played ROGUE before on this PC, if you did - you only have to copy .conf file and start daemon from archive with same params as you used before. : 
```
Unzip
Start ROGUE chain, get valid for wallet pubkey, stop the daemon
Copy ROGUE.conf to the folder with unzipped files
Start the daemon with valid pubkey
Wait for chain synchronization```

if the keystrokes tx isnt saved, it is as if you are died

if you are dead, all is gone


[24-Feb-19 09:27 PM] jl777c#5810
now that we improved the player saving, i think it is more due to missing keystrokes files.


[24-Feb-19 09:28 PM] jl777c#5810
I added a log of the keystrokes tx being sent to the keystrokes.log, so the GUI can check to make sure it is broadcast properly before doing the bailout

what about the amount of ROGUE? Is that related to keystroke? I just played 2 consecutive games, quit while still alive, each with over 1000+ gold, but I only get 0.0003 ROGUE each

[24-Feb-19 10:00 PM] jl777c#5810
0.0003 is the consolation prize on death, means no keystrokes file was sent


[24-Feb-19 10:02 PM] wookie#7663
should I do: 
git checkout jl777
git pull

to get the keystrokes.log?


[24-Feb-19 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL gameinfo shows the baton, which would be the registration txid at first, then as each new keystrokes tx is made, it updates the baton. maybe what is happening is that the tx goes into the mempool, but then it doesnt confirm? querying for the batontxid and doing a getrawtransaction/sendrawtransaction until it confirms should make things a lot more reliable


[24-Feb-19 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
@wookie once you do the bailout without any keystrokes file, the player is dead. so the TUI needs to make sure to never send a bailout if the baton is the registration txid


[24-Feb-19 10:04 PM] wookie#7663
Is that something that needs to be fixed in the TUI? Or is this something I can do? Sorry, I'm not a coder, don't really understand what needs to be done.


[24-Feb-19 10:09 PM] jl777c#5810
if you are using TUI, wait for new TUI.

[25-Feb-19 12:28 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c`maybe what is happening is that the tx goes into the mempool, but then it doesnt confirm?` - for game where I lost warrior not new entry / entry for this gametxid was created in keystrokes.log at all. Is it creating after transaction mined only? If I can't see the keystroke attempt I can't rebroadcast it or ensure that last keystroke is on blockchain.

Cases about which players reported seems the same. Will try to reproduce it reliably.
I think if I'll track the games baton I'll able to detect the cases when only registration txid is broadcasted.

- TUI checking for ROGUE.conf in daemon folder and copying it if needed
- TUI waiting for chain sync before the start
- TUI setting valid pubkey automatically if no pubkey set in daemon start params```

are there any other paths to get a warrior that you own?

@ronyi you should also be able to rescue your cancelled warrior

Place sell order with your warrior and buy my warrior in marketplace, after this warrior killed, but is in my warrior list.

Good morning everyone!  
Jl777 please let me know when you officially decide on a winner and when you would like to run the next contest. I was thinking in another week or two, so we can make sure we have the installers for Windows and OSX üíØ%.


[25-Feb-19 05:58 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Has anyone here played a multi-player game yet?


[25-Feb-19 05:58 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, we need to make sure all the major bugs are fix and we have installers for all the OS

is anybody else close to ronyi as far as totals?


[25-Feb-19 06:03 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I doubt it (good going @ronyi  !!) *but* maybe someone else will chime in within the next few hours. Although, I do think they would be excited to chime in with their totals right away. they may not be up yet....

[25-Feb-19 06:43 AM] ronyi#5719
@Cryptofist In this game we are always in danger, you have to pay attention, especially on a small level. If I create a new game with new warrior I starting slowly and farming (rings, potions, scrolls and food! High level warriors is always hungry) upgrade weapon and armor (Lvl.1-3). If my warrior level= 4-5 I starting to use auto-attack and continuously farming on lvl 1-6 and upgrading my equipments. My faviorits item in high warrior level(6-10) slow digestion ring and searching ring and continuously farming on lvl 1-12. After I trying to reaching lvl 21, but after lvl 13 anything can happen (someting hit you and dead). Not easy to find good equipments. Map scroll is very usefull in the maze. I have now lvl 9 warrior and and I haven't found slow digestion ring, searching ring yet. I never find amulet, but trying.

@jl777c Hmm my warriors scanner deciding if warrior dead or alive by:
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE gettxout playertxid 1
If output is none I count warrior as dead

I bought this one ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib playerinfo 17 \"[%2277549e285d63e408f98448da0b55ac2285a1913f8cda4510a54746b003ba7d8e%22]\"```- he looks very alive (persists in my players list and I can choose him to start the game)

But `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE gettxout 77549e285d63e408f98448da0b55ac2285a1913f8cda4510a54746b003ba7d8e 1` return nothing 

Is it might be connected to trading that this output is spent?

yes, always better to adapt to existing than be hardcoded


[25-Feb-19 08:49 AM] ronyi#5719
If quit my warrior with full HP(32 or 50 or ...) and start a new game this warrior HP always 12.

yes, but doesnt it retain the max? so after a bit of time it goes back to the max


[25-Feb-19 08:54 AM] ronyi#5719
no. If this warrior(with 12HP) "born" beside "H", very likely to die. No armor no weapon, first hit and dead.

and no space for dressing


[25-Feb-19 08:55 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Need to equip W + w and usually by then one more hit and you die.


[25-Feb-19 08:58 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I suppose the game normally starts at 12 on a new game, so... I assume there would have to be a whole lot of coding to have the token determine that number when starting ....


[25-Feb-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
you should gain a hp every 10 steps or so


[25-Feb-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
run 100 steps and you can have armor


[25-Feb-19 09:25 AM] ronyi#5719
And run another enemy hand.


[25-Feb-19 09:26 AM] ronyi#5719
very rare case, but possible to die

Both are alive


[25-Feb-19 10:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Ahh I think I understood - have to check vout for playertxid not tokentxid


[25-Feb-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[25-Feb-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
tokentxid is only unspent until the first usage


[25-Feb-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
playertxid is the most recent


[25-Feb-19 10:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Confusion was mostly because I'm scanning tokenlist


[25-Feb-19 10:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Hard to abstract from tokens


[25-Feb-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
tokenid -> gametxid->baton ?


[25-Feb-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
or just find the spenttxid for the token till you get to where it is unspent


[25-Feb-19 10:50 AM] TonyL#3577
tokenid -> playerinfo -> getrawtransaction -> gettxout


[25-Feb-19 10:51 AM] TonyL#3577
I thought about such option


[25-Feb-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
tokenid/vout, find where it is spent using spentindex


[25-Feb-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
iterate until it is either consumed with a register or you find the unspent


[25-Feb-19 11:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Thanks! Will try to add such iterations now.
 Had not correct logic before which assumed that by call `playerinfo 17 tokenid` I get most actual `playertxid`


[25-Feb-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess starting with the tokenlist and then tracing each tokenid to the unspent will get the current playertxid, though some of them could well be in DEX ask


[25-Feb-19 11:02 AM] TonyL#3577
For dex I'm just not checking if it "dead"


[25-Feb-19 11:02 AM] TonyL#3577
If it's actually dead it's not possible to buy/sell it on dex since it's burned


[25-Feb-19 11:03 AM] TonyL#3577
So dex scanner worked correct before I wonder (I can buy warrior with different tokenid / playertxid and detect orders for it)


[25-Feb-19 11:04 AM] TonyL#3577
But usual scanner with death check detected before only warriors with same tokentxid/playertxid


[25-Feb-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt playerinfo show both the tokenid and playertxid?


[25-Feb-19 11:05 AM] TonyL#3577
It show, but if I call `playerinfo tokeind` it showing me playertxid which was on warrior creation moment


[25-Feb-19 11:05 AM] TonyL#3577
other words it's always the same


[25-Feb-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i see. what about gameinfo


[25-Feb-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
for the game the token was created from


[25-Feb-19 11:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Will try to find gametxids now


[25-Feb-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the gameinfo interated the tokenid to the latest playertxid


[25-Feb-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
at worst iterating the spentindex will get you to the latest unspent for a tokenid


[25-Feb-19 11:08 AM] TonyL#3577
But I don't have gameinfo for all games on chain - all I have is `tokenlist`


[25-Feb-19 11:08 AM] TonyL#3577
And tokenids


[25-Feb-19 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
I can print the gametxid for a playerdata if it isnt already there


[25-Feb-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
then tokenid -> gametxid -> playertxid


[25-Feb-19 11:09 AM] TonyL#3577
It would be great yes


[25-Feb-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
I will able to iterate into the games


[25-Feb-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
And find last one


[25-Feb-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
But now there is no gametxid in playerinfo


[25-Feb-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
now there is


[25-Feb-19 11:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Thanks!


[25-Feb-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
all the data is there, i just am not passing it through with all rpc calls

Hm on the last frame in replay you're frozen by icemonster - but not dead at all


[25-Feb-19 12:14 PM] ronyi#5719
Intresting, but i can't quit in this time, so it should be dead i think.

Oh have idea how to speedup Rogue TUI (SUDOKU-like) - spin node which constantly creating new singleplayer games when such pending games quantity is <100 let's say. And then in TUI on singleplayer game start I'll just detect such games and register player to some pseudo-random one from this list (exactly how in Komodoku).
So player will start game just in a few seconds (should be must-have for mobile platforms and etc.)

@TonyL would cutting block time to 30 seconds make a significance difference?


[25-Feb-19 01:15 PM] TonyL#3577
It will make waiting time 2 times less than now
But in general my TUI just not very clever.
If add such pre-generating of single games + thread which will do bailout sending procedure in background - it's possible to make singleplayer game process without waiting at all


[25-Feb-19 01:16 PM] TonyL#3577
You'll need to wait for bailout to be mined only if want to re-use this warrior in the next game


[25-Feb-19 01:17 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Is it possible to make a new loading screen with the TUI ? @TonyL  Or  would that need to be something separate?


[25-Feb-19 01:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Since TUI using for testing - I'm printing information which allows me to debug/understand picture of problem in case of error on user side


[25-Feb-19 01:18 PM] Alright#0419
can you make new game txs for the user with any pubkey? Then they use it?


[25-Feb-19 01:18 PM] Alright#0419
is this the idea @TonyL ?


[25-Feb-19 01:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep


[25-Feb-19 01:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Not matters who created the singleplayer game transaction


[25-Feb-19 01:19 PM] Alright#0419
maybe do it in coinbase?


[25-Feb-19 01:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Anybody can play it


[25-Feb-19 01:19 PM] Alright#0419
every block would have a new game tx?


[25-Feb-19 01:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Just permanently will be let's say 100 already mined singleplayer games


[25-Feb-19 01:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Same way Sudoku working


[25-Feb-19 01:20 PM] TonyL#3577
There are thousands of pre-generated games - and on new game start I'm just randomly choosing one in GUI


[25-Feb-19 01:21 PM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist And if implement such games generation there will not be a loading screen (this "Waiting for gametxid to be mined") at all


[25-Feb-19 01:22 PM] Alright#0419
can likely just run a blocknotify script that checks oracle, if there are <100, add some until there are 100 then update oracle


[25-Feb-19 01:22 PM] Alright#0419
TUI reads oracle, picks one and starts


[25-Feb-19 01:22 PM] Alright#0419
it's quite a bit of spam added to the chain, but it's a good idea


[25-Feb-19 01:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Why need oracle? I can scan `games ["pending"]` list for singleplayer games and know exact quantity in any time


[25-Feb-19 01:23 PM] Alright#0419
how do you know you generated it?


[25-Feb-19 01:23 PM] Alright#0419
and you're not just taking someone else's?


[25-Feb-19 01:23 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I just really liked the loading screens from the old games. üòÉ


[25-Feb-19 01:25 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm not sure if problem of re-usage someones freely generated game (it will happens super not-often) worth connection of oracle


[25-Feb-19 01:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Nothing stops you now make a script and permanently steal games


[25-Feb-19 01:26 PM] TonyL#3577
So CLI users will not able to play because your script registers faster

[25-Feb-19 01:28 PM] Alright#0419
why does new game tx need to be confirmed before using it?


[25-Feb-19 01:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Because register call will not generate transaction if it's not mined - I'm not sure about exact reasons of such implementation


[25-Feb-19 01:30 PM] Alright#0419
think maybe it's using blockhash as entropy, not sure that's implemented though


[25-Feb-19 01:30 PM] Alright#0419
if that's not the case, I'm not sure why it couldn't spend from mempool


[25-Feb-19 01:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Anyway testing of warriors/progress not-saving in long games, testing of dex features and especially multiplayer games seems more important on this point than this clue with pre-generated games


[25-Feb-19 01:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Multiplayer almost untested at all


[25-Feb-19 01:34 PM] Alright#0419
progress not saving sounds like rogue app failing to communicate via rpc

[25-Feb-19 01:36 PM] TonyL#3577
There were many different problems, most interesting was when progress not saved because of `Q+n` keys (rogue thought that any Q is game finish)

@TonyL where do I unzip your 0.11n update to? komodo/src folder?


[25-Feb-19 01:46 PM] TonyL#3577
@wookie  it have daemon inside, so no matters


[25-Feb-19 01:46 PM] TonyL#3577
Just start the daemon from zip


[25-Feb-19 01:47 PM] TonyL#3577
In zip there are komodo daemon, rogue and TUI


[25-Feb-19 01:49 PM] TonyL#3577
So you may just stop your current daemon and start daemon from bundle if your daemon isnt updated (daemon in bundle built with all latest fixes except of order cancelled warriors usage in game)

@Strob ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%22gametxid%22,%22pubkey%22]\"``` after execution in output you'll see the command to start replay

Current gold cashing formula in singleplayer is:
`extracted_rogue_satoshies = gold * gold * dungeon_level * 10 `

@TonyL pushed version that displays gametxid and batontxid for playerinfo. You can start with any playertxid (from tokenid to latest unspent) and it will trace the spends to find where the unspent token is and that is the batontxid. it should then be easy to see if that tx is a DEX tx or not

Thanks @jl777c ! Will try to play with this new info to fix warriors scanner


[26-Feb-19 03:13 AM] jl777c#5810
based on what I know, it seems keystrokes tx reliability is the only core issue left?


[26-Feb-19 03:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Seems so - there are few reports that dead warrior is not dead (I checked replay and just few last keystrokes not included) + this keystrokes "corrupting" with death

yes, both cases of alive players dead and dead players alive are explained by missed keystrokes in the middle and missed keystrokes at the end

@TonyL yep. My colleague died and I seem alive, but I died playing the game


[26-Feb-19 04:51 AM] TonyL#3577
If he died faster you have to ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib highlander 17 \"[%22470951049fa24bf5800d3b36c22dd3391ff13690688f538af576ff32117c32f3%22]\"```


[26-Feb-19 04:52 AM] TonyL#3577
TUI can't detect cases when first died player (in case of more than 2 player - it's second left alive) bailout not mined yet - so let's say if you both died in the same block or even 1 block difference maybe - it will try to broadcast bailout instead of highlander. Have an idea how to improve it

How do we manually send a warrior? An off the books OTC tx..


[26-Feb-19 07:40 AM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist  for OTC trading and gifts: ```[3] Transfer warrior to other pubkey```


[26-Feb-19 07:43 AM] Cryptofist#7504
In CLI though... and send ROGUE too.


[26-Feb-19 07:44 AM] Cryptofist#7504
If that's in the manual play guide I'll take a look. Just realized I never went through that entirely.


[26-Feb-19 07:45 AM] TonyL#3577
In cli just use:
to transfer warrior `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE tokentransfer playertokenid destpubkey 1`
to transfer funds `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE sendtoaddress address amount`


[26-Feb-19 07:50 AM] Cryptofist#7504

For what to break or what I was trying to do ?


[26-Feb-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
"bought a warrior, went right back in, warrior still there, it didn't let me re-buy though."
is that a bug report?


[26-Feb-19 08:37 AM] Cryptofist#7504
For what I was trying to do... 
I wanted to see what would happened if I tried to buy a warrior twice before the mined tx and what would happen.  

I bought a warrior ,  went back to the main TUI menu, I back into the selling section, that warrior was still there, but when I entered the same bidtx  it  gave me "something went wrong"    ... so either I was too slow or it works exactly how it is supposed to.


[26-Feb-19 08:37 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Not really, I was trying to see if i could find one


[26-Feb-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
did the purchase confirm?


[26-Feb-19 08:37 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Yep


[26-Feb-19 08:47 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Tried again, the warrior will stay in the sales list for just a bit after successful purchase,  you can not buy it then.  The next time in the sales section the warrior is gone.


[26-Feb-19 08:48 AM] Cryptofist#7504
and i bought a bunch of warriors...


[26-Feb-19 08:48 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Im going to try the sell side now.


[26-Feb-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810

Is it not possible to make a  0 sell ?


[26-Feb-19 08:52 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I did place one with 0.0000001 successfully.


[26-Feb-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it needs to be a non-zero price, otherwise its not a sale, just a free transfer


[26-Feb-19 08:53 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok.  The idea behind it was adding freebie warriors  to the marketplace.


[26-Feb-19 08:54 AM] Cryptofist#7504
So what I might do is offer some free coins to purchase warriors in the dex.


[26-Feb-19 09:02 AM] Cryptofist#7504

isnt that all you need?


[26-Feb-19 09:29 AM] TonyL#3577

[26-Feb-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so you figured it out?


[26-Feb-19 09:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Separate all parts are working - but in complex I'm getting copies by some reason. Just need to debug propertly


[26-Feb-19 09:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah, I think I was confused on some point because many of warriors with "Ronyi" name were in TOP20


[26-Feb-19 09:54 AM] TonyL#3577
12 `Ronyi` in top20 üòÉ

And some have quite similar level/experience


[26-Feb-19 09:56 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Yeah. There's many. Lol


[26-Feb-19 09:56 AM] TonyL#3577
So initially I've messed with `Player txid: ` `Token txid: ` prints and thought that there are copies of same warrior


[26-Feb-19 09:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Now I fixed prints and can see that they have different tokeinds


[26-Feb-19 09:59 AM] Cryptofist#7504
**side note** can we use an address to get a list of warriors from that specific address only?  I think it would be awesome if we were able to share wallets to have others look through one person's warriors specfically.


[26-Feb-19 10:00 AM] Cryptofist#7504

At the moment way (which I know at least) to check somebody list is to start the daemon with his pubkey in -pubkey= param


[26-Feb-19 10:02 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Cool. Just thinking from a player community perspective , I thought that would be neat. Anyway we can showcase the Dex too.


[26-Feb-19 10:03 AM] TonyL#3577
[12] printing all-all warriors on chain


[26-Feb-19 10:04 AM] Cryptofist#7504
It's overwhelming is why I thought of single address.


[26-Feb-19 10:04 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Interactive for players to look through each other's lists


[26-Feb-19 10:04 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Like trade binders in magic.


[26-Feb-19 10:06 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm very unlikely will make any filters and etc. in TUI since it will not help to testing
Imo it's possible to implement on DEX GUI side


[26-Feb-19 10:06 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Just an idea for later if possible.


[26-Feb-19 10:06 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Good point.


[26-Feb-19 10:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Possible to display only warriors with needed levels lets say


[26-Feb-19 10:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Or even with specific item - GUI backend can sort it


[26-Feb-19 10:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Display warriors for specific pubkey (maybe new RPC call is needed)


[26-Feb-19 10:08 AM] Cryptofist#7504
That would be neat. The digestion ring can fetch a good price on any level Warrior.


[26-Feb-19 10:09 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I guess what I was originally thinking was something like [14]. Search address for warrior tokens


[26-Feb-19 10:09 AM] TonyL#3577
When you have a list with all players and all inventories - you may do whatever you like with em


[26-Feb-19 10:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Version with fixed top20 rating is in master.
It forming rating in --- 4.7629921436309814 seconds ---,  scanning through batons added some time - but with caching on application side it shouldn't be problem + my scanning algo can be improved I bet

[26-Feb-19 10:14 AM] TonyL#3577
To place your warrior on 20 place of rating  you need some with `Experience: 1539`+

@Cryptofist If you're available now we may try some multiplayer on latest TUI from master branch - I've changed some suspicious moments


[26-Feb-19 10:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Played short game against myself - on one node was executed highlander, on other one bailout - so I wonder it's playable

Missing a few stuff.


[26-Feb-19 11:23 AM] TonyL#3577
It's possible to carry `strength * 2` items


[26-Feb-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
you should be able to do an addressutxos rpc call with the address for a pubkeys CC asset address


[26-Feb-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
you can get that address with tokensaddress pubkey


[26-Feb-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
then filter the 1 satoshi outputs


[26-Feb-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess going into DEX will change the address though...


[26-Feb-19 11:25 AM] ronyi#5719
I restored strenght, but nothing.


[26-Feb-19 11:26 AM] ronyi#5719
If i bailout my stuff is gone i think.


[26-Feb-19 11:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I think so


[26-Feb-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
proper pack strategy requires dumping excess items before bailing out


[26-Feb-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
its like trying to take too much with you in a parachute. stuff just falls into the abyss


[26-Feb-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810 (pinned)
we should document this and any other gameplay changes that have been made

Oh a lot of good ronyi's rings are in abyss now

the rings magics would intefere with each other if they are too close

Aha!


[26-Feb-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810

I'm a little sad now. üòÑ it is difficult to collect two identical rings, but thanks. Before i bailout, must pay attention on strenght and pocket size.

There should be some notification in new rogue GUIs I wonder

```Dump excess items before bailout. Strength X2 = your pack size. This means if you lose strength, you lose items automatically with no decision by you.```


[26-Feb-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
yes a page of the rules changes and some specific warnings. on Q,'y' i will need to add a pause to get the keystrokes file sent out, though at that point it is too late to change things

next to a emu


[26-Feb-19 12:09 PM] TonyL#3577
I thought it should be available for start only on Start height: 34604 height

[26-Feb-19 12:09 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok let me start too


[26-Feb-19 12:09 PM] ronyi#5719
yes


[26-Feb-19 12:10 PM] Cryptofist#7504
the game is so hard that the strategy of not playing is the best strat. Anyway we can kill off an inactive account from a multip;ayer game?

[26-Feb-19 12:11 PM] Cryptofist#7504
if we quit, do we still get the gold -> ROGUE


[26-Feb-19 12:11 PM] Cryptofist#7504
hmmm


[26-Feb-19 12:11 PM] Cryptofist#7504
60 is too long I think


[26-Feb-19 12:11 PM] TonyL#3577
if start with not blank warriors games should be more interesting


[26-Feb-19 12:11 PM] Cryptofist#7504
indeed


[26-Feb-19 12:12 PM] TonyL#3577
But for now we want to test not long ones anyway


[26-Feb-19 12:12 PM] Cryptofist#7504
im  playing did anyone else hop on this one?


[26-Feb-19 12:12 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm in game too


[26-Feb-19 12:12 PM] Cryptofist#7504

ok, i will investigate game becb0154d6dc7f425e7b6d915ed38aefad5b615cef02484e0fe706231e8779dc


[26-Feb-19 10:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the recent bug fixes changed the detection of last man standing


[27-Feb-19 12:14 AM] jl777c#5810
looking at the gametxid details, i see all three of the 0.01 vouts are spent, that means registered tx happened and 2 of the three 0.0001 vouts are spent, so indeed 2 of the 3 players are finished


[27-Feb-19 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
to help understand the newgame tx has a special set of vouts:
vout0 0.0001 for the highlander -> this allows resolution of a race in the unlikely event two players have amulet. (yes this is the level of detail that is needed to get things 100% working)
vout1... voutN -> these are 0.01 vouts to fund the keystrokes tx and registration spends it. it implements the max players and if a race condition, the one that gets their registration tx confirmed is the one that registers.
voutN+1 to vout2*N -> these are spent when the game is finished so at a glace we can tell the game state and it ties in game completion for a player to the cashout and creating playerdata, thus preventing it from being done multiple times.

@Deleted User some useful info for you in the above about vout usage


[27-Feb-19 12:19 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, will investigate why the gameinfo isnt seeing that gametxid properly


[27-Feb-19 03:02 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Just in case this info is helpful.
I confirmed with everyone that they had died and then quit out of the game.


[27-Feb-19 03:04 AM] jl777c#5810
all three? the third seems to be pending. in anycase dont do anything with that game till I fix the bug. some other distractions delaying me


[27-Feb-19 03:08 AM] ronyi#5719
I died early. üòÑ

[27-Feb-19 03:17 AM] CrisF#3405
I imagine someone will make a betting dapp to bet on tournaments and even games at some point.  
Seems I would have lost a few KMD with your early death @ronyi  :yassinheartbroken:


[27-Feb-19 03:19 AM] ronyi#5719
I think betting dapp is good, maybe Rogue betting dapp? üòÑ but i never betting


[27-Feb-19 03:19 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I was last standing, so I quit at the end. The other two died. Take your time. I won't mess with it more.


[27-Feb-19 03:20 AM] CrisF#3405
Imagine something that could cover many blockchain games...


[27-Feb-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
rogue multiplayer is a betting dapp already


[27-Feb-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
until I fix the keystrokes reliability, keystrokes and thus game status will be unreliable

oh... yes it would be possible


[27-Feb-19 03:21 AM] jl777c#5810
bet on your favorite player to win sort of thing?


[27-Feb-19 03:21 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes


[27-Feb-19 03:21 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Aye.


[27-Feb-19 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
I will think about how to do this


[27-Feb-19 03:22 AM] Cryptofist#7504
As far as a broad eSports betting book.... that's been a popular thing to try and do .... and ICO. I still haven't seen one though.


[27-Feb-19 03:22 AM] CrisF#3405
Imagine sports results could be oraclized.  But these games have the proof and info right there already.


[27-Feb-19 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
bets would need to be placed after all are registered and before any are finished


[27-Feb-19 03:22 AM] ronyi#5719
double or nothing?


[27-Feb-19 03:24 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, before finished.  But if possible to adjust maybe up untill the final 2?


[27-Feb-19 03:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the betting would go into a betpool of all the bets. all the ones that bet on the winner would be able to split it

@ronyi e99ff21564d45e63d10ad71c7c51cd2345ffa79a91791ca2de14542f35d628d3 replay shows you died on level4,likely due to keystrokes of level5 not properly received and using the next levels keystrokes on the wrong level. very likely death results


[27-Feb-19 05:03 AM] jl777c#5810
the keystrokes reliability monster strikes again


[27-Feb-19 05:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i am still working on fixing it


[27-Feb-19 05:09 AM] jl777c#5810
I have pushed various fixes that should make multiplayer mode more reliable. keep a close eye on the numplayers and numalive, openslots fields to make sure it is sane. some complications due to 60 blocks expiration for registration and extending keystrokes

So I can sacrifice another warrior to multiplayer if anyone wants to try.


[27-Feb-19 05:18 AM] ronyi#5719
I think this was a trap. (maybe), but not dead on level4. Thank you.


[27-Feb-19 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, it could be that something about the gameplay looks like death. hard to reproduce. I will hopefully have reliable keystrokes later today


[27-Feb-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
@ronyi I implemented a first level keystrokes reliability. you need to make clean and make the rogue dapp in addition to rebuilding komodod. let me know if it works more reliably


[27-Feb-19 06:53 AM] ronyi#5719

Is the Game txid the same at the end as the begining?


[27-Feb-19 03:19 PM] Cryptofist#7504
theres only one right?


[27-Feb-19 03:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes gametxid is the same in beginning and in bailout print in the end


[27-Feb-19 03:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Do we need to make it to level 12 to count as valid?


[27-Feb-19 03:20 PM] Cryptofist#7504
3 games with a fresh warrior to level 12 is only for the very skilled


[27-Feb-19 03:21 PM] TonyL#3577
```3 - Play 3 long games (dungeon lvl12+) with fresh warrior or warrior re-usage and check if progress saves```


[27-Feb-19 03:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Re-usage is ok


[27-Feb-19 03:21 PM] Cryptofist#7504
If we're testing that bug we might need to save and go back a few times.

[27-Feb-19 08:19 PM] TonyL#3577
So user will just need to execute `./rogue_tui` and if daemon not started it will start it for you.
In such case new player just will need to unzip and execute `./rogue_tui` - two steps to play

pushed fix for osx compiler issue


[27-Feb-19 09:11 PM] jl777c#5810
also, on exit from the program, it will wait for the most recent keystrokes tx to confirm. that can take a few minutes as it waits for new blocks


[27-Feb-19 09:12 PM] jl777c#5810
you can check in keystrokes.log the txid of what it is waiting for confirm. it does a sendrawtransaction in a loop to help it propagate and get mined


[27-Feb-19 09:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so far I have not heard of any keystrokes tx failures, so maybe it is good enough reliability? the next level of reliability will take a lot longer to implement. also not sure if at the end it needs to wait for confirmation


[27-Feb-19 09:19 PM] TonyL#3577
It seems fine.
At the moment I'm just waiting for a next block before bailout - I think I can check if last keystroke for current game have > 0 confirmations and only after it make bailout to make it more reliable


[27-Feb-19 09:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i removed the waiting for last tx at the end of the program as that is indeed something the TUI can do, though the bailout should work even if the keystrokes is in the mempool.


[27-Feb-19 09:21 PM] TonyL#3577
For now TUI can "cut" last keystroke easily I wonder


[27-Feb-19 09:21 PM] jl777c#5810
one trick for a stubborn tx that stays unconfirmed is to sendrawtransaction once per 10 seconds or so until it gets an "already in the blockchain" error


[27-Feb-19 09:21 PM] jl777c#5810
latest also has a rogue.sendlog file it makes to log the results of the sendrawtransctions it does


[27-Feb-19 09:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so if there are troubles, at least there should be a log of it


[27-Feb-19 09:22 PM] jl777c#5810
has the latest seem to make longer games more reliable?


[27-Feb-19 09:22 PM] jl777c#5810

[27-Feb-19 09:22 PM] TonyL#3577

[27-Feb-19 11:29 PM] TonyL#3577
Is it started to behave like this after something specific action/transaction broadcast?


[27-Feb-19 11:30 PM] ronyi#5719
Yes i played a game, but (28, 'Operation timed out after 30001 milliseconds with 0 bytes received'), edca5d578250800e43ab03103c605ab83272f805a966b688337c8fe9e641f43b. Manual bailout failed. I think stopped before i tryed manual bailout.


[27-Feb-19 11:31 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, are you using latest daemon?


[27-Feb-19 11:32 PM] TonyL#3577
It's second report about daemon deadlock already


[27-Feb-19 11:32 PM] ronyi#5719
I think yes, i updated after jl777 pushed fix.


[27-Feb-19 11:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Please check if manual bailout hangs daemon after daemon restart


[27-Feb-19 11:34 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm filling my form atm - but no deadlocks so far


[27-Feb-19 11:36 PM] ronyi#5719
yes, daemon just hanging, i tryed maual bailout without respone. Updating:

Just old warrior and i quti at level 4.


[27-Feb-19 11:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so maybe there is problem with old warriors re-usage or re-usage in general, I'm testing with fresh warriors now. Will try to reproduce on my side

Short games with fresh warriors worked great, 4  games from 4 fine - progress saved even for very low keystokes amount lvl1 game.
UPD: in 5th short game with fresh warrior very alive warrior counted dead by some reason
Starting short games with warriors re-usage

Ouch something really bad happening when re-using warriors, just noticed that they are not saving after re-usage at all
http://rogue.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/dbb8c979b96b5ccd9465a1e6c3f07e9ec684628ae0a5386988d3b1e2a335f33a gold -> rogue conversion paid to my address, but 1 satoshi (warrior) gone to address which not belongs me, so warrior not appeared in my players list


[28-Feb-19 01:11 AM] ronyi#5719
I dare not play a long game üòÑ


[28-Feb-19 01:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, all my 3 from 3 reused warriors not appeared in my players list after bailout (gold was converted to ROGUE like a they survived and sent to my address, warrior token was sent to address which not belongs me)


[28-Feb-19 01:12 AM] TonyL#3577
http://rogue.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RTneCmAMhv54ht7qxXycuSVvjjh6AgdJ9n
Hmm on initial creation they are sending to this address too, so maybe it's how it should be - but anyway warriors not appears in players list after bailout on re-usage


[28-Feb-19 01:13 AM] TonyL#3577
At least I've received cashed ROGUE


[28-Feb-19 01:34 AM] TonyL#3577
So what we have for now:

1) Deadlock on bailout
```komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 "[%22edca5d578250800e43ab03103c605ab83272f805a966b688337c8fe9e641f43b%22]" -> (Minironyi) found baton 22b7f6bb559eb3919a2c0de2b51dfb0135dab73f683091ce96d756faf2ac8cee numkeys.1417 seed.1862856489122242256 playerdata.812 Node just hanging.```

2) Warriors created today not saving after re-usage my side (I lost 2 more to ensure and 5 from 5 in total):
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PO-Ey528RqDLrSg2I4xMKZfQJb6fXDqgES0TjgfJ9gk/edit#gid=0&range=36:44

3) 1 short game with new warrior progress wasn't saved without 0 keystrokes broadcasted with"couldnt find batontxid" error (but it looks minor in comparison with first two) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PO-Ey528RqDLrSg2I4xMKZfQJb6fXDqgES0TjgfJ9gk/edit#gid=0&range=28:28

4) Warrior had strength.17/16  but he gone in `2` (mentioned in report)

5) https://pastebin.com/un8FK5k3 - `invalid gametxid, or already started`  on game start and bailout with warrior gone

@ronyi Could you please check `2` on your side?
Just play short game with brand new warrior, then re-use him in other short game (without death) and track if he back to your list after bailout is mined


[28-Feb-19 01:37 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes, but tryed, no problem,  up to now.


[28-Feb-19 01:38 AM] TonyL#3577
Very strange, I erased 5 from 5 this way


[28-Feb-19 01:42 AM] ronyi#5719
I tryed again, but i quit on lvl 5, warrior in lvl 4, the gold is not right, but i see my warrior in warrior list.


[28-Feb-19 01:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, was it re-usage of this warrior?


[28-Feb-19 01:44 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes.


[28-Feb-19 01:44 AM] TonyL#3577
In first game on my side everything fine - progress/warrior saving. But when I re-use warrior and bailout - I'm receiving ROGUE like warrior was alive but warrior not appears in my list ü§ï


[28-Feb-19 01:46 AM] ronyi#5719
ohhh... such are the lives of testers. Re-using my warrior and playing short games.


[28-Feb-19 01:48 AM] TonyL#3577
And I got extraction prints like everything fine (strength, health, gold extracted) - noticed that warriors not back only when 3 from 6 left in list üòÇ


[28-Feb-19 01:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Btw warriors created not today seems not behave like this on my side

it does seem things got destabilized... i wont be able to fix it till tomorrow. somehow the playerdata is going to a totally different address? that seems the worst issue

Take you r time jl777


[28-Feb-19 08:08 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Is there a way to rollback? Use the FSM branch?


[28-Feb-19 08:09 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@PureHate  When was the last time you updated and how did you do so?


[28-Feb-19 08:51 AM] ronyi#5719
I tryed FSM branch, but failed on linux.


[28-Feb-19 09:01 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I updated to what ever Tony told me too and it works mostly fine.


[28-Feb-19 09:02 AM] Cryptofist#7504
```cd ~/komodo

For this I was also told to Ignore error messages given during install and keep going.

BUUUUUUT like JL said. It's dead broken. Can't guarantee it will work.


[28-Feb-19 09:06 AM] ronyi#5719
We use FSM branch or jl777? I deleted all komodo dir.


[28-Feb-19 09:06 AM] Cryptofist#7504

---- I'm going to pull the testing posts until we have a good feeling about updates again. I'll position the idea in my wrote up as something we will do next week. Maybe drum up more interest.


[28-Feb-19 09:47 AM] PureHate#9411
@Cryptofist  at time posting and i start from scratch  aftett build i run the game manually coz no way yet to use rogue_tui.py


[28-Feb-19 09:49 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Got it


[28-Feb-19 09:49 AM] Cryptofist#7504
So tony + I both had the game freeze issue, then we came to that last set of instructions I have posted,  to make it work.


[28-Feb-19 09:50 AM] Cryptofist#7504
basically double delete things and reinstall and then we didnt have the lockdown upon start


[28-Feb-19 09:51 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I think there is an issue upon start unless you do it that specific way


[28-Feb-19 09:53 AM] PureHate#9411
my first mistake was unzipping to /komodo instead of /komodo/src after ni freez but i play 30sec

I'd like to show multiplayer set up at some point , joining  and game play in a 3-8 minute long video.  if we need to do a couple of rounds to get a good recording that is fine by me.  It might take us a solid day of playing to do so. 

Soooo... If you can, lets all get some high level characters built.  We can use them next week (maybe later depending on bugs) for a multiplayer session, that we can all play slowly to record. If we all have a google account of some type I think we can all stream our screens  in a one screen stream .   I know there is the bug with 3 player but we can see what we can accomplish anyway.  I might push it directly to gaming.youtube.com

If it's broken on jl777 and can't sync on FSM unlikely we can do something until his fixes

any idea of a known good commit that I can pull?


[28-Feb-19 05:44 PM] TonyL#3577
I think it might break things even more. Do you want sync to play or mine? If to mine - try to use jl777 branch - maybe it'll sync, if to play - I think there is no way to relatively smooth gameplay atm if FSM not syncing


[28-Feb-19 05:45 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
atm I just need the chain and a working transaction


[28-Feb-19 06:05 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
That didn't work either @TonyL same auto shutdown based on fork ‚òπ 
Giess I'll have to wait and play with pool later


[28-Feb-19 07:21 PM] TonyL#3577

the last I saw, everything was broken? but that seems hard to understand as all I changed was keystrokes tx handling


[28-Feb-19 09:14 PM] TonyL#3577
A lot of issues were reported, some deadlocks, I lost warriors somehow on bailouts


[28-Feb-19 09:14 PM] TonyL#3577
```So what we have for now:

1) Deadlock on bailout
komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 "[%22edca5d578250800e43ab03103c605ab83272f805a966b688337c8fe9e641f43b%22]" -> (Minironyi) found baton 22b7f6bb559eb3919a2c0de2b51dfb0135dab73f683091ce96d756faf2ac8cee numkeys.1417 seed.1862856489122242256 playerdata.812 Node just hanging.

2) 1 short game with new warrior progress wasn't saved without 0 keystrokes broadcasted with"couldnt find batontxid" error (but it looks minor in comparison with first two) https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PO-Ey528RqDLrSg2I4xMKZfQJb6fXDqgES0TjgfJ9gk/edit#gid=0&range=28:28

3) https://pastebin.com/un8FK5k3 - invalid gametxid, or already started  on game start and bailout with warrior gone

-) Warrior had strength.17/16  but he gone in 2 (mentioned in report) 
UPD: it happened in these strange times when I lost warriors - and now I enlarged warrior strength and he started with 17/17 so I wonder it can be not reviewed on this point

-) Warriors created today not saving after re-usage my side (I lost 2 more to ensure and 5 from 5 in total):
UPD: not reproducible at the moment 
```


[28-Feb-19 09:14 PM] TonyL#3577
Strength 17/16 - never was before as well üòÉ


[28-Feb-19 09:20 PM] TonyL#3577
When I lost warriors - in bailout vout with gold was sent to my address, warriors were sent to not my address


[28-Feb-19 09:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so the warriors were created, just sent to the wrong address. let me check


[28-Feb-19 09:21 PM] TonyL#3577
There are bailout/game txids in googledoc


[28-Feb-19 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
RTneCmAMhv54ht7qxXycuSVvjjh6AgdJ9n is not the CC address for RF4G3G8ewN5TA6itxs7nXCY28iADaFW5sy ?


[28-Feb-19 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810

[28-Feb-19 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the code is sending the NFT to the mypk CC address


[28-Feb-19 09:27 PM] jl777c#5810
I really have hard time to believe this all of a sudden broke. could you have been running a daemon with a different -pubkey= value?


[28-Feb-19 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
what are some typical lines from rogue.sendlog


[28-Feb-19 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed a version that disables looping on waiting for last keystrokes file to be finished


[28-Feb-19 09:31 PM] TonyL#3577
It might be a good explanation if pubkey was wrong on this node - I felt myself not very well yesterday so mistake is possible + nobody else had the same problem. Shouldn't gold be sent on not my address too in such case?


[28-Feb-19 09:32 PM] jl777c#5810
RF4G3G8ewN5TA6itxs7nXCY28iADaFW5sy is the gold address and RTneCmAMhv54ht7qxXycuSVvjjh6AgdJ9n is the matched CC address


[28-Feb-19 09:33 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, removing the while loop should fix the deadlock

Yes it's some random address it seems - thats why I was very confused

Like a gold sending to me - but warriors disappear to nowhere, and nobody else have such issue

more than one node using that address does this same thing?

It's correct, I checked it first

Node on which I faced issue is OSX, and node on which I wasn't able to reproduce is Ubuntu if it might matter somehow


[28-Feb-19 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so this node, it is wearing any cursed rings?


[28-Feb-19 09:39 PM] jl777c#5810
drink any strange potions?


[28-Feb-19 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
from what you are saying it seems quite strange. it is able to create a new warrior to the correct address, but if you are playing with an existing one, it goes to a random address?


[28-Feb-19 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
these playertxid you are using, where did they come from?

No I played 5 short games first - warriors created, then reused these 5 warriors


[28-Feb-19 09:42 PM] TonyL#3577
And they disappear


[28-Feb-19 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so it creates them fine, but on a reused one goes to a random address and it happens only on this node


[28-Feb-19 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
what if you use the same keypair on a different node. maybe it is keypair specific


[28-Feb-19 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
my guess is that any keypair on that node will do the same


[28-Feb-19 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
some sort of memory corruption going on


[28-Feb-19 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
did you make clean and make from ~/komodo/src/cc/rogue dir?


[28-Feb-19 09:44 PM] TonyL#3577
I think I did, let me try to clean everything, rebuild and reproduce


[28-Feb-19 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
so my guess is the waiting for sendrawtranasction to fail is causing problems, but otherwise keystrokes is more reliable. just at the end can cause a hang


[28-Feb-19 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810
for bailout hangs, get me the cclib args for an external extract, where you have the address or pubkey in addition to the gametxid. that should almost certainly reproduce any looping on baton search

```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%22edca5d578250800e43ab03103c605ab83272f805a966b688337c8fe9e641f43b%22,%220325151cf0f7321d0cde232898c5adc6b60f32df71b79af3a49d10020d42925ae9%22]\"
```


[28-Feb-19 09:52 PM] TonyL#3577
(It happened on @ronyi side so I've used pubkey which he provided before - this extract hanged my node)


[28-Feb-19 09:55 PM] jl777c#5810
great! i just need such examples, but one per type of bug is enough

@jl777c Cleaned everything and rebuilt - not able to reproduce this warriors disappearing issue atm. 
So since it's happened only for me and only on this node and not reproducible now I assume it was cursed ring or most probably hello kitty fault


[28-Feb-19 10:55 PM] jl777c#5810
that extract infinite loop seems to be a hello kitty monster too... cant even find where it is hanging

It's deadlock - maybe it's same case as about which you've reported before (James not fixed it yet I think)

@TonyL finally solved it, was infinite looping in the replay. it seems the warrior died but the keystrokes maybe was messed up and that ended up in an infinite loop. found half a dozen other places where it might happen and hopefully it is prevented

Maybe @jl777c will check game and it's something different hmm, rekt on lvl21 with 15lvl warrior it should be sad


[01-Mar-19 06:41 AM] TonyL#3577
But since it's on not updated version anything can happen - latest fixes were huge


[01-Mar-19 06:43 AM] ronyi#5719

If `git pull` printing that you're already up to date - it means you on latest


[01-Mar-19 06:49 AM] TonyL#3577
But need to clean and rebuild


[01-Mar-19 06:50 AM] TonyL#3577
```cd ~/komodo
git checkout jl777
git pull
make clean
cd src
rm komodod komodo-cli komodo-tx *.so
cd cc
rm *.so
cd rogue
make clean
cd ../../..

@ronyi the amulet starts appearing on the 26th level. Then you gotta go all the way back up (new rooms) to win.


[01-Mar-19 07:17 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I haven't found instructions or any clear indication that the amulet is only on 26 and that there are not more downward levels..... So it's possible it might go lower....

Congrats on getting way farther than anyone!


[01-Mar-19 07:21 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I wonder if he meant warrior level.


[01-Mar-19 07:22 AM] Cryptofist#7504
The game levels are 26 down 25 up to neat it unless he changed it.

Hmm I've played 4 short games with fresh warriors fine.
In 5th game (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16qgqaeVL6B3Ol36UXkXcmbfbi3eF5eOuobdcH5YHGJQ/edit#gid=0&range=26:28) progress wasn't saved
```,"error":"couldnt find batontxid"``` for keystroke

Only difference from previous 4 games is that I started to play not immediately after game creation/register mined but in ~5-8 minutes

maybe it is level 26,not 21

gold is needed along with experience or warrior is not saved

it is the original rules

you shouldnt be able to broadcast keystrokes for someone else

but you should be able to extract anybodys game (concatenated keystrokes) and extracting a game would need to find the baton

[01-Mar-19 08:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha!


[01-Mar-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe you broadcast keystrokes and that fixed it?


[01-Mar-19 08:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Worked for me now too


[01-Mar-19 08:46 AM] TonyL#3577
So it wroked after I manually broadcasted failed keystoke


[01-Mar-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe you need to wait for confirmations?


[01-Mar-19 08:47 AM] TonyL#3577
But it's after bailout already


[01-Mar-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
dont bailout if there are no keystrokes


[01-Mar-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
that is required safety guard


[01-Mar-19 08:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha


[01-Mar-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
also, the last 2 keystrokes might still be unconfirmed


[01-Mar-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so you need to wait for extract to work and then do a bailout


[01-Mar-19 08:48 AM] TonyL#3577
But if keystroke with "failed" status in log and not generated transaction - after I quit rogue how it'll be broadcasted


[01-Mar-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
tui


[01-Mar-19 08:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha


[01-Mar-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
when i put in logic to wait for confirmation, people complained about locked up system


[01-Mar-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so on exit, i now exit


[01-Mar-19 08:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, I'll parse keystrokes.log I think to know the status


[01-Mar-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
but that means that there could be 2 keystrokes tx in the mempool


[01-Mar-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
1 that was there the moment of game end and another that is the last keystrokes


[01-Mar-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
i think a good thing would be to do an extract, it prints the gold, etc


[01-Mar-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
if that is sane, then do a bailout


[01-Mar-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
if not, then dont. once you do a bailout, whatever happens is permanent


[01-Mar-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the utxo from the newgame tx is being spent and that is a onetime thing


[01-Mar-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
i think extract as a sanity test is good. you can also see if there are 1 or 2 keystrokes tx in the mempool


[01-Mar-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
and user can confirm the gold amounts extracted before issuing bailout


[01-Mar-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
this way, we can at least troubleshoot any games that have a bad extraction, while they are still in that state. once it is bailed out, there isnt much i can do, nor can i find out what state it was in


[01-Mar-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
extract should be able to extract the full gameplay even if it is in the mempool, but that needs to be tested


[01-Mar-19 08:55 AM] TonyL#3577
I need to know two things as I see;
1) txids of keystrokes which were broadcasted - to wait until they mined
2) explore if there any error = not broadcasted keystroke, ensure that it broadcasted and mined before bailout


[01-Mar-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
keystrokes.log should have all that


[01-Mar-19 08:55 AM] TonyL#3577
Yep, so I'll just parse keystrokes.log


[01-Mar-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
and get confirmation of bailout with extract command result


[01-Mar-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
that way I can always fix whatever bug and rescue an otherwise would be deleted playerdata


[01-Mar-19 08:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Extract working before bailout as well?


[01-Mar-19 08:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh it doing first


[01-Mar-19 08:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Then baillout


[01-Mar-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it should, needs testing


[01-Mar-19 08:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, I see


[01-Mar-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, extract to make sure it will be a happy result, then and only then bailout. that alone might solve the main issue of tears for lost playerdata


[01-Mar-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
then as all the various edge cases are fixed, all the extract will return the happy data for safe bailout. extract is essentially a trial run for a bailout, without doing the actual bailout


[01-Mar-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
only if there is any issue, would tui need to parse keystrokes to reconstruct what needs to be done


[01-Mar-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be that all keystrokes need to be confirmed before a proper extract


[01-Mar-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure


[01-Mar-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
so, there seems to be a lot of questions that can be answered with a few changes to tui

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[01-Mar-19 08:59 AM] TonyL#3577
I'll look for `"status":"error"` in keystrokes.log but only when player stopped game - to not corrupt keystrokes consistency


[01-Mar-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[01-Mar-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
that and extract before bailout with user confirm of results

I'm parsing keystrokes.log


[01-Mar-19 11:27 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess that should work as good as it would be the same functions making the local log. ok, so it seems  we are maybe going to have a new level of reliability. instead of relying on luck for bailing out with the right warrior we can verify ahead of time. and even take corrective actions. what would be left are edge case bugs where the bug is reproduced with somehow an extract that isnt working properly

Oh yes, if progress not satisfy user - he can press button now and wait 10 seconds more, if no keystrokes found in log at all - it waiting until there will be some attempts, if keystroke broadcasted with error - it should rebroadcast it until get txid

Unlikely Windows have `cat` and `grep`

I can change the format of keystrokes.log if needed to make it work on windows


[01-Mar-19 11:44 PM] TonyL#3577
In general it will be just a sweet dream if for each game will be creating `gametxid.keystrokes.log`

In `logs` folder let's say

does the extraction data show the amount of hold, hp, strength...

Yes - as value of "extracted" key


[01-Mar-19 11:55 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as the user sees that then if gold matches what they had, it should be the same player


[01-Mar-19 11:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Aha, just user have to remember how many he had


[01-Mar-19 11:55 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed a version that stores the raw keystrokes in seed.1, seed.2, ... files


[01-Mar-19 11:55 PM] jl777c#5810
seed.0 file is created by extract


[01-Mar-19 11:56 PM] jl777c#5810
so this way both can coexist. the first seed.N file that is 0 length indicates the prior one was the last

[02-Mar-19 12:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Just new JSONs outputs not beatified in TUI yet - because at first want to check that it work as expected if see keystroke with error on broadcast


[02-Mar-19 12:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Just TUI update is fine I think - since your last update only debug info was added


[02-Mar-19 12:03 AM] TonyL#3577
And TUI work now only with keystrokes.log so you should be fine

[02-Mar-19 12:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Would be great if we catch keystroke with error in status - in such case TUI should print smthng like a:
```print("Trying to re-brodcast keystroke")```
``` print("Let's try again in 5 seconds")```
```print("Keystroke broadcasted! txid: " + keystroke_rebroadcast["txid"])```

the rogue makefile of the dapp is not very smart, so if the rogue.h file changes, it doesnt recompile all the files, even though all of them are needed a global structure


[02-Mar-19 12:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so if it even runs, some modules are writing at one location, while others are using a different one, for the same variable.

Was a nice purchase of warrior üòÉ

you should have gone up all the levels


[02-Mar-19 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it would give you a lot of gold


[02-Mar-19 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
all the pack items are converted to gold, so it would be very good

[02-Mar-19 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
also with amulet, it should allow highlander


[02-Mar-19 02:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Ouch he allows me now to bailout like I'm on dl5


[02-Mar-19 02:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Extract it showing


[02-Mar-19 02:17 AM] jl777c#5810
level 10?


[02-Mar-19 02:17 AM] jl777c#5810
seems keystrokes got lost?


[02-Mar-19 02:18 AM] TonyL#3577
There are many in keystrokes.log and all without errors


[02-Mar-19 02:19 AM] jl777c#5810
seems some nondeterministic player action still plauges us... maybe an extract needs to be done at each level to make sure things are in sync? at least to debug


[02-Mar-19 02:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes some thing should corrupt replay


[02-Mar-19 02:20 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed a fix so that if you have amulet, it treats it at least as level 26, even if you are lower


[02-Mar-19 02:20 AM] TonyL#3577
I think weared ring first time on ~dl5


[02-Mar-19 02:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so if it is being confirmed level by level,at least you will know when things get out of sync and can bailout at that time


[02-Mar-19 02:20 AM] TonyL#3577
So my only idea that it's corrupted from place where I put ring


[02-Mar-19 02:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be the informational commands, that get things out of sync


[02-Mar-19 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
I think if each level you check the extract, then it will be clearer what action is causing the out of sync


[02-Mar-19 02:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok üò∞


[02-Mar-19 02:25 AM] TonyL#3577
At least he should return alive


[02-Mar-19 02:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Bail-outing so


[02-Mar-19 02:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe will get some info from replay now

Ok so let's assume for now that reason is corrupted warrior (before/if someone else face same problem with progress saving and warrior created without bugs in long game) üòÉ


[02-Mar-19 02:48 AM] TonyL#3577
If inventory data was corrupted - I used something and replay broke. I think that was a case


[02-Mar-19 02:48 AM] jl777c#5810
unless bug is reproduced with clean build, it can be anything


[02-Mar-19 02:48 AM] TonyL#3577
And this place when it stopped - I've rearranged my inventory here


[02-Mar-19 02:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a dropped a lot of items / took others


[02-Mar-19 02:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Sad, but at least now we know that it's possible to find amulet üòÉ


[02-Mar-19 02:49 AM] jl777c#5810
but we dont know that extraction handles amulet properly, there is special logic for it that is still untested


[02-Mar-19 02:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Quite hard to test it haha

[02-Mar-19 02:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Who have a luck to a) find amulet b) avoid possible gremlins with keystrokes extraction c) have not legacy warrior


[02-Mar-19 02:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's possible to make "amulet debug" version of rogue? Like a change in source code that amulet creating on lvl1

Adopted keystrokes log parser for windows - seems it works ( but should support only WinXP+, will not work on Windows 98 üò¶ ). 

Will beautify things a little, test a little and then publish bundles for all three OSes (in a few hours I think)

Played quite short game on Windows (quit on lvl2). Two keystroke transaction were broadcasted without problems. 

https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/sBGMzxHtrd/

Extract returns error (tried to wait few blocks - but same error):
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17 \"[%228f1f3c32c39fb457a1a80e1a083d91ef598d6042536669171d7064b4a3f64610%22,%22031d6340665e4be675e6b39093152b6169e546ac6885c39058c4c60afee529d491%22]\"

Not bailouted yet. I did very nothing special in this game - Just defeated few enemies (fight by `f + arrow `), collected armor, scroll, a little bit gold and quit. 

UPD: seems it's Windows pack daemon/rogue specific issue (same behaviour as above 3 times a row  on Windows, but on Linux jl777 branch node progress extracting fine in same games)

Reproduced issue which @ronyi had.

Game not started with:
```setplayerdata
findbaton err.-1
invalid gametxid, or already started``` 

And then TUI think that game is finished and trying to do bailout process. (if make bailout - warrior will be instadead because no keystrokes were broadcasted)

I stopped TUI by CTRL+C - gameinfo was like game is not started yet

Manually started game - and it's worked fine. I wonder some re-attempt needed on this stage.
I'll calculate time before and after execution of rogue game - and if game took less than 1 second I'll try to start it again until success instead of bailout.

awthanks 

[02-Mar-19 06:20 PM] TonyL#3577
In general for all cases when no keystrokes were sent at all it's possible to play this game again if bailout wasn't sent. Seems one more issue possible to resolve from TUI side


[02-Mar-19 06:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Pushed fix with such game duration check - hope no more warriors will be lost in games which even not started

Hmm seems that keystrokes sending on each level added another headache - played 5 levels game, first and third keystroke failed with "couldn't find batontxid" - but it was detected only when game finished and even when rebroadcasted and waited few blocks extract returned error (so game progress/warrior lost).
So I have to monitor logs permanently - not only on game finish and rebroadcast each time I see error to hope that sequence remains the same.


[02-Mar-19 09:40 PM] TonyL#3577
So now have some games like this: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/SNWgcvgcCg/ (played 3 levels - 1st keystroke have error in keystrokes.log so wasn't broadcasted - even after re-broadcast extract will return error because of inconsistency I think) - it should be not hard to solve: just not broadcast next if previous returned error, and try to rebroadcast one with error first until success.
It don't have much sense to make bundles now with such problem because progress of many games will be lost.


[02-Mar-19 09:43 PM] TonyL#3577
```********```
Windows one have two cases of extraction:
 1) It's just error and nothing is extracted at all
2) It's extracting state for `dl1` (but no errors in keystrokes.log for other levels). 
Extracted more that dl1 in 0 games from ~15

Trying to identify now if it's a FSM branch problem or Windows kit especially

Ubuntu latest FSM extracted fine in first case from first, so problem should be somewhere on Windows stuff side (build or maybe my env) - not branch specific


[02-Mar-19 10:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm even if I died on lvl1 - Windows one extracted state for lvl1 ü§î 
Already feeling that I got lost. It's time for issues tracking I wonder üòÄ

i think if you play really fast you can end up submitting keystrokes before the prior tx is confirmed. still it should wait until it is confirmed to broadcast the next keystrokes tx. I will work on adding an automatic extract verification step to the keystrokes submitting, that is too complex for TUI


[02-Mar-19 10:31 PM] jl777c#5810
for now make the bundles as people cant even play at all

does extract work at all on windows, ever?


[02-Mar-19 10:34 PM] TonyL#3577
Windows wasn't tested much so maybe it not worked before as well


[02-Mar-19 10:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Now I have a test plan - so started to test Windows with it and found these problems with extraction


[02-Mar-19 10:47 PM] jl777c#5810
are the keystrokes files being created? also, for an extraction that doesnt work on windows, does it work on unix? i mean with the game played on windows


[02-Mar-19 10:47 PM] jl777c#5810
we can isolate what part is broken in windows


[02-Mar-19 10:48 PM] jl777c#5810
if every windows game fails, then there is no point for release


[02-Mar-19 10:51 PM] TonyL#3577
All `.1+` keystroke files are empty on Windows


[02-Mar-19 10:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Extract call which return error on windows return error on unix as well

Aha, thats why I have progress only for 1 level maybe


[02-Mar-19 11:07 PM] jl777c#5810
no, that was a bug i fixed in unix, but it didnt make it into the windows build. doesnt affect things as nothing is using it yet


[02-Mar-19 11:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the .0 file having keystrokes means it found at least one keystrokes tx

i get an error on that short game too, trying to extract it. so it could be an edge case windows stumbled into. will investigate


[02-Mar-19 11:33 PM] jl777c#5810
zero value character was killed -> no playerdata

does the game replay show the same rooms?

Just choosen bad example with hobgoblin first - it's different bug I think

For game from paste I got error on extract call


[02-Mar-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so the nondeterministic replay. i am wondering if we have os specific issues with that


[02-Mar-19 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
do you have any game in windows that worked at all?


[02-Mar-19 11:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Zero


[02-Mar-19 11:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Two states: or error on extract, or extract only dl1


[02-Mar-19 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
but you are getting keystrokes in the rogue.seed.0 file that matches what was played?


[02-Mar-19 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
if you do: cc/rogue/rogue seed and have it display the replay, are the rooms the same?


[02-Mar-19 11:42 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll check it after lunch, just discovered for me these keystrokes log files


[02-Mar-19 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
extract creates the .0 file


[02-Mar-19 11:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Ahh it's not created during the game?


[02-Mar-19 11:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the .1, .2, ... are but a bug truncated all of them. it is fixed in the latest src


[02-Mar-19 11:43 PM] TonyL#3577
I thought it's different one which logging playee keystrokes input

[02-Mar-19 11:44 PM] jl777c#5810
i am wondering if you even get the same set of rooms with the same seed


[02-Mar-19 11:45 PM] jl777c#5810
so what happens if you play seed 777 ? does it give you the expected rooms (with 2 handed sword in one of them)


[02-Mar-19 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it sounds like even with the same keystrokes, the gamereplay is totally wrong


[02-Mar-19 11:53 PM] jl777c#5810

Yesterday created 2 warriors and now finded 3 rings in game and quit, everythings looked like normal, but i lost 1 warrior. unfortunately i noted not my gametxid and bailout txid. I using this komodo commit 62cea0f4e863f3861054a8e35bcccdd8bdf766bd and  tui commit e1a4281a7fd8b381040681bb79c7bc56e276ba22. Do i update?

@TonyL that 256 char game is very strange. the replay is a bit silly, but it isnt dying, yet the blockchain daemon is saying dead. investigating... but this wont be fast at all


[03-Mar-19 01:56 AM] jl777c#5810
for now, try to get even the simplest game in windows that extracts and replays correctly

actually it seems it is the no gold,no experience death case

so the question is why does it do the short replay and quit so early

@ronyi What means by "TUI bailout not worked" - some error or?


[03-Mar-19 07:09 AM] TonyL#3577
After game where you lost game progress please check keystrokes by:
```cat keystrokes.log | grep gametxid```

There are two cases might be: 
a) error cant find batontxid (if it not in last keystroke sending attempt - progress will be lost) 
b) no keystrokes at all - if send bailout for such game warrior will be insta dead


[03-Mar-19 07:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Case a) happens in 20-30% games maybe (when moving between levels fast maybe 50%+) so you should lose warriors quite often

Played one more short 1lvl game, in this one I fight monster, picked-up gold and before I quit I checked inventory:

Only not sure if it ok spaces around `i`


[03-Mar-19 03:59 PM] TonyL#3577
So between last two ones only difference is inventory checking - in extracted game I not checked it, in not extracted (in game where warrior counted as ded) I did


[03-Mar-19 04:06 PM] TonyL#3577

I should be able to make keystrokes saving a lot more reliable, so we would be down to non-deterministic keystrokes and windows

Aha, this "batontxid not found" in first keystrokes corrupting many games atm


[04-Mar-19 12:28 AM] jl777c#5810
is that just when it hasnt confirmed yet?


[04-Mar-19 12:29 AM] TonyL#3577

Hmmm maybe it's because `register` transaction isn't confirmed

When rogue trying to send first keystroke


[04-Mar-19 12:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Should `register` be confirmed?


[04-Mar-19 12:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[04-Mar-19 12:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha! I'm waiting only for newgame transaction confirmation, then sending register transaction and then game starting


[04-Mar-19 12:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Before when keystrokes broadcasted not after each level it wasn't visible


[04-Mar-19 12:32 AM] TonyL#3577
But now I have to start only when register confirmed, ok


[04-Mar-19 12:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it might be possible to allow it to work from mempool, but really it is more reliable to have registration tx confirmed


[04-Mar-19 12:32 AM] jl777c#5810
that alone could make it much more reliable!


[04-Mar-19 12:32 AM] jl777c#5810
lets see if it does, then I wont need to destablize things with the keystrokes syncing


[04-Mar-19 12:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, maybe this check alone will help

When some progress is missing - try to not bailout immediately but wait few more blocks (`n` option to wait one more block). Maybe more/all progress will be saved - noticed it few times


[04-Mar-19 09:15 AM] TonyL#3577
No errors in your keystrokes - so maybe something which not suits extract happened on lvl10

I see. Will try to catch non-det bugs tomorrow. Will do specific things on specific level and then check where extraction stopped

You may extract your game and check `rogue.gameseed.10` file - maybe there is something strange in keystrokes

Hi guys, I am a bit better feeling, not 100%... but not out of commission. 
I gotta tie up some other work things today and will be back tomorrow! 
I have some questions in the meantime.

Tony - 1. A couple of news outlets pushed out BTCtalk ANN , so the original windows bundle link you posted is there (they copied/pasted) Can make that a still useful link somehow?  
2. Can you also leave me a list of things to test if need be for tue/wed?  Should I try to pull 1-2 more people in here? Seems we lost some people.

jl777 -1. What is an estimated time frame for when you think we will know if this is or is not a test chain ?  My assumption is that it isn't going to end up just a test chain, but we wont know til you feel it is complete.  I'm looking for some info to help complete the timeline i'm making. 
2.  How do we feel about taking Rogue out to a video game convention in mid-april?  Do think it is possible  to have a version  to run in a booth to demo at that point? There is the East Coast Game Con in NC at that time, not too far from me and sensibly priced booths.  If not there are many more later. 
3. Is there  any documentation on how RogueCC itself works I can take a look at? 

Thanks guys!


[04-Mar-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
current ROGUE chain will either morph into the real chain, or at worst we will airdrop the ROGUE balances from this chain to the real one

I have been "waiting for next block before bailout" for quite a while, I keep getting this message every few minutes that I have never seen this before: 
Do you want to make bailout now [y] or wait for one more block [n]? [y/n]: 

what's the difference between bailing out now or waiting for one more block?


[04-Mar-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
check to see if the gold it extracts matches the gameplay. if it does, no need to wait for next block


[04-Mar-19 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
if things dont change after several blocks, likely it wont be changing, so no point waiting


[04-Mar-19 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
the point to wait is that sometimes it will extract more gold by getting more keystrokes tx confirmed


[04-Mar-19 04:17 PM] wookie#7663
now that you mentioned it, I just scrolled back to look. The gold was short by about 30% (I ended the game with almost 6000, but only 4000 was recorded). I waited through 4 of those messages and then I said yes.


[04-Mar-19 04:19 PM] jl777c#5810
still a few cases where the keystrokes seem to be getting lost. once we track that down things will become a lot more reliable

the evil crash during extract/replay is non-deterministic...

sometimes it works, sometimes it crashes. when it crashes, it is in the same place

i have a feeling whatever this is could be the explanation for the non-determinism. but it could be i need to refactor a large portion of the rogue game code to fix this...

I got down to level 20 and level 15 in the last couple of games but when bailed out, the keystrokes only recorded up to level 5 and 2. It seems to me that perhaps the keystroke recording "max'd out" rather than randomly record?

@TonyL @ronyi finally tracked down the crash. it was a bug in the rogue code where if a nymph steals an item that you have more than one of, it ended up discarding the object, even if it is still in your pack. so things ended up with freed memory in the pack and that led to random crashes or not depending on OS, mem situation, etc

@wookie when you do the bailout is it showing the correct gold/items?


[06-Mar-19 06:30 AM] wookie#7663
No, I'm those recent games I only got 20-30% of what I ended the game with. items that I picked up later were noticeably not there. Interesting thing was that I noticed that an armor I dropped later in the game remained with me when I reused the warrior


[06-Mar-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
if the keystrokes did not get recorded, it is as if those keystrokes never happened


[06-Mar-19 06:31 AM] wookie#7663
Also, now that you mention it, it seems some games my I can carry more stuff in the pack but some games less.


[06-Mar-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
depends on strength

[06-Mar-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
the new logic checks to see if the prior keystrokes tx is unconfirmed. if it is, then it broadcasts it again. and doesnt save keystrokes until next time


[06-Mar-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
the edge cases are at the beginning, the registration needs to be confirmed before the first keystrokes and at the end, the last one or two keystrokes needs to confirm before extract


[06-Mar-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i think if those two edge cases are handled, then we might have reliable replays

at least it doesnt crash on level 4 now. hopefully you can get to deeper levels not finding 00000000...0000000 seems a missing baton issue, which if confirmed should fix things, strange it found baton but ends up with 0000 txid

good news! hopefully now it will work for longer games, only worry i have is the first and last ones and the TUI needs to be waiting for those

bailout worked fine


[06-Mar-19 04:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm TUI don't have any control over rogue process (it continue to work only when rogue process finishing) - so if you proceeded to bailout it means that rogue crashed/quited.
Tesitng new komodod with TUI üëç  Seems updates are promising üòÉ


[06-Mar-19 04:26 PM] TonyL#3577
```the edge cases are at the beginning, the registration needs to be confirmed before the first keystrokes and at the end, the last one or two keystrokes needs to confirm before extract
i think if those two edge cases are handled, then we might have reliable replays
```
At the moment in TUI game starting only after registration is confirmed, At the end it's waiting just for one block for default but user can wait as many blocks as he want if `extract` result not satisfy him

[06-Mar-19 05:25 PM] TonyL#3577
Mempool was clean on node when broadcasted first bailout so it seems I have to wait  1+ confirmation for last keystrokes in any cases before bailout. Now got this point


[06-Mar-19 05:32 PM] TonyL#3577
`117e2378a3f4dbe47a3ac81daa018cab6de615bacb752df03cdd6f441760fd71` aha - it's last keystroke txid in keystrokes.log


[06-Mar-19 05:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Just will change  in TUI`Waiting for one more block before bailout` to `Waiting for last keystroke to be confirmed`


[06-Mar-19 07:20 PM] TonyL#3577
TUI version which waiting for last keystroke confirmation is in `master`:
```Last keystroke not confirmed yet! Let's wait a little
Last keystroke not confirmed yet! Let's wait a little
Last keystroke not confirmed yet! Let's wait a little
Last keystroke confirmed!

[06-Mar-19 10:44 PM] jl777c#5810
are you checking specifically for the keystrokes tx to be confirmed?


[06-Mar-19 10:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, specifically for txid of last keystroke


[06-Mar-19 10:44 PM] TonyL#3577
```        # waiting for last keystroke confirmation here
        last_keystroke_json = json.loads(keystrokes_rpc_responses[-1])
        while True:
            confirmations_amount = rpc_connection.getrawtransaction(last_keystroke_json["result"]["txid"], 1)["confirmations"]
            if confirmations_amount < 2:
                print("Last keystroke not confirmed yet! Let's wait a little")
                time.sleep(10)

                break```


[06-Mar-19 10:44 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, then it could solve the edge cases and actually be reliable


[06-Mar-19 10:45 PM] jl777c#5810
until this last release i was misparsing the json coming back, so it was never even checking for the keystrokes tx!


[06-Mar-19 10:45 PM] TonyL#3577
-1 it's last element from list with parsed keystrokes


[06-Mar-19 10:45 PM] jl777c#5810
got fooled into thinking it worked as it started working much better after I first implemented it


[06-Mar-19 10:45 PM] jl777c#5810
so these are the first versions where it is actually waiting for past keystrokes tx to confirm before sending the next


[06-Mar-19 10:46 PM] jl777c#5810
before it just sent and if any didnt make it, you get gaps and death

TUI checking a lot of stuff atm: waiting for registration to be mined, will not allow to bailout if game not started, checking for errors in keystroke tx and rebroadcast it (may help if last keystroke had error), if there are 0 keystrokes it will try to wait also and not allow to bailout


[06-Mar-19 10:48 PM] TonyL#3577
+ now waiting for last keystokes confirmation and as mega feature even after all these steps player can just try to wait one more block if he dont like extract print

Everything is working good for me, only the deadlock is missing üòÇ

deadlocks are bad, why do you want it?

TUI: Something went wrong! confirmation

[06-Mar-19 11:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Daemon deadlocked and then you was able to execute bailout manually?


[06-Mar-19 11:54 PM] TonyL#3577
Can you provide more prints from TUI pls?


[06-Mar-19 11:54 PM] TonyL#3577
It's not clear now where it happened


[06-Mar-19 11:55 PM] jl777c#5810
manual worked... seems maybe some TUI loop is looping too hard?


[06-Mar-19 11:55 PM] TonyL#3577
```Something went wrong! ``` may be throwed on various things


[06-Mar-19 11:55 PM] TonyL#3577
It's just like a `if Exception` print it


[06-Mar-19 11:55 PM] TonyL#3577
But it should print exception as well


[06-Mar-19 11:56 PM] TonyL#3577
It can loop for hard easy - there are a lot of `while True` things üòÉ


[06-Mar-19 11:57 PM] TonyL#3577
But I dont think that it'll print `Something went wrong!` in such case

Next time i create screenshot.

Have to update bundles asap \- it should be very annoying for users to bailout manually


[07-Mar-19 12:36 AM] TonyL#3577
P.S. it was not a deadlock - just not complete TUI logic


[07-Mar-19 12:39 AM] jl777c#5810
does this mean we have a potential fix for all known issues?


[07-Mar-19 12:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Only if there will be no "baton not found" in some middle keystroke


[07-Mar-19 12:48 AM] TonyL#3577
In such case other issues should be non-det


[07-Mar-19 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
looking at the code I can easily believe there are more nymph stealing multiple object items type of bug, that was non-deterministic as it all depended on what the system did with the freed memory


[07-Mar-19 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
in the middle keystrokes, I just sendrawtransaction until it returns an error (most likely due to being onchain already)


[07-Mar-19 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
if not, it waits till the next level


[07-Mar-19 12:59 AM] jl777c#5810
if that isnt enough, I have code ready that extracts the current game and compares to local keystrokes and a way to adjust the next keystrokes if needed, but it could be we need a special "patch keystrokes" with a diff sent as a new tx. want to avoid this complexity if at all possible


[07-Mar-19 01:00 AM] jl777c#5810
if we can reduce the error rate to less than 1%, that would just be part of the game


[07-Mar-19 01:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Updated bundles with this little patch (it's same 0.2.1b release page - just updated rogue_tui inside zips)

Will focus now on multiplayer part of TUI enchacing + mutliplayer testing so (have to refactor part of code I think to re-use in both single and multiplayer). And will wait for a feedback about singleplayer

Also you may to find keystrokes for this game by `cat keystrokes.log | grep gametxid` and check if last keystroketxid on blockhain

Yep, first level should be the same

`If i starting multiple new game `  - please note that multiplayer games don't have any TUI fixes yet (waiting for different transactions confirmations and etc) so progress of most of the games should be lost


[07-Mar-19 01:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Not recommend to use valuable warriors - I'll work on mutliplayer patching now


[07-Mar-19 01:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Later in stable version I can hide these printouts "waiting for this, waiting for that" or change to some funny text but now it's helpful to troubleshoot

Ok, I think I know how to solve it - will just rebroadcast last keystroke in case of any error this scanner see until it get `confirmations` key

yes, need to keep broadcasting until it confirms

Hmm just a thought regards multiplayer: 
Since atm is possible to start multiplayer game when room not totally filled - is it possible to scan games list to find games where `alive: 0` but still free spaces to join and then just join and highlander to take everyones buyins?


[07-Mar-19 02:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha here is the answer!
```Do you want to make bailout now [y] or wait for one more block [n]? [y/n]: y

[07-Mar-19 02:29 AM] jl777c#5810
you can bailout


[07-Mar-19 02:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the tricky case with likely bugs are when there are open slots but its expired as it is too late


[07-Mar-19 02:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, I have pretty dumb check: If alive > 1 => bailout, if alive == 1 => highlander

i have code to try to determine all the possible variations, but doubt I got them all right

but if one spot was never registered, it wont be alive


[07-Mar-19 02:30 AM] jl777c#5810
but maybe the highlander rpc will return that error for such cases


[07-Mar-19 02:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe give seed to players only when room filled?


[07-Mar-19 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
seed is only after 5 blocks


[07-Mar-19 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
late arrivals can register for up to 60 blocks later


[07-Mar-19 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
or can close registration at the 5 blocks


[07-Mar-19 02:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I think I was able to start game less than in 5 blocks


[07-Mar-19 02:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me re-check


[07-Mar-19 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810
there should be no seed before 5 blocks as it uses the blockhash from 5 blocks in the future

hmmm @jl777c  this error I got when using migrates with far too many inputs, the transaction was too large it seems, and it caused some overflow which results in the validation thinking vout is negative, when infact its not when you decode raw transaction.


[07-Mar-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
seems it was a temporary issue as the manual bailout worked


[07-Mar-19 06:42 AM] TonyL#3577
According to screenshot it is error on last keystroke rebroadcast attempt so it shouldn't affect manual bailout (maybe it was just made without last keystroke progress)

There  is no `Qy` in replay but last frame just "frozen by ice monster", not moment of death


[07-Mar-19 02:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe only death when hp  == 0 tracking, not by hypothermia. Hmm but in replay you have 288 gold as in extract, interesting why ``` 260 Testelek:``` rogue counted as 260


[07-Mar-19 02:24 PM] TonyL#3577

``` both players have status finished now 
I'm not totally sure how I can handle such cases from TUI


[07-Mar-19 03:08 PM] TonyL#3577
To decide bailout or highlander I'm checking first what `gameinfo` alive key return: 
- if it's > 1 I'm trying to do bailout, if bailout attempt returned error - trying to do highlander (maybe game state changed since gameinfo response let's say)
- if it's 1 - trying to do highlander. Only if room not full ```highlander_info["error"] == 'numplayers != maxplayers'``` doing bailout instead


[07-Mar-19 03:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Also I think multiplayer not enjoyable at all from TUI atm because player can't see current game state (how many players alive) to decide can he quit already to take buyins or not.

And tbh current winner decision seems not interesting imo. Games might be super long - somebody can just die on lvl1 and not make bailout for hour


[07-Mar-19 03:25 PM] TonyL#3577
I think more interesting might be mode like a: who will extract more gold in 20-30 minites win the game or something like this (more dynamic and with countable score result).Lets say auto bailout based on current extract making on block X and gold counting to decide the winner. 

 But here community opinion is important - it's just my personal one üòÄ

üëÜ 

[07-Mar-19 03:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm idea is pretty straight forward:

1) Add game length param (in blocks amount) to multiplayer games creation 
2) After game_end_length height is reached dont accept more keystrokes from players
3)  After it on game_end_length height  decide winner  from players extracts based on most gold collected and send buyins to winner

It will allow to create blitz games, rapid games, long games and etc so player will be able to decide which game join/create depends of how much free time he have / in which mode he interested in + winner determination  and in-game goal is clear and understandable in such case and strategy when you not start game and waiting for everybody die will not work.

@jl777c How do you think is it worth to be implemented?

I like the idea of multiple multiplayer formats, but we will need an interface to do that, correct?


[07-Mar-19 04:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Some modificaitons in CC needed (new param for game creation + keystrokes accepting lock / auto game finishing with gold calculation in extracts)
Displaying GUI/TUI have to handle (check how much blocks left in active game and show countdown X blocks left till finish)


[07-Mar-19 04:36 PM] TonyL#3577
I already thought about implementation from TUI side: I think I can just open rogue subprocess in new terminal window and print constantly updating information about current game state in TUI terminal (looks like simpliest solution to not defect rogue gameplay)


[07-Mar-19 09:18 PM] Cryptofist#7504
I'm going to push for some more people to come test again now. Is there any updates on a windows installer?   Do we have anything important to look at right now and can we maybe try the form bounty again?

[07-Mar-19 10:11 PM] TonyL#3577
There are no any updates regards Windows one yet (it's not saving progress and I'm not sure atm how to troubleshoot it). I think it's better to start such bounty when Windows version will be ready. Will try to research some solution for win from my side today. I think that maybe it's some specifics of windows terminal and will try to play on some Unix terminal ported to Windows or something like that - maybe it'll help.

TUI setting pubkey automatically if it wasn't set in daemon params, copying ROGUE.conf also and waiting for sync (tested on Windows and it worked)

for multiplayer, i think being able to see the other players games as they do new levels is needed


[07-Mar-19 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so that would require to extract the other players games and then show a replay in a window when it changes in size


[07-Mar-19 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
probably would need a way to pause a replay and add keystrokes to it

some games there is a lot of gold, others not much at all  and every action changes the RNG


[07-Mar-19 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess the question is if we want rogue to be more a game of skill or of luck


[07-Mar-19 11:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm but surviving is the point of luck as well since a lot of things based on RNG


[07-Mar-19 11:50 PM] TonyL#3577
And if you playing longer and faster becaause of skills you can collect more gold


[07-Mar-19 11:50 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, binary state of killed or survived, vs random gold amounts...


[07-Mar-19 11:50 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a poker - combination of luck and skills

Possible to find: rogue.xyz.8 to gametxid?


[08-Mar-19 02:19 AM] ronyi#5719
I think think created one game and playes and quit and everythings is looks like good, but warrior is missing and i can't find my gametxid in expoler and my bailout txid.


[08-Mar-19 02:35 AM] TonyL#3577
@ronyi You may find your gametxid in `cclib games 17` past games (or in not finished games if bailout wasn't actually broadcasted)
Then check `cclib gameinfo 17` for this game if you need to find a seed


[08-Mar-19 03:32 AM] ronyi#5719
I not find my seed in my gameinfo. rogue.573308751621131768.x


[08-Mar-19 03:33 AM] ronyi#5719
No txid for this seed. As if it hadn't happened.


[08-Mar-19 03:39 AM] TonyL#3577
It is possible to get seed only from gameinfo - like a no other ways to get it


[08-Mar-19 03:39 AM] TonyL#3577
So it should exist somewhere hmm


[08-Mar-19 03:39 AM] TonyL#3577
I may make games scanner script which will search for specifc seed in games list


[08-Mar-19 03:39 AM] TonyL#3577
But a little bit later

Yes i give same error.


[08-Mar-19 07:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Error on this place not looks like something bad because here brutforce rebroadcasting last keystroke


[08-Mar-19 07:59 AM] TonyL#3577
So on some point it can throw error


[08-Mar-19 08:01 AM] TonyL#3577
It just waiting for "confirmations" actually and just to be sure rebroadcsting it


[08-Mar-19 08:03 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes, but is never ending game and lost warrior again and possible some lose another and i don't know what's the mistake. In the first bailout in TUI looks like everything is normal and now after tryed manual bailout everything is "success", but not.


[08-Mar-19 08:04 AM] ronyi#5719
I don't thing it was connection issue.


[08-Mar-19 08:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Record these bailout calls - if they are not broadcasting (but generating hex and txid) I think you'll able to broascast it in some case, Im just not with PC already


[08-Mar-19 08:05 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder just chain reject these bailout txs by some reason

I'm working on documentation for ROGUE currently.

Right now, I'm looking for a complete list of commands that can be used to play ROGUE manually in the terminal.

How can I find/make this?

There may be another list @Bryan_Beus but this is what I use https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/rogue/rogue.doc#L388

Your pack size is 2 x your strength, if you lose a strength point and exit with a higher amount of items , you will randomly lose items.

At first check extract by:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extraxct 17 \"[%22gametxid%22]\"```
Than if it's fine in extracted key, do bailout:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22gametxid%22]\"
```

Maybe I have to just wait for this last keystroke tx to be mined, not try to rebroadcast each 5 seconds. Or do it not so often

[09-Mar-19 06:09 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Assume a multi-player game.

If a player finds the amulet, returns from the dungeon, and executes the `highlander` method, do all other players in the game die? Or are they automatically bailed out?


[09-Mar-19 08:04 PM] TonyL#3577
@Bryan_Beus Oh I think by design player which found amulet should be able to `highlander` so after it other players will be able to `bailout` only


[09-Mar-19 08:05 PM] TonyL#3577
But it not tested so far and there is no any special amulet handling logic in TUI because such case seems to be not actual on this stage


[09-Mar-19 08:07 PM] TonyL#3577
```I think i find another bug, i finded sustain strenght ring and 5 gain strenght potions so my strenght is 21, and previus game i quit lvl 6 with 21strenght, but strenght is 20.

@TonyL After playing 15-20  games on the 0.2.1b bundle, I have to say, this version seems buggier(?) than previous ones. I reused my warrior in new game, but lost all my inventory in one game or lose some inventory in others. Most recently, clearly still alive but when exiting, says player was killed:

[09-Mar-19 08:30 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe daemon in 0.2.1b a little bit out of date already and it's a time for new one


[09-Mar-19 08:31 PM] TonyL#3577
But it seems that you exiting with not full strength so can't carry all what you have in invetory to the next game


[09-Mar-19 08:31 PM] wookie#7663
sometimes it's with low HP, but often strength is not full


[09-Mar-19 08:31 PM] TonyL#3577
You can carry only `strength * 2 ` itmes


[09-Mar-19 08:32 PM] wookie#7663
I see, you need Full strength to carry inventory over to next game??


[09-Mar-19 08:32 PM] TonyL#3577
So if let's say you had 20 items, but exited with strength 5 - you'll start next game with 10 items only


[09-Mar-19 08:32 PM] wookie#7663
definitely did not know about that feature!


[09-Mar-19 08:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, quite tricky üòÉ I hope James will make some print in rogue üòÉ


[09-Mar-19 08:33 PM] TonyL#3577
But it seems logical feature - warrior more strength so can carry more


[09-Mar-19 08:34 PM] wookie#7663
that makes sense, I just didn't know that that feature affects the next game.


[09-Mar-19 08:34 PM] TonyL#3577

I think its same issue which @ronyi  had - when bailout transactions weren't accepted by chain nodes


[09-Mar-19 08:35 PM] wookie#7663
oh, it's no problem! it's not really "negative". Just a slight frustration when I go to level 10 with good things and 1000+ gold but then lose the warrior.


[09-Mar-19 08:36 PM] wookie#7663
I'm still happy having a game to play and "contributing" the little that I can!

that's interesting, gonna try it out now. brb


[09-Mar-19 08:37 PM] TonyL#3577
If you got `extracted` print with all progress - it means that warrior should  be saved and return to you after succesful bailout


[09-Mar-19 08:41 PM] wookie#7663
yes, I do have game txid, how would I go about getting the warrior back? right now it says I have 0 warrior


[09-Mar-19 08:49 PM] TonyL#3577
@wookie Try to ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22gametxid%22]\"```


[09-Mar-19 08:51 PM] TonyL#3577
And then check if generated txid is on blockchain


[09-Mar-19 08:55 PM] wookie#7663
yeah, I put in the generated txid in the explorer and it says "no matching records found"


[09-Mar-19 08:57 PM] wookie#7663
any way to "push" the txid onto the chain?


[09-Mar-19 08:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Try the following please:
In one terminal window:
```tail -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/Komodo/ROGUE/debug.log```
In second:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22gametxid%22]\"```

And check what first window printing after bailout call

[09-Mar-19 11:30 PM] ronyi#5719
I tested strenght > 20 case. My strenght 21 and my inventory is contained strenght 20 items. I quit with strenght 21 and started new game with strenght 21.


[09-Mar-19 11:33 PM] TonyL#3577
So maybe ring of sustain strength is a clue


[09-Mar-19 11:36 PM] ronyi#5719
I used ring of sustain strength in both cases just now my inventory was  less.


[09-Mar-19 11:39 PM] ronyi#5719
Now testing 21 strenght and full inventory again, lets see what i give the abyss. üòÑ


[09-Mar-19 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
the actual strength is used, so if magic is enhancing it, it goes away when being extracted, as all magic is disabled then


[09-Mar-19 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
the game is very strange indeed, @TonyL investigating. it looks like things are much better, but still edge cases left to fix


[09-Mar-19 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
what about windows? did deckers build make things work?

[09-Mar-19 11:44 PM] ronyi#5719
i use gain strenght potions and ring of sustain strenght. Now my all items in my inventory intresting.

```


[09-Mar-19 11:53 PM] jl777c#5810
on the node that you played the game, there should be rogue.409...609.1, .2, .3 ... files


[09-Mar-19 11:53 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the total size of all those files?


[09-Mar-19 11:59 PM] TonyL#3577
@wookie could you please `ls -la | grep rogue.4093377559412155609` in komodod directory when you'll have a chance?


[10-Mar-19 12:00 AM] TonyL#3577
(it's not mine but wookie's game)


[10-Mar-19 12:01 AM] jl777c#5810
he is running latest komodod?


[10-Mar-19 12:01 AM] jl777c#5810
with the keystrokes fix


[10-Mar-19 12:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it looks like a lost keystrokes


[10-Mar-19 12:02 AM] TonyL#3577
He using bundle and bundle have 3 days old jl777 komodod


[10-Mar-19 12:03 AM] TonyL#3577
I think it's good idea to publish very latest daemon updated bundles


[10-Mar-19 12:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont think anything changed in last 3 days though


[10-Mar-19 12:04 AM] TonyL#3577
I've used daemon in bundle after huge fixes oriented on keystrokes order


[10-Mar-19 12:04 AM] jl777c#5810
the replay log shows he went negative hp at 7667, so it does seem a missing keystrokes somehow


[10-Mar-19 12:05 AM] jl777c#5810
by concatenating the .1, .2, ... files and comparing it to the .0 file, we can see what the difference in actual keystrokes vs keystrokes tx is. until then we are just guessing

In low levels with new or reused warriors no problem, but higher levels not always smoothly. Usually after lvl7 problems begin.

a lot of play to create strong warrior, that without problems farming above lvl 7. Begin at lvl3 R cause -strenght necessary (strenght potions or ring), above A cause armor problem (leather armor, but necessary enchant armor scrolls), and I didn't even talk about a weapon and hypothermia. üòÑ i don't figured out an antidote to hypothermia

Not sure what happened. But I've been getting this error this morning when trying to start TUI: 
ROGUE not synced yet.

ROGUE not synced yet.

TUI started up and played fine last night. How do I fix this?


[10-Mar-19 10:25 AM] SHossain#0007
1. stop ROGUE and TUI
2. start ROGUE with `-reindex` param or delete chain data (except wallet.dat & ROGUE.conf) and start again

I'm on my laptop and I don't have ROGUE installed here. Can anyone do me a favor real quick and run a search in the `komodo/src/` directory for the `keystrokes.log` file?

I need the path directory for documentation.


[10-Mar-19 04:15 PM] wookie#7663
@SHossain I first tried deleting all files except wallet and .conf, then restarting daemon, but I got stuck on block 50901. So I stopped the daemon then restarted with -reindex, but I'm still stuck on 50901. Any ideas what to try next?

Hmm, it seems like your warrior was detected as dead on lvl15 or lvl16 by some reason

I think beatween lvl 15 and lvl16 it was a teleportation trap.

Hi @TonyL üëã
re: ```I'm stuck on 50901 as well```
 fyi, I got stuck on `50901` in ubuntu 18.04 yesterday.  A lot of `make clean` and `./zcutil/build.sh` got me past it without anymore trouble.

ronyi quit on lvl18, but his last keystoke locally is rogue.seed.16 with 0 size (it means that he was detected as dead on this level I wonder). Content or rogue.seed.15 is above and it ends with Qy

Hmm you playing in non standart terminal?


[11-Mar-19 03:13 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes.


[11-Mar-19 03:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Could you please play future games in standart terminal? (I think it would be better to use same env + non standart terminal combinations might confuse replay parser)


[11-Mar-19 03:18 AM] TonyL#3577
For example I'm not sure if replays parser was ready for such keystrokes sequence ```kkhhkkeakQQQ li ```


[11-Mar-19 03:27 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes of course.


[11-Mar-19 03:41 AM] ronyi#5719
I played terminus almost always, I don't think this would be a problem. From herre i use always terminal.


[11-Mar-19 03:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it not causing problems - but just to remove this variable from equitation
```In terminus shift+up arrow=Q``` - such key combinations may create non-standard keystrokes


[11-Mar-19 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
agreed, we need to get it working stable first before experimenting with non-standard things


[11-Mar-19 03:56 AM] ronyi#5719
I think keystrokes say, my warrior is not dead, just i quit, turn not. If i quit, that could be dead?


[11-Mar-19 04:05 AM] jl777c#5810
something strange is going on for sure. i think when we fix the windows, it could stabilize these strange things


[11-Mar-19 04:08 AM] ronyi#5719
Thanks TonyL and James, i trying to help, but often frustrating. Sorry. Playing many days building warriors, and once quit and dead. Tester life...

building ROGUE version of komodod is the same as the normal komodod


[11-Mar-19 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
it just links in whatever libcc.so is in ~/komodo/src when being built

[11-Mar-19 09:50 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes, trying.


[11-Mar-19 11:05 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Each time I had run it , the game and map was drawn oddly.


[11-Mar-19 11:08 AM] SHossain#0007
do you have a screenshot @Cryptofist ?


[11-Mar-19 11:25 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I may.... I think so.


[11-Mar-19 11:27 AM] SHossain#0007

hmmm....strange. i found that only using pure windows. let me try with winbuntu


[11-Mar-19 11:37 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Two + weeks ago. ^


[11-Mar-19 11:37 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I used the Ubuntu app for win 10 specifically. Just FYI


[11-Mar-19 11:38 AM] Cryptofist#7504
It would also redraw part of the map next to me as I moved.


[11-Mar-19 11:38 AM] SHossain#0007
yep, i'll use the same to see if i can reproduce it

[11-Mar-19 12:32 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe it was fixed, since you seen that 2 weeks ago


[11-Mar-19 12:32 PM] Cryptofist#7504
Perhaps! I was wondering if it could have been.

[11-Mar-19 08:19 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Are there any tech team members here who have time to review the ROGUE documentation?

It is almost finished, but needs review, and there are items in the tables that baseline need information.

If anyone can help, the best way to do so is to fork the repository to your local github account, make sure you are on dev branch, write right over the top of anything that is inaccurate, and then submit all changes to me as a pull request. I will correct for grammar, voice, etc.


[11-Mar-19 10:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Sure, will do asap


[12-Mar-19 04:48 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Hey! @Bryan_Beus  Looks great! This part is not a bug... 
```:::tip Quick Tip Some users report that typing the letter s on the keyboard does not properly execute the save game command. If this is an issue, instead use SHIFT + Q. :::```
It was intentionally disabled  and quitting is the only way to save.

Hmm if you not imported you privkey / setup same wallet.dat and pubkey on OSX - this game was played on Ubuntu I wonder


[13-Mar-19 07:11 AM] ronyi#5719
checking whether the linker accepts -Wl,-z,relro... no

Ohh, i stuid, used ./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc).... sorry


[13-Mar-19 07:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, on Ubuntu game replay finishing with `586 gold`
In `extract` print ```"extracted": "$$$gold.620 hp.27 strength.21/21 level.7 exp.608 dl.6"```


[13-Mar-19 07:13 AM] TonyL#3577
620 vs 586 hmm


[13-Mar-19 07:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Let's check on OSX when it build

Finished build


[13-Mar-19 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
yes the 620 vs 586 was the difference, the question is what is different about the replay on osx


[13-Mar-19 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
and i wonder what windows does


[13-Mar-19 07:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh - would be interesting to check it on windows as well yep


[13-Mar-19 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
if windows is 620, maybe it is the unix that is wrong


[13-Mar-19 07:17 AM] TonyL#3577
ROGUE on OSX continued to sync after 50901 block reconsidering


[13-Mar-19 07:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Brb in 10 minutes and will compare replays of this game from 3 platforms


[13-Mar-19 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
in the io.c if ( 0 ) statement you can log the player gold amount


[13-Mar-19 07:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Synced OSX fine

On windows it's ` "extracted": "$$$gold.620 hp.27 strength.21/21 level.7 exp.608 dl.6",` 620 same as on unix - but I have FSM daemon without latest fixes on both unix and windows


[13-Mar-19 07:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Wow, on windows replay ends with 620 gold


[13-Mar-19 07:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Only platform on which it ends with 620 gold


[13-Mar-19 07:37 AM] TonyL#3577
@ronyi try to`brew install libidn2`


[13-Mar-19 07:38 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c it seems that at the moment full replay playing only on windows


[13-Mar-19 07:39 AM] TonyL#3577
And I'm using Deckers `rogue` here


[13-Mar-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
deckers build likely doesnt have the latest code


[13-Mar-19 07:39 AM] TonyL#3577
`rogue` itself he sent me tonight


[13-Mar-19 07:40 AM] TonyL#3577
daemon is pretty old FSM on both unix and win


[13-Mar-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
i merged his fixes in, so any new build will have latest


[13-Mar-19 07:40 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh I see


[13-Mar-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
without the most recent, it will say 620


[13-Mar-19 07:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me try to update daemons to latest jl777 on all three platforms so


[13-Mar-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
with the latest, 586 or maybe 620, or maybe latest is fixed on all?


[13-Mar-19 07:41 AM] TonyL#3577
Have to update all platforms first - have latest jl777 only on OSX at the moment


[13-Mar-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so osx "extracted": "$$$gold.586 hp.27 strength.21/21 level.7 exp.608 dl.6"
then the bug could be fixed


[13-Mar-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
but maybe the gameplay for that game had 620...


[13-Mar-19 07:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes - thats what I'm thinking about


[13-Mar-19 07:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Because on Windows it's not just printing 620 when I'm replaying


[13-Mar-19 07:43 AM] TonyL#3577
There were more keystrokes actually


[13-Mar-19 07:44 AM] TonyL#3577

you have the .1, .2, ... files for the game?


[13-Mar-19 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it just missed the last keystrokes, that would explain the different gold,but all else matches so it seems just missed 34 gold


[13-Mar-19 07:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Only .0


[13-Mar-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to have played it locally to have the .1+ files


[13-Mar-19 07:49 AM] TonyL#3577
ronyi played this one - so maybe he have on one of his machines


[13-Mar-19 07:49 AM] TonyL#3577
But .0 ending with Qy on all platforms


[13-Mar-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
I guess in io.c add gold to the log print


[13-Mar-19 08:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Is gold recording in `rogue_state` as purse?


[13-Mar-19 08:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Not played with this code so far


[13-Mar-19 08:13 AM] TonyL#3577
``` c = rs->keystrokes[rs->ind++];
            if ( 1 )
```
Changed to 1, make clean, make - but don't see any new prints on replay


[13-Mar-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
it goes into a file called "log"

But it's better to test it first (I played on new Windows rogue for ~1 hour only so far) and wait for OSX fix before spread and etc.


[13-Mar-19 11:05 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@TonyL So,we will all test and if there seems to be no issues after osx is fixed,  then we will promote them again. Correct ?


[13-Mar-19 11:07 AM] TonyL#3577
There might be an issues in long games, but we might promote em with some bounty for testing - I think yes, if James agreed on it

Things should be quite stable now (at least in singleplayer)


[13-Mar-19 11:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Multiplayer should work at least in some simple PoC tests, some difficult multiplayer cases like a when all players finishing in same block - TUI can't handle

it was a problem for all OS!


[13-Mar-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
turn_see is a normal function that was used as a daemon, and it was passed 2 args instead of 1, which changed the value it was using, depending on whatever was top of stack. very very bad and leads to memory problems or random crash, or just non-deterministic behavior


[13-Mar-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
and the longer the game the more likely this happened

@wookie Try to execute bailout manually:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 '["0669a10b3fea38193449dd90c0a0833fcb771bfe20c12c20c7c03ba48b924b8a"]'```


[14-Mar-19 09:15 PM] wookie#7663
every time?


[14-Mar-19 09:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Nope - usually it broadcast from first attempt. It seems just not in 100% of cases.

Will add now to TUI waiting for bailout tx confirmation with re-broadcasting attempts (same as for last keystroke)


[14-Mar-19 09:44 PM] wookie#7663
I just tried the manual bailout now, I get the same issue: 
in the window running the daemon, it shows only this:
extracted $$$gold.1501 -> 2.02770090 ROGUE hp.53 strength.16/16 level.9 exp.1794 dl.9 n.1 amulet.0


[14-Mar-19 09:45 PM] wookie#7663
normally there's more after that. this one is just "stuck"


[14-Mar-19 09:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Is CLI printing txid and hex on your bailout call?


[14-Mar-19 09:51 PM] wookie#7663
yes


[14-Mar-19 09:52 PM] wookie#7663
I waited a few minutes more, but nothing else came out, so I ran the manual bailout again and this time I got an extra line:
extracted $$$gold.1501 -> 2.02770090 ROGUE hp.53 strength.16/16 level.9 exp.1794 dl.9 n.1 amulet.0

Check if transaction id generated by bailout call appears in explorer / mempool


[14-Mar-19 09:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's just not confirmed yet

In one terminal window:
tail -f ~/Library/Application\ Support/Komodo/ROGUE/debug.log

In second:
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 \"[%22gametxid%22]\"


And check what first window printing after bailout call


[14-Mar-19 10:01 PM] wookie#7663
got this:

Could you please share your call and full CLI output here please (with hex)?

the first one when I first exited the game, or the one from the manual bailout?

I have problems with bailout broadcasting also (on Linux).
Maybe bailout transactions not broadcasting at all at the moment, hmm.
Added to TUI attempt to broadcast until it on blockchain:
```

So tried manual:

```

Oh, and for this game with `couldnt finalize CCtx` - just bailout already done so made mistake somewhere in fresh commit logic

Hmm for `decoderawtransaction wookieshex` getting ```error code: -22

Added waiting for bailout confirmation to TUI - so now such cases detecting by long waiting (when bailout not broadcasting on chain)


[14-Mar-19 11:19 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder this problem was actual before - just wasn't tracked (both ronyi and wookie reported before about similar cases - now with tracking easiliy reproduced on my side)


[15-Mar-19 12:48 AM] jl777c#5810
it looks like it is using a vin that got reorged. the bailout needs to be done again and post the rawtx

pushed fix. non-consensus change, so no need to update all nodes, just nodes that have this problem


[15-Mar-19 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it was indeed a problem with short games, where the gold cashout was less than the txfee


[15-Mar-19 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
this made it not generate the cashout vout2, which then would fail the vout2 check in validation


[15-Mar-19 01:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so games with less than 10000 satoshi reward were affected?


[15-Mar-19 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, all such short games would have failed


[15-Mar-19 01:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Yay, it's huge fix!


[15-Mar-19 01:20 AM] TonyL#3577
May it somehow be connected with not passing bailout of wookie?
He have a long game and bailout not accepting with:
```2019-03-15 05:00:37 ERROR: CheckTransaction(): txout.nValue negative

@wookie When you'll be with PC:
Could you please restart daemon with --daemon param (restart to be sure that see all prints) and call again: ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 "[%220669a10b3fea38193449dd90c0a0833fcb771bfe20c12c20c7c03ba48b924b8a%22]"``` and post full output to: https://paste.ubuntu.com

that seems different. what is the decoded tx?


[15-Mar-19 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
does it have a negative vout value?


[15-Mar-19 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if so, which value


[15-Mar-19 01:22 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm getting ```error code: -22
error message:

```


[15-Mar-19 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
likely due to cut and paste error


[15-Mar-19 01:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe in hex missing some symbols because it was pasted in two messages


[15-Mar-19 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
or CRLF added?

[15-Mar-19 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
that would cause a parse error

There is a fix for games with less than 10000 satoshies reward - but it's not in bundles yet


[15-Mar-19 07:45 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok, So should I try to get above 10k sats  and see if the warrior saves for now?


[15-Mar-19 07:45 AM] TonyL#3577
We have to check if latest  fix resolves wookies issue. And if it's fine now - I'll update bundles


[15-Mar-19 07:46 AM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptofist yes please - for games with rewards >10000 sat bailout should work


[15-Mar-19 07:47 AM] Cryptofist#7504
If I can make it that far with a fresh start.


[15-Mar-19 07:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Rewards calculating as: ```rogueshis = gold * gold * level * 10```


[15-Mar-19 07:47 AM] Cryptofist#7504
super hard mode activated.  
Maybe ill start with an older address


[15-Mar-19 07:48 AM] TonyL#3577
So 10000 satoshies not so long game - even 50 gold on level 2  - it's 50000 rogueshis already


[15-Mar-19 07:56 AM] Cryptofist#7504
Ok. I saw you guys talk about the level  calculation changes a bit, just to make sure I understand fully, Dungeon level 3 exit would be a higher amount of rogue than Dungeon level two, with the same amount of gold ? 
For 50 Gold on dungeon level 2
 50* 50 * 2* 10 = 50000
For 50 Gold on dungeon level 3
50* 50 * 3 * 10=75000

Thats strange, TUI not caching anything anywhere - just requesting data again when you calling menu item

always the icemonster. maybe there is an edgecase there

Death from hyperthermia is RNG based - maybe it's changing the seed

i dont see anything strange in the death by icemonster path

```Maybe back to dex and multiplayer items next?

[16-Mar-19 08:40 PM] TonyL#3577
And its extracted progress for dl3 in ronyi game, so all keystroke tx were mined in order - just some last key presses missed in replay what caused not matching of gold amounts. So I think its reproducing of this last remained known bug

[18-Mar-19 01:12 AM] TonyL#3577
@ronyi Could you please zip all keystrokes for this game seed and send me in DM?


[18-Mar-19 01:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Actually for both would be great, just mark somehow which zip is for which problem description or gametxid


[18-Mar-19 01:14 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes of course.


[18-Mar-19 01:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Thinking to make updated bundles today - so maybe we'll find out this problem roots and solve it before ü§û


[18-Mar-19 01:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah and also attach please: `cat keystrokes.log | grep gametxid` output


[18-Mar-19 02:13 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c Could you please have a look on this game?

It have not many keystrokes so maybe easy to find out the issue. @ronyi died on lvl1 by hypertermina. 
Extracted keystrokes matching with his local ones: 
```cat rogue.2957615466801226752.0

Last frame in replay "you're frozen by icemonster"

It don't have Qy in the end. 
Also what is sucpicious ronyi locally have empty ```rogue.2957615466801226752.2``` by some reason (but died on lvl1) - maybe it's the clue.


[18-Mar-19 02:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, I have to check in `if ( 1 )` log also


[18-Mar-19 02:19 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/jxW9qxk3QF/ is it fine that seed changing more than 10 times in single dungeon level game? I'm checking mine replays and seed changing only once per room or so


[18-Mar-19 02:21 AM] TonyL#3577
Also 247 keystrokes in `log` while in extract `"numkeys": 248,`


[18-Mar-19 02:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Also other case (it looks different to icemonster case): https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/7WCrjFtxzt/

Where progress partially missed, hmm

One `h` after `>` - I think I saw it before when checked keystrokes of games with lost progress. Anyway it looks like a bug because it's not possible to move on level when you used stairs

Another hypotheria killed, but warrior is alive.


[18-Mar-19 03:37 AM] TonyL#3577
Same last frame "You are frozen by ice monster"


[18-Mar-19 03:37 AM] TonyL#3577
So something not correct happens in "You are frozen by ice monster -> Death because of hyperthermia" case imo

Updated Rogue bundle.

```Changes since 0.3.0:

    Fixes in ROGUE RPC:
    fix for small gold reward (<10000 sat) games
    fix negative vout3 (change calc fixes?)

    TUI waiting for bailout to be mined now (should help to track when bailout not broadcasting by some reason + clearing process with warrior appearing in playerslist)
```

Opened problems remained: 
1) part of progress missing in some cases - have not many ideas so far. I wonder have to change io.c to get more info into the log.
2) ice monster not killing warriors - might be related to 1 

@wookie When you'll be with PC/have a chance - please try to bailout from your game with negative vout  about which you've reported with fresh OSX bundle  ( ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 "[%220669a10b3fea38193449dd90c0a0833fcb771bfe20c12c20c7c03ba48b924b8a%22]")

@jl777c Is it ^^ giving some clue to problem code paths?

In previous game with lost progress there was fight with `kestrel` too before things went wrong


[18-Mar-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
realistically I will need to dig into this as they require understanding what exactly happened in the code. in commands.c you can log the characters. kestrel is just a common early level monster, probably coincidence

Yeaah, same as in previous game


[18-Mar-19 10:19 AM] TonyL#3577
`h>fl` symbols after `>`


[18-Mar-19 10:20 AM] TonyL#3577
And in previous game with missed progress you reported:
```hhl>h``` on level after which progress missed


[18-Mar-19 10:20 AM] TonyL#3577
So it's not so non-det now I wonder


[18-Mar-19 10:23 AM] TonyL#3577
At least now it's clear (I hope) that progress is missing when in keystrokes for level presists some symbols after `>`


[18-Mar-19 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
so the .0 file does not match the sum of the .1, .2, ... files?


[18-Mar-19 10:24 AM] TonyL#3577
@ronyi could you please `ls -la | grep rogue.817135201493258637` ?

if the contents match then it is a non-det issue

[18-Mar-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the replay shows a level 1 but the exit (stairs) are not visible. so it could be a search that somehow didnt work in the replay, but without knowing what the original gameplay was like not sure how to solve this one


[18-Mar-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810

In replay he even not reaching left room with stairs


[18-Mar-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, so you need to find when it diverges and that is the non-det event


[18-Mar-19 10:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh it would be much more easier with possibility to watch replay keystroke by keystroke


[18-Mar-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
just slowdown the replay


[18-Mar-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
in rogue.c


[18-Mar-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a sleeptime*1000 or something like that


[18-Mar-19 10:47 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, ok


[18-Mar-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
make it a bigger number


[18-Mar-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
if you add logging at the end of command() in commands.c, basically a copy paste of the io.c logging code (using a different name than "log")


[18-Mar-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
then you can see the keystrokes

then it is not a keystrokes tx problem!


[18-Mar-19 10:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, so it's clear now how to determine this non-det - will try to find it out now


[18-Mar-19 10:51 AM] ronyi#5719
I played another game(lvl1-6) without problem. I think i playing one more almost sure....bug.

plz confirm this! alternative good/bad is quite unlikely, but not impossible as anything is possible

[18-Mar-19 11:01 AM] TonyL#3577
In replay things starting to go out of sync after defeating of  non existing `kestrel`


[18-Mar-19 11:02 AM] TonyL#3577
This fight with `kestrel` presists in replay but not presists in actual game, then in replay he go back to top right room to pickup dropped armor - but actually he never do that


[18-Mar-19 11:04 AM] TonyL#3577
There are no scrolls, no potions - just armor drop and pickup - then movement to left room. In replay there is a fight with `kestrel` in hall, in actual game he just moved and actually fighted with `kestrel` but a little bit later in other map place (in other hall)


[18-Mar-19 11:05 AM] TonyL#3577
After this fight with non-existing kestrel things starting to go wrong


[18-Mar-19 11:06 AM] TonyL#3577

In extracted replay fight is in ellipse hall, in actual game in rectangle one
Then in extracted replay warrior back to pickup armor to the right direction, but in actual game he went into rectangle zone and fighted here, than back without armor picking up


[18-Mar-19 11:10 AM] TonyL#3577
So maybe this non-det even is connected with monsters spawn


[18-Mar-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
seems so. out of curiosity are the length of the 2 hallways the same? did the K appear in the same place in each?


[18-Mar-19 11:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh it interesting to check


[18-Mar-19 11:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Length not the same

[18-Mar-19 11:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Hall where original fight happened is longer :troll_compadre:


[18-Mar-19 11:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Ahaa thats match with my previous finding about fight as well (second game with progress losing interrupting after fight with kestrel. By interruption I mean moment when gold progress stops to count) - problem is monsters in non expected places ohh


[18-Mar-19 11:16 AM] TonyL#3577
I hope rogue don't have some troll code like a "random monsters generating in halls"


[18-Mar-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as it uses the normal RNG it can have that


[18-Mar-19 11:21 AM] TonyL#3577
normal means pseudo one?


[18-Mar-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the standard way it gets a new random number everywhere in the code


[18-Mar-19 11:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Sorry, just don't know which events generating from block entropy


[18-Mar-19 11:24 AM] TonyL#3577
So if monster appeared in non predicted place - it means that seed changed by some reason I wonder, last things which warrior did is pickup / drop armor


[18-Mar-19 11:24 AM] TonyL#3577
When armor creating by in-game RNG determining if it cursed (or maybe on pickup stage - not sure)


[18-Mar-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
each RNG calc updates seed


[18-Mar-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the only external setting of seed is at the beginning


[18-Mar-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
user actions determine what RNG to calc


[18-Mar-19 11:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Ohh, I'm out of ideas sorry


[18-Mar-19 11:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Will compare now video and extracted replay for previous game - maybe will catch something in it

game state fix will require confirmation that restarting ROGUE daemon before each game does fix things


[18-Mar-19 12:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, testing it atm


[18-Mar-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
then I will move all possible state that isnt cleared into globals

@wookie Please stop current daemo, start daemon from this archive: https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui/releases/download/0.1/daemon_for_wookie.zip
And try to bailout then


[18-Mar-19 01:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Ah, also daemon from archive should be placed to bundle folder (just replace current daemon files) - otherwise it will not find rogue if you'll try to play with it

So can't reproduce on my side, maybe it's realted to itemization/gameplay style - let's say ronyi using rings as  I know but I dont have any


[18-Mar-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, ronyi is advanced player and must be doing something rarely


[18-Mar-19 01:41 PM] TonyL#3577
Let's wait for ronyi expertise so. Maybe he can try to play without rings lets say or not use some jedi-tricks in a few games to compare extraction. Or if daemon restart will help will be really easier to `move all possible state that isnt cleared into globals`


[18-Mar-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, first is for him to do exactly the same just a restart of daemon before every game. it that makes things reliable, then it is some internal state. i am not thinking this is very likely as the internal replay happens N times and each time it is the same. if there was something specific to initial time, it wouldnt always extract the same. still we need to eliminate this. then it would be some advanced gameplay method that causes the non-det

@TonyL did exactly what you said, placed the new daemon into the latest rogue bundle. then started daemon and executed the manual bailout command. 
It worked!!! My ROGUE is on the blockchain now too!
Here's the output:

@wookie Is it fine without re-starts as well?


[19-Mar-19 03:39 AM] TonyL#3577
I've built everything on `VERSION="18.04.2 LTS (Bionic Beaver)"` so maybe it's some Xenial deps specific issue @ronyi if daemon compiled on my PC not starting on yours

@ronyi can you play with same pubkey/wallet on other platform  bundle(OSX or Windows) with same playstyle as on your Ubuntu?

[19-Mar-19 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
I guess what we need to do is identify the exact point of divergence for each non-det and then see if a pattern emerges. i will look at identify scroll potion to see it rng usage


[19-Mar-19 04:16 AM] TonyL#3577
First game where I've used identification scrolls interrupting on moment where I used it


[19-Mar-19 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
is it any scroll or just specific ones?


[19-Mar-19 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, that is a big clue!


[19-Mar-19 04:17 AM] TonyL#3577

[19-Mar-19 04:17 AM] TonyL#3577

Yup


[19-Mar-19 04:23 AM] TonyL#3577

[19-Mar-19 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no rnd() calls with those scrolls. but maybe memory corruption from changing name


[19-Mar-19 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you are not making user input, it just sets a flag that you know about that item

Have to try write down all places with scrolls usage so


[19-Mar-19 04:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh video not availiable yet @ronyi want to check did you use scrolls or potions with gold 1578

Oh, actually you can check it in `rogue.seed.9` I wonder


[19-Mar-19 04:27 AM] TonyL#3577
If there are some `r` on lvl9 and no `r` on levels before - it may be a clue

[19-Mar-19 04:34 AM] TonyL#3577
1) You used enchancement armor scroll
2) You found identify scroll scroll and used it on echancement armor scroll
3) You used enchanacement armor scroll again


[19-Mar-19 04:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Somewhere after this point progress is missing/corrupted

I bet that if you'll try to play without scrolls usage - progress will be fully saved

Where my game stopped - I've picked up many items and iventory was full too on some point

How to pick up more items?


[19-Mar-19 05:16 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm not sure - hmm you have 45 items in inventory on screenshot, but print showing 46 vs total 47 and you have 19 letters but print showing 21 inventory letters


[19-Mar-19 05:17 AM] TonyL#3577

[19-Mar-19 05:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Inventory counters may cause corruption as well I wonder (especially if something couting not correct / not as expected)
`i will just scrub every last static variable that isnt const` - so maybe it will help in case if it is the clue


[19-Mar-19 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
made half a dozen changes, none of which I can see how it explains the issues, but then again this bug is not an obvious one

maybe things works exactly the same, or it is totally broken, but likely something in between. just test in unix

it seems there is an issue with icemonsters. you freeze and seem dead, but thaw out and can be used again

until we isolate the non-det, all extra info helps. if you can play without scrolls (or without rings or without potions) and things are stable, then we at least can narrow it down to the type of magic that causes the non-det

2 slow digestion ring and warrior exp was 181 dropped some potions, but in this game i used only rings.


[20-Mar-19 01:45 AM] ronyi#5719
Just simple idea, somehow possible printf all variable, const while playing?
4 games playing(dlvl 1-3) without ring everything is good.
1 game wtih 2 slow digestion ring and everything is good.


[20-Mar-19 01:55 AM] jl777c#5810
there are too many variables 100+


[20-Mar-19 01:55 AM] jl777c#5810

[20-Mar-19 02:35 AM] ronyi#5719
Intresting game i started this game with full strenght and 2 rings missing. Game extracted fine, but some thing is not good in strenght (inventory, items) calculation. Somehow possible pickup more items i think.

[20-Mar-19 03:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Can you try to play with fresh warrior / re-use him and never fill inventory fully? (just drop not needed item before pickup to keep items amount ~const)


[20-Mar-19 03:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Now it looks like inventory is a thing which working a little bit not as expected. And with fresh warriors progress extracting fine almost 100% cases I think no matters of gameplahy


[20-Mar-19 03:03 AM] TonyL#3577
So I'm thinking that it's like this maybe because inventory never reaching edge states for games with fresh ones


[20-Mar-19 03:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Unpacking / stacking + items packs + strength formula with non-constant strength + rings which can protect it


[20-Mar-19 03:05 AM] TonyL#3577
For me it seems as trickiest stuff in whole game, and rogue code for it (interaction with inventory) is super tricky as well


[20-Mar-19 03:06 AM] TonyL#3577
+ you're loosing some items when you shouldn't


[20-Mar-19 03:07 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes, with fresh warriors no problem. How to know my inventory is full or not? Yes strenght*2, but if possible pick up more items and sometimes calculate good and sometimes not and sometimes i have 48item, but my inventory size is 54 and can't pick up items. I testing my lvl9 warriors without rings.


[20-Mar-19 03:08 AM] TonyL#3577
I've analyzed some videos tonight - and have an idea now that progress might be lost after some item pickup / drop with inventory edge case


[20-Mar-19 03:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Try to play re-usage game without much items pickup let's say and compare stability


[20-Mar-19 03:08 AM] ronyi#5719
Sounds good.


[20-Mar-19 03:09 AM] ronyi#5719
Maybe good test. Using rings, but inventory never full?


[20-Mar-19 03:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, play as usual but try to keep amount of items in inventory low

{Reactions}
üëå 

[20-Mar-19 03:10 AM] TonyL#3577
And maybe it's better to create fresh warrior for this test which never had huge inventory in his adventures (let's say maybe current warriors inventory already corrupted / causing corruption because of huge size)


[20-Mar-19 03:12 AM] ronyi#5719
If i create new warrior and using gain strenght potion = huge inventory = inventory corruption?


[20-Mar-19 03:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe gained strength working not correctly because of something hardcoded in original rogue code, or maybe when invetory is full some counter working not correct


[20-Mar-19 03:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Just think that it's a hugest bottleneck because of amonut of code


[20-Mar-19 03:18 AM] TonyL#3577
Playing without changing original max strength is a good test as well, also maybe might be a good idea temporary disable `strength*2` max inventory rule and return this logic to the original one to see if it helps


[20-Mar-19 03:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Problems after strength gaining looks probably - I think on place where I lost progress yesterday I've quaffed strength restore + strength gain potions also besides of the scrolls usage


[20-Mar-19 04:09 AM] ronyi#5719
I played a game(dlvl 8) now and my inventory was never full. Everything worked good.

I played several games yesterday on MacOS i did not notice  any inventory major loss. But I did not monitor if it was  correctly doing so. I'll keep an eye on it today.


[20-Mar-19 06:33 AM] wookie#7663
Are ronyi's Ubuntu errors expected on MacOS? If so, I can see if i can recreate it. or is it os specific?


[20-Mar-19 06:34 AM] ronyi#5719
I playing on ubuntu.


[20-Mar-19 09:11 AM] ronyi#5719
Now try to play on os x with my warriors.


[20-Mar-19 09:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Is behaviour on Ubuntu the same with not full inventory?


[20-Mar-19 09:13 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes, sometimes good,but rather bad.


[20-Mar-19 09:19 AM] ronyi#5719
We know, but in the firrst game on os x hypothermia killed (one hit) and yes warrior is alive. I think maybe hypothermia it has no effect my another warrior this warrior carry in the inventory(light wand, cold wand) still testing. 3 short games witout problem, now playing long game.
"Long" game: 
 1  1554 Test: quit on level 8.

Intresting... playing another one.


[20-Mar-19 10:17 AM] TonyL#3577
200164 experience ?


[20-Mar-19 10:17 AM] TonyL#3577
And you have now warrior with such experience?


[20-Mar-19 10:17 AM] TonyL#3577

[20-Mar-19 10:19 AM] TonyL#3577
It looks like a new bug after latest changes for variables


[20-Mar-19 10:23 AM] TonyL#3577
In game replay warrior starting with 200,000 experience


[20-Mar-19 10:23 AM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib extract 17  "[%224201a3f7b3f2b869b0e52d3b9d4795c138f2a94f625b5b7d52d447d829a62b85%22,%220325151cf0f7321d0cde232898c5adc6b60f32df71b79af3a49d10020d42925ae9%22]"

```
In this one you starting with 2000


[20-Mar-19 10:28 AM] TonyL#3577
But then funny things happens - after some fight your experience doubling, and after other one doubling again


[20-Mar-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so we still have non-det issues but now some strange things happening?


[20-Mar-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe I should revert?


[20-Mar-19 10:29 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh and replay seems to be corrupted in the end for last one - you moving back in fourth in same room for many keystrokes


[20-Mar-19 10:29 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c yes, still progress losing (part of game replay corrupting) + now experience counting not correct


[20-Mar-19 10:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Unfortunately it does not seems like a latest changes helped for anything


[20-Mar-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
reverted

I wonder if the chain will sync now with such high experience

[20-Mar-19 10:33 AM] TonyL#3577
`facepalm`


[20-Mar-19 10:33 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes terminator with +11 leather armor [protection 13]
A +7,+6 two handed sword.


[20-Mar-19 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
how much for that player?


[20-Mar-19 10:34 AM] TonyL#3577
I thought you're playing on latest, so maybe revert was hasty. My fault


[20-Mar-19 10:36 AM] TonyL#3577
So only OSX 0.3.0 bundled version creating terminators atm?


[20-Mar-19 10:36 AM] ronyi#5719
I transfer for you jl777 or TonyL for better testing.


[20-Mar-19 10:37 AM] ronyi#5719
No, ubuntu with jl777 "lastest"(reverted) version.


[20-Mar-19 10:38 AM] TonyL#3577
But before when you played today on Ubuntu - everything was fine with experience?


[20-Mar-19 10:38 AM] ronyi#5719
Yes, but after i think lvl9 or lvl 10 used 5(6) raise lvl potion.


[20-Mar-19 10:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Ahhh so it's not a bug - just valid level raising by level raising potions


[20-Mar-19 10:40 AM] TonyL#3577
If you're raising level - experience raising to reach minimum needed for this level


[20-Mar-19 10:40 AM] TonyL#3577
I thought you got such experience because of bug. But if you quaff 5-6 potions of lvl raise on lvl10 and get lvl16 with relevant experience - it's not a bug


[20-Mar-19 10:42 AM] ronyi#5719
I think not, but sorry, i see randomly my warriors exp....


[20-Mar-19 10:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Missmatch between extracted and actual experience in case of game corruption was yesterday as well, yup


[20-Mar-19 10:44 AM] TonyL#3577
It should be related to the fact of corruption I wonder - because after this moment warrior moving randomly in replay on same level (it' using keystrokes from next actions/locations) but not changing level to other one


[20-Mar-19 10:44 AM] ronyi#5719
If you or jl777 send pubkey i transfer this warrior, if it is possible.


[20-Mar-19 10:45 AM] TonyL#3577
You can place it on marketplace - maybe somebody will buy him üòÉ


[20-Mar-19 10:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Gift for free it's not fair for this terminator efforts


[20-Mar-19 10:47 AM] ronyi#5719
üòÑ I'd rather kill this warrior. No value, just playing for fun and helping this project.


[20-Mar-19 10:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, I wonder that only way to detect what is the clue is very scrupulous review all videos/replays which you sent these days, print as many as possible info about actions in log


[20-Mar-19 10:48 AM] TonyL#3577
And make a list of possible actions which caused missmatch


[20-Mar-19 10:49 AM] TonyL#3577
My only fear is the case if not any concerete actions connected to this bug and it's causing by some mem corruption let's say üòÉ


[20-Mar-19 10:49 AM] ronyi#5719
If i transfer this warrior you or/and james possible monitoring in real-time... I think it is easier.


[20-Mar-19 10:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, if you want to give him: 
`027d28d7d59ac499fac55f89b9e06933d66aaf74435c48326d83f8fbc6a7b14e85` :)
But anyway you've prepared a lot of material which just needs to be propertly analyzed


[20-Mar-19 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm actually I even no need to watch videos/replays a lot I think - I just need to print in `log` list of actions and after corruption point gold amount became const


[20-Mar-19 10:59 AM] ronyi#5719

In this game things went wrong after you read unidentified scroll which turned out to be "magic mapping scroll" which revealing map


[20-Mar-19 11:26 AM] ronyi#5719
Just starting... üòÑ Strong warrior with good stuff this is fix. üòÑ


[20-Mar-19 11:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe abracadabra named scrolls is the problem ü§î


[20-Mar-19 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Played short game where used abrakadabra scrolls, and some others - let's see if it extracted fully üòÉ


[20-Mar-19 11:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Found a method to exclude things - use something, pick-up gold, use something, pick-up gold ...


[20-Mar-19 11:36 AM] TonyL#3577
In the end you'll see on which gold amount extraction stucked


[20-Mar-19 11:39 AM] ronyi#5719
I many times used abrakadabra scrolls and/or potions, one time extracted fully, one time not.


[20-Mar-19 11:40 AM] TonyL#3577
And expereience not match because in replay happening fights which not happened in actual game because of random movement over map

Let's see what happened with gold 34 on dl1


[20-Mar-19 11:42 AM] TonyL#3577
First gold piece which I've actually picked up is 51, not 34

{Reactions}
ü§ï 

[20-Mar-19 11:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Second gold piece is 34, so I have 85 in total


[20-Mar-19 11:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe I started to run randomly in replay before 51 piece pickup and picked up this one


[20-Mar-19 11:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha!


[20-Mar-19 11:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Now it's clear what happening. My movement stops to match map coordinates


[20-Mar-19 11:47 AM] TonyL#3577
And it happened after I step on food and got a print "no space in inventory" and then dropped potion, and step again on food but got again print about no space in inventory


[20-Mar-19 11:49 AM] TonyL#3577
My local keystrokes match with extracted keystrokes.0


[20-Mar-19 11:50 AM] TonyL#3577
So replayer in some cases starting to missmatch player position with map coordinates


[20-Mar-19 11:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha!


[20-Mar-19 11:51 AM] TonyL#3577
`W* cc * fW* dlli `


[20-Mar-19 11:51 AM] TonyL#3577
I dropped item with letter l


[20-Mar-19 11:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe if I making an action on item which have a same letter as movement keystoke letter


[20-Mar-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can reproduce this, then it is solvable


[20-Mar-19 11:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Replayer think that I mved


[20-Mar-19 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
and mismatched position on replay will definitely cause non-det


[20-Mar-19 11:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Now it's clear I think


[20-Mar-19 11:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Funny


[20-Mar-19 11:52 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me try to reproduce


[20-Mar-19 11:53 AM] TonyL#3577
But I think it's obv that replayer can't see difference in `l` between  inventory item select and actual `l` step


[20-Mar-19 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
there are 2 of them


[20-Mar-19 11:55 AM] TonyL#3577
I dropped `l` item and then moved `l` to pickup other


[20-Mar-19 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
so those are the actual keystrokes? but on replay it didnt drop the item?


[20-Mar-19 12:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Actually it's corrupting on other moment:
```dul```

```u Move diagonally up and right.```


[20-Mar-19 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
Still reviewing - but map movement was affected after this


[20-Mar-19 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
I can see in replay print than I dropped but then I stepped on food to pick up - but instead of it I'm moving other direction


[20-Mar-19 12:06 PM] ronyi#5719
Another intresting case, no gold on lvl1, i find gold 160 on lvl2 first gold pack 34. Extacted game: dlvl 1 with 34gold


[20-Mar-19 12:12 PM] TonyL#3577
So what was in game actually:
```
I moved on food (no space in invetory)
Moved 1 step left
Dropped `u` item
Moved one step right to pick up food```


[20-Mar-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
what does replay show?


[20-Mar-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
it sort of makes sense that out of inventory is involved in this, but not sure why it is non-det


[20-Mar-19 12:14 PM] TonyL#3577
What is in replay:
```
I moved on food (no space in invetory
Moved two steps left
Moved step right
Moved step left
Dropped potion
Went away without food picking up```


[20-Mar-19 12:15 PM] TonyL#3577
I'll cut now needed fragments to demonstrate


[20-Mar-19 12:15 PM] TonyL#3577
And there was sucpicious game focus loss on this moment in actual game


[20-Mar-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so a l -> llrl ?


[20-Mar-19 12:16 PM] TonyL#3577
l -> llhl


[20-Mar-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but are the llhl chars in the keystrokes?


[20-Mar-19 12:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Confused a little bit - matching recorded keystrokes with video


[20-Mar-19 12:52 PM] TonyL#3577
Actual game fragment: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1jZYtiYAaZBoxgukJsHVl23BZomNgtv1I
Game fragment replay: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1b0eJB4aDc0HUJlLQR-8VAvOOULMkHslj

All keystrokes:  https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/9n2Z6MjGmX/

Keystrokes which should cover this fragment:
```kkkkkllllj i hhl  hi dul```


[20-Mar-19 12:53 PM] TonyL#3577
Keystrokes not match actual gameplay by some reason


[20-Mar-19 12:54 PM] TonyL#3577
I think it was when when after inventory usage game lost it's focus for some time


[20-Mar-19 12:55 PM] TonyL#3577
Until I press space again - but at first I've tried to move warrior because didn't know that there is no focus


[20-Mar-19 12:55 PM] TonyL#3577
So keystrokes which actually not moved my warrior were recorded


[20-Mar-19 01:01 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm 99% sure that this is the clue. Now only left to reliably reproduce case with focus losing (until second Space press) after inventory usage and fix it then

Screen1 - inentory in some case with visible cursor, 
After Space press - screen2 - no focus on warrior, cursor still visible in corner unti second Space press


[20-Mar-19 01:06 PM] TonyL#3577
In this moment recording not correct moves


[20-Mar-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
focus losing!


[20-Mar-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
that would affect possibly all commands


[20-Mar-19 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and that would be potentially different between game play and replay as the replay skips various screen only things


[20-Mar-19 01:09 PM] TonyL#3577
What a gremlin


[20-Mar-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
this feels like the last issue as it explains all recent issues


[20-Mar-19 01:11 PM] TonyL#3577
I've noticed that double space press sometimes needed to exit contect menu after some ncurses deps changes if I remember correct


[20-Mar-19 01:13 PM] TonyL#3577
So I think if to make `Press Space -> Close context menu and return focus on game` process reliable it will solve the issue


[20-Mar-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
it needs to be cleanly duplicated first


[20-Mar-19 01:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, working on it


[20-Mar-19 01:18 PM] TonyL#3577
Reproduced focus losing - it's happening after you checking inventory after `there is no room in your pack + you moved on %itemname%` print


[20-Mar-19 01:19 PM] TonyL#3577
To easily reproduce - you can just throw and pickup arrows until it fill inventory letters max amount

Let me check if I can put as many keystrokes as I want in this state


[20-Mar-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so focus losing is the symptom or the cause


[20-Mar-19 01:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Focus losing allows me to press buttons withiout any affection on game process but they are recording as keystrokes


[20-Mar-19 01:20 PM] TonyL#3577
So playing during the replay


[20-Mar-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess if keystrokes dont work without focus, but they go in keystrokes file that would cause non-det


[20-Mar-19 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, we say the same


[20-Mar-19 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
focus losing is the cause


[20-Mar-19 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
and it only happens when out of inventory ?


[20-Mar-19 01:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Yup - one arrow press with lost focus and futher progress lost


[20-Mar-19 01:22 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm so far I found only this way to lose it


[20-Mar-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
what causes it to lose focus at the ncurses level?


[20-Mar-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
can you have decker track this down?


[20-Mar-19 01:24 PM] TonyL#3577
Ok, I'll consult with Decker
Flow is:
```There's no room in your pack--More--```
Pressing space - then can do anything - move or fight no matters


[20-Mar-19 01:24 PM] TonyL#3577
On next inventory check I'll need to press Space twice to return control (or press ESC)

With not full inventory it should work with single space - but maybe there are some other cases in different context menus when focus losing.  Please report if you notice any case besides of full inventory when double press needed to return the focus

@TonyL I've used the latest MacOS bundle for numerous games over the last few days now. Here's the first time I've ran into an issue. I played to level 16, using both ring of slow digestion + ring of sustain strenthg, but on bailout, it only recorded keystrokes up to level 6. I kept delaying bailout for up to 10x but it was still stuck. I then tried manual bailout.

@wookie `  "error": "couldnt finalize CCtx"` means that bailout tx was mined alredy
I wonder you ran into this inventory focus issue which will be resolved soon I hope


[21-Mar-19 09:05 AM] wookie#7663
"inventory focus issue", do you mean the issue is caused by the "ring of sustain strength"?


[21-Mar-19 09:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Nope - there is an issue that when quit inventory context menu with full inventory after you step on item - focus is losing until Space is pressed again but in this moment all pressed buttons recording as keystrokes so map movement replaying not correct


[21-Mar-19 09:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm thinking now - what if try to press arrows when inventory is opened


[21-Mar-19 09:38 AM] wookie#7663
I just tried pressing arrow keys while inventory opened. Nothing happened.


[21-Mar-19 10:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Nothing happened = progress extracted fine?


[21-Mar-19 10:46 AM] wookie#7663
I pressed the arrow keys while inventory was open at the beginning of the game. Then I played to level 14 with both ring of slow digestion and ring of sustain strength. I just exited the game now, and it only recorded keystrokes to level 3:

I'm starting a game now, not gonna use ring of sustain strength to see if the problem is still there. I suspect it's the ring of sustain strength, it's the only "new" item I've used in the past few days.

how do you quit with double space?

out of curiosity, does the game difficulty vary with the number of players playing? Just trying to understand some of the mechanics: if 10 players playing simultaneously mining, vs 1000 players. Would the 1000 players get a more "difficult" game, eg earlier or more trolls/medusas ? just curious. thanks.

There was a bug with large inventory displaying (it not showed second page of inventory for a big one and it was a reason of focus losing) - so now when you check huge inventory it'll scroll page to second by Space button press and close it automatically in 5 seconds.

Is your version showing "wait 5 seconds" in inventory?

Yes, but not always and somehow still possible pickup more items

For how many levels `rogue.seed.number` were created? Also are there any errors in `cat keystrokes.log | grep gametxid` ?

@ronyi Hmm by replay it seems like bug is the same / similar


[22-Mar-19 01:10 PM] TonyL#3577
You starting to randomly run in one room on lvl13


[22-Mar-19 01:11 PM] TonyL#3577
So maybe there are still some moments without focus


[22-Mar-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
@Decker maybe we just remove that extra display part totally? it is optional data and losing player progress is much worse


[22-Mar-19 01:14 PM] ronyi#5719
Tomorrow i testing agin and creating gameplay, sorry now i can't. I don't know import or not, but the wait 5s message not always printed the full inventory sometimes just 2 items.


[22-Mar-19 01:14 PM] TonyL#3577
We can always make max amount of letters less I wonder so there will be only one screen


[22-Mar-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, we need to remove the strenght prints and make sure it never goes to second screen


[22-Mar-19 01:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Or maybe it's possible to not accept movement keystrokes when this screen is active


[22-Mar-19 01:15 PM] TonyL#3577
I saw no strength prints on latest


[22-Mar-19 01:16 PM] TonyL#3577
Like a: if screen is active - can only watch and keyboard handlers aren't active


[22-Mar-19 01:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, player have to press space üòÉ


[22-Mar-19 01:18 PM] TonyL#3577
I've noticed now when played that sometimes I'm getting 2 pages, sometimes 1 with same inventory - but can't reproduce reliably. Maybe just one was with prints and one without


[22-Mar-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we can change things to just never get the second screen. increase the LINES (screen height) if needed


[22-Mar-19 01:21 PM] TonyL#3577
I hope that there are no other unknown cases when some inputs which not moving warrior reading like moment keystrokes rather than inventory


[22-Mar-19 01:23 PM] TonyL#3577
Just interesting - is there some handling which can distinguish between `l` movement keystroke and usage of item which have `l` letter in inventory?


[22-Mar-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it is based on context


[22-Mar-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe decker can go through the code looking for any other possible causes of losing focus


[22-Mar-19 01:25 PM] TonyL#3577
I've lost 2 levels but I hadn't cases when 2 space press were needed


[22-Mar-19 01:25 PM] TonyL#3577
So maybe there are places which just counting presses when it not moving warrior


[22-Mar-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
but why does it behave differently when using gui vs replay?


[22-Mar-19 01:26 PM] TonyL#3577
Because key press is recorded


[22-Mar-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
there are half a dozen to a dozen if ( rs->guiflag != 0 ) type of special cases


[22-Mar-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the answer is in those


[22-Mar-19 01:27 PM] TonyL#3577
If one movement keypress which actually not moving warrior is recorded somewhere - all next progress will be lost


[22-Mar-19 01:28 PM] TonyL#3577
Keystrokes just replaying on this level and warrior moving to where he able to move with others levels keystrokes


[22-Mar-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
plz work with @Decker to find all the possible non-det

no


[22-Mar-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but you could change the sleeptime to a much slower value based on level


[22-Mar-19 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
just set rs->sleeptime = 1000000; after N keystrokes

[22-Mar-19 04:33 PM] TonyL#3577
But these jumps and strange appearing on lvl13 - now it seems like a different issue (not just not connected with map movement because of illegally recorded keystrokes)


[22-Mar-19 04:35 PM] TonyL#3577
There is even no print about some action in the end of lvl12. He just stept on this wand, then moved right and then lvl13 started (started very not-correct way as it seems on screenshots)


[22-Mar-19 04:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Since ronyi had memcorruption on his macbook before - maybe it's related hmm

Another (35:47) fighting with G and give me more than 2000 exp, this is normal? In previus game fighted with V and in warrior lvl 13 max hp is 91, but after first V my life point is 88 and after the next V is 86 and never restored to 91. So V is a real vampire. üòÑ

Lost 3 levels in first game on OSX - on level13 I had print "Couldnt finalize CCtx" on gaming screen (when I've entered this level) - so I guess it's related.

On lvl12 I step on teleportation trap - it teleported me to room with stairs and I went to lvl13

Ok, have to check the replay

I'm starting to run in same room on lvl12 in replay

On the last frame of replay I can see settings menu with keystrokes recorded into "Name" and "Fruit"

In actual game I only fight with Aquator in this room and picked up gold - not used any items

Yes, like I'm magically somehow changed level two steps left from stairs and then somehow appeared one position upper on the next level

Maybe it's OSX specific somehow since both problem games are on OSX so far


[23-Mar-19 12:13 PM] TonyL#3577
Not even sure how it's possible to change level without stairs hit. And there is nothing suspicious in original gameplay - I'm just walking to stairs. Not using anything, not fighting, not picking up items or using inventory

also remarkable how many roguelikes are out there- maybe this site can be helpful to recruit devs/ raise awareness of ROGUE and the opportunities it offers, or find cool open soource resources?!?

@jl777c So issue is:
At some point when you changing level you getting print ```FinalizeCCtx couldnt find 00000000000000000...0```

You have same prints and dl16 extracted only

But with amulet already so you got this "FinalizeCCTx couldn't find" on the way back


[24-Mar-19 03:13 AM] TonyL#3577
So for now it seems biggest issue. But problem is that keystroke not broadcasting sometimes, not non det I think. Will make a script now to analyze keystoekes.log and find out are all txs on blockchain or not. Also in debug.log I have prints about negative vout - so it should be related

Ok so for my game as I expected from some point keystrokes stopped to broadcast on chain (on the moment when I got "FinalizeCCTx couldn't find" print I wonder). I made a code to just check if keystrokes for game from keystrokes.log are on chain :

```Keystroke not broadcasted: 97b3e48c4883d6b281ed8f22984112e2027ded81e67293d66a18ba45641ad1f9

@jl777c So issue is super clear now. By some reason some keystrokes generating with negative vout0 and game progress not saving after this point obv.

Call and output hex which generated keystroke with negative vout0:

it seems unexpectedly many keystrokes, will need to adjust the amount spent for baton.


[24-Mar-19 05:59 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed version with 10x smaller keystrokes, which means baton can do 10x more keystrokes tx before going negative

yes, maybe it will complain with every keystrokes tx, but it should work. if the txfee is 1000 sats for keystrokes tx, then it is working


[24-Mar-19 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810

@jl777c Not seems that this vout amount became less (actually it seems a little bit bigger than before)

Hmm you've changed txfee from 10000 to 1000 so this vout should be -1000 sat, not -10000 i wonder


[24-Mar-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
what was the keystrokes tx before that one?

Let me find last transaction with non negative vout for this game


[24-Mar-19 11:15 AM] TonyL#3577

Then two with negative vout (I've posted above)


[24-Mar-19 11:16 AM] TonyL#3577
By logic which you've described - it have "value": 0.00840000 left, so the next one (https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/qhXTM5zKkr/) spend funds somehow incorrect I wonder


[24-Mar-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
then the bug is caused by something else


[24-Mar-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
was it 0.0085 before that one?


[24-Mar-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
seems the txfee change didnt take effect


[24-Mar-19 11:17 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me check


[24-Mar-19 11:17 AM] TonyL#3577
```  "vout": [

        ]
      }
    },
```


[24-Mar-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
i think not being able to find the baton makes it a fatal issue and it gets value of 0 and subtracts txfee from it


[24-Mar-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
the txfee in latest should be 1000 sats


[24-Mar-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, i need to force it to be 1000 sats


[24-Mar-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810

[24-Mar-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
updated


[24-Mar-19 11:19 AM] TonyL#3577
But anyway - even it's 10000 why it's -10000 after 840000 ?


[24-Mar-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
still this doesnt explain that


[24-Mar-19 11:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh yes, this `if txfee == 0 => txfee = 1000` looked suspicious for me üòÉ


[24-Mar-19 11:21 AM] TonyL#3577
But I dont know much about underlaying code


[24-Mar-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
cant finalize means it couldnt find the prior vin for some reasopn


[24-Mar-19 11:24 AM] TonyL#3577
I think its print on next keystroke broadcast


[24-Mar-19 11:24 AM] TonyL#3577
When previous have negative vout and not broadcasted


[24-Mar-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
can you make it consistently get the negative vout?


[24-Mar-19 11:27 AM] TonyL#3577
No it happens randomly


[24-Mar-19 11:27 AM] TonyL#3577
But then if you continue playing after one print


[24-Mar-19 11:27 AM] TonyL#3577
On next levels I have same print


[24-Mar-19 11:27 AM] TonyL#3577
On the beginning of next level


[24-Mar-19 11:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Usually it happens on late levels, one time I had it on level3


[24-Mar-19 11:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Ronyi got it on lvl16 when moved back upstairs with amulet


[24-Mar-19 11:32 AM] TonyL#3577
```"batontxid":"0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"``` causing this negative vout if I understand correct


[24-Mar-19 11:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it have wait for something if baton not found


[24-Mar-19 11:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it caused bad internet connection + fast level switch. So if it looking for previous one  right here right now - it can't find it. Also blocks time is not consistent


[24-Mar-19 11:44 AM] TonyL#3577
But I was able to reproduce it on OSX only


[24-Mar-19 11:45 AM] TonyL#3577
An just checked ronyi video - it seems that ronyi played on OSX too


[24-Mar-19 11:46 AM] TonyL#3577
Will try to go back and forth for amulet on Ubuntu now (grabbing 1000 txfee fix - so also will check if it changed). Just like keyboard on Mac Air so played from it today üòÉ

Maybe 5-10 seconds was on each level (stairs were in same room where I appeared)


[24-Mar-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, and keystrokes tx are triggered each time you change levels, at least it checks things

Aha, print appears immideatly after level change

TUI will wait until last keystroke tx have confirmations on blockchain anyway


[24-Mar-19 12:00 PM] TonyL#3577
So keystroke txs might be queued by rogue I  wonder (broadcast next after previous is mined and not finish rogue process until last is broadcasted)


[24-Mar-19 12:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Because there might be edge case if I change levels fast befroe quit - even if you'll handle zero baton - last keystroke will not be rebrodcasted because rogue exited


[24-Mar-19 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
for all but the last keystrokes processing, i make sure it has been 5 minutes since the prior one


[24-Mar-19 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
TUI rebroadcasting now keystrokes only in case of error in keystrokes.log, but hmm can check few last keystrokes on blockchain as well and rebroadcast in order if needed before extract/bailout


[24-Mar-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
last keystrokes should get sent, but yes, likely some edge cases possible, can be seen via difference in extracted keystrokes vs local


[24-Mar-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the way to reproduce the 000000 baton is likely to very quickly do new levels


[24-Mar-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
pushed version that will hopefully make keystrokes much more stable

{Reactions}
üëç 

[24-Mar-19 12:05 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm thinking now that can solve it from TUI side anyway (if after rebroadcasting attempt keystroke which generated negative vout will return not negative in case of previous keystroke mined)


[24-Mar-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
this bug would explain the lvl 13 bug ronyi had

[24-Mar-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810

@TonyL I just played a long game this morning, got to level 18 where I quit.
Game txid: 59ecb6f8ab442fcb4fe2984876223f9a590e8bd920954bd338a35f42c071e7f4
Information about game saved on chain: $$$gold.4858 hp.69 strength.19/20 level.11 exp.5800 dl.18


 I kept waiting for the bailout but kept getting: 
Bailout not on blockchain yet. Let's wait a little bit more
getrawtransaction: No information available about transaction (code -5)

after 3 hours, I finally ctrl+c, then did manual bailout: 
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/5ndKdzyrfx/
this was the daemon output:

But it's not in the blockchain, my address has no ROGUES from this. So I tried manual bailout again and got this:

this was the output from the daemon screen:

@wookie Hmm it seems like a pubkey missmatch.
Could you please try to `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE validateaddress RPD4UAn8MSVSkcCWfWsowdEgY4BdjxmGsX` and the check if pubkey in this call output match pubkey which you have in `getinfo` output?


[24-Mar-19 02:32 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh, or maybe pubkey for this `RPD4UAn8MSVSkcCWfWsowdEgY4BdjxmGsX` address should be set

@wookie Hmm it looks like you're using some legacy warrior with this ```1: 10  q* s dsjdsjq* a hhhkhhhhhhhhhhhhh h hhhhhkkkhhhh s

Or maybe it's a new bug. What happened is - keystrokes recorded to the "favourite fruit name" in game options

the blockchain paid 914 ROGUE for it


[25-Mar-19 02:48 AM] jl777c#5810
what happend on level5 on the way up?


[25-Mar-19 02:49 AM] jl777c#5810
but this shows the earning power of "immortal" playerdata


[25-Mar-19 02:49 AM] jl777c#5810
they can convert 90 minutes of time to a lot of ROGUE


[25-Mar-19 02:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so i wonder what its economic value is. certainly a lot more than 1000 ROGUE. likely nobody but ronyi is able to pay its actual value


[25-Mar-19 02:50 AM] jl777c#5810
something that can earn 1000 ROGUE per day would likely be work 100,000 ROGUE ?


[25-Mar-19 03:00 AM] ronyi#5719
I don't see anything extraordinary. My video is playable right now.


[25-Mar-19 03:04 AM] Mylo#8306
How much ROGUE is 7000 gold?
Nice video @ronyi


[25-Mar-19 03:07 AM] ronyi#5719
Thanks, 7000 * 7000 * dungeon level * 10, if i know right.


[25-Mar-19 03:08 AM] jl777c#5810
with amulet the dungeon level is 26


[25-Mar-19 03:08 AM] jl777c#5810
also winning gets you a bigger multiplier


[25-Mar-19 03:56 AM] jorian#4555
did anyone ever win already?


[25-Mar-19 04:01 AM] jl777c#5810
yes a few times, just havent gotten the blockchain proof for it yet


[25-Mar-19 05:18 AM] wookie#7663
@TonyL yes, this warrior was created probably 1-2 weeks ago. He's been around and may have "died" at least once from hypothermia that I can remember, but was (luckily) still on list of warriors afterwards.

@wookie I'm not sure - we had CC Eval 0x11 Invalid prints when chain not synced on OSX. But this issue should be resolved. It's quite strange - I'm playing with started daemon from 0.4.0 bundle and can't see it on my side. 
So is problem on your side at the moment only the game in which you can't do bailout or now chain not syncing because of these prints?


[25-Mar-19 09:10 AM] wookie#7663
ok, i'm going to try reindexing again


[25-Mar-19 09:12 AM] TonyL#3577
Is chain syncing now on your side?


[25-Mar-19 09:15 AM] wookie#7663
yes, its syncing


[25-Mar-19 09:25 AM] wookie#7663
I'm still getting the error at the end of reindexing, looks like the same thing but different text:

I'm going to delete blockchain and resync whole blockchain again


[25-Mar-19 09:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe these prints on reindex are fine since it's succesfully synced


[25-Mar-19 09:31 AM] wookie#7663
I was still able to play a couple of short games that bailed out ok, and rogues showed up on blockchain despite those error messages. haven't tried a long game since.


[25-Mar-19 09:31 AM] wookie#7663
maybe it's fine...


[25-Mar-19 09:34 AM] TonyL#3577
It looks like some warrior/warriors not-compatible with current version. I think with new ones it should be fine


[25-Mar-19 09:34 AM] TonyL#3577

[25-Mar-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
does multiplayer work? looking at the code it looks like the winner wont be able to make a highlander tx


[25-Mar-19 09:58 AM] wookie#7663
@TonyL thanks. I'll just buildup another new warrior. 
after redownloading the blockchain, I immediately tried manual bailout of that last game, and again I got:
 illegal game err.-1

I next launched tui, and tried to start a game, but it gave me the error:
Something went wrong.
'txid'
Press [Enter] to continue...

I stopped the daemon and restarted it. Once again, in tui, when I try to start a new game, I get:
Something went wrong.
'txid'
Press [Enter] to continue...

seems I can't start a new game anymoreüò¢

@wookie Please try to do the following:

re-download bundle and unzip 
start daemon from it```


[25-Mar-19 10:20 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm just downloaded bundle and playing fine on it - so for now have not many ideas whats going wrong on your side :/ Maybe steps above will help


[25-Mar-19 10:29 AM] wookie#7663
the bundle worked well for me too until that fateful game 2 days ago


[25-Mar-19 10:29 AM] wookie#7663
ok, doing that


[25-Mar-19 10:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Interesting: now tried to play long game:
Get this print ```                                                                                                                      FinalizeCCTx couldnt find 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
``` When switched from lvl26 to lvl27 (and on lvl26 played few minutes)


[25-Mar-19 10:36 AM] TonyL#3577
What is the most interesting - I've monitored extract print whole game
When I reached lvl26: I had this print in `extracted`
```  "extracted": "$$$gold.6842 hp.105 strength.29/29 level.17 exp.449956 dl.26",
```


[25-Mar-19 10:36 AM] TonyL#3577
After I got ```                                                                                                                      FinalizeCCTx couldnt find 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

`


[25-Mar-19 10:36 AM] TonyL#3577
So it like a flushed one keystroke for dl26 ( lvl in extract rolled  back from dl26 to dl25)


[25-Mar-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
jl777 builds now, that went a lot faster than I estimated


[25-Mar-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
i will add error checking to keystrokes


[25-Mar-19 10:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, proceed to multiplayer


[25-Mar-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed version that doesnt advance the keystrokes counter, if there is an error with keystrokes tx, like cant finalize

{Reactions}
üëç 

[25-Mar-19 11:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Will it try to rebroadcast it until success in such case or progress just should stop in case of error?


[25-Mar-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
it will pretend as if it didnt happen and the next time will issue a full keystrokes


[25-Mar-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
before any error and the keystrokes sequence would have been broken, 100% of the time

[25-Mar-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
just that game or all games has this problem?


[25-Mar-19 11:19 AM] TonyL#3577
It's not a problem - error there is expected


[25-Mar-19 11:19 AM] TonyL#3577
It's bailout attempt for game for which bailout was already executed and mined


[25-Mar-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, so a valid error message, just not very clear


[25-Mar-19 11:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, `CC signing error: vini.0 has unknown CC address` this print confused me a little when it was initially reported


[25-Mar-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
it probably skipped getting everything setup since it was already bailed out


[25-Mar-19 11:23 AM] TonyL#3577
But not confused not less because it's a game for which wookie getting such error:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib gameinfo 17 "['59ecb6f8ab442fcb4fe2984876223f9a590e8bd920954bd338a35f42c071e7f4']"

And player is alive (means bailout wasn't mined)


[25-Mar-19 11:24 AM] TonyL#3577
But he had this:

Something very bad happened locally I wonder because it worked fine before from same bundle


[25-Mar-19 11:33 AM] TonyL#3577
@wookie If steps which I've proposed above not helped - please backup current `~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/ROGUE/wallet.dat`, save privkeys (dumprivkey %address%) for addresses with funds / warriors and then delete:
```~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/ROGUE ```
Or you can instead of ROGUE folder deletion backup it:
```mv ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/ROGUE ~/Library/Application Support/Komodo/ROGUE_backup```

Then start daemon and import old wallet privkey/s `importprivkey %privkey%`

@wookie Try to purge ROGUE folder after wallet backup


[25-Mar-19 11:53 AM] wookie#7663
ok


[25-Mar-19 11:54 AM] wookie#7663
sorry what's the full command for dumpriv key? is it ./komodo-cli dumprivkey [address]?


[25-Mar-19 11:54 AM] TonyL#3577
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE dumpprivkey [address]` (since you backing up your ROGUE chain wallet)


[25-Mar-19 11:56 AM] wookie#7663
so I ran that but it keeps telling me this:
error: couldn't connect to server: unknown (code -1)
(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)


[25-Mar-19 11:56 AM] wookie#7663
but my daemon IS running


[25-Mar-19 11:56 AM] wookie#7663
I'm executing the dumprivkey inside the bundle folder, as is the daemon (in a different window)


[25-Mar-19 11:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe daemon crashed or hanged


[25-Mar-19 11:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Try to `pgrep komodod`


[25-Mar-19 11:58 AM] TonyL#3577
And if there is any output: `pkill komodod`


[25-Mar-19 11:58 AM] wookie#7663
output: 1753


[25-Mar-19 11:58 AM] wookie#7663
I just started the daemon a minute before trying dumprivkey, I waited until it said "finished loading blocks"


[25-Mar-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
use FSM for now

[25-Mar-19 11:59 AM] TonyL#3577
Then if after `pkill komodod` no output in `pgrep komodod` 
Try to start ROGUE daemon again, and then check if you'll able to `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE getinfo`


[25-Mar-19 12:00 PM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c wookie using daemon from bundle built 3 days ago (if your advice was not general but connected to this particular case)

dumprivkey still gives error


[25-Mar-19 12:01 PM] TonyL#3577
It's obviously gives error now because you have 0 blocks and 0 connections


[25-Mar-19 12:03 PM] wookie#7663
after I ran daemon, I waited until:
finished loading blocks ROGUE

got this output in the daemon window when ran getinfo:

komodo_faststateinit retval.-1


[25-Mar-19 12:03 PM] TonyL#3577
Try to temporary backup whole ROGUE folder (move to other place = copy to other place and delete in /Users/xxxx/Library/Application Support/Komodo/) and try to start daemon again


[25-Mar-19 12:04 PM] wookie#7663
ok

I removed the old ROGUE folder and started daemon from a fresh copy of 0.4.0rc. I got all this output in 1 second:

I don't see any more progress or new output


[25-Mar-19 12:17 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe peers blocked your node hmm
Try to start daemon with `-addnode=159.69.45.70` (it's my node)


[25-Mar-19 12:19 PM] wookie#7663
ok, 
btw instead of starting with my usual daemon command with my pubkey, I started it with the generic starter command in github:
./komodod -ac_name=ROGUE -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=5.9.102.210  -ac_cclib=rogue -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=60001 -ac_script=2ea22c80203d1579313abe7d8ea85f48c65ea66fc512c878c0d0e6f6d54036669de940febf8103120c008203000401cc -daemon


[25-Mar-19 12:20 PM] TonyL#3577
It's fine to start without pubkey (TUI will set it for you in such case)

You should connect to `38426` not `43060`

Try to delete everything inside ROGUE folder and create such ROGUE.conf file:

Just change username and password to some not so easy. And then start daemon again


[25-Mar-19 12:33 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe you have some network issues or firewall blocking


[25-Mar-19 12:34 PM] wookie#7663
I've been using this same internet (at work) to get to ROGUE since the beginning, I was at home the last 2 days with probably the same issue.


[25-Mar-19 12:40 PM] wookie#7663
the rogue.conf that was in there has the same contents, but I replaced it anyways. restarted daemon, connection still 0


[25-Mar-19 12:48 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm as only idea I left - try this daemon https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_cryptoconditions_tui/releases/download/0.1/komodod_fsm_osx_mar26.zip


[25-Mar-19 12:49 PM] wookie#7663
it's just strange that it worked until yesterday. I was able to play 2 short games at home.


[25-Mar-19 12:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Maybe it's because daemon in bundle is outdated and other nodes dont like it

You said that it should work fine if broadcast in 10-15 seconds after level start. And it found baton on manual rebroadcasting after some time.
So maybe set artificial delay like a 
```if delta between levels change <20 seconds
wait until delta > 20 seconds, then broadcast keystroke
else just broadcast keystroke```


[25-Mar-19 02:16 PM] jl777c#5810

Thanks, but not need it. Building more warriors, i love rogue and i think is good, we playing for the game experience.

Or connection point for games better to say maybe


[25-Mar-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i got most all the rogue equivalent functions ported, but they are untested


[25-Mar-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
right now I am integrating the user event broadcasting so we get realtime keystrokes events to prevent cheating by not broadcasting keystrokes


[25-Mar-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it also allows to do keystrokes tx just at the end


[25-Mar-19 02:37 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh there should be solution for our current problem I bet (in realtime broadcasting maybe) üòÉ


[25-Mar-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
yes


[25-Mar-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
but realtime broadcasting will be swiss cheese at each node


[25-Mar-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
no single node would be guaranteed to have all events


[25-Mar-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
but the node cant really afford to cheat as any event likely is on some other node and if you cheat you lose your gold and player


[25-Mar-19 02:39 PM] TonyL#3577
Oh it sounds like a p2p gaming consensus

[25-Mar-19 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
Will it have "customazible" keystrokes reader?


[25-Mar-19 02:42 PM] TonyL#3577
So can pre-set if keystroke `c` it's call if `f` it's fold and so on


[25-Mar-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
that is all game specific. I just got it so tetris events are broadcast in realtime


[25-Mar-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
makegames and then maketetris, run ./tetris. your node will spew out realtime keystrokes


[25-Mar-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
there is almost 1:1 of the rogue rpc, you can test the initial ones like create (newgame), list, games, register, etc


[25-Mar-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
not finish as the tetris dapp just got the realtime broadcasts and it took 3500 lines today to get this far


[25-Mar-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
basically all the rpc calls that dont involve playing should be working


[25-Mar-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810

[25-Mar-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
updated the rpc calls to match rogue almost exactly, i wanted to make it as easy as possible to make a games TUI. the only difference is there is no bailout/highlander, but just finish. though maybe this will change. the actual gameplay not being there makes it hard to know ahead of time

{Reactions}
üî• 

[25-Mar-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
so other than the bailout/highlander the rogue TUI could just work as it is. the evalcode also matches as it is 17

probably we need to limit the level multiplier

i think yes, or somehow maximalize how many rogue in one game.

what is the deepest level you went to?


[26-Mar-19 02:04 AM] ronyi#5719
This was that lvl. 34, but i think possible with this warrior is the game limit. D it doesn't hurt.....


[26-Mar-19 02:04 AM] jl777c#5810
game has no limit


[26-Mar-19 02:04 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe 2 billion levels

I can set the max dungeonlevel in the cashout calc to anything

maybe I will set it to 42

~700-1300 lvl. 1-26 up and down


[26-Mar-19 02:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and a lot of the rewards are for the magic items, which doesnt seem right you get it over and over, so what about a 777 ROGUE cashout cap


[26-Mar-19 02:11 AM] ronyi#5719
I think good, we want community value.


[26-Mar-19 02:14 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, as of height 77777 777 will be the max ROGUE per game


[26-Mar-19 02:14 AM] jl777c#5810
also dungeonlevel > 42 will just multiply as 42

[26-Mar-19 04:16 AM] TonyL#3577
And other ones in print are block generation transactions as well


[26-Mar-19 04:18 AM] TonyL#3577
But it have height significally less than 69521 - so maybe these prints not related to chain stuck

[26-Mar-19 04:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh new peers gave me new chain state and bigger longestchain - just few nodes I'm connected to stuck on 69521


[26-Mar-19 04:23 AM] TonyL#3577
`159.69.19.131`

Not sure whom nodes these - but you're stuck on 69521 atm üòÉ

https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/KKC8mJYSYK/ full print I have on stuck @jl777c


[26-Mar-19 04:28 AM] TonyL#3577
It's somehow connected to what happened on wookies side it seems


[26-Mar-19 04:28 AM] TonyL#3577
By some reason players inventory printed for me in stdout on sync


[26-Mar-19 04:30 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder it's happened because of some legacy warriors reusage


[26-Mar-19 04:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i make it print mismatched playerdata, that is illegal, is it on the mainchain?


[26-Mar-19 04:37 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the difference in pack

clearly illegal


[26-Mar-19 04:49 AM] jl777c#5810
but is that txid somehow on the mainchain?


[26-Mar-19 04:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if so, the mainchain is wrong


[26-Mar-19 04:49 AM] TonyL#3577
There was a bug few weeks ago when was possible to create such items, let me check these txs on node with full chain


[26-Mar-19 04:52 AM] TonyL#3577
`strength.31/0`oh and also they have max strength 0


[26-Mar-19 04:55 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm not sure how to check these corrupted inventory players txs on mainchain - there is no playertxid in stdout

what happens on extract of that game

oh, it could have been the data corruption bug from a while back

` extract worked fine


[26-Mar-19 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
so is the bailout tx for that game the valid playerdata or invalid playerdata


[26-Mar-19 05:02 AM] TonyL#3577
In this one warrior don't have anything suspicious in invetory:

        ],
```


[26-Mar-19 05:05 AM] jl777c#5810
in the error printout where the two inventories are listed out, one is what it generated, the other is what is claimed


[26-Mar-19 05:05 AM] jl777c#5810
which inventory got confirmed? the valid one or the invalid one


[26-Mar-19 05:10 AM] TonyL#3577
After two inventories prints there is a print:
`2a34b36cc1292aecfaabdad79b42cab9989fa6dcc87ac8ca88aa6162dab1e2c4 playerdata: gold.4377 hp.91 strength.31/31 level.13 exp.29824 dl.15
`


[26-Mar-19 05:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Which reflecting upper one


[26-Mar-19 05:11 AM] TonyL#3577
And 2a34b36cc1292aecfaabdad79b42cab9989fa6dcc87ac8ca88aa6162dab1e2c4 is on mainchain


[26-Mar-19 05:12 AM] TonyL#3577
There are prints with inventories on earlier heights as well - so I think maybe not it is the clue


[26-Mar-19 05:13 AM] TonyL#3577
And if first inventory is valid one - it seems that it was choosen correct

Btw maybe make favourite fruit name const? In some very edge cases keystrokes writing to options fileds Name and Fruit Name (options calling by `?`). Not sure if then rogue can understand that something calling non slim-mold is slim-mold

if so ,we should resync to that height

we can airdrop new coins to existing holders


[26-Mar-19 06:10 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, we're close to stable gameplay atm :). Also perc can be adjusted in reboot (if it needed - I wonder it's too high now. Oh but maybe not with recent rewards enlargement)


[26-Mar-19 06:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Maybe make snapshot on 77777 ?


[26-Mar-19 06:14 AM] TonyL#3577
It looks symbolic üòÉ


[26-Mar-19 06:21 AM] ronyi#5719
do we lose the warriors?


[26-Mar-19 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
we might be able to transport warriors to the new chain


[26-Mar-19 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
get the playerdata for all the players you want and we can allow them to be ressurected on the new chain


[26-Mar-19 06:25 AM] TonyL#3577
Will be first NFT crosschain swap migration in history I wonder


[26-Mar-19 06:28 AM] TonyL#3577
So for now as I understand only way to sync node with latest chain and pass trough validations is bootstrap blockchain from healthy node and download bootstrap from fresh node

I need the opreturn hex for each of those


[26-Mar-19 06:59 AM] TonyL#3577
```"scriptPubKey": {
        "asm": "OP_RETURN f26321..."``` this one? 

I can make script to save this hex for warrior/warriors list so players will be able to save their warriors


[26-Mar-19 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
the hex


[26-Mar-19 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the playerdata in the opreturn


[26-Mar-19 07:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Aha, so `"hex"` field from `scriptPubKey`


[26-Mar-19 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
so in the new chain we recreate it and transfer it to the pubkey, along with allowing such creating players out of thin air


[26-Mar-19 07:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, will share the script asap

```#!/usr/bin/env python3

players_list = rpc_connection.cclib("players", "17")["playerdata"]

for player in players_list:

    for vout in player_vouts:
        if vout["value"] == 0:
            print(vout["scriptPubKey"]["hex"])
```


[26-Mar-19 07:16 AM] TonyL#3577
Should print hexes of opreturn vout for whole playerlist (have to be executed from folder which contains lib folder of TUI). You can just forward output from script to file if needed:
`python3 script.py >> file.txt`

Interesting that he have such short hex now - I think it's because I placed him in token order and cancelled order then


[26-Mar-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it needs to be the opreturn from tokenid


[26-Mar-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so it cant be short

    tetris tweaks``` on the 2 nodes I tried with. Deleted all chain data in `.komodo` before starting. 
```"blocks": 69521,

During indexing there were many stops and starts where blocks would start syncing and then stop, with connection errors like Tony posted. Then syncing would start again.

@TonyL I'm using your last bundle.


[31-Mar-19 07:38 PM] TonyL#3577
Daemon from bundle is quite outdated. I'll publish fresh one with latest jl777 daemon today


[31-Mar-19 07:39 PM] TonyL#3577
So maybe latest daemon will work with this bootstrap

I used @smkhound bootstrap, and the bundle new bundle. But I'm still getting this error:
..........finished loading blocks ROGUE

[31-Mar-19 09:14 PM] wookie#7663
I tried it with:

and with only:
-addnode=5.9.102.210 -addnode=159.69.45.70

But I still get the same error


[31-Mar-19 09:15 PM] wookie#7663
do I need to reindex?


[31-Mar-19 09:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I'm not sure. Try to delete everything in ROGUE folder before unzip bootstrap. 
Btw ` -addnode=159.69.45.70` it's my node and it's ded atm


[31-Mar-19 09:20 PM] wookie#7663
ok, brb


[31-Mar-19 09:22 PM] smkhound#7640
@wookie  are you launching with -reindex?


[31-Mar-19 09:23 PM] wookie#7663
i did not. I just followed what tonyL suggested to delete everything except wallet and put in blocks.


[31-Mar-19 09:24 PM] wookie#7663
so far no error, waiting on the daemon....


[31-Mar-19 09:26 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder maybe it's because in bootstrap no `chainstate` folder, only blocks


[31-Mar-19 09:28 PM] TonyL#3577
So your chainstate conflicted with blocks which you get so thats why `InvalidChainFound`


[31-Mar-19 09:36 PM] wookie#7663
You're probably right. It's downloading the chain now, I'm still at 38000+, still waiting


[31-Mar-19 09:37 PM] TonyL#3577
It's reindexing now to create chain state I think because blocks you got from bootstrap


[31-Mar-19 09:39 PM] TonyL#3577
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE getinfo

@TonyL 
I was able to play a long game to lvl22 with no problems yesterday. After that I played a relatively short game, I quit with warrior alive and healthy, but kept getting:
getrawtransaction: No information available about transaction (code -5)
Let's wait a little bit more
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/cfcr5Zhvfh/

so I did ctrl^c and did manual bailout 
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/rn5Kwh8G99/
and got "result":"success".

However, a few hours later, ROGUE was still not on the blockchain and warrior wasn't on my list. So I tried manual bailout again but now it's 
./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib bailout 17 '["d5d40c52bb02341921ef6b027b0aedf55ca07c73e4b41576dd3b2bd99d3c7d7e"]'

  "error": "couldnt finalize CCtx"
}
Here's the daemon window output:

Is there a pool for mining Rogue?


[09-Apr-19 02:03 PM] TonyL#3577
As I know there is no mining pool for Rogue. Main concept of the chain is that players getting significantly more coins than block reward for games. So best way to get some ROGUE coins is to play rogue

This one should work, though you'd best get the bootstrap also to save time and possibly ending up stuck on a block - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Get-Started-with-Rogue-Game

I'm thinking now if it fine to trasnfer old warriors: as I understand  in cases when people played/playing on different komodod versions and different forks  - some warriors can start do bad things on the fresh chain as well (I think thats how forks initially happened actually)


[10-Apr-19 05:00 AM] TonyL#3577
So maybe it's worth to transfer only coins and start from "clean sheet" for warriors avatars

@TonyL not sure if you're still working on ROGUE. but I was just playing a long game, got to level 24, I quit while alive, but I got this error:

I tried manual bailout but I keep getting this error, and the chain gets stopped. I have to restart the daemon.

doesn't necessarily have to be a "CFEK" chain


[13-Apr-19 11:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, thats totally fine I think since notas should prevent forks

We can start everything with latest FSM nodes and I'll prepare latest FSM bundles and delete all old ones

you'll need LABS komodod or notarizations won't be recognized

Not sure if there are plans for chain which combining all cc based games


[14-Apr-19 12:48 AM] TonyL#3577
In general more chains is better I think because it's taking less storage space and you have to download only specific game blocks if you need only this one


[14-Apr-19 12:49 AM] TonyL#3577
But it depends on the scale of the game probably


[14-Apr-19 12:51 AM] ronyi#5719
I think maybe better for all games project is running on 1 chains (Tetris, Rogue, Sodoku, komdore64 and .....). The avarage users if want play, download all different chains and start komodod with different parameter, not exactly user friendly.


[14-Apr-19 12:52 AM] TonyL#3577
I think there might be something like a gaming Agama (kinda blockchain Steam) - you choose a game you want to play and it's downloading first (native mode daemon starting and syncing)


[14-Apr-19 12:52 AM] TonyL#3577

If/when ROGUE comes to Labs, there are a few areas that might be worth exploring regarding ROGUE development.


[15-Apr-19 01:06 AM] CrisF#3405
Might it be good to focus it back more to it's original core purposes?


[15-Apr-19 03:03 AM] Alright#0419
We need a developer to continue with the validation code in order to do anything useful with it on LABS. The reason we'll be putting it on the CFEK cluster is to avoid forks. Whichever chain the notaries are running is the definitive chain.


[15-Apr-19 03:05 AM] Alright#0419

should work for LABS and CFEK

@Alright Can do it, yep


[15-Apr-19 03:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
I guess you can launch a chain but I realyl dont think you should add any notarizations to until I can reset LABS eras ready for the main chain launch... unless I get some free timr in the next 2 days to get LABS ready for launch, we need pubkeys from everyone though, dont see that taking a day or 2.


[15-Apr-19 03:19 AM] Alright#0419
simply starting it with CFEK* will work for now


[15-Apr-19 03:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
if you dont care tha all notarisations will become invalid once we launch the main chain yes it will.

Tried to spin new chain and play: looks like there is a bug in rogue now. Games without warrior reusage are fine (after little trick with CFEKDUNG.conf copying as ROGUE.conf), but when trying to register with playertxid arg not able to broadcast register transaction:

https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/nGsqGZ8CF7/

` AcceptToMemoryPool: BUG! PLEASE REPORT THIS!` print in debug.log asked me to report it üòÉ @jl777c


[27-Apr-19 02:03 AM] Alright#0419
@TonyL nothing in stdout when that printed?


[27-Apr-19 02:30 AM] Alright#0419
Was that the first tx you made on the chain that spent a ROGUE CC UTXO?


[27-Apr-19 02:30 AM] Alright#0419
if so that probably means cclib isn't working properly on it


[27-Apr-19 07:15 AM] TonyL#3577
@Alright No it's not first tx since it's warrior reusage. Nothing in stdout


[27-Apr-19 07:25 AM] Alright#0419
ok so without cclib working properly, you'll be able to create CC UTXOs


[27-Apr-19 07:25 AM] Alright#0419
but not be able to spend them


[27-Apr-19 07:25 AM] Alright#0419
maybe that's the problem?


[27-Apr-19 07:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm, but bailout for game without warrior reusage worked fine


[27-Apr-19 07:28 AM] TonyL#3577
As I remember bailout spending gametxid


[27-Apr-19 07:29 AM] Alright#0419
yes bailout spends a CC vout I believe


[27-Apr-19 07:30 AM] Alright#0419
how can I test this?

[27-Apr-19 07:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Sequence of calls:
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/nGsqGZ8CF7/

But first I've "precreated" playertxid - created game same way, waited till game txid is mined, registered with only gametxid arg, waited for registration txid to be mined


[27-Apr-19 07:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Than in gameinfo printing params to start rogue


[27-Apr-19 07:32 AM] TonyL#3577
Playing, waiting for keystrokes to be mined, doing bailout


[27-Apr-19 07:32 AM] TonyL#3577
After bailout is mined should appear playertxid in players call


[27-Apr-19 07:32 AM] TonyL#3577
This playertxid possible to use as second arg of `register`

`./komodod -ac_name=ROGUE -pubkey=X -ac_supply=1000000 -addnode=116.203.120.163 -ac_cclib=rogue -ac_perc=10000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=60001 -ac_script=028707f61cc4e6f32bd0fc4e5058bf6050f7879f2c3f12ccdae253710a443af518 -daemon`

So far, no `blocks` are mined and the amount of `connections ` is 0. 

What would be a solution, so that ROGUE blocks are actually mined?

Not sure rogue is working. They might be restarting the chain at sometime in the future.


[02-May-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
too many consensus rule changes were made and without dPoW the chain got split as different nodes ran different versions and now it is hard to sync to the mainchain or even know which one is the mainchain


[02-May-19 01:44 PM] bartwr#6773
Perfect, thank you for your reply. I'll run 2 ROGUE nodes myself, that should work if I'm correct.


[02-May-19 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if you change the -ac_reward parameter you will get a new chain and can have a brand new chain

My 2 nodes are running. Number of `connections` = 1. No. of `blocks` = 0. (No blocks are mined yet)


[02-May-19 02:30 PM] bartwr#6773
I get the `illegal maxplayers` error if I do `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 "[1]"`. wookie25, smk762 and TonyL had this before as well. What could be the reason?

What I've tried:

- Removing `~/.komodo/ROGUE` folder
- Stopping & restarting daemon
- Running TUI and starting a single player game (I get the error: `Something went wrong. 'txid'`)
- Double checking ac params of my 2 nodes


[02-May-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
is any node mining?

``` get the illegal maxplayers error if I do ./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 "[1]". ``` - looks like some different error
Try to just call `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 ` it should create singleplayer game
Also `./komodo-cli -ac_name=ROGUE cclib newgame 17 [1]` might work I think

My two nodes weren't mining ROGUE blocks yet. Fixed this by using a VPS for node 1, instead of my own PC (this so the IP address is public).

Hey all, if you have any proof of concepts, or built something cool for Rogue CC, please let me know. The goal is to build out a list of concepts using CCs to help show other developers what is possible and add this to the Komodo docs page. TUIs are good!

rogue CC was a proof of concept, to make it production ready, a game engine would need to be refactored

@Jcharming we should ask whoever has the synced rogue blockchain, to share some node details

if nothing much, I hope that it wouldn't be bad idea to start fresh


[27-Aug-20 09:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c @SHossain how can we resurrect rogue gameplay now? I think it's just the rogue blockchain needs some connectivity? is the seed node still alive?

[27-Aug-20 09:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, in community meeting the interns showed interest and the feedback says there should be something fun to engage to. and I think rogue game might be helpful in that aspect


[27-Aug-20 09:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
even if it being proof of concept, it can help that engagement


[27-Aug-20 09:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and if restarting it helps some engagement, I'd suggest to start it back with the acknowledgement that it's the one of the first proof of concept blockchain based games


[27-Aug-20 09:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if starting a new chain, I think it will need some changes with the chain and params and cc-rogue module


[27-Aug-20 09:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if those are clear or documented, we can help it restarted

if you want to get ROGUE going again, maybe the easiest way is to checkout a commit from march 2019 or so from jl777 repo.


[27-Aug-20 07:03 PM] Mylo#8306
reason i say march 2019, is because there are yt vids of the game when doing a gg search for rogue komodo.


[27-Aug-20 07:04 PM] Mylo#8306
a lot has changed since march 2019, so the efforts would be for a one-off chain for fun & education.

However, warriors not extracting on version I've used it seems, getting  
`Information about game saved on chain: zero value character was killed -> no playerdata` on exit for every game finish, so have to dig and find some jl's commit with relatively stable gameplay
In this https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo-cctools-python/releases/tag/0.4.0rc bundle description got saved commit hash, so will start investigation from this point (chain will be restarted when I'll find such version), will do it next weekend most prob

This is even more amazing when you consider the token marketplace where the nft for characters and items are tradable.  On top of that KMD has the possiblity for a project to create this totally independent from KMD if wanted.  Can have their  own soveriegn ecosystem with a different game on separate chains, but items from one game tradeable with items from another.  (a phazer from one tradable from a sword on another).  The entire ecosystem could be protected with dPoW.
Tokens from one game (chain) could also be migrated to another game (chain).

Example is using real (live) test coins.
The power and vision of what has been produced already is very much unknown and under appreciated.
Some of the other things that are here are equally impressive.  jl777 and Tony's work on trading crypto and stocks (KMD/AAPL) have such amazing potential.
What a 'game' that would be.

https://veloren.net/ is a open source voxel(minecraft like) graphic sandbox game written in rust. they even have a proper contributors guide here: https://book.veloren.net/contributors/developers/index.html
maybe its characters can be nfts and the underlying smartchain coins can act as the actual coins of its economy. coin generation can be done by gameplay(killing mobs, collecting resources)  instead of block mining
all gameplay must run on community approved servers to mitigate cheating/botting
access to servers can be sold for the coins themselves giving them value instantly. the fiat received by selling the coins for access can be used for paying server rents.
this way, no need for ICO. the founding team can have a public premine for startup/dev/server/marketing costs

listed min requirements are pretty basic:
```
Minimum requirements
GPU with either Vulkan, Metal, or DirectX 11.2+ support
4GB RAM
multi-core CPU
2GB of free disk space
For Windows 7 systems with an Nvidia GPU, we recommend installing an Nvidia driver version 465 or newer.

@QualityASSURANCE I followed this https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/wiki/Get-Started-with-Rogue-Game. I did have a previous Rick build that was messed up on this droplet, Ubuntu 18.04 4 gigs ram. And install didn't work the first time so I deleted everything in the komodo folder and then reinstalled via instructions and it worked.

thanks @‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª  I am going to erase the komodo, folder running it on 20.04 Ubuntu apparently for 20.04 and above you have to install this repository that's missing in this release because they say it's obsolete ```  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gezakovacs/ppa ```

Can you put up a character for sale sometime today or whenever? You need to hit q to exit while still alive. I'd imagine you will appear in the top 20 list. Slick Willy is also for sale in case you want to test a buy.

I'm wondering what would make a good tournament with what we can do with rogue currently?

There is also a multiplayer feature. As far as I know, it's never been tested. Or I've never seen what it's supposed to do.

And I'm curious if a binary of rogue can be made?


[31-Jul-21 10:47 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
And I'm not seeing a way to interact with gold/rogue coin in the tui. I guess wallet features are command line only.


[01-Aug-21 11:24 AM] QualityASSURANCE#1813
Sure will try it out

No worries. Ive racked up over 1000 in-game gold, have about .5rogue in my wallet. LoL. So I reduced cost for one of the warriors to .001

What Ubuntu version do you use? I was successful with 18.04

This was what qualityassurance did


[12-Aug-21 08:36 AM] Marx1001#5313
I use 20.04. Did same as obsolete but every time i get same error.


[12-Aug-21 08:40 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Beyond deleting komodo folder, and installing any missing repository, I'm not sure what to do for 20.04.  Maybe you are in a position to try 18.04

I'll see if my build is still working this morning.

@Marx1001  this is the command I had to use 

```

  sudo add-apt-repository ppa:gezakovacs/ppa 


```


[16-Aug-21 03:05 PM] QualityASSURANCE#1813
you basically have to install the Qt4 library


[16-Aug-21 03:06 PM] QualityASSURANCE#1813
that's now obsolete on 20.04
