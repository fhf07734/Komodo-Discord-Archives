@AmeroMoney yes üôÇ
A true open blockchain system is permission less. And that's what @KomodoPlatform Antara Smartchain technology offers. I just helped kickstart a fan #cryptocurrency community for @souljaboy pretty quick.

@ptyx11 @souljaboy @AtomicDEX yes mate, it took me about 10-15 minutes to decide on the chain params looking at dev docs. setting up cloud server another 10+ min. $kmd Smartchain setup maybe 15-20+ min. GitHub website + domain, like 1+ hour. rest of the community helped with explorer + wallet + DEX. üòéü§ìüöÄ

who wants to send me some SOULJA?


[30-Jan-21 09:28 PM] ejuliano#8606
i am getting new pc so i will start staking it eventually if possible


[30-Jan-21 09:28 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I would love some soulja too :3040_suspepe:


[30-Jan-21 09:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ejuliano I helped setting up chain params keeping in mind to spawn a community of SOULJA with some funds


[30-Jan-21 09:29 PM] ejuliano#8606
crabby deserves that soulja!


[30-Jan-21 09:29 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
:3040_kingpeepo:


[30-Jan-21 09:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653 (pinned)
so, there are funds of 100,000 SOULJA premined


[30-Jan-21 09:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and 1% Founders Rewards which gets mined and goes to the founders address after 10080 blocks, approx in 7 Days


[30-Jan-21 09:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so, there'll be continous supply of SOULJA funds


[30-Jan-21 09:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
what I want is some community members take care of it


[30-Jan-21 09:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so that I can concerntate more on development than this kind of stuff


[30-Jan-21 09:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
can you all help who wants to help with this kind of stuff ?


[30-Jan-21 09:30 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I can help (just no dev stuff üòÇ)


[30-Jan-21 09:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
help spread the word and let people know what is possible using KMD tech and SOULJA fan community ?


[30-Jan-21 09:30 PM] ejuliano#8606
yes that's what i'm trying to do


[30-Jan-21 09:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess then first task is to how this community wants to spread the 100,000 pre-mined SOULJA coins


[30-Jan-21 09:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653 (pinned)
make some kind of plan which invites people to have KMD address, use and install AtomicDEX on Desktop/Mobile and we drop these SOULJA to them


[30-Jan-21 09:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
equally


[30-Jan-21 09:31 PM] ejuliano#8606
i think you're right, the first task is to get soulja boy / his community to care/want it... otherwise, it was a good awareness campaign for kmd tech


[30-Jan-21 09:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
If you remember how PIRATE donations happned, that kinda plan might also help


[30-Jan-21 09:32 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I can reach out to some Asian rapper community + a very large Asian WSB community


[30-Jan-21 09:32 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
If I can get a bit of help in making the chain


[30-Jan-21 09:32 PM] ejuliano#8606
exactly that was one of my hopes


[30-Jan-21 09:32 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I presume it‚Äôs a few minutes work


[30-Jan-21 09:32 PM] ejuliano#8606
that increases AtomicDEX downloads


[30-Jan-21 09:32 PM] ejuliano#8606
that's the goal basically


[30-Jan-21 09:32 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I know the subtle Asian traits spin off has thousands of members who love this kind of stuff


[30-Jan-21 09:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

@NewJackHodler @Komodo4all @souljaboy @KomodoPlatform But since it is 100% mineable, the mined tokens actually has value since mining costs money. Hope community make smart dApps using it, & it can actually make some pretty amazing applications for music industry, if one really wish to use it for right way. @KomodoPlatform can guide

no, staking needs a full node. I don't think there's a gui full node yet, but you can use command line if you want. https://souljacoin.cash

someone need to figure out the giveaway strategy of 100,000 SOULJA to community. I'll give these tokens away if there's a plan


[31-Jan-21 04:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the more this community is delaying this, the less attention you get by time


[31-Jan-21 04:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
as I'm seeing the progress so far, SOULJA is only fun for the time being and it will fade away soon at this pace.


[31-Jan-21 04:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so if it is of no interest, that's fine. leave it as is

it was anyway a fun thing for weekend

and to showcase what can be done in very very short span of time to kickstart a project

[31-Jan-21 04:44 PM] ejuliano#8606
also you're exactly correct what you say... and really it's up to souljaboy or his community or both... so perhaps the giveaway is the way to go.. and plus it might fulfill one of the goals for this type of awareness campaign:
get people to download atomicdex

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[31-Jan-21 04:46 PM] ejuliano#8606
so... we will try to inform souljaboy fans that if they want soulja, they should download atomicdex... we can ask jcharming if he wants to coordinate similarly to how it was done during stress test, or, we can give away 100 soulja to the first 1000 people who give us their wallet address in here, or on twitter


[31-Jan-21 04:47 PM] ejuliano#8606
or i was thinking a faucet too


[31-Jan-21 04:47 PM] ejuliano#8606
that might be a good way to get it into their hands, especially if the faucet is accessible by click of button in gui like for rick/morty was

With SOUJA, tokens could be issued to fund new albums


[31-Jan-21 06:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
singles


[31-Jan-21 06:49 PM] daemonfox#6136
w/e


[31-Jan-21 06:50 PM] daemonfox#6136

could he use the NFT function to create a song and sell that?

@decryptmedia  this $SOULJA coin chain is an independent smart chain built from @KomodoPlatform  
-plenty of cool features including POW & POS chain, as well as NFTs & any tokenization.  Already on @AtomicDEX GUI and swappable.
Of course no vendor lock-in with Komodo Platform https://t.co/gmMtKZPORx

@Komodo4all @Robietheoracle @souljaboy @AtomicDEX I have 100,000 $SOULJA to give away. If people are really interested, make a plan on how you want it to be distributed or given away.
I also have about 15,000 $SOULJA for give away that I mined in early blocks.
Probably another 25,000 $SOULJA/week give aways from Founder Rewards

@Mylo can you plz share your staking commands with others


[03-Feb-21 07:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
When I tried I couldn‚Äôt stake a single block with single big utxo of 15k

you definitely want to split your coins into all 64 segid addresses for best staking results


[03-Feb-21 07:15 PM] lightspeed393#5403
even more utxo's in 1 address is better than 1 big one

getaddress.py creates list.json with 64 addresses.
then run sendmany64.py and it will ask for chain "SOULJA" and show the balance, then select size of utxo and how many (x64 should be less than your balance to send)

pos64staker is no longer needed, the functionality is built into the daemon

guess I should note that in the readme of it üò´


[04-Feb-21 04:18 AM] lightspeed393#5403
how is it built into the daemon? a rpc to split the coins? I have a SPACE node running pos64staker, others staking without it, and the pos64staker still stakes far more


[04-Feb-21 04:22 AM] Alright#0419
the split is the only thing not built into the daemon


[04-Feb-21 04:22 AM] Alright#0419
the thing that manages utxo is now built into the daemon


[04-Feb-21 04:26 AM] lightspeed393#5403
isn't that the most important part, so that coins are distributed to all 64 segid's?


[04-Feb-21 04:31 AM] Alright#0419
if you split coins and do not manage the UTXOs properly, the wallet size grows massively and slows down basically everything


[04-Feb-21 04:31 AM] Alright#0419
what you have is fine, forget I mentioned it


[04-Feb-21 04:33 AM] lightspeed393#5403
no I appreciate the knowledge. Everything I've read in the dev docs still mentions using pos64staker though, which is why I ask. I just went straight to that. I agree the wallet grows large, I redo my staking setup every few weeks because of it.


[04-Feb-21 04:34 AM] Alright#0419
I need to dig up information on the new(relative) UTXO management system


[04-Feb-21 04:34 AM] Alright#0419
I cannot recall if it's active by default


[04-Feb-21 04:35 AM] Alright#0419
the basic idea is that the staking transaction at the end of the block, blackjok3r made this able to be paid into the coinbase amount via transaction fees


[04-Feb-21 04:36 AM] Alright#0419
so instead of staking and creating 2 new UTXOs, it can create just 1


[04-Feb-21 04:36 AM] Alright#0419
it will maintain a static number of overall UTXOs so the wallet does not bloat


[04-Feb-21 04:36 AM] Alright#0419
there is the `setstakingsplit` rpc command, play around with it and you will see what I mean

got it thx lol


[04-Feb-21 01:10 PM] daemonfox#6136
Think ppls biggest issue stll is no easy way to gen 64 addresses if not using Linux


[04-Feb-21 01:10 PM] Alright#0419
we patched some bug and as a happy coincidence were able to introduce that with little effort


[04-Feb-21 01:10 PM] Alright#0419
unless you are super serious about staking, just set it to make more utxos for about 2 weeks


[04-Feb-21 01:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
Thats what I do when lazy...


[04-Feb-21 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
then once you have about 1000 UTXOs or so and set it to setstakingsplit 100


[04-Feb-21 01:11 PM] daemonfox#6136
Let it solo until I had a ton of addresses with coins


[04-Feb-21 01:11 PM] Alright#0419
make sure not to run with `-pubkey` as well


[04-Feb-21 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
the only reason to truly truly optimize staking is if you intend to sell (or otherwise stop staking) your coins soon


[04-Feb-21 01:13 PM] Alright#0419
if you are long term holding, it averages out even for the worst of the worst UTXO management


[04-Feb-21 01:14 PM] Alright#0419
....or if you're starting a new chain

If anybody can supply me the soulja chain parameters and electrum servers, I can create and post a Verus Desktop import file, for those that would like to add SOULJA to Verus Desktop.
Or any other enthusiast can create it himself by using https://github.com/VerusCoin/Verus-Coin-Importer
(importing the `SOULJA-import.txt` does __NOT__ support private addresses on a native chain at this time)

To import the coin definition in an existing Verus Desktop installation:
- `+ Add Coin`
- do not select a coin: pres `ALT` 3 times or type `ADDFROMFILE` (in capitals!!!) in the coin selection box
- click `Choose File`
- browse and select `SOULJA_import.txt`
- choose native or lite mode as desired.

üìå Private addresses will not (yet) be active in Verus Desktop native mode, although the import file is prepared for it.
üìå If you *deactivate* the chain, you will need to import `SOULJA_import.txt` again to activate. Wallet restart **will** remember the chain.

SOULJA is not endorsed by soulja boy, but it is currently the only soulja coin that can be mined and traded, it can also be staked since it is its consensus uses staking & mining; it has officially been released and can be accessed using atomicdex desktop version.  As of now it is memecoin, until Souljaboy says otherwise.

I think I did wrong calculations on founder reward number


[07-Feb-21 01:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It was supposed to be 1% not 100% üôàü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§¶


[07-Feb-21 01:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
1% after every 10080 blocks


[07-Feb-21 01:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was expecting this: 25804.8


[07-Feb-21 01:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
(10080 * 256) * 0.01 = 25804.8


[07-Feb-21 01:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
But it‚Äôs (10080 * 256) = 2,580,480


[07-Feb-21 01:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
with this rate, the total supply would be doubled, approx of 400,000,000 when all mined


[07-Feb-21 01:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And founders reward will be getting 50% of all total supply

that seems like the easiest solution to implement unless these funds be used for giveaways, competitions, and bounty etc.


[07-Feb-21 02:15 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
nobody came with community building spirit, so for that reason I mentioned earlier it is failed project as a coin for me. Sure these coins could be used for community building or marketing or whatever if these had market value. so far not. Would be happy to burn them. I think as original plan, can keep 1% and burn rest. And community can still decide what to do with those 1%. Can burn or giveaway.

@grewalsatinder According to you, did SOULJA fail? . . Does mining make no sense now?


[07-Feb-21 03:05 PM] jvr#6773
I think if it was a success from day 1 it would be great but it's not always the case, in fact pretty rare, sometimes it takes time and continuous effort. It might never become anything but I wouldn't call it a failure just yet.


[07-Feb-21 03:07 PM] tier#1154

This coin should also focus on marketing and getting on bigger exchanges. Investors want to see the price go up and not sink all the time. A coin is more than just developing better code. Its also about letting people know about how good the coin is and allowing them different ways to buy it from larger exchanges.

@PrestonPysh @souljaboy Depends on how the issuance & distribution of the cryptocurrency is done. If 100% mining blockchains like $BTC $LTC $DOGE $ETH etc are treated as security, then sure https://t.co/wBWGkZsidM is a security too. But I think your conclusion is wrong. None of them are security.

Thank you. It is synced ok but at each block found on network, I need to wait several seconds while getblocktemplate does not work. It looks like block with holding but I think that more addnode should solve the problem

Have a look in the debug.log while this happens... i suspect this happens when `AcceptBlock block from future error` followed by `ERROR: ProcessNewBlock: ActivateBestChain failed`
so getblocktemplate will only work when enough time has passed and the block from future is not from future any more


[17-Feb-21 03:55 AM] phm87#7395
Yes, I saw such logs when I looked I think, what can I do to solve the pb ? Check my clock ?


[17-Feb-21 03:56 AM] cipi#4502
problem is the clock from the person who mined the block, not your own... if that is the case, you can't do anything about it, other than stress the people to fix their clock


[17-Feb-21 03:58 AM] cipi#4502
there was a change in code a while ago https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/commit/6056b180f883226b4a2f9cb64bfe6ab6acace01d but i guess it does not address this specific error, but not sure, maybe it helps


[17-Feb-21 04:04 AM] cipi#4502
btw, i was hoping for a more radical solution like denying all blocks from future right away and not accept them, not now and not in the future (like it is now), but someone told me that wouldn't be possible because of some time warp attack vector that i didn't understand üôÇ

Some users ask why they got many orphan blocks. 

"Generated but not accepted".

It's important for everyone to synchronize the computer's clock.

If your device's clock is not perfectly accurate, your generated blocks will have a wrong timestamp and so be rejected.

So orphan

iirc there is 'some' deviation of the computer clock ~~possible~~  allowed. Don't know the limits on that.


[17-Feb-21 06:37 AM] CHMEX#0686
Alright also mentioned you need to accept those to prevent some sort of attavk

[17-Feb-21 06:56 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Neither am I: setting your computers clock forward would prevent most miners to find a block if accepted. It would open up the chain to an attack with relatively little hashpower needed.

Stratum does not like the 500 errors when calling getblocktemplate. I finally found a block with my gpus. If I enable mining on Soulja, many miners will complain due tu interrupted connections ...


[17-Feb-21 07:43 AM] phm87#7395
Sad that mining is not smooth on a smartchain that may have some exposure. I don't want to trick my clock so I will load a hidden coin on the same stratum

seems most of the miners on SOULJA have a wrong clock

Specially on non dpow chains


[17-Feb-21 08:03 AM] cipi#4502
yes, thought the same... you are right... and not sure about the banning either... just because the block was coming for the peer x does not necessarily mean that peer actually mined the block, could just be relaying it... right?


[17-Feb-21 08:03 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes correct


[17-Feb-21 08:04 AM] CHMEX#0686

[17-Feb-21 08:11 AM] phm87#7395
There is a way: in yiimp, I see blockheight of each peer. When a block is found, one will be higher than other. I can add a if and link with blocknotify maybe


[17-Feb-21 08:11 AM] cipi#4502
i guess we can expect that from serious miners... that they run ntpd and keep their clock in sync... not 7 minutes apart, max couple of seconds


[17-Feb-21 08:13 AM] CHMEX#0686
One of the bigger kmd pool has its clock 2 minutes behind on all coins it mines


[17-Feb-21 08:14 AM] phm87#7395
We should check the 2 public pools also per block found


[17-Feb-21 08:15 AM] cipi#4502
if those blocks would be rejected by all other peers, these miners would certainly fix their shit... if they don't find any blocks, they will fix it... but only then


[17-Feb-21 08:25 AM] phm87#7395
About my story of 2018, the coin developers maintained a (secret) excel sheet with all pools, IP, Addresses of pools and so on to be able to track problems on network. I think that KMD Team also have such excel sheet (and webworker01's website and smk's one)


[17-Feb-21 08:31 AM] cipi#4502
i will try to identify them by hand... something like `komodo-cli -ac_name=SOULJA getpeerinfo | grep -E "(\"addr\"|synced_headers)"`... btw, which value is best to look after, synced_headers or synced_blocks? i guess headers are simply synced faster than blocks


[17-Feb-21 08:41 AM] phm87#7395
Thank you. A possible attack is to send headers but delay blocks, I forgot the name


[17-Feb-21 08:45 AM] phm87#7395
I'll sent you a printscreen in DM @cipi  sorry, maybe useful


[17-Feb-21 08:48 AM] phm87#7395
I'll check again later when the problem occurs and I'll send you another printscreen in DM (if it helps). A getpeerinfo is called when I refresh this page


[17-Feb-21 11:52 AM] cipi#4502
btw, `getpeerinfo` shows `"timeoffset": 0` for the peers there... banning those with timeoffset != 0 could help

üéâ UniMining.net is adding support for mining SOULJA üéâ

Stratum URL:
```equihash.eu1.unimining.net```
Stratum Port:
```2152```
Password:
```c=SOULJA```
Username:
```Your KMD/SOULJA address, example: RYTWfHVK5p8jeXye4rxcPB3W8Y9T5AV2U6```
Example of connection string with ccminer:
```ccminer-x64 -a equihash -o stratum+tcp://equihash.eu1.unimining.net:2152 -u RYTWfHVK5p8jeXye4rxcPB3W8Y9T5AV2U6 -p c=SOULJA```
Due to the issues of SOULJA network discussed here above, connection between miner and stratum was interrupted very often. To mitigate this issue, another coin is loaded on the stratum so when SOULJA can't be mined (500 HTTP error returned by getblocktemplate during few minutes), shares are sent towards the other coin. Conversion from the other coin to SOULJA is automated. I hope that the network issue (miner with bad clock allowed) will be solved soon.

Not sure that banning peers with the longer chain because you don't like how the stock komodo daemon works is the proper course of action

```sh
$ echo "G: $(wget -qSO- --max-redirect=0 www.google.com 2>&1 | grep Date: | cut -d' ' -f5-8)" && echo "L: $(date -u| cut -d' ' -f2-5)"

in any rage from 2 mins slow to 59 seconds fast, the only getblocktemplate errors I've gotten since decker fixed the if is in the 1st 1/10th of a second after producing a block (while the block is still being checked and neither valid or invalid)

[20-Feb-21 07:57 PM] lightspeed393#5403
go for it


[20-Feb-21 08:00 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
make sure to include this screw up on SOULJA if anyone posts it on bitcointalk forum:

the calculations for doing 1% founders rewards is wrong. It is actually 100% ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[20-Feb-21 08:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
That is why I burnt 99% from founders rewards recently, and kept 1%


[20-Feb-21 08:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
those are reserved in case marketing or other community things required.


[20-Feb-21 08:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but acknoledge this screw up where you post about SOULJA


[20-Feb-21 08:01 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is a trust issue


[20-Feb-21 08:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and people can indeed argue they can not trust in the creator "me" as if he'll for sure burn the future founders rewards or not


[20-Feb-21 08:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
people don't know me, so I would totally understand that argument as legit, and it is indeed a concerning point.


[20-Feb-21 08:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Another reason, I felt not so motivated about SOULJA due to this screw up


[20-Feb-21 08:03 PM] tier#1154
Since it is wrong, it is fine to publish an announcement


[20-Feb-21 08:04 PM] tier#1154
Just explain it clearly


[20-Feb-21 08:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm posting the screen shots of my warnings and screw ups on website now


[20-Feb-21 08:05 PM] lightspeed393#5403
with txid of the burn tx, it shouldn't be too much of a worry

If you upgrade now, is it too difficult to solve this problem?


[20-Feb-21 08:52 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
It is not good to leave this hidden danger, take a snapshot and rebuild one?


[20-Feb-21 08:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that's a good idea too üëç


[20-Feb-21 08:55 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
You can also let the KMD address of the soul boy be the founder. If he is willing to download KMD mobile wallet.


[20-Feb-21 08:56 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Let him be the founder, maybe he will be very proud.


[20-Feb-21 08:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't know if it's possible but may be worth exploring if the value of founders percentage `-ac_perc=100000000` can be changed inside the `komodod` code itself ü§î , and if that will treat it then as 1% instead of 100%


[20-Feb-21 08:58 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
The code is the law, and if there is a problem, it must be dealt with.


[20-Feb-21 09:35 PM] tier#1154
good

What is the feedback from Soulja personally? There was contact at the beginning on Twitter, what is the current situation?


[18-Mar-21 03:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
He never reacted to this chain


[19-Mar-21 06:25 AM] Seko#7408
We should donate 1 million SOULJA to him. üòâ


[19-Mar-21 06:27 AM] Seko#7408
I have no interest in SOULJA, not in the artists and not in the coin. 

He had suggested to want to have control and did not understand. The only thing he understands is money.


[19-Mar-21 06:32 AM] Seko#7408
Thanks CC, I respect you. That's why I save myself a discussion.

[18-Apr-21 07:08 AM] lightspeed393#5403
what do you consider legit? it's a real blockchain with real coins being transacted


[18-Apr-21 07:18 AM] Dyngbj√∂√∂ni#2196
yes but is it backed by the man himself


[18-Apr-21 07:19 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
there are many men that back it


[18-Apr-21 07:20 AM] lightspeed393#5403
no, he was made aware, but he's not actively involved.

You think I centrality control any of the cryptocurrency in Komodo ecosystem??? How  you expect me to remove anything while I don‚Äôt have anything to do with either the code or the decentralised network nodes on any cryptocurrency project in the ecosystem? Do you understand how any ecosystem project works or how decentralised peer to peer cryptocurrency work in general?? Give me step-by-step guide do do what you expect me to do.

As long as 1 person on the planet continues to run a daemon, no chain (in the ecosystem or not) can be "removed"
