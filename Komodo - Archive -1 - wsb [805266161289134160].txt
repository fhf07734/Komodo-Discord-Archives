I kept a few coins for testing on this node


[30-Jan-21 06:44 PM] lightspeed393#5403

@WSBToken @daemonfox69 @wsbmod @KomodoPlatform we are running a full blockchain with its own token platform. We already created test tokens for $GME $AMC $NOKIA and $BB. In addition it has privacy transactions and other smart contracts.

[30-Jan-21 06:58 PM] daemonfox#6136
Hmmm... why doesn't the token call have the name or ticker of the token in the output?

means ppl who arent already versed have to figure out to call tokeninfo to ensure they pick the right toeknid


[30-Jan-21 07:12 PM] daemonfox#6136
Hence why I pasted the above for all 4


[30-Jan-21 07:21 PM] lightspeed393#5403
yea I gotcha


[30-Jan-21 07:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
Looks like you left tBB in the NOK command


[30-Jan-21 07:25 PM] daemonfox#6136
Both are named tBB


[30-Jan-21 07:25 PM] lightspeed393#5403
yup definitely messed that up


[30-Jan-21 07:26 PM] lightspeed393#5403
that's why the list goes by txid and not name, because multiple tokens can have the same name


[30-Jan-21 07:41 PM] carl#3101
Is there a wsb twitter already? That Tron wsb token has one


[30-Jan-21 07:49 PM] lightspeed393#5403
no but someone should make one


[30-Jan-21 07:49 PM] ejuliano#8606
do you want one?


[30-Jan-21 07:49 PM] ejuliano#8606

[30-Jan-21 07:49 PM] lightspeed393#5403
try to get something with WSB coin or blockchain


[30-Jan-21 07:49 PM] ejuliano#8606
unless you have other suggestions for where to get email


[30-Jan-21 07:49 PM] lightspeed393#5403
protonmail is always good


[30-Jan-21 08:17 PM] lightspeed393#5403

want it?


[30-Jan-21 09:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
wsbcoin is better


[30-Jan-21 09:04 PM] Komodefi#5638
so it's been airdropped? can people claim in adex app?


[30-Jan-21 09:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can get that if you like


[30-Jan-21 09:06 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I'm cool with whatever @grewalsatinder but if people want it to be serious wsbcoin might be better than wsb.fun


[30-Jan-21 09:06 PM] lightspeed393#5403
yes, a new atomicdex was released today that includes it


[30-Jan-21 09:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

you may have just almost single handedly executed the most genius marketing move in recent kmd history.


[30-Jan-21 09:10 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Komodefi me? if so, thanks.
but it wasn't indeed me alone.
some other tech members of community made it happen,
and of course the rest of the community who are as enthusiasts of blockchan and komodo tech as I am of it 🙂


[30-Jan-21 09:11 PM] Komodefi#5638
whats ratio for the airdrop?

[30-Jan-21 09:12 PM] Komodefi#5638
when was the snapshot?


[30-Jan-21 09:12 PM] ejuliano#8606
@CHMEX originated it


[30-Jan-21 09:14 PM] lightspeed393#5403
yes, block # of the snapshot would be a good thing to add to the Komodo Airdrop section on the site


[30-Jan-21 09:15 PM] lightspeed393#5403
whatever is easiest for you. You can just point it to the github if you'd like and I can add a cname


[30-Jan-21 09:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@lightspeed393 is it possible for you to setup cloudflaire DNS for it?


[30-Jan-21 09:21 PM] Komodefi#5638
you guys care if I post about it on reddit?


[30-Jan-21 09:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll point my DNS to cloudflaire DNS names


[30-Jan-21 09:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you manage it's domain/subdomain as you wish


[30-Jan-21 09:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Komodefi plz wait till all the domains setup is complete


[30-Jan-21 09:21 PM] Komodefi#5638

[31-Jan-21 06:08 AM] daemonfox#6136
so...


[31-Jan-21 06:11 AM] ejuliano#8606
yes it's great... just for the feeling of opening up atomicdex 0.4 and seeing that you got tens of thousands of wsb coins.  It's already making a difference from the buzz it generated


[31-Jan-21 06:12 AM] ejuliano#8606

90 billion? that's huge sum of supply 😅

Yes its enough to airdrop other coins and / or burn it

it would be the best awareness for komodo and atomicdex especially

The thing we are missing that these other pretend token chains are doing is ease of access to token creation, monitoring and exchange via a webportal, or dAPP in aDEX in our case

It is possible to have a uniswap listing. But it means a centralised bridge at the moment


[01-Feb-21 12:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Someone has to make ERC20 of same supply, have that erc20 listed on AtomicDEX, make it 1:1 tradable to WSB coin, make a pool on Uniswap exchange and that’s how it listed there


[01-Feb-21 12:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
But the potential risk is to the party who 
- makes this ERC20 token 
- a person/market maker who sells these ERC20 tokes for smart chain tokens at 1:1 price on AtomicDEX


[01-Feb-21 12:56 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
could possibly be dragged to legal issues

i do @NutellaLicka 
dimxy is working on on tokens cc support for browsers
so it's only some months away form having a poc web app
now suppose cc enabled on kmd main chain you'd be able to buy/sell tokens directly for kmd


[01-Feb-21 01:31 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It is funny you mention this. I can now publicly disclose a project that I have been working on in the background for a little awhile now, Tokel. Tokel intends to fill this KMD ecosystem capability gap. We will be using existing KMD technologies to offer a Token Platform within the Komodo ecosystem. We are developing an application that will focus on token creation/management and trading (fixed supply and Non-fungible tokens). This will include an in-built tokenDEX and token NFT marketplace. We have the technical support of JL and are being assisted by dimxy in the CC development/testing area at the moment. We have also acquired enough funding to keep the project moving along steadily.

If you'd like to learn more, please head over to our discord https://discord.gg/DZvuAR6QzX

@pbca26 I would love it if you would assist us with our token explorer development. We were currently looking at an insight upgrade to incorporate tokens, but it looks as though you may have already done this.

All of our development efforts will be open sourced and available for other KMD ecosystem projects to use.


[01-Feb-21 01:46 PM] pbca26#5430
i was actually going to work on insight token support this month
after helping marmara team i have good grasp of insight internals
there's also a token wallet app that you probably saw under kp github profile (courtesy of ca333 and naezith)
it's native only for now but works pretty well and has full tokens rpc support including onchain trading

Use this faucet to receive some $WSB memecoin that will never be worth 1:1 with $DOGE

But you could still give it to your grandkids to play with

...if anyone's still even mining it by then

@Artist dabbles with games dev, i worked with him a little bit for proof of concept stuff but i don't have time to do much.  have a chat about making something small for KMD ecosystem.   i had a construct.net implementation for giving out tokens/coins.  very easy to make a centralized web based game with payments of coins out to the player

[05-Feb-21 03:07 AM] jvr#6773
yes, thanks for the heads up! It's also how $DOGE started so we'll see in the long run maybe it'll turn into something someday and maybe never


[05-Feb-21 03:08 AM] ejuliano#8606
yes... so if you want to offset that chance, you could take a look at verus coin, you can even mine it with cpu

I created a erc20 token with the 90b supply and added it to uniswap:
https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap?inputCurrency=0x6e4926ed5b823cc28ce6e9e202a1896790bae560
same amount of airdropped tokens are in the Pool with liquidity.
Next step would be to compare fees between uniswap and atomicdex

@ca333 plz do your magic mate,
We need wsb erc20 on AtomicDEX


[06-Feb-21 12:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think since it is not on coinpaprika, it has to be added via source code pr


[06-Feb-21 12:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@CHMEX that’s great start


[06-Feb-21 12:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Once ERC20 is on AtomicDEX a 1:1 swap can be put on AtomicDEX which can allow goin in and out of ERC20, and able to trade it on uniswp via pool there


[06-Feb-21 12:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So it will be supported cross blockchain platforms and multiple DEXes

Get a Hummingbot integration
The liquidity multiplier will draw lots of attention


[06-Feb-21 02:12 AM] CHMEX#0686
With that people dont need to write their own connectors between cex and adex. Or maybe such a thing is already in works idk

@cipi ^ fyi feedback welcome


[06-Feb-21 03:36 AM] cipi#4502
i run my own bot on adex and several CEXes, but i don't let it withdraw automatically, i do that manually
problem are the withdraw fees on the CEXes and the time it takes for the funds to be credited to your account there... the bot updates the prices every 30s on a CEX and if i would let it also send eg KMD to Binance in the same run, the funds would not be there in 30s, so i would need to take the in-transit KMD into account too the next time it runs
most of the time when the BTC/ETH/USDT on Binance are empty i don't even send those coins there but some other coins that i then convert to one of these manually, eg LTC or whatever coin has a "surplus" on ADEX


[06-Feb-21 04:47 AM] ejuliano#8606
wow that's incredible!  so is it available and visible right now on uniswap?  or not yet?

To import the coin definition in an existing Verus Desktop installation:
- `+ Add Coin`
- do not select a coin: pres `ALT` 3 times or type `ADDFROMFILE` (in capitals!!!) in the coin selection box
- click `Choose File`
- browse and select `WSB_import.txt`
- choose native or lite mode as desired.

📌 Private addresses will not (yet) be active in Verus Desktop native mode, although the import file is prepared for it.
📌 If you *deactivate* the chain, you will need to import `WSB_import.txt` again to activate. Wallet restart **will** remember the chain.

that looks like an address for another WSB coin. This WSB addresses start with `R` or `zs` for private addresses.

WBS can't produce blocks normally.


[13-Feb-21 04:02 AM] cipi#4502
someone should mine the chain... i mined 2 blocks, but i don't really want to do it 😉


[13-Feb-21 04:10 AM] CHMEX#0686
I have 30 cores running on it get like one each 6 hours till the diff drops


[13-Feb-21 04:12 AM] cipi#4502
diff is now at 85568... what would be a normal diff for a cpu-only mined chain?


[13-Feb-21 04:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
under 80 would be good


[13-Feb-21 05:53 AM] 花果山#5224
The block reward is only 1 WBS, which is too small, so no one wants to dig.

@CHMEX I got a message from @jvr and he was telling me how he joined the discord for the other WSBC, the one that zoldi posted an address for above, and suggested possibly doing a merger. Supposedly they're having some mining/wallet issues and a possible 51% attack going on. I'm not sure all of the details, but maybe they'd be willing to join this chain if some of the premine could be used to credit the holders of that chain. Just thinking out loud, I'm still not sure how serious everyone wants to get with this project, but figured I'd share it here.


[13-Feb-21 11:49 AM] Komodefi#5638
@lightspeed393 is their chain compatible with adex?


[13-Feb-21 11:50 AM] lightspeed393#5403
not sure. it's a fork of turtlecoin


[13-Feb-21 12:00 PM] CHMEX#0686
Yes that sounds like a good idea we can distribute premine to their address if they want to join


[13-Feb-21 12:01 PM] CHMEX#0686
Started as a proof of concept but happy it still generating interest


[13-Feb-21 12:07 PM] lightspeed393#5403
sounds good. @jvr feel free to share with their dev if you want


[13-Feb-21 12:07 PM] lightspeed393#5403
or if you'd like to @CHMEX this is their discord: https://discord.com/invite/S4qFHwfhHt


[13-Feb-21 01:34 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I mined and kept decreasing my hash to bring the diff down as much as I could. I've hit a bit of a wall at 7k though. Turning off my miner, maybe it's enough for your server to cpu mine more than 1 every 6 hours chmex.


[13-Feb-21 02:07 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I just made a post over in the other discord proposing some sort of merger


[13-Feb-21 02:20 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I hear there are about 12 million WSBC, so there's definitely enough premine for some sort of swap


[13-Feb-21 02:35 PM] jvr#6773
Can the chain parameters be adjusted at this point or is it too late? Like block reward, algorithm, etc.


[13-Feb-21 02:37 PM] lightspeed393#5403
not without creating a new chain, but that's honestly not super hard. It would require taking a snapshot of the current chain, creating the new one, and then airdropping the coins, similar to how @CHMEX did originally to KMD addresses.


[13-Feb-21 02:51 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I've never done it myself, but it would be a cool thing to have documented. Just as WSB helped show how easy it is to create a chain with KMD, it would be nice to have an example to show how other coins could snapshot their existing chain and then create a smartchain and airdrop onto it.

[13-Feb-21 02:57 PM] Komodefi#5638
It would be even more next level if the a pair could be set up on the orderbooks to bring users to atomic dex.


[13-Feb-21 02:59 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I checked further into that WSBC and turtlecoin is a fork of cryptonote/monero which is not included on atomicdex, so I don't think ti would work.


[13-Feb-21 03:01 PM] Komodefi#5638
I see, well there are probably more than a few coin projects out there that we can assimilate into the kmd borg by leveraging the tech and the dex.


[13-Feb-21 03:57 PM] jvr#6773
I think we should pitch it as letting them take over KMD SmartChain or creating a new SmartChain and airdropping both coins with general consensus about the configuration of the new chain. That way they don't feel like they're just abandoning all their hard work. More like scheduled upgrade.

What does that mean, disperse wallets?


[13-Feb-21 10:01 PM] lightspeed393#5403
he was talking about stopping that chain because of errors and restarting and distributing funds out to everyone's wallet


[13-Feb-21 10:01 PM] lightspeed393#5403
basically doing a snapshot to a new chain like we were talking about


[14-Feb-21 01:22 AM] jvr#6773
weird, don't know what his hesitation would be, seems like a no brainer to migrate to a KMD smartchain

🎉 UniMining.net is adding support for mining WSB 🎉

Stratum URL:
```equihash.eu1.unimining.net```
Stratum Port:
```2151```
Password:
```c=WSB```
Username:
```Your KMD/WSB address, example: RYTWfHVK5p8jeXye4rxcPB3W8Y9T5AV2U6```
Example of connection string with ccminer:

WSB can be mined with CPU, GPU and ASIC but please do not use ASIC to mine WSB, CPU and old GPU are sufficient.

any equihash miner that supports both AMD and 200,9*

*sometimes labled as "zcash"

[01-Mar-21 06:53 AM] Komodefi#5638
kind of speaks to the multitude of wsb coins. if we are trying to support a movement we should do so on a united front. and preferably not on the rent seeking piece of spaghetti code known as eth.

well i don't know why anyone who is half educated in this space would not choose komodo for exactly what they (wsb) want to do

[04-Mar-21 01:59 PM] dp-unique#7315
Haha. Just had a question. I saw you mentioned knomp as the best option to use, pool is up and configured, but when I send my miner I get incorrect size of solution. Wasn't sure if you might have a tip on that?


[04-Mar-21 01:59 PM] lightspeed393#5403
what miner are you using?


[04-Mar-21 01:59 PM] dp-unique#7315
Miniz


[04-Mar-21 02:05 PM] dp-unique#7315
Might have just had algo wrong, maybe.


[04-Mar-21 02:05 PM] lightspeed393#5403
like a z9 mini asic? or a software miner?


[04-Mar-21 02:05 PM] dp-unique#7315
software miner running on Nvidia 2080


[04-Mar-21 02:06 PM] lightspeed393#5403
yea most likely the wrong algo. make sure it's equihash 200,9. sometimes referred to as just zcash equihash.


[04-Mar-21 02:06 PM] lightspeed393#5403
a lot of software miners have moved on from 200,9 to other variants because of asic's on 200,9


[04-Mar-21 02:06 PM] dp-unique#7315
ah, yeah. MiniZ is picking up 210,9


[04-Mar-21 02:08 PM] lightspeed393#5403

Strange since it's usually very quiet in here

It might be a bit more economical though for some of those miners to buy WSB from existing holders than mining  🤷‍♂️ just my thoughts but idk

he points out at 4:54 that atomic dex is geo blocked. maybe someone could plug dogedex in the comments as a workaround.

I made a comment saying I'll give away 30 WSB to people who respond with an address to get people started with it. Maybe get some atomicDEX downloads out of it

hey fellow apes I just watched the video and got here, what do you think is the best mining pool and miner? 🔷 🙌


[27-Mar-21 04:31 PM] Marco_3legs🐘#9955
btw i still have to get my wallet so if you have a referral link i'll be happy to use it!


[27-Mar-21 04:32 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I would use the miner that ComputerGenie shared a few messages above.


[27-Mar-21 04:33 PM] JoshTickles#4160
Dex is good, that's what i chose to use


[27-Mar-21 04:35 PM] JoshTickles#4160
and yes, the miner above is perfect for nvidia, reminds me of the good ol ZEC days.


[27-Mar-21 04:35 PM] Marco_3legs🐘#9955
okay thanks! The miner is already configured to mine wsb or do I have to change something in the code?


[27-Mar-21 04:36 PM] JoshTickles#4160
You need to build your own .bat file


[27-Mar-21 04:36 PM] phm87#7395
I am using ccminer to mine equihash on nvidia, not the best one but I am used to it and I read some of its source


[27-Mar-21 04:37 PM] phm87#7395
Spread the hashrate on different mining pools, 3 are listed on the official website

[27-Mar-21 04:39 PM] Marco_3legs🐘#9955
is there any pre-configured miner?

```miner.exe --server stratum.spaceworks.co --user RJmh7rNQdTFsGsmM9NAkDphXmtTes5F7dJ --pass x --port 5393
```
Change the bits you need if you want another pool and your wallet etc.


[27-Mar-21 04:54 PM] JoshTickles#4160
Put it in a notepad, save as miner.bat, and then save in same folder as the miner (if you downloaded the one attach in discord by computergenie)


[27-Mar-21 04:55 PM] phm87#7395
with ccminer, the parameters are a little bit different, do not forget to change the address by yours:
```ccminer-x64 -a equihash -o stratum+tcp://eu1.equihash.unimining.net:2151 -u RYTWfHVK5p8jeXye4rxcPB3W8Y9T5AV2U6 -p c=WSB --cpu-priority=3
pause```

thank you so much! You guys are amazing


[27-Mar-21 04:58 PM] phm87#7395
Usually, I create one .bat file for each pool/crypto. Other miners are better than ccminer. To mine equihash and be profitable, we should use ASICs. Maybe it is more profitable to mine something profitable with GPU and buy WSB : GPU can't compete against ASICs on equihash (but for the fun, we can mine with what we want)


[27-Mar-21 04:58 PM] Marco_3legs🐘#9955
oh okay got it


[27-Mar-21 04:59 PM] JoshTickles#4160
all hashrate helps though.


[27-Mar-21 04:59 PM] phm87#7395
after few minutes, you should be able to see your miner's address on the website


[27-Mar-21 05:00 PM] Marco_3legs🐘#9955
and with a 3070 what level of difficulty do you think i should choose? I went on spaceworks and there's several


[27-Mar-21 05:01 PM] phm87#7395
my pool unimining have a starting diff allowing GPU to mine, I don't know about spaceworks, maybe @lightspeed393  knows (lightspeed is the operator of spaceworks pool I think)


[27-Mar-21 05:02 PM] phm87#7395
but GPU should use the lowest difficulty on equihash, if you don't see any "Accepted" or "Yay" in green after few minutes, the starting diff is too high


[27-Mar-21 05:03 PM] JoshTickles#4160
0.5


[27-Mar-21 05:05 PM] lightspeed393#5403
yea just use the lowest port for gpu mining


[27-Mar-21 05:05 PM] lightspeed393#5403
so 5393


[27-Mar-21 05:07 PM] JoshTickles#4160
would be the same as my bat file above

for pool mining, just download any equihash 200.9 miner


[04-Apr-21 10:38 AM] Heno1974#6038
what is the gen and genproclimit for the start script?
I'm a beginner


[04-Apr-21 10:39 AM] lightspeed393#5403
here's the example from the site. Same starting params as above but with gen and genproclimit added:
`ac_name=WSB -ac_supply=90000000000 -ac_cc=3 -ac_reward=100000000 -addnode=94.130.38.173 -addnode=178.63.47.105 -gen -genproclimit=4`


[04-Apr-21 10:40 AM] lightspeed393#5403
gen tells it to mine. genproclimit tells it how many cpu threads to use

so i ran komodod -ac_name=WSB -ac_supply=90000000000 -ac_cc=3 -ac_reward=100000000 -addnode=94.130.38.173 -addnode=178.63.47.105 -gen -genproclimit=4 

how do i know everything is working fine?


[06-Apr-21 07:33 AM] zigzag#4638
and can i mine wsb with my gpu also?


[06-Apr-21 07:33 AM] lightspeed393#5403
go to the console and run `getgenerate`


[06-Apr-21 07:33 AM] lightspeed393#5403
it should show true for mining and the 4 threads


[06-Apr-21 07:33 AM] zigzag#4638
in the same cmd window?


[06-Apr-21 07:34 AM] lightspeed393#5403
sorry I assumed qt wallet. no you can open another terminal and do `komodo-cli -ac_name=WSB getgenerate`


[06-Apr-21 07:34 AM] lightspeed393#5403
and you can mine with gpu if you want, just download a equihash miner and join a pool.

ewbf and nheqminer both work, but any equihash 200,9 miner will do. just be sure its 200,9 because a lot of equihash miners moved to other variants after asics came about.

WSB on this #wsb channel is a PoW equihash smartchain, you are looking at another token, an ERC20, these projects are unrelated


[19-Apr-21 04:59 PM] phm87#7395
there is another PoW coin (not equihash, cryptonote maybe?), all 3 are unrelated to each other

it is the smartchain of #wsb then, not the erc20

well the erc-20 one you mentioned would be a token

A cryptocurrency coin made for the WallStreetBets community.


[19-Apr-21 05:22 PM] martinoyo#2482
Are there any charts for it? And is it gonna be listed on other exchanges? Do you think any of the wsb coin projects are going to get any aproval with the r/wsb comunity?


[19-Apr-21 05:23 PM] lightspeed393#5403
the only chart is the chart on cexz.ca. There's no plans for it to be listed anywhere else, but this is a community effort so if you have any in mind you'd like to try, feel free.


[19-Apr-21 05:24 PM] lightspeed393#5403
same thing with r/wsb. We've reached out in the past to a few of the wsb folks on twitter, but that's about it. Feel free to share with them.


[19-Apr-21 05:25 PM] martinoyo#2482
The wsb community on reddit strongly belives all wsb coins is a joke and a scam.


[19-Apr-21 05:25 PM] lightspeed393#5403
Well it's definitely not a scam. And not really a joke either. It was mostly started the demonstrate the potential of KMD tech, but anything's possible with it.

I also have some premine funds from chmex still, that I'm happy to give out for tasks. tweets, a post of /r/wsb, etc. basically if you want to contribute you can be rewarded

The total supply forever is 90b?


[19-Apr-21 05:29 PM] lightspeed393#5403
no, 90b was the premine. and there's 1 wsb blocks for mining


[19-Apr-21 05:31 PM] martinoyo#2482
So blocks can be mined forever?


[19-Apr-21 05:33 PM] lightspeed393#5403
yes


[19-Apr-21 05:34 PM] martinoyo#2482
What does that mean for the price of the coin?


[19-Apr-21 05:35 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I'll make no guesses on the economics of such thing. Typically I'd say a coin with unlimited supply makes no sense economically, but look at DOGE.. so your guess is as good as mine


[19-Apr-21 05:36 PM] martinoyo#2482
I see, that answers my question


[19-Apr-21 05:36 PM] lightspeed393#5403
but with 90 billion premine, I don't think 1 coin per block matters too much in the grand scheme.

inflationary money is useful - and it helps to balance out because if there is only deflationary money then things will eventually get bloody in the streets - debtors vs savers;
deflationary money as the base value layer and then anything else can be in abundance; that's what i'm thinking so far

Guys, what do you think about this. I am member in alot of facebookgroups regarding crypto and ico's. There are thousands of new hungry holders looking for airdrops and adventures. Eighter get them here for free drop, or to our own WSBcoin facebook page? Teach them to mine or something? Get automated mine?

so yes it is completely doable, currently I try to have a rendering with the commands of kmd but then I think of supplementing it with all the assets chain, it is only a port to modify if the commands of the blockchain are the same, there is nothing to prevent that 😉
For the moment the app is made in node but I think to redo the API in RUST when I would have real skills in RUST
So thank you for warning me that I can have fun with WSB for mining in CPU or GPU
If I get elected I could spend a lot of time making little tools like this 😇

did you get any blocks? diff is still at 13023511.81728298


[21-Apr-21 11:33 AM] phm87#7395
Sorry maybe I was confused, I thought that wsb and/or soulja had adaptivePoW but I checked and they don't have aPoW ... so yeah risk is high that chain is stuck until one asic ou GPU miner decide to push the chain ...


[21-Apr-21 12:40 PM] 𝓓𝓻 𝓚𝓾𝓼𝓱 |🦄| Komodian#3853
how can I push the chain to him?


[21-Apr-21 12:42 PM] phm87#7395
With gpus or asics at this diff high ...

Yeah, there is alot of wsb projects going on now


[21-Apr-21 04:23 PM] martinoyo#2482
I see in the wsb chart on cexz.ca, a buy order of 1.8m wsb. Why isn't it reflected in the 24h vol?


[21-Apr-21 04:23 PM] lightspeed393#5403
because it's hasn't been traded. it's just on the orderbook


[21-Apr-21 04:24 PM] martinoyo#2482
Because there is no miners?


[21-Apr-21 04:25 PM] lightspeed393#5403
no because no one has sold to it


[21-Apr-21 04:25 PM] lightspeed393#5403
it's just an open order


[21-Apr-21 04:25 PM] lightspeed393#5403
24h volume is traded orders


[21-Apr-21 04:25 PM] martinoyo#2482
What do you mean by sold to it?


[21-Apr-21 04:27 PM] lightspeed393#5403
That order for 1,824,985 WSB at 0.00000001 is a buy order. Someone placed it, signifying that they will buy that much at that price. If you wanted to sell 100 coins, you could sell to it.


[21-Apr-21 04:27 PM] lightspeed393#5403
just as the orders above that in red are sell orders. People with WSB saying I'll sell x for y


[21-Apr-21 04:28 PM] martinoyo#2482
I see


[21-Apr-21 04:28 PM] martinoyo#2482
So why doesn't the exchange have pairs to sell?

that is the page/market for the WSB/BTC pair


[21-Apr-21 04:29 PM] lightspeed393#5403

But it seems to stuck at block 83744. Also the same on some mining pool


[22-Apr-21 01:49 AM] phm87#7395
Chain is stalled due to big miners that left. One miner should burn money to unstuck chain and lower the diff


[22-Apr-21 01:51 AM] phm87#7395
But explorer works fine imo.
Can you open a PR on <https://github.com/lightspeed393/WallStreetBetsCoin> then ping lightspeed ? Then it will be on official website :-)
Thank you for the new explorer !

Good idea. I just push a new PR with the new explorer I have deployed @lightspeed393 Hope it will be very usefull

Yes thats what i am asking


[22-Apr-21 05:47 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> One miner should burn money
mining at whatever the diff is isn't "burning money"
especially when you count the diff drop they get and the many super low diff blocks that will come with dropping the wall


[22-Apr-21 06:20 AM] lightspeed393#5403
thanks for the explorer. your PR is merged.


[22-Apr-21 06:23 AM] lightspeed393#5403
each exchange trades how much has been traded on their platform. you can see on CexZ the orders on the left side that have been bought/sold.

What is the % devide of the pre mined coins?


[22-Apr-21 02:32 PM] lightspeed393#5403
WSB was airdropped to all komodo holders at a rate of 100:1. So if an address had 10 KMD they got 1000 WSB. There are still premine coins left over though for other things but @CHMEX would have more details on that


[22-Apr-21 03:45 PM] martinoyo#2482
Would be nice to know of the number is high or low.


[22-Apr-21 03:45 PM] martinoyo#2482
Somebody needs to mine, people are starting to buy and use the faucet.


[22-Apr-21 03:50 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I mined for a few hours today, 1 block got mined and the diff barely changed.


[22-Apr-21 03:51 PM] lightspeed393#5403
something like 77 billion remain after the airdrop to KMD


[22-Apr-21 03:57 PM] martinoyo#2482
Wow, thats little to much. Are those going in the faucet, how long is that gonna run? I have made more ads.

What diff? If nobody mines the pair isnt bought or sold? Thats what you are saying..


[22-Apr-21 04:07 PM] lightspeed393#5403
no the mining difficulty for the network. diff as in how hard it is to find a block. Trading on CexZ is offchain and doesn't require blocks being found. Only for receiving and withdrawing coins from your wallet.


[22-Apr-21 04:08 PM] martinoyo#2482
I see, so the cexz has its own deposits of wsb already


[22-Apr-21 04:08 PM] lightspeed393#5403
each user has their own deposits


[22-Apr-21 04:09 PM] lightspeed393#5403
then the exchange holds the coins. and gives you a balance to trade with. the trading itself is offchain.


[22-Apr-21 04:09 PM] martinoyo#2482
I see


[22-Apr-21 04:10 PM] martinoyo#2482
Maybe i can mine in the weekend. What does it mean that mining is difficult?


[22-Apr-21 04:10 PM] lightspeed393#5403
blocks aren't being found. which means transactions aren't being confirmed.


[22-Apr-21 04:10 PM] martinoyo#2482
So basicly it is many blocks and it takes more time?


[22-Apr-21 04:12 PM] lightspeed393#5403
no, few blocks. the difficulty is hard, so it requires lots of power to mine a block.


[22-Apr-21 04:16 PM] martinoyo#2482
What makes it hard? Few blocks sounds like it would be easier. Is that some kind of system to force people to mine all the time?


[22-Apr-21 04:20 PM] lightspeed393#5403
the mining difficulty algorithm made it hard because of a large miner using lots of power


[22-Apr-21 04:22 PM] martinoyo#2482
I see. You tell me how to mine tomorrow.

Hey, where to receive from the other faucets on atomic explorer?  Couldn't find any wallets  for them..


[23-Apr-21 08:12 AM] lightspeed393#5403
use atomicdex, it has all the coins available


[23-Apr-21 08:13 AM] lightspeed393#5403
and RICK and MORTY are just test coins


[23-Apr-21 08:17 AM] martinoyo#2482
I couldn't add rick and morty on the atomicdex, but i entered a kmd adress from cexz and that worked..


[23-Apr-21 08:19 AM] lightspeed393#5403
cexz doesn't have RICK and MORTY so those coins are now lost


[23-Apr-21 08:19 AM] lightspeed393#5403
RICK and MORTY can definitely be added on atomicDEX


[23-Apr-21 08:19 AM] lightspeed393#5403
if you face an error, please report it


[23-Apr-21 08:22 AM] martinoyo#2482

I don't get the point with non custodial exchange? Only use as i see is to host independent chains? And why have no synced pairs? Can the exchange be custodial and non custodial at the same time?


[23-Apr-21 01:44 PM] lightspeed393#5403
a CEX (centralized exchange) such as CexZ.ca is custodial, they hold your coins for you. This has downfalls, which have plagued crypto for years. The exchange could get hacked, then your coins are gone. The exchange owners could be malicious and steal your coins, etc. etc. 

a DEX (decentralized exchange) such as atomicDEX is non custodial, you hold your own coins. They are safely in your own wallet until you make a swap. 

AtomicDEX has unlimited pairs. you can swap WSB to any other coin that is on the DEX. Most centralized exchanges like CexZ only have one or a few markets, for example WSB only has WSB/BTC pair. And no, exchanges can't be custodial and non custodial at the same time.


[23-Apr-21 02:07 PM] martinoyo#2482
I don't see the point of having unsynced pairs, then its just a swap with charts. If there can't be both cust and uncust whats the point? Most exchanges offers wallets aswell anyway..


[23-Apr-21 02:10 PM] lightspeed393#5403
i'm not sure what you mean by unsynced pairs or cust and uncust. The DEX orderbooks work just the same as CEX orderbooks, but just not limited to one pair.


[23-Apr-21 02:11 PM] lightspeed393#5403
Centralized exchanges offer deposit addresses to **their wallet** but it's not a traditional wallet for you to use. As I said above, you don't control the coins, they do. So essentially they own the coins and give you an IOU, like a bank.

What i mean by in sync is for example, isnt the btc/usdt pair on binance app the same signal as the btc/usdt pair on houbi and the other major exchanges?


[23-Apr-21 04:12 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
there's no direct link from one exchange's price to that of another other than the actions of traders
the exchanges themselves don't manipulate the price based on some other exchange

{Reactions}
☝️ 

[23-Apr-21 04:18 PM] lightspeed393#5403
it's a free market, each exchange reflects the price of the people trading on it


[23-Apr-21 04:20 PM] lightspeed393#5403
there are traders who will buy on one exchange and sell on another exchange in scenarios when the prices differ. that's part of the reason they stay close to the same price. but they're by no means *synced* with eachother


[23-Apr-21 04:21 PM] lightspeed393#5403
the same thing is true with traditional markets, not just crypto exchanges/trading.


[23-Apr-21 04:21 PM] lightspeed393#5403
you should do some basic googling/research into trading and how exchanges and orderbooks work


[23-Apr-21 04:45 PM] martinoyo#2482
So how does the exchange fill the missing volume of buyers to match the price if it falls on one oaeticular exchange?


[23-Apr-21 04:50 PM] lightspeed393#5403
they do not match the price of other exchanges. The exchange is a tool to let buyer and sellers trade. simply that. the exchange itself does no buying or selling


[23-Apr-21 04:50 PM] lightspeed393#5403

not one of them is the exact same


[24-Apr-21 03:16 AM] martinoyo#2482
That proves my point? How can the price be almost the same over 100 exchanges with no correlation? That is statisticly impossible....


[24-Apr-21 03:18 AM] martinoyo#2482
For it to make sense by logic it has to be like this: the blockchain allows only blocks that match the price signal to be mined and keeps track of the price. The exchange fasilitates the transaction and holds the money, if the ask price is wrong the block is not created... how can there be any other way?


[24-Apr-21 03:23 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> That proves my point? How can the price be almost the same over 100 exchanges with no correlation? 
correlation is not causation
if price on exchangeY is $1 and I can sell on exchangeX for $2 then I'll pull my order on exchangeY back to $2
the exchange has no control over how I set my pricepoint, the overall market does


[24-Apr-21 03:29 AM] martinoyo#2482
It is impossible to belive that the price of bitcoin differs with maximum 1% over 100 exchanges in real time.

[24-Apr-21 03:46 AM] martinoyo#2482

Maybe the buy and sell orders together is what is the governance


[24-Apr-21 03:47 AM] martinoyo#2482
And the exchanges rely that


[24-Apr-21 03:48 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
a) many people on both sides use automated trading
b) the only "signal" is literally looking at a and b and seeing the difference and adjusting
c) big money players make the bigger moves and "joe average" moves with them either by choice or force (that's just how markets flow 99% of the time)


[24-Apr-21 03:53 AM] martinoyo#2482
If that is the case there will be no more exchanges coming, because that would mean all the coins are worth 0 again on your new exchange. And how is that gonna go about when the blocks say different..


[24-Apr-21 03:55 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
exchanges get their revenue from listing fees and skimming tx fees
they care 0 about the actual trading or market prices


[24-Apr-21 03:55 AM] martinoyo#2482
So they follow signals

no, literally the opposite of what I said


[24-Apr-21 03:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

Thats because the structure matters not the inflated value


[24-Apr-21 03:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
and coinbase literally bragged to investors about how much income they make overcharging users for tx fees


[24-Apr-21 03:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
they don't care about structure, just the income


[24-Apr-21 03:59 AM] martinoyo#2482
Yeah i know, alot of exchanges charges alot. And they keep their wallets full.


[24-Apr-21 04:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
99.9% of exchanges don't even have someone on board that can go to terminal and type `coinx-cli help`


[24-Apr-21 04:00 AM] martinoyo#2482
I mean, the serious exchanges doesn't take on coins that doesn't have a propper percentage allocation of the coins. The concept and quality of the chain is what matters for the customer and the pro exchanges.


[24-Apr-21 04:01 AM] martinoyo#2482

I understand that very well, but it is not that simple. And i am glad for that. When the owners own more than 50% of the coins and refuse to sell and give it to the market or the exchanges, they don't deserve the spot.

how about when there are no owners, there is no premine, and the coin exists open?

also, not sure what any of this conversation has to do with #wsb 😕


[24-Apr-21 04:38 AM] martinoyo#2482
Yeah but that is the part of the game, the exchange is not gonna develop the system of your coin for you. If it got to a hold there is many reasons for it. Like you said its the community who dictades the liquidity, and when there is no mining, no faucets or live trading uportuneties, it holts. In the wsb case, what needs to be done in my oppinion is to remove all other pairs that doesn't belonge to komodo on cexz, and get a way to connect live trading pairs, then when your coins has volume, others would want to list it..


[24-Apr-21 05:29 AM] Horneybearman#0736
well you might want to research more of the coins on Coinbase then because ones like Chainlink are 90% owned by whales


[24-Apr-21 06:02 AM] martinoyo#2482
Only a few percentages of coins is in that situation, it doesn't have to be a problem, offcource there will be banks and other centralized entities that manage their own coins. We have to trust some of the employers and systems. Not all of them are bad actors.


[24-Apr-21 08:00 AM] lightspeed393#5403
did you even read the link I shared to you above about people trading between exchanges


[24-Apr-21 08:02 AM] lightspeed393#5403
it's simple, if BTC is 50000 on coinbase, and BTC is 52000 on Binance, then people will buy on coinbase until it reaches binance price because it's cheaper. Trust me the exchanges prices, aren't in sync, and surely not in sync from the blockchain. The blockchain or coin network and the prices on exchanges have nothing in common. in the early days of crypto, there were much larger price spreads between exchanges because there weren't as many traders arbing between each other.

In short: traders set the price on each exchange, there is no *syncing*. We've gone over this a lot now. and as @ComputerGenie said, #wsb channel isn't really the place to have this discussion, it's for WSB coin related things. Try #📈┃talk-trading and everyone will tell you the same thing. Please google and do some research on the topic. It's how markets work and have been working for many years

hi!


[27-Apr-21 11:45 AM] MMuscio#6773

[27-Apr-21 11:46 AM] MMuscio#6773
im not new to mining i just can't seem to find a pool and i dont know which sftware i need to use


[27-Apr-21 11:46 AM] lightspeed393#5403
hi there, WSB is an equihash coin and can be mined with GPU or ASIC's.


[27-Apr-21 11:46 AM] lightspeed393#5403
there are 3 pools listed on the site to choose from

[27-Apr-21 11:46 AM] lightspeed393#5403
actually 4 now I think zpool added it as well


[27-Apr-21 11:51 AM] lightspeed393#5403
software wise for GPU miners, there's a few cuda miners such as EWBF. I don't know of any amd ones

Is this a typo, or is premine = 90,000,000,000 WSB?

1,000,000,001

The premine is currect and subject to burn of 70bn 
Each block from 1 to 90 or so has 1bn blockreward whuch can be considered premine

🤔 

[28-Apr-21 08:01 AM] ejuliano#8606
what if there is a wsb foundation...
of the 70bn to burn, keep 777 million for the wsb foundation or whatever group wants to take it forward; burn the rest 69+billion; and see what happens


[28-Apr-21 08:01 AM] ejuliano#8606
WSB bonfire


[28-Apr-21 08:02 AM] ejuliano#8606
get some traction on atomicDEX


[28-Apr-21 08:03 AM] ejuliano#8606
maybe you keep 7.77 billion, whatever


[28-Apr-21 08:04 AM] ejuliano#8606
it just might be time to drop the load


[28-Apr-21 08:04 AM] ejuliano#8606
any thoughts around this?


[28-Apr-21 08:08 AM] CHMEX#0686
The foundation has 77bn left i was thinking of using it to onboard another coin. Meaning airdrop to DOGE or another one...
Then burn the rest. Problem is once it burned it burned 😎 no way to return


[28-Apr-21 09:55 AM] ejuliano#8606
yes onboard more communities!


[28-Apr-21 09:56 AM] ejuliano#8606
that's an even better option


[28-Apr-21 09:57 AM] ejuliano#8606
is there a way to do it: if you hold your doge on atomicdex/dogedex then your address will be airdropped with wsb accordingly


[28-Apr-21 10:08 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes that is possible


[28-Apr-21 10:08 AM] CHMEX#0686
need to sync a DOGE node and export the addresses with balances


[28-Apr-21 10:38 AM] ejuliano#8606

[28-Apr-21 11:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Is that the same wsb I was airdropped for kmd as well?


[28-Apr-21 11:58 AM] lightspeed393#5403
this WSB is the airdropped WSB you received based on KMD balance

I see.. do you have the rick and morty coins too? You know.. few wants to buy it when owners own more than 50% or something..


[29-Apr-21 04:54 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes they eill be burned in time


[29-Apr-21 04:54 AM] CHMEX#0686
Rick and morty are testcoins and the dev team have the key to those

Someone is mining WSB on spaceworks pool with the incorrect address `0xEC3711D7a522432Adf50041d39Aa797af26b182b`. If you'd like to get the coins you're mining, you need to use a WSB address.

[29-Apr-21 12:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Consider them burned


[29-Apr-21 12:43 PM] lightspeed393#5403
consider them mine 😁  unless the miner notices and reaches out, then I'd be happy to return them


[29-Apr-21 12:44 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I agree. And tokens don't have mining, so I'd think being a miner they'd know the difference

Wsb has no real value does it ?

Believing the utility of this coin has run its course,🐔 will be removing this coin in the next 12-36 hours.
Final payments will be made at such time.
