small survey ... how do you think, how many people used our `komodo-qt` in everyday life? question related to upcoming changes since 1.000.000 block ... currently komodo-qt didn't have needed changes in sources for monthly interest claim support and few other things. we didn't see much interest from the community to this wallet. so, the main question is - should we continue to support it? if nobody uses it, should we continue to work on it?


[27-Jun-18 05:36 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Unless Agama is planed to eventually have advanced features, I think the qt wallet is highly necessary; however, I could just be biased because I use it daily


[27-Jun-18 05:38 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
As to the 2nd part, community interest could have to do with presentation. 99% of the time all people hear is Agama. Granted, it's a flagship product, but I don't think most people even know there is a qt wallet

never used it, but i think QT is underpromoted on KMD platform since Agama is the wallet to rule them all


[28-Jun-18 02:54 AM] jorian#4555
once on the KMD platform, chances are you want an asset or two, and that will want you to go to Agama


[28-Jun-18 04:29 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"since Agama is the wallet to rule them all"
Until Agama has any real coin features, I'll continue to not use it.
imo, Agama is the granny wallet and QT is the wallet for people that actually use currency.

[28-Jun-18 05:08 AM] jorian#4555
well i can use a currency using Agama


[28-Jun-18 05:08 AM] jorian#4555
define use


[28-Jun-18 05:24 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
maybe "use" is too strong of a word and I should have said "maintain personal control of"?
Unless I've just missed something, Agama lacks :
the ability to send multiple payments at once 
the ability to control fee expenses
any way to manage UTXOs manually
and
any way to even know what UTXOs you have.
Specifically, to the last bit, Agama is like cramming all of your money in your pocket, buying a coffee, and then shoving all of your money at the cashier and saying "here, you sort it out and give me back whatever change you decide I should have."


[28-Jun-18 05:29 AM] jorian#4555
good analogy, i think you're right. but it's the easy solution what most people want. If you buy a 23.49$ coffee and all you have are lots of quarters and dimes, then most people are lazy as fuck and rather shove it, yes.


[28-Jun-18 05:29 AM] jorian#4555
the cashier is a computer after all


[28-Jun-18 05:32 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
OK, the flip side to that is:
If you want to spend 9 KMD and you have UTXOs of 10, 10, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, and 0.0001 then agama will bust up your reward 10 and leave you with 10,  3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 0.9999, and 0.0001


[28-Jun-18 05:32 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
because, bitcoin üò¶


[28-Jun-18 05:33 AM] jorian#4555
yeah, who cares. :troll:


[28-Jun-18 05:33 AM] jorian#4555
but anyways, you use QT, i think most of the advanced users use the CLI


[28-Jun-18 05:34 AM] jorian#4555
and in that way, Agama is really the granny solution


[28-Jun-18 05:34 AM] jorian#4555
and that's not bad


[28-Jun-18 05:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm not saying Agama's not a good product or that it's not good for many folks; I'm just saying that I think QT has a place and there are a lot more folks like me out there (that perhaps haven't even come to Komodo yet)


[28-Jun-18 05:34 AM] jorian#4555
if you want more control, you need to do a little more


[28-Jun-18 05:36 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"but anyways, you use QT, i think most of the advanced users use the CLI"
tbh, I use QT on my win box only and cli on nix boxes


[28-Jun-18 07:26 AM] Decker#3767
What about me - i'm using QT on both platforms: WIndows and Ubuntu, it's very convenient ... and Coin Control Features are "unique". I can simply select an utxo from which i want to send coins. Agama doesn't allow this, and from cli - this is a problem too. Because no utxo field in `sendtoaddress` or other cli commands. In CLI i just can do `lockunspent` to prevent few utxos from being spended. But i can't select an utxo from which i wish to spend from CLI ... and this is not comfortable.

I like QT coin control


[28-Jun-18 07:27 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Seems you answered your own question there; yes, we need it üòõ


[28-Jun-18 07:27 AM] Decker#3767
But Qt have other problems ... if you have 20000 utxo with 0.0001 KMD in your wallet - GUI will hang for a couple of minutes to display it )


[28-Jun-18 07:28 AM] Decker#3767
That's why it's not recommended to use wallet.dat with very high number of utxos with Qt.


[28-Jun-18 07:29 AM] Decker#3767
Btw, today i invited @Ocean in this chat ...


[28-Jun-18 07:30 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
The hang and lack of multi-select are negatives, but the hang is more inherent in the core than the GUI (I think)


[28-Jun-18 07:31 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
alternatively, don't mine 20k blocks before you consolidate üòõ


[01-Jul-18 09:44 AM] pbca26#5430
mos of the features you desire are not needed for regular users
if we loose one computergenie  to qt wallet and gain more average joes in agama i say that's a solid win
no one in sane mind is going to work through numbers to save on some dust fee amounts as well as messing with individual utxos
people wanted a somewhat grama friendly product so here you have it
i like qt wallets for their speed and advanced features for hardcore folks


[01-Jul-18 09:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Yes, @pbca26, because what sane person would want to send out 2+ payments at once rather than paying double tx fees ü§¶üèø


[01-Jul-18 09:46 AM] pbca26#5430
how many people need to send 2 or more payments?


[01-Jul-18 09:47 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
When a crypto is actually used as a currency: many


[01-Jul-18 09:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I get going for mass appeal; I don't get the notion of "fek real use cases we love Granny"


[01-Jul-18 09:49 AM] pbca26#5430
well most folks want grandma friendly
they don't need coinage control or mass payments
anyhow all these features are on my todo list but they come last on it


[01-Jul-18 09:50 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
If you were paying your monthly bills and had fees asigned to amount of payments, would you opt for paying extra fees and making extra payments or opt for less fees and only having to make 1 payment?


[01-Jul-18 09:50 AM] pbca26#5430
are you paying your monthly bills in kmd?


[01-Jul-18 09:50 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

[01-Jul-18 09:52 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
keep in mind that this fee argument is coming from a guy that makes his living off of fees üòâ


[01-Jul-18 09:52 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
professionally, I hope no one ever pays less fees
personally, I find limiting options to be limiting


[01-Jul-18 09:54 AM] pbca26#5430
for your own good :)
not w/o a reason


[01-Jul-18 09:54 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Limiting your options for your own good"
Didn't they try that in 1940s Germany?


[01-Jul-18 09:56 AM] pbca26#5430
lets not succumb into history/politics discussion
your consideration is noted


[01-Jul-18 09:58 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
That was more sarcasm than political, but my point is that while I can see keeping Agama as a flagship product, I think that making it the sole focus is a horrible idea
By extension, it's the same as abandoning BarterDEX and only promoting HyperDEX


[01-Jul-18 10:01 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
If marketing is pushing Komodo as an "end-to-end blockchain technology provider", it's counter to that to say that apps with extended features are "insane"


[01-Jul-18 10:03 AM] pbca26#5430
all products deserve focus
but i'm not sure how agama is related to any pr
there's no pr and never was, random tweets and posts don't make it marketing


[01-Jul-18 10:04 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
scroll through the marketing channel (or most any of them) and count the team references to "Agama" and count the total references by everyone (not counting me) for "QT" or "Ocean"


[01-Jul-18 10:05 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

[01-Jul-18 10:12 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
In fact, if you read #komodo-team  from yesterday and don't get the sense that Audo is all about pr for Agama (where wallets are concerned), then I'll never speak of wallets again


[01-Jul-18 10:29 AM] PTYX#6840
I don't see why we can have the best of both worlds and have QT for the technically inclined and Agama as a user friendly wallet


[01-Jul-18 10:31 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
that's what I'm saying


[01-Jul-18 10:35 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
or even add an overlay for the raws to Agama and have it all in one
While I love the technical aspects of Ocean being 1 of only 2 equihash QT wallets, if Agama had actual currency features then this would be a different conversation


[01-Jul-18 10:37 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
It's hard to be an "end-to-end blockchain technology provider" and cut out promotion of a given _x_ feature of tech


[01-Jul-18 10:40 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
And, while it's technically, grammatically true that "Agama doesn't get pr", it's 99.9999999% the only option offered or discussed and I'd literally bet some KMD that about the same percentage of users don't even know that Ocean exists


[01-Jul-18 10:45 AM] PTYX#6840
Does coin control work in spv?


[01-Jul-18 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
same as in native: raw transactions (like mm uses)


[01-Jul-18 10:55 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and to step into my condescending shoes for a moment:
Not counting electron, what tech is in Agama besides a webpage and a bit of ajax?


[01-Jul-18 12:08 PM] PTYX#6840
Your feature request is added to the wishlist. If it's so simple then make the changes and PR. If not, then we wait for the person who tackles the feature wishlist by priority.


[01-Jul-18 12:15 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"If it's so simple then make the changes and PR."
The flip side to that is:
"Why would I spend time coding a feature that already exists in a hugely over-looked, and under-promoted, app already?"


[01-Jul-18 12:16 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
combined with:
"If I didn't suck at graphic design, I likely would have done so long before the Ocean wallet existed"


[01-Jul-18 01:28 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I have to add in, there are tons of people that have experience with QT wallets, so it would be nice to have that experience available with KMD. I use Komodo-Ocean-QT on one machine, so I would like to see it continue if possible @Decker üòäüëè

I am delaying updating master for now. but beta will become master prior to height 1000000


[02-Jul-18 10:40 PM] Decker#3767
ohhh ... this will be too hard, i think, to import all current beta changes to komodo-qt ... `komodo-qt` and  `komodod` is **unmergable**, so, updating komodo-qt it not just `git merge` ... it's a hard work to analyze every (!) commit for compatability with komodo-qt. if you just merge `beta` komodod into `master` - i think we don't have time to import all changes. because currently, as i remember, don't contain anything about new assetchains keys and other things. also, as i remember, dev and beta branches have some changes in library usage ... it seems to me it will like a pain ...


[02-Jul-18 10:42 PM] Decker#3767
importing in komodo-qt current commits from master - is a one work, but if master will be merged with beta - it's a totally different and more harder work.


[02-Jul-18 11:00 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, then make the version compatible with master for now. that should work for KMD, just wont work with the new CC enabled chains or chains using new ac options


[02-Jul-18 11:21 PM] Decker#3767
yes, this was initial plan ... make `komodo-qt` compatible with current master.

I've been writing with Fyookball to negotiate an electron Komodo wallet. They are now integrating ledger and I think it's worth pursuing a pure fork.

It would probably be easier to take the BTCP electrum wallet, fork it to Komodo and then apply the ledger changes to the wallet if it doesn't break anything.

@pbca26 I think easier to fork any existing SPV wallet and modify it for Komodo than integrate it into Komodo-Qt. Is there any SPV wallets for Bitcoin example, that integrated into Bitcoin Core client? I mean not separate SPV wallets, i mean SPV wallet that using Bitcoin Core codebase?


[04-Jul-18 06:09 AM] Decker#3767
p.s. Of course combining native and SPV wallet idea like it implemented in Agama is interesting . But at this moment we haven't such aim.

if there's a library/source that is c based you can make your own implementation
this will be a one of a kind qt wallet
jl mentioned once that nxt pioneered hybrid wallet/mode approach


[04-Jul-18 07:47 AM] pbca26#5430
i guess you can borrow code from bdex


[04-Jul-18 08:51 AM] BlackJesus#6161
If we could integrate ledger access into agama/qt we could put that long talked about issue to rest with ledger nano s


[04-Jul-18 08:52 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Bch has it done so we can definitely somehow modify their implementation.


[04-Jul-18 08:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
or people could accept that hardware wallets come with that downside and caveat emptor

it wont help as change is required inside ledger fw
if it was as easy as integrating ledger would've been done by now

@Decker hey mate, can you please tell me how are you keeping the QT wallet updated with real time updates from blockchain data?


[01-Aug-18 07:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
_I haven't actually tried QT, but I assume it behaves exactly as Bitcoin QT wallet _


[01-Aug-18 07:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
As I know the core daemon has zmq, 
are you using that in QT wallet ?


[01-Aug-18 07:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I want a way to have realtime update from the wallet, pushed to the front-end code.
so I see few possibilities using go as backend and react.js as front-end
- use zmq to get the update on new block/tx and when it sends this update trigger the RPC API calls
- or make a code to process the debug.log file, and use it's realtime updates to trigger events to the go which passes to the front-end react.js code.


[01-Aug-18 07:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
which way you suggest?


[01-Aug-18 07:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Decker @pbca26 @ca333


[01-Aug-18 07:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the reason is this time I don't want to use `interval` push/pull method to get updates from the wallet and then do action.
I want to follow the event driven method of development with next app I'm working


[01-Aug-18 07:48 AM] Decker#3767
@grewalsatinder don't clearly understand the meaning of the question. Komodo-Qt is not external GUI on komodod, it's Bitcoin Core Qt Interface + Komodo Daemon inside. So, it has updates from blockchain data same way as komodod. And GUI part is used for visualisation. It's not used ZMQ or any other interface to interact with "daemon", it has "daemon inside". So, Komodo-Qt = closed integration of GUI and komodod, same as bitcoind and Bitcoin Core GUI.


[01-Aug-18 07:50 AM] Decker#3767
But i think for your purposes to get real-time updates from daemon in "external app" you can somehow use ZMQ or blocknotify ... but i never deep in how ZMQ works, so, can't advice anything concrete.


[01-Aug-18 08:17 AM] pbca26#5430
^ either that or watch debug.log/stdout
bitcoin has an option to output everything to a console, -printtoconsole


[01-Aug-18 09:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Decker okay, thanks for clearing.
@pbca26 in agama do you always do native `komodo-cli` command ? I tagged you as I thought you might be also doing something realtime in agama ü§î


[01-Aug-18 09:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for native wallets


[01-Aug-18 09:23 AM] Decker#3767
I think Agama calls uses RPC requests directly, without executing `komodo-cli` ...


[01-Aug-18 09:25 AM] ca333#0333
@grewalsatinder try `blocknotify` and see if its good for your purpose - its natively available and really easy to use.


[01-Aug-18 09:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ca333 right.... so with blocknotify whenever a new block will be synced to the local wallet, only then the set of API commands will be executed to check on getting updates, instead of doing every set interval api calls every seconds/minutes etc.

@jl777c read up 4 of satinder's messages - ```I want a way to have realtime update from the wallet, pushed to the front-end code.```
that annoying request i make at any opportunity of a blockchain event system, first was in Verus discord with mike about using an event system for their autochains, and more recently for CC state changes and how it will allow for real time UI updates and other oracle like services to be built (supply forecasting etc.).
can we emit to an endpoint?


[02-Aug-18 01:46 AM] Mylo#8306
it's just how app devs and front end devs think - on system changes and reacting to them


[02-Aug-18 01:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
everything happens on a block being received, just grab the relevant info with a blocknotify, blocknotify can be written in C or anything you want.


[02-Aug-18 01:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
the native deamon will call the executable you specify on a block being received, check for condition


[02-Aug-18 01:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
nothing happens if block isnt mined.


[02-Aug-18 01:51 AM] Mylo#8306
sending a tx to mempool happens before the block, and you don't want to be polling for mempool info - it's inefficient compared to an event system that would fire off a 'mempoolTxReceiveEvent'


[02-Aug-18 01:53 AM] Mylo#8306
apps won't be realtime waiting up to 60s for block.  can have a to-be-confirmed state and offer realtime-ness.


[02-Aug-18 02:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
hmmm... then we need to add mempool notify, but what if somebody spams the network?


[02-Aug-18 02:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

zmq is required when setting up the insight explorers. That must be how they can see pending transactions before they are confirmed in a block


[02-Aug-18 08:43 AM] Mylo#8306
nice, yeah that was the first time i saw the zmqxxxxxx settings in komodo.conf.
@grewalsatinder i didn't get much reading done, but it's all about patterns - communication patterns.  maybe have a look at some explorer code to see how it gets the pending tx like xRobeSx says.  thanks @xRobeSx

[02-Aug-18 03:07 PM] DG#6934
Just for my recommendation is that until an stable version of the Zilla QT wallet is released , try the Agama version for now


[02-Aug-18 03:10 PM] Moonraker.Breaks#5590
Ya agama works after the .41a release. Was just hoping i could get it stable. So much potential but so much instability with all the kmd products


[02-Aug-18 03:11 PM] Moonraker.Breaks#5590
One day, it will all work from "download". I have faith


[02-Aug-18 03:12 PM] DG#6934
I am documenting the QT wallet right now is totally easier I think some users will decide in getting their Kmd only in the QT wallet and well Agama will remain for the majority of the users that want a multiwallet


[02-Aug-18 03:15 PM] Moonraker.Breaks#5590
Agree


[02-Aug-18 03:16 PM] Moonraker.Breaks#5590
But at the same time is use the qt as a multiwallet. Can never have too many wallet options

Hello ! How to import my passphrase on KomodoOcean ? thanks !


[17-Oct-18 11:48 AM] DG#6934
@OsTa  You can import the private key in the Debug menu use the command importprivkey "yourprivatekeysherenoquotes"


[18-Oct-18 12:39 AM] OsTa#2589
passphrase works too ? for me importprivkey is only to import private key, not a passphrase üòÉ

Get privkey from your passphrase and import privkey.

Important note to all **Komodo-Qt (KomodoOcean)** users according to new features coming on December 15 - https://komodoplatform.com/upgrade-guide-dec-15/ . As we are all know coming update brings a lot of new features, such as sapling, VerusHash algorithm and others. This is a massive update that includes changes to over 500 different source files and adding new dependencies. Komodo-Qt will follow original komodod branch and will updated too as soon as possible, but this hard work unfortunatelly will not be finished to 15 Dec (!), in this way all komodo-qt users should temporarily switch to use original komodo daemon (komodod) or Agama, until update for komodo-qt will be released. All your funds are safe, just backup `wallet.dat` and continue to use your `wallet.dat` from Komodo-Qt with komodod or Agama, or export your privkeys from Komodo-Qt using `z_exportwallet` and import them into komodod with `z_importwallet`. 

We will keep you informed about current state of Komodo-Qt and coming updates, but keep in mind that current version of Komodo-Qt will be incompatible with new changes after sapling is activated, so, you should temporary stop using it and switch to other wallet.

I  am actively mining Komodo; however when I started the first valid wallet I found was in the Coinomi wallet on my phone.  Is there any additional action I should take?  Please advise ... thank you.  I look forward to downloading the new desktop wallet once  the  link is active on Komodo home page.  Very Respectfully, WX2

I have been because at the time it was the first valid wallet I found and had several rigs ready to go, but no address when I found the one on my phone.  I plan to download the update for the desktop wallet when it is available  but was trying to be proactive in the even their was something I either needed to do, or not do during the update; ie. like not try to move the coins during that time .. this is what I was trying to find out. thx.

Few words about "copyZSendMany[from/to] template context menu". As you are know the GUI for Z-addresses transactions is under developement now, but we actually need a way to send it right now. To get this process easy without full-featured GUI, wallet now have z_sendmany templates. Here is a small demo video "how it works":

It's a fresh start without wallet.dat or start with already existing wallet.dat ?


[18-Dec-18 05:02 AM] Decker#3767
This can happen if the wallet is encrypted or locked. So try to backup your old wallet.dat (if you use it) and start it fresh.

Small demo video that illustrates how you can use current version of Komodo-Qt (KomodoOcean) with PIRATE assetchain. At this time Komodo-Qt have full support of z-transactions with Sapling and Sprout addresses, but GUI part for work with z-transactions is still in developent. Even so, you can use it for KMD or any assetchain, including PIRATE, and make private transactions.

@Decker  Before updating the wallet.dat, can't I use it?


[19-Dec-18 04:36 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
If you use the pre-update wallet.dat, always report an error and exit automatically.


[19-Dec-18 06:20 AM] Decker#3767
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± wallet encryption thing is highly expiremental, we leave it "as is" for users who wanna to test it. but the main plan is to remove wallet encryption from GUI totally. what about pre-update wallet.dat you can use following way:

1. start previous version of komodo-qt, unlock your wallet and export it using `z_exportwallet`.
2. rename your wallet.dat in wallet.dat.bak
3. start new version of komodo-qt, it will create new wallet.dat file
4. import all your privkeys using export file create on step 1 using `z_importwallet`
5. use it as usually ...

@PTYX somehow the QT wallet inherited the macOS Mojave dark theme. generally it looks like normal QT wallet like other ones.

What's the difference between using Agama vs QT? Is QT more user friendly?


[13-Jan-19 01:27 AM] Decker#3767
Qt has a well-known Bitcoin Core interface with it's own features, like advanced Coin Control Feautures (you can select specify utxos for sending or combining), it's not an GUI shell on komodod, like Agama in native mode, it has "daemon inside", so, it's "standalone wallet". And it fully written in C/C++ and Agama uses NodeJS, so, it should be little bit faster. 

What to use Agama or Komodo-Qt - it's a matter of personal preferences. For me - Komodo-Qt it's a main wallet, but when i need SPV (Electrum), i'm using Agama.

@Decker thank you for the explanation. how do I claim kmd rewards on the QT wallet? Is there a QT wallet for pirate?


[13-Jan-19 11:21 AM] SHossain#0007
You need to send full balance to self to collect reward.


[13-Jan-19 11:21 AM] SHossain#0007
Yes, you can use all assetchains using this QT wallet


[13-Jan-19 11:22 AM] SHossain#0007
go to `Launch_assets` folder and double click on the Pirate file to launch pirate wallet

Hi guys, thanks for your awesome work for this great version of komodo and assets chains wallet ! Is there a manner to compile with another branch of komodo, like dev or the Jl777 branch ?


[26-Jan-19 07:45 AM] SHossain#0007
You can't use KomodoOceanQT with other branches from Komodo repo itself. The daemon is built-in and coded directly


[26-Jan-19 07:58 AM] Adli#5025
Okay thank you


[26-Jan-19 07:59 AM] Adli#5025
And you follow the update of the main repo ?

[26-Jan-19 08:01 AM] Adli#5025
As I understand in checking the avalaible command, it is possible to stake with -mint ?

for staking asset chains


[26-Jan-19 08:04 AM] SHossain#0007
but, it doesn't have CC funtionality


[26-Jan-19 08:04 AM] SHossain#0007
staking works with `komodo-cli -ac_name=COIN setgenerate true 0`

great


[26-Jan-19 09:12 AM] Adli#5025

[27-Jan-19 08:44 AM] Decker#3767
Fast way to activate staking in Komodo-Qt: go to Help -> Debug window -> Console and enter `setgenerate true 0`.

If you are using Windows - it's in archive with binaries as always.

If you still can't find it in some reasons, you can use this batch script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/master/release/launch_assets/pirate.cmd to launch PIRATE.


[28-Jan-19 02:45 AM] Decker#3767
If you are Linux or MacOS user just launch ./komodo-qt with following args `-ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225` .


[28-Jan-19 05:56 AM] wookie#7663
@Decker Thanks. I'm on a mac. I searched in the komodo ocean folder and there's no "launch_assets".  
I used ./src/qt/komodo-qt & to launch komodo before, so to launch pirate, is this correct? :
./src/qt/komodo-qt & -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225


[29-Jan-19 01:05 PM] SHossain#0007
@wookie it would be like below
```
./src/qt/komodo-qt -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=178.63.77.56 &
```


[29-Jan-19 01:08 PM] SHossain#0007
it is the same way if you were using `komodod` to start a chain. just instead of `komodod` you have to use `komodo-qt` from the location.

thanks, I'm not too familiar other than the basic getting funds in/out. I'm looking through the help menu, can someone help me understand if there's any difference between importaddress and importprivkey? I can just import an address without the the privkey?


[29-Jan-19 03:17 PM] SHossain#0007
with importaddress, you can't spend funds, that is just watchonly

got it. thanks!


[30-Jan-19 09:48 PM] Decker#3767
New RPC method `convertpassphrase` will be added in next release of Komodo-Qt. It will help you to get WIF for using with `importprivkey` from Agama passphrase.

I never understood why AGAMA wants to support LTC, DASH and other altcoins. I strongly think that it's useless and it just bring more work to them. I hope you will not do the same mistake.


[19-Feb-19 12:30 PM] riseandfall#3726
When I see that now they propose from AGAMA to use the API of coin switch for small trades through the wallet UI. I just think :
1 : what is the benefit for the user ? He saves 5 clicks and take the risk of another software layer (the wallet itself) as an intermediary....in other world a very very small benefit.
2 : how heavy it is ? I think it's quite easy to implement....but in a long term view it just gives you more work for maintenance/updates.


[19-Feb-19 01:39 PM] SHossain#0007
Have you ever asked Coinomi why they have that many coins in their wallet?


[19-Feb-19 01:42 PM] SHossain#0007
> I strongly think that it's useless and it just bring more work to them.
maybe this is just useless to you. there are many users who would like to use and manage most of their crypto from one open-source wallet with only 1 key rather than installing different wallet for each coin.

{Reactions}
üëåüèº 

[19-Feb-19 01:55 PM] riseandfall#3726
But for coinomi this is their core business. I mean doing multi-coins wallet is their core business. They are not working for a specific cryptoproject.


[19-Feb-19 01:56 PM] riseandfall#3726
It's not a a team member of a specific crypto who is doing that.


[19-Feb-19 01:58 PM] riseandfall#3726
I mean myetherwallet for example is there to support ETH tokens  (and it was/is a huge a project)....not all tokens there are in the world

Ps : don't think I'm aggressive...I just say my opinion üòä


[19-Feb-19 01:59 PM] riseandfall#3726
It means that it totally exceeds the perimeter of Komodo....


[19-Feb-19 02:01 PM] riseandfall#3726
You could answer "ok BarterDEX also so ?" And I would say that in this case it would make more sense...


[19-Feb-19 02:02 PM] riseandfall#3726
But to my opinion KMD should more focus on making the life as easy as possible.....*for projects hosted on Komodo*


[19-Feb-19 02:02 PM] riseandfall#3726
Not for the whole world


[19-Feb-19 02:05 PM] riseandfall#3726
You start a new chain on KMD : KMD offers you without effort : safety with dPOW, a wallet (and if possible the possibility to store your new coins on the KMD ledger app if the keying system is smart...and when AGAMA will support ledger), and a gate for exchange on BarterDEX (so you don't have to pray to be listed in an exchange). It means that if you start a project on KMD you propose the essential services in a "turnkey solution"


[19-Feb-19 02:06 PM] riseandfall#3726
But this perimeter seems too narrow as far as I understand. I thinks it's already a huge challenge....but it seems Devs wants to do something even more "challenging"


[19-Feb-19 02:09 PM] riseandfall#3726
If I were you I would consider for AGAMA (and even for BarterDEX) only : KMD chains + Bitcoin....and nothing more.

Just because I have the feeling that QT has another perimeter : just KMD coins. But maybe I'm wrong ?


[20-Feb-19 12:47 AM] jorian#4555
true, KMD and assets in QT


[20-Feb-19 12:47 AM] jorian#4555
i guess it's just convenient to also have BTC and others in Agama


[20-Feb-19 02:11 AM] riseandfall#3726
You are probably right towards AGAMA. But I anyway think that QT choose the right perimeter.

Hi, All ! Here is some significant changes comes till the end on NN election in Komodo-Qt:

1. We fixed some minor bugs in the wallet in Komodo-Qt, one, according to using of `sendmany` command from Debug windows -> Console (earlier it caused wallet crash), second with wallets containing z-transactions and few others.
2. Well-known that earlier we had 3 separate branches of 3 different OSes - Linux, Windows and OSX. Now i'm working on get all of this build from one `single branch`, like original komodod. There was an issues caused by linking OpenSSL 1.1.1a + Qt + other libs, but now all seems solved. This branch is not released yet on Git, but will be published soon and will called `static`. This also means, that you will able to build static binaries (!) for all 3 OS from single branch.
3. For Windows we will have simple and comfortable NSIS based installer.

There is an unoffical "alpha-test" binaries available, for all who wants to test it right now:

1. https://send.firefox.com/download/5569ea3885affb18/#jqFFWAhGMbAxwRxaygsM0A - komodo-qt installer for Windows.
2. https://send.firefox.com/download/da5af4ffd28a5137/#_GhscCPNq2jUKC7-7w3Fvw - archive with static binaries of komodo-qt for all 3 OS: `komodo-qt-win.exe` - Windows, `komodo-qt-linux` - Linux, `komodo-qt-osx` - MacOS. Linux static binary should work on most distros with `LIBC 2.23` (in Ubuntu, it's 16.04 and higher). You can test it and report here will it work on your favorite distro or not.

but additional tests will not be superfluous, bcz users can prefer some "specific" Linux distros, like Arch Linux, Fedora, or others.

Download Qt: Choose commercial or open source
With Qt, you can reach all your target platforms with one technology and one codebase, minimizing your time-to-market. Qt is available under a dual-licensing model.

if you don't have the latest zcash params, it will download. if you have them, it will exit and will tell you they exists


[30-May-19 12:40 PM] SHossain#0007
once done let me know


[30-May-19 12:40 PM] 24052019#7280
This script will fetch the Zcash zkSNARK parameters and verify their
integrity with sha256sum.

If they already exist locally, it will exit now and do nothing else.

[30-May-19 12:48 PM] SHossain#0007
if you want to create a shortcut, open another terminal and type `cd ~/Downloads/komodo-qt-mac-2`


[30-May-19 12:49 PM] 24052019#7280
Typed it but dont think it did anything

that comamnd mean to close the file by saving it

[30-May-19 01:02 PM] SHossain#0007
if you don't know how to do that, just close the terminal you were using to create the shortcut, use the other way how you started next time. just save the steps in a notepad


[30-May-19 01:04 PM] 24052019#7280
okay. sorry for wasting your time man


[30-May-19 01:11 PM] SHossain#0007
how's your PIRATE wallet doing?


[30-May-19 01:17 PM] 24052019#7280
dont know, just following the steps again

[30-May-19 01:20 PM] SHossain#0007
that means you are not in the right directory


[30-May-19 01:20 PM] SHossain#0007
it was there


[30-May-19 01:20 PM] 24052019#7280
im in MacBook-Pro:komodo-qt-mac-2 XXX$


[30-May-19 01:20 PM] SHossain#0007
type `ls` and see if you the `komodo-qt-mac` file is there or not

[30-May-19 01:22 PM] SHossain#0007
if you don't see the file, you are in a diffrent directory


[30-May-19 01:22 PM] SHossain#0007
you need to `cd` to the right directory and issue the start command


[30-May-19 01:23 PM] 24052019#7280
cd ~/Downloads/komodo-qt-mac-2    right?


[30-May-19 01:25 PM] SHossain#0007
should be


[30-May-19 01:25 PM] SHossain#0007
it's your computer


[30-May-19 01:25 PM] SHossain#0007
based on the outputs you provided me last time, it was there


[30-May-19 01:28 PM] 24052019#7280
yeah dont know why its showing up not there, nothing has changed


[30-May-19 01:28 PM] 24052019#7280
pirate.sh.save, PIRATE_7776, komodo.conf, fetch-params.sh


[30-May-19 01:28 PM] 24052019#7280
are in the folder now


[30-May-19 01:29 PM] SHossain#0007
that means, you somehow deleted the `komodo-qt-mac` file


[30-May-19 01:29 PM] SHossain#0007
delete the full folder and unzip again


[30-May-19 01:29 PM] SHossain#0007
and try


[30-May-19 02:05 PM] 24052019#7280
sorted it.

[30-May-19 02:11 PM] 24052019#7280
since it says komodo wallet, im guessing ARRR can be used in the same wallet as KMD?


[30-May-19 02:12 PM] SHossain#0007
the command i gave you is to start ARRR wallet


[30-May-19 02:12 PM] SHossain#0007
if you wanted only KMD the start command would be `./komodo-qt-mac &`


[30-May-19 02:13 PM] 24052019#7280
oh right, i double clicked komodo qt mac in my folers


[30-May-19 02:13 PM] 24052019#7280
chmod +x pirate.sh?


[30-May-19 02:15 PM] SHossain#0007
that was to create shortcut, so you wouldn't have to use the long command every time


[30-May-19 02:16 PM] 24052019#7280
./komodo-qt-mac -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1 -addnode=178.63.77.56 &


[30-May-19 02:18 PM] SHossain#0007
yes


[30-May-19 02:27 PM] 24052019#7280
ran it and its opened up another kmd wallet

you can run as many wallets with this file


[30-May-19 02:29 PM] SHossain#0007
same wallet you can run only one instance


[30-May-19 02:30 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe you are running KMD and PIRATE now?


[30-May-19 02:30 PM] 24052019#7280
i see, it has pirate instead of kmd, sorry i just took a quick glance at the top of the window


[30-May-19 02:30 PM] 24052019#7280
i am yes, sorry


[30-May-19 02:31 PM] 24052019#7280
And the seeds from these are transferbale to agama, once we have the updated agama out?


[30-May-19 02:32 PM] 24052019#7280
thank you hossain, not only did you help me making the wallet but actually taught me about terminals, appriciate it alot.


[30-May-19 02:33 PM] SHossain#0007
if you use native mode, it doesn't use seed, it uses wallet.dat which contains your addresses, their private key and related txs. if you close this wallet and start using Agama native mode for these coins, Agama will automatically pick up these wallet.dat


[30-May-19 02:34 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll be more happy if you can remember all these and learn more while using and help others in need


[30-May-19 02:37 PM] 24052019#7280
ive got the steps down on notepad, at the moment its just a process to me but im going to look up the meaning behind the commands and how it intergrates  together. Once ive grasped it if i see anyone with similar issues i‚Äôll shout up.

then try to build with

I think `git checkout Linux` what is needed (there is no branch `static`)

do i type in my private keys into the QT command prompt with spaces?? sorry for the noob ?


[05-Jun-19 07:22 AM] PeoplesReserve#2704
i confused a key with seed, my bad.......where can i find my priv key?


[05-Jun-19 07:34 AM] TonyL#3577
@PeoplesReserve to get privkey from your seed: https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000027703-get-an-address-and-private-key-from-a-wallet-seed


[05-Jun-19 07:35 AM] TonyL#3577
But you should not use it because it is compromised


[05-Jun-19 07:35 AM] TonyL#3577
What you need to do is to move funds to wallet with other seed/privkey generated NOT in Agama


[05-Jun-19 07:36 AM] TonyL#3577
You can install Verus Agama and create new seed/address in it, then transfer funds from your old address which was generated in compromised Agama: https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000029932-agama-security-announcement please read this guide


[05-Jun-19 07:37 AM] TonyL#3577
If you want to use QT: wait until it syncs, then press "Receive" then login with your seed to Verus Agama and send funds to address which you see QT

Did you change the `komodo.conf` file?  From error looks like that it's corrupted at the moment

@TonyL why would I change it? I jus downloaded i from komodo website as is and trying to install it


[05-Jun-19 08:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Because installation guide suggest to change username and password in it


[05-Jun-19 08:30 AM] ecbuddy#8524

Windows users of Komodo-Qt probably will like installer (!), bcz it automatically downloads ZCash Params (if needed) and creates `komodo.conf` file.

[05-Jun-19 06:32 PM] ecbuddy#8524
@Decker That zip file didn't work for me and I kept getting an error no what matter what i tried


[05-Jun-19 07:27 PM] Decker#3767
If we are talking about Windows installer - there is no any zip.


[05-Jun-19 07:27 PM] Decker#3767
`komodo-qt-win.zip` - static binaries of Komodo-Qt for Windows
`komodo-qt-win.exe` - Windows Installer


[05-Jun-19 07:27 PM] Decker#3767
Feel the difference between zip with binaries, and installer.


[05-Jun-19 07:28 PM] Decker#3767
In case of installer it automatically downloads ZCash Params and creates komodo.conf, in case of zip with binaries - you'll need to fetch ZCash params manually and create komodo.conf, also manually.


[05-Jun-19 07:29 PM] Decker#3767
So, if you are not experienced with this, or don't understand what is the ZCash Params or komodo.conf file - read the docs, or just use the installer.

Excuse me, if the wallet is encrypted, how can I export the private key? How to decrypt the wallet first


[05-Jun-19 09:14 PM] Decker#3767
You should unlock wallet first.


[05-Jun-19 09:33 PM] weldon.gull5#3242
@Decker How to unlock? I don't see the unlock wallet option in the menu.

Same way as in Bitcoin Core and other wallets.

Hi, when i run ./komodo-qt-linux It says Error Cannot parse configuration file: Missing komodo.conf. only use key=value syntax


[05-Jun-19 11:54 PM] Aiz.#1337
i didnt modify the conf file


[05-Jun-19 11:55 PM] Aiz.#1337
all the parameter in the conf file are key=value syntax... or atleast they seem to be


[06-Jun-19 12:02 AM] smkhound#7640
@Aiz. make sure no special chars in your conf file (like /, \, $,!  etc)


[06-Jun-19 12:15 AM] Aiz.#1337
yup just checked it again.. no specfial chars


[06-Jun-19 03:27 AM] Decker#3767
@Aiz. show us your `komodo.conf`, just copy it on pastebin.com and put link here.

Also, show the full path to it on your system.

@jl777c When will a Trezor connection finally come? You can see what happens if you don't have a hardware wallet. On the Trezor page it says that there is no wallet from KMD yet. When can one count on it


[06-Jun-19 04:36 AM] Decker#3767
Hardware wallets is not 100% safe, bcz you can't be sure what actually you will receive with the next firmware update. It's a question of trust )


[06-Jun-19 04:39 AM] Decker#3767
Let's imagine, just theoretically that somebody hacked Ledger firmware update servers ) And inject a code to change a transactions before sign. You trying to send coins on address X ... Ledger shows you address X and needed amount ... but after you pressed a button, coins will be sent on address Y. Just a theoretical case, but also possible.

Guide is for RFOX / PIRATE on Linux, but same process for other assetchains, and on other operating systems change the `./komodo-qt-linux` bit to the launch file for your operating system

I'll just need to the cmd line params for launching ocean with different assetchains

- whereas I have to say, it is possible to enter a convoluted chunk of params, it is not really nice to do so for each of a dozen chains one wants to start- which is why I never did it

@smkhound My friend's wallet ~ put in KMD ~ 15 minutes to see the reward in REWARDS, why can't I?

@ecbuddy so is it working now?


[10-Jun-19 10:06 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
for "non-default", you need to add like
`datadir=/mnt/Storage/CoinData/Komodo/` (or path as per OS)
to komodo.conf and have a copy of the conf in the default location


[10-Jun-19 10:07 AM] ecbuddy#8524

yes, just like any other conf param


[10-Jun-19 10:10 AM] gcharang#6833
theres a solution to add a shortcut in the article @ecbuddy that should work


[10-Jun-19 10:11 AM] gcharang#6833
one thing to note is that, if you remove and connect the external drive, it may get a different letter assigned in windows
so just change the setting at that time @ecbuddy


[10-Jun-19 10:13 AM] ecbuddy#8524

D/Wallets/Komodo/


[10-Jun-19 10:13 AM] ecbuddy#8524
in my conf I put this at the very bottom of it


[10-Jun-19 10:13 AM] ecbuddy#8524
datadir=D/Wallets/Komodo/


[10-Jun-19 10:14 AM] gcharang#6833

I moved the whole komodo directory to my D drive


[10-Jun-19 10:19 AM] ecbuddy#8524
i added the path to the conf file


[10-Jun-19 10:19 AM] ecbuddy#8524
i also moved kmd.exe into the same drive


[10-Jun-19 10:20 AM] gcharang#6833
you mean komodooceangui.exe ?

which houses the komodo-qt-win


[10-Jun-19 10:21 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`I moved the whole komodo directory to my D drive`
do you have a copy of the conf in 
%appdata%\komodo
?


[10-Jun-19 10:22 AM] ecbuddy#8524
no, I was told to move the whole directory as per the link above

Before you start create the following configuration file, named komodo.conf in  cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Komodo folder:

rpcuser=bitcoinrpc
rpcpassword=password
txindex=1
addnode=5.9.102.210

How do I get my WIF from Ocean Qt so I can claim rewards in Verus Agama?  Is it "dump privkey" from the console?


[17-Jun-19 06:47 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@agnewpickens why would you want to? just send it to yourself in QT and be done with it


[17-Jun-19 06:48 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Mmm, didn't know I could do that, first time using Ocean Qt.  Thanks.


[17-Jun-19 06:51 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
your rewards are paid to you for using KMD (even sending to yourself) no matter what client you use


[17-Jun-19 06:52 PM] agnewpickens#7393
Sweet, that makes things easier.

How can I use my Ocean Qt address for HyperDEX?


[17-Jun-19 06:54 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
no clue, I don't use electrum clients like hyperdex

I'll ask in that channel, I guess.

I'am having trouble installing the Ocean wallet on Win10. First i downloaded the wallet, started it and everything was fine and after the intial scan it showed all the adresses/transactions from my agama wallet (which funds i have transfered out due the vulnerability to an exchance). Means no funds there. But it reminded me that it's best to begin with a clean installation and NOT use eventually compromised adresses/keys. Closed the Ocean wallet and deleted ALL references/files from everywhere i had from Agama. Tried to restart the Ocean than, FAIL. Error message. Ok, uninstalled the Ocean wallet as a whole including every possible reference in %appdata%. Unzipped the ocean again, installed and again the same error message. No idea how to fix this, any ideas? Below what i get each time i try to start komodo, wasn't able to find the komodo.config anywhere. Error: Cannot parse configuration file: Missing komodo.conf. Only use key=value syntax.

How do you claim rewards in Komodo Ocean-qt?


[22-Jun-19 12:37 AM] smkhound#7640
just send your balance to your own address. You can check pending reward here - https://dexstats.info/rewards.php

https://dexstats.info/rewards.php
Dexstats Dashboard - BarterDEX and Komodo ECO System
See your unclaimed KMD Reward


[22-Jun-19 12:45 AM] cryptopoli#6868
And is the manual Reward transfer also displayed synchronized in AgamaVerus 0.6.0?   Ok es gibt eine kleine Reward- diferenz zwischen ocean and Verus Anzeige ~ 64 digit.


[22-Jun-19 01:59 AM] smkhound#7640
rewards are calculated on chaon via nLocktime parameter


[22-Jun-19 02:00 AM] smkhound#7640
Verus Agama and Ocean both set this param


[22-Jun-19 02:00 AM] smkhound#7640
they might not dispaly rewards, but you can check that on dexstats

So I am having an issue with my balance. It says I have 0 available ARRR, but I am showing a balance in ‚ÄúPrivate‚Äù. When i try to send it, nothing happens. I believe the problem is that it is marked as private and not available. Could somebody provide some guidance. Thanks.

@Hugh Glass pretend that "Available" reads "Transparent"


[22-Jun-19 03:22 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
As far as the send, you'll have to check the opid in the console to see what it's doing or not doing


[22-Jun-19 03:23 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
"Help"......"Debug window"......"Console" tab...
then use the opid like:
`z_getoperationstatus '["opid-7fe46e63-fc75-48c0-a33e-21fb50746ba0"]'`


[22-Jun-19 03:25 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
opid is in the Z-Send tab where you send, like this:

there are a couple of links within to calculate pending rewards. if you are using Verus Agama or Komodo Ocean wallet, sending balance to own address will claim pending rewards

New version of komodo-qt will be released soon (follow the news on this channel), new and improved features upcoming:

- 99.9% compatibility with jl777/beta branch: support most of newest assetchains.
- `convertpassphrase` internal RPC method to obtain WIF from Agama passphrase for import with `importprivkey`.
- **x5-x7** wallet loading speed (big speed improvements at loading block index db stage)
- other minor & major fixes ...

Installed Komodoocean and its currently synching the headers.  I have my seed from my agama wallet but don't have wallet.dat file.  I can't find a way to reinstall agama desktop wallet.  Are my funds lost?


[04-Jul-19 03:05 PM] SHossain#0007
as long as you have your seed safe, your funds are safe


[04-Jul-19 03:10 PM] SHossain#0007
you can use `convertpassphrase` command to convert your seed into privatekey and import into KomodoOceanQT wallet. follow the example below and replace `agama passphrase` with your own seed
```
convertpassphrase "agama passphrase"
```
output:
```
{
  "agamapassphrase": "agama passphrase",
  "address": "RVHPhunndxxmKBU6nCJHtyopYVYWqER8bX",
  "pubkey": "02f5ea0bf2b72d02f1202247cc294a0c8bf9b70b8e5d6a83852f1421a82be63beb",

  "wif": "UvjTortSCah4Zut4omsHvhhEaX5Pk56gmPEmAEUzhd6KVNkCzgvv"
}
```
you need this wif to import using the following guide

How do you claim your rewards if your rewards address isn't listed in the Pay From drop down in the QT wallet?


[06-Jul-19 08:12 AM] SHossain#0007
https://support.komodoplatform.com/en/support/solutions/articles/29000030305-use-komodo-ocean-qt-wallet-to-claim-rewards


[06-Jul-19 08:20 AM] guttermonk#5375
I already did that when I transitioned from Agama. Now, when I click "Use available balance" it just takes the "available" balance and not the "reward" balance.


[06-Jul-19 08:22 AM] SHossain#0007
until you claim the reward, it can't use the reward value. sending all available fund (not including the accrued reward) will claim the reward


[06-Jul-19 08:24 AM] guttermonk#5375
So generate a new receiving address and send my balance to it?


[06-Jul-19 08:33 AM] SHossain#0007
you can send to same address.

@CombatWombat 
try starting it with the `-reindex` parameter

to do that,
follow "Step 2: Edit the properties of the shortcut" in
https://www.digitalcitizen.life/pin-shortcuts-parameters-taskbar-or-start-menu

to edit the shortcut of the qt-wallet and add `-reindex` at the end

maybe your wallet is not synced with network, do you see a blockheight in the WT wallet @ecbuddy  ?


[15-Jul-19 01:17 PM] phm87#7395
To know if a tx is confirmed, it is better to check on an explorer such as komodod.com

I havent received my last two mining payments from the mining pool so I restarted the Ocean wallet and it was stuck at 99.94% for quite some time.  So I exited that wallet and downloaded the latest version and installed it.  It  also is stuck on 99.94%.  My last block update was July 16th at  12:53:21.  With the recent changes that were  implemented do I need to open a port on my router  to allow block chain updates for this wallet?  Or is there another reason for the failure to update?  Like Windows 10 firewall settings or ?  I haven't made any changes or software updates (other than the Ocean wallet) on my PC.


[17-Jul-19 10:23 AM] spudboy999#5256
Both payments show as valid in the blockchain explorer and have many confirmations on them, so I know they are legit.


[17-Jul-19 10:27 AM] spudboy999#5256
I have the ASUS AC-5300 router.  I did update the firmware on Monday, but my wallet was receiving payments after the update so I am pretty sure that is not the cause.

@SHossain, maybe the invalidateblock/reconsiderblock trick?


[17-Jul-19 11:13 PM] SHossain#0007 (pinned)
@spudboy999 @Catalyst @Andy. @Jame$ please ensure you are using this release specifically. the version number might seem to be similar but USE ONLY THIS ONE and delete your old downloaded one  https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-4


[17-Jul-19 11:17 PM] SHossain#0007
then, check what block you are in. use `getinfo` call from **Help > Debug Window** to find it.
once you found the block number, e.g: for block 1444008 use `getblockhash 1444008`
once you have the hash for the block you are stuck at, use `invalidateblock <BLOCKHASH>` without `<>` like the command below
once that is done, use `reconsiderblock 035ee329fe10944f1b0bf659a8b8d2424322b98532deba0fe225f26eb350fdb2`

i guess use the -maxreorg .. helped me really quick

Please I tried to install Komodo Ocean QT but I am having error message as                                                    
Cannot find the Zcash network parameters in the following directory:
"C:\Users\'''''\Appdata|\Roaming\ZcashParams"
Please run 'zcash-fetch-params' or './zcutil/fetch-params.sh' and then restart."


[19-Jul-19 05:53 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@9jŒ± NiŒ∑JŒ± use `fetch-params.bat` included in the zip file


[19-Jul-19 05:54 AM] 9jŒ± NiŒ∑JŒ±#1533

I saw it, I run it but nothing happen


[19-Jul-19 05:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
there are certain "proving keys" needed to make zero knowledge proofs work in equihash
these same keys are used for all zcash based chains


[19-Jul-19 05:57 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`I run it but nothing happen`
run it from cmd (not by clicking it) and you'll see it download the files

Synchronize the wallet, the display is connecting to the node, but there are 15 active connections in the lower right corner of the wallet, which can't be completed synchronously. How can I do this?

@weldon.gull5 @NO_CPU 
please ensure you are using this release specifically. the version number might seem to be similar but USE ONLY THIS ONE and delete your old downloaded one  https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-4
then, check what block you are in. use `getinfo` call from **Help > Debug Window** to find it.
once you found the block number, e.g: for block 1444008 use `getblockhash 1444008`
once you have the hash for the block you are stuck at, use `invalidateblock <BLOCKHASH>` without `<>` like the command below
once that is done, use `reconsiderblock 035ee329fe10944f1b0bf659a8b8d2424322b98532deba0fe225f26eb350fdb2`
wait for the daemon to get on mainchain which might take some time

if you get an error like this https://i.imgur.com/Ba4PLhih.jpg
stop KomodoOceanQT wallet and lauch with `-maxreorg=300`
follow this guide to do that https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000030462-starting-the-komodooceanqt-wallet-with-command-line-parameters-in-windows

@ParliamodiCrypto the last resort you could try is start the wallet with `-reindex` option. but, i guess before that you can try using bootstrap https://bootstrap.dexstats.info/KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz

@gcharang Hello, sorry but the wallet don't sync neither with the new wallet (g28-4) and the bootstrap
 is still, from 2 day, at 99.78%
Time: lun lug 22 01:09:48 2019


[27-Jul-19 04:52 AM] ParliamodiCrypto#6833
What I can do?


[27-Jul-19 04:53 AM] ParliamodiCrypto#6833
I start it with maxreorg=300


[28-Jul-19 09:58 PM] Morat Gurgeh / Modru#3970
Hello I have been syncing the wallet for days and it‚Äôs stuck at 99.32%. Why ? I need to send coins to another wallet and I don‚Äôt know if I can do it while it‚Äôs still synchronizing?


[28-Jul-19 10:10 PM] Morat Gurgeh / Modru#3970
Ok thanks will try that


[30-Jul-19 09:01 PM] ChairmanJ#2985
I'm trying to download the ocean-qt wallet, and encountering an issue.... It's the first time to install it on my PC. I'm getting the error - *Cannot parse configuration file. Missing komodo.conf. Only use key=value syntax* I'm using Windows 10.


[30-Jul-19 09:02 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
copy the komodo.conf that's in the zip file to %appdata%/komodo


[30-Jul-19 09:15 PM] ChairmanJ#2985
That worked, but now I am getting the ... *Cannot find ZCash parameters* error


[30-Jul-19 09:18 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
there should be a cmd file to fetch params that was in the zip, as well
open cmd and just drag the file into it and hit enter


[30-Jul-19 09:54 PM] ChairmanJ#2985
It worked, thanks


[31-Jul-19 05:57 PM] Morat Gurgeh / Modru#3970
Hello. I bootstrapped as explained above (deleted files and folders and extracted as instructed) but the software just started syncing everything again from 0%. Is this what should happen?


[01-Aug-19 12:10 AM] gcharang#6833
@Morat Gurgeh / Modru it must be loading the blocks
did it finish syncing?


[01-Aug-19 05:07 AM] Morat Gurgeh / Modru#3970
Nope. I didn‚Äôt let it. I don‚Äôt want to wait days again. Can I recover my funds using another wallet software ? This one is not for me


[01-Aug-19 05:17 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
no matter what GUI you pick, you need to let the sync finish (unless you use a "lite" mode type thing where someone else stores the full chain)
that's how blockchains work


[01-Aug-19 05:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
also, if the GUI truly "just started syncing everything again from 0%", then it's possible you placed the files in the wrong location (unless you mean "rescan" and not "syncing")


[01-Aug-19 05:21 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
extreme data corruption is the only reason that it would disregard all data and start syncing from block 0


[01-Aug-19 08:19 AM] Morat Gurgeh / Modru#3970
Yup. Probably messed up. No problem. Will figure it out. Someday


[01-Aug-19 08:20 AM] gcharang#6833
@Morat Gurgeh / Modru did you use a native wallet before or your coins currently in a address created using a seed phrase?


[01-Aug-19 08:22 AM] Morat Gurgeh / Modru#3970
Used agama until the problem and moved coins to this wallet. Then the neverending syncing. Bored üòë


[01-Aug-19 08:23 AM] gcharang#6833
which OS are you using?
I can help you use this wallet properly or help you move your coins to agama


[01-Aug-19 08:24 AM] Morat Gurgeh / Modru#3970
Windows 7 old desktop.


[01-Aug-19 08:25 AM] gcharang#6833
@Morat Gurgeh / Modru RAM ?


[01-Aug-19 08:25 AM] Morat Gurgeh / Modru#3970
8


[01-Aug-19 08:25 AM] gcharang#6833
ok, it should work ok
do you want to try once more to correctly setup this native wallet?
or move the coins to agama?


[01-Aug-19 08:28 AM] Morat Gurgeh / Modru#3970
Which is faster? Though I am not at home now so I cannot do it until my evening 6 or more hours from now. Thanks for the help


[01-Aug-19 08:29 AM] gcharang#6833
@Morat Gurgeh / Modru agama is faster
6 more hours from now is past midnight for me how about after 12 hrs or in the weekend ?

Well, just gonna do a fresh sync again.  Ugh.


[01-Aug-19 09:25 PM] actionslacks#4072
If you're not running the latest wallet this could be the issue. there was a significant update that happened july 15


[02-Aug-19 01:09 AM] gcharang#6833
@agnewpickens were you able to sync?


[02-Aug-19 01:31 AM] agnewpickens#7393
@gcharang  Doing a fresh sync, my previous sync got interrupted a couple times anyway, I am patient, took me a month once to sync my ETH wallet during the Homestead days, when in doubt, do a fresh sync.

using a bootstartp is the easiest
if you tell me the OS I can give you the exact instructions


[02-Aug-19 01:33 AM] agnewpickens#7393
Nah, I am good, I can wait, was just wanting to claim my interest, it will be there when the sync is complete.

Hey guys, I'm new to Komodo. You can stake in the KomodoOcean wallet right? If so, do you need to keep it running to stake, or log in every so often to collect rewards?


[02-Aug-19 10:13 PM] ChairmanJ#2985
I'm reading the page on Komodo 5% Active User Reward


[03-Aug-19 01:37 AM] gcharang#6833
@ChairmanJ KomodoOcean wallet can be used
just open the wallet once a month and send the whole balance to yourself, that will claim your rewards

im getting this error and not sure how to resolve. "A block chain reorganization has been detected that would roll back 267 blocks! (Komodo Ocean Linux )This is larger than the maximum of 99 blocks, and so the node is shutting down for your safety." any help would be appreciated..


[05-Aug-19 10:53 AM] phm87#7395
@arkiii look in the pinned msgs of this channel. Default max reorg is 99 blocks but here the coin daemon detected a reorg of 267 blocks


[05-Aug-19 10:54 AM] phm87#7395
You can read the previous msgs on thiz channel, I think that other ppl had a similar error


[05-Aug-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
you can start with -maxreorg=300 to sync up to mainchain even with a 267 block reorg


[05-Aug-19 05:57 PM] ChairmanJ#2985
So does the wallet automatically credit you when you open it? It shows a rewards balance, so is it already claimed just by logging in?

pleas help!


[08-Aug-19 12:30 PM] phm87#7395
@Warkid  I don't use ocean qt but when I made a search in discord about 1444268 I found several other persons who encountered this problem. Maybe some good tutorial is in the pinned messages. My guess is that you are using an old version of the wallet
Warning: Whatever you do, please do not delete wallet.dat, keep seed and private key secret and backup them


[08-Aug-19 12:30 PM] phm87#7395
Oh ... I discussed myself about the error few days ago : see a few messages above:

[08-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Warkid#2117
How can it be old version? I downloaded it today and compiled it!


[08-Aug-19 12:31 PM] Warkid#2117
Thank you anyway, checking the pinned messages


[08-Aug-19 12:31 PM] phm87#7395
Ocean qt should be a recent version and the maxreorg param should be used at launch, some explanations are in the pinned messages


[08-Aug-19 12:31 PM] phm87#7395
sorry for my wrong idea about the old version ... it should be the maxreorg then


[08-Aug-19 12:33 PM] Warkid#2117
Thx, will try the "maxreorg"


[08-Aug-19 12:33 PM] ComputerGenie#7004

I've the same version with 2 weeks. Z-send is a button.


[08-Aug-19 04:17 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@saskboy 
The zsend tab still appears because its *use* is still enabled for __other__ chains (such as PIRATE)
As Oszy said, it is not, however, usable for the KMD chain
<https://komodoplatform.com/z-transaction-functionality-is-moving/>


[08-Aug-19 11:31 PM] saskboy#5198
What happens when it's used with an R address? I didn't remember/realize it wouldn't work, but it was how it appeared to be able to send from a specified wallet address, because it had a drop-down menu listing addresses to send funds from.


[09-Aug-19 01:21 AM] gcharang#6833

HI!! üòÉ Just learned that the OceanQT can be used for THC, by launching to from the command line!! WHOOHOO! 
1st question, will the OceanQT be operated solely by the commandline?
2nd, can users still input `importprivkey` and `rewardlock` into the OceanQT to migrate their coins and initiate the 100kTHC lock function we have?

TECH Support Question - Help! ...I had the KMD Ocean QT installed but it stopped working, so I tried to reinstall, but never could get it to work again. Then I just got a new computer and downloaded the Windows KomodoOceanQT from (komodoOplatform.com) and tried to install and got error msg "Error: Cannot parse configuration file: Missing komodo.conf. Only use key=value syntax."   ...I have spent hours trying to solve this problem. Please help. Thanks  --- UPDATE --- was able to install Zcash parms and update the cong file - now downloading blockchain -- hope to restore old wallet after.

Just a quick question about uninstalling KomodoOcean (have installed on another computer, now want to remove from my laptop). Is it just a simple matter of dragging all the files to the recycle bin? Or is there more to it than that? (I am on Linux, running Ubuntu). Thanks heaps.


[20-Aug-19 01:02 AM] Oszy#5734
to remove komodo ocean
`rm -rf path_to/ocean_folder`
if you want to completely remove blockchain and other data as well
`rm -rf ~/.komodo` > this will remove every other assetchain data as well not recommended if you only want to delete KMD
to just remove KMD 
`rm -rf ~/.komodo/blocks`
`rm -rf ~/.komodo/chainstate`
`rm -rf ~/.komodo/wallet.dat`
`rm -rf ~/.komodo/notarisations`
`rm -rf ~/.komodo/komodostate`
basically everything from ./komodo folder


[20-Aug-19 01:03 AM] Oszy#5734
as From File explorer yes just delete them from the directories mentioned above


[20-Aug-19 01:03 AM] Oszy#5734
make sure you have a backup of wallet.dat / or private keys / seed

[27-Aug-19 07:04 PM] Daito#0409
in the folder there are 3 files. feth-params, komod-wq and komodo.conf


[27-Aug-19 07:34 PM] ShitcoinWhale#7300
move the komodo.conf to a new location or delete it and restart the wallet, should generate a new one

still get the same message

@BaguioBoy the Ocean wallet is a native wallet. It downloads the blockchain and has a wallet.dat
the wallet.dat file has to be backedup after every transaction

I still haven't been able to claim rewards. I don't get the reply "because you don't get the reward for spending KMD until you spend KMD" Spend, how? Why should someone have to spend KMD? Spend as in make an outgoing transaction first? Please elaborate.


[03-Sep-19 10:44 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
Komodo rewards are a reward for using KMD. That's why you earn more rewards if you use KMD once a month than it you only use KMD once a year.
You can get your reward by sending a transaction. That transaction can be any transaction, even sending your balance to yourself; however, there must be **a** transaction or else there's no way for the new coins to be created.


[04-Sep-19 05:51 AM] gcharang#6833
@ChairmanJ just send the coins to your own address, that will add your rewards to your balance
check here the rewards your address has accrued: https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/rewards


[04-Sep-19 03:33 PM] ChairmanJ#2985
Should I just Z-Send all of the funds back to my wallet address in the core wallet?


[04-Sep-19 09:44 PM] CHMEX#0686
KMD does not support z-trx anymore use PIRATE for that.
To claim rewards send the complete balance to yourself and you receive the reward. Simple transparent transaction.


[06-Sep-19 12:06 PM] WhamBamHampton#9272
Tried to send KMD from a native wallet within the OceanQT desktop wallet a few days ago but it still says 0 confirmations. The native wallet was setup using a backup Wallet.dat from the old non-varus Agama wallet. I'll admit I didn't read in depth about the hack a while back and I'm curious if there was a way to confirm if my wallet funds were effected then or if I'm just having a problem with the OceanQT wallet now.

make sure you are updated to the latest version: https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-5
open a terminal, navigate to the directory where the wallet is unzipped, execute the command
```
./komodo-qt-mac -maxreorg=300
```
or you could use a bootstrap https://bootstrap.dexstats.info/KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz

@hastrup if you are using QT wallet, `./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX getmininginfo` wouldn't work. All you have to do is issue the actual command in Debug Console. Check the DMs on how to get there (you already know). Just use `getmininginfo` there.

Constructive criticism -

Even though I sent myself my entire balance to collect my rewards, I still have the same balance, minus the transaction fee. It really isn't a great system to have to send yourself the entire balance to collect a reward. It sounds a little ridiculous to me. Anyway, it was fun. I'm selling. Maybe I'll become as holder again in the future.


[05-Oct-19 07:30 AM] gcharang#6833
@MetaJames#2985 as to the issue of not receiving the reward, your utxo needs to have lock time set to be eligible
all komodo wallets set it by default
may be you received the coins from an exchange which doesn't do it
check your address here, to see if your coins are accruing rewards

There is a simpler method of importing Agama / AtomicDEX seed in komodo-qt. By calling `convertpassphrase` method you can obtain WIF, which can be imported in komodo-qt via `importprivkey`.

you can  use the  bootstrap zip (unzip it into ./komodo) and try starting the wallet again

I got past being stuck on a block but now that I have loaded the wallet the balance is showing 0 and no transactions. I only had 1 wallet.dat saved, could I somehow have loaded the wrong wallet.dat? Is there a way to see what addresses are on a wallet.dat file?


[12-Nov-19 02:39 AM] gcharang#6833
@jmayhew `File -> receiving addresses` should show your addresses


[12-Nov-19 02:52 AM] jmayhew#4656
ughh, the receiving address (address where the funds were sent to from agama) is not the same as the one currently showing for some reason üò¶


[12-Nov-19 03:07 AM] gcharang#6833
@jmayhew follow this guide and check if you are able to get the private key of the address where your coins are <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024700-how-to-export-your-private-keys-from-the-komodo-ocean-wallet>


[12-Nov-19 03:28 AM] jmayhew#4656
It is saying is not known (code -4), that means the wallet.dat i thought was the correct one is not the one with the funds?


[12-Nov-19 03:41 AM] gcharang#6833
seems like it
maybe search your computer and backups for another wallet.dat ?


[12-Nov-19 03:55 PM] jmayhew#4656
searched but nothing, just not sure how I would have backed up an empty wallet


[12-Nov-19 09:47 PM] Oszy#5734
the safest way to backup is to export private keys, wallet.dat as a file as in your case could be a different wallet.dat, or it can get corrupted especially under windows, never rely on just the wallet.dat file in the future.

[25-Nov-19 12:45 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
is it good practice to allways add self sending rest of the balance in z_sendmany ?


[25-Nov-19 12:46 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
seems for z-addr the remaining will go to same addr, but for t-addr it can just go to some new addr and that is not really intuitive for wallet user


[25-Nov-19 12:47 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
also when z-tx is being process the remaining amount seems gone, didnt notice when to read it


[25-Nov-19 08:12 PM] Alright#0419
not sure what you mean really @passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã , but it's best practice to use a new change address each time generally


[25-Nov-19 10:11 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
I mean take a user used to online banking

[25-Nov-19 10:14 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
here when I do t->t or t->z that do not involve whole balance the remains may go to new balance (but also may stay)


[25-Nov-19 10:17 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
since giu wallets keep same addr then I infer they use z_sendmany from t-addr to 2 addr each time not whole addr balance is needed : 1. exernal addr (outgoing payment) 2. internal addr (same self)


[25-Nov-19 10:18 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
handling that seems problematic too - first tim I did it the script calcualted remaining amount with rounding error of 44e-14 and the total balance was not enough for that üòÇ


[25-Nov-19 10:20 PM] Alright#0419
I'm still not sure what you're trying to accomplish. You should use a new address each time, especially if you intend to store coins on it long term

[27-Nov-19 05:09 AM] erav3n#9290
@passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã for calc address balance - use `listunspent` with filter by needed address and just sum the amounts of available utxos.


[27-Nov-19 05:10 AM] erav3n#9290
`getaddressbalance` can be used only in case if you have `addressindex` enabled, which is false by default.


[27-Nov-19 05:10 AM] erav3n#9290
so, `listunspent` seems exactly what you want.

https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-7 - new binaries of Komodo-Qt are available. This version is not yet upcoming hardfork compatible, it just includes some pre-hardfork fixes:

- Possible crash fixed in case of receiving some mailformed transaction (kmdnuke fix)
- Latest KMD checkpoints added (this will allow correct determine of initial block download state)
- Added SSE4 optimized SHA256 implementation (by default it's turned off, to enable it you'll need to recompile binaries with `--enable-experimental-asm` configure option enabled)
- Fixed sync from scratch / stuck during sync with error like below:
 ```
    CheckBlockHeader komodo_check_deposit error
    ...
    Error: Failed to connect best block
```

- Other minor fixes and improvements.

I have an embarassing problem there: when I run the build it all starts quite well (no issues w/ dependencies etc);
but at some time the build fails with :
_Fetching libsodium ...
http://supernetorg.bintray.com/misc/libsodium-1.10.11.tar.gz:
ERROR 403: FORBIDDEN_
this looks a bit strange, bcs I am fairly sure that I have libsodium installed w/ simple apt-get, and also, why would it try to fecth that lib from a supernet site?
No real surprise that I cant access there, but can I make the build _not_ try that?


[03-Dec-19 10:43 AM] SHossain#0007
which repo and branch you are trying to compile? are you using latest source?


[03-Dec-19 10:43 AM] SHossain#0007
@LocoMB do a `git pull` and build again


[03-Dec-19 10:43 AM] LocoMB#8593
yep- git checkout Linux-dev-18.04


[03-Dec-19 10:44 AM] LocoMB#8593
and before that simply git checkout  Linux


[03-Dec-19 10:44 AM] LocoMB#8593
ok sec will try


[03-Dec-19 10:44 AM] LocoMB#8593
also, build of PirateOcean and komodod works on that setup, (19.04 Budgie) so should be sort of ok..


[03-Dec-19 10:45 AM] LocoMB#8593
nope, says up-to-date - I just checked out half an hour ago anyway

[03-Dec-19 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
but, fetching libsodium, libgmp and libsnark might fail as this host is giving forbidden message and not allowing download `https://supernetorg.bintray.com/misc`
recently, those packages download link were moved to different URL in the main komodo source

F.A.Q.

Q1. Can't understand the structure of repo and it's branches. I tried to build from master branch, but seems it have old and only Windows version?

A. Yes, you are right. Earlier we have 3 separate branches one per OS, master -> Windows, Linux -> for Linux and MacOS -> MacOS. Since Komodo-Qt (KomodoOcean) have new build subsystem and ability to build static binaries for all 3 OS all of these branches are deprecated. You should use static branch to build latest Komodo-Qt. Static branch is default branch for now.```

yes I'll do that- running ./zcutil/build-linux.sh on static branch also gave the libsodium access error

yes, you will get that error until Decker fixes that


[03-Dec-19 01:17 PM] LocoMB#8593
in any case, I am running komodod and PirateQT built locally, so I sont need it urgently- I just want to have a look at the DEX integration there- if I understood that correctly

you need to wait for him


[03-Dec-19 01:18 PM] LocoMB#8593
also, having the build setup running, I just want to have them all built locally for geek factor and to be able to stay up to date quickly - once it is up and running a git pull & buils is even easier than dl'ing  binaries (and safer)


[03-Dec-19 01:22 PM] LocoMB#8593
errrm.. also, the binary that has https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v2.0.15-rc2-g28-7 
has a version number v2.0.15rc2-a977e49


[03-Dec-19 01:26 PM] LocoMB#8593
probably the build system assigned a different version number under the hood when finishing the build - but with a local build, this kind of confusion wont occur any more


[03-Dec-19 01:29 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
28-7 = a977e49
is has to do with how the ifs in clientversion.cpp or configure.ac (I forget which) work out

[04-Dec-19 07:59 AM] Decker#3767
About versioning it's little bit not clear, i'm agree. Internally we have few different version numbers, but common is:

- `3.0.0.0` (CLIENT_VERSION_MAJOR.CLIENT_VERSION_MINOR.CLIENT_VERSION_REVISION.CLIENT_VERSION_BUILD) - this is daemon version, that equals to `v3.0.0-beta1`. And equals `"version": 3000000` from `getinfo` output.
- `0.5.0` - is a KMD version ("KMDversion": "0.5.0").
- `v3.0.0-beta1-9979ca2` - GitHub Tag of current release.

Earlier (from times when Komodo-Qt was available only for Windows) we used different tag versioning, with `-g%VER%-%BUILD%` at the end, now it will be deprecated.

how do i increase the number of transacations I can export to csv file?  I don't see that under the settings window.  So it must be a command line option I suppose....


[06-Dec-19 11:55 AM] erav3n#9290
Use `listtransactions` RPC to export in JSON, then - convert it to CSV or anything you want.


[06-Dec-19 12:05 PM] erav3n#9290
Here is small example how to export address and amount fields to CSV for 10 transactions:
```
komodo-cli listtransactions "*" 10 | jq -r '[.[] | {address, amount}] | (map(keys) | add | unique) as $cols | map(. as $row | $cols | map($row[.])) as $rows | $cols, $rows[] | @csv'
```
Result will be like:
```
"address","amount"
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",-0.01209162
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",12.012906
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
"RF7ahEsFqdskMe6jS9TzeEk6npRjqtjnCw",0.01
```


[06-Dec-19 12:06 PM] spudboy999#5256
thank you for the information.  Is there a way to include the date and time for each transation ?


[06-Dec-19 12:09 PM] erav3n#9290
You can export `blocktime` field also, it's time of block in which it included. Just add blocktime to this `{address, amount, blocktime}` in expression above. Blocktime will be exported in Unix Timestamp format.


[06-Dec-19 12:09 PM] spudboy999#5256
Excellent!  Thank you  very much for assisting me.


[06-Dec-19 12:28 PM] spudboy999#5256
@erav3n   When I use the entire command string I get "Error:  Error  JSON:|"  If I parse it  down  to just  :  listtransactions "*" 100 ....that works but only gives me the last 53 transactions, which is exactly the same amount I get from the csv export button in the app

[06-Dec-19 12:42 PM] spudboy999#5256
I think I need to change something  in the configuration file and reboot the wallet so it has a larger list of past transactions?  I seem to remember having to do that with the Agama wallet before exporting a larger than default setting list of transactions....


[06-Dec-19 12:46 PM] spudboy999#5256
Its definitely not in the conf file I just viewed it  in notepad.


[06-Dec-19 01:15 PM] erav3n#9290
If after `listtransactions "*" 100` you get only 53 txes - seems it's all for all addresses in your wallet. Mean, you have no more transactions associated with your wallet.


[06-Dec-19 01:31 PM] spudboy999#5256
I have been mining KMD for over a year now.  My wallet address did change after the Agama wallet sweep.  I can't remember how long I have been using this address though.  I may have changed it in Oct when I transfered all my coins to an exchange, reformated my HD and reinstalled the QT wallet and then sent my coins back to Ocean wallet..


[06-Dec-19 01:57 PM] spudboy999#5256
Ok that is definitely what happened and since I don't remember the other address, I will just have make a generic entry in cointracking.info for those coins I mined....


[06-Dec-19 01:57 PM] spudboy999#5256
The good news is haven't lost any coins though....

thank you to everyone for helping this clueless (at times) KMD miner....

Bcz it's more convienment to use existing build subsystem to build for all three platforms (Linux, Windows, MacOS), there is no reason to support MSVC separate. And this approach is closer to original komodo repo.

[23-Dec-19 08:03 AM] Decker#3767
@artik123 i guess for on board windows developers, no matter which compiler is exactly using - gcc, clang, or cl from Visual Studio. Developement process is not compiler specified thing.


[23-Dec-19 08:04 AM] Decker#3767
komodo-qt / komodod for now used several programming languages - c, c++, rust and it's not a barrier for Windows, or Linux, or MacOS devs to make contributions into the project.


[23-Dec-19 09:05 AM] Decker#3767
To be honest, i never tried to develope ETH smart contracts, only had quick read few docs about this. But anyway, ETH smart contracts and Komodo UTXO based CC contracts is a different things. CC is more low-level thing and it require from dev deep understanding how the blockchain works, what is the utxos, and how bitcoin stack-based scripting system works. Without these knowledge, of course, it's hard to begin with CC. And to begin with ETH smart contracts it's enough to copy & paste any smart contract template and start with it. But this have an other side ... just remember how many news was about ETH, like "funds was frozen/stolen bcz of error in smart contract" ... )

hey thanks for invite to conversation over here @artik123 

it's easy to make suggestions, but it's very hard to implement them.  suggesting changes to developer workflows who are already working well is even a bigger task.

C++ is not the issue, bitcoin has been rewritten in rust by parity, c by jl777 - btc protocol is not a text based protocol - instead of http where it's text across a wire, it's a cryptographic puzzle.  on top of that, it's also low level bit-wise reconciliation/accounting for every satoshi.   it's a hard protocol.  finding info on bitcoin development setup of IDE / tutorials is not easy.  e.g. `https://blog.lopp.net/how-to-set-up-an-ide-for-developing-bitcoin-core-on-linux/` was not in my first 3 searches & clicks.  maybe youtube is better to search.  __without an understanding of bitcoin, learning komodo is __

i'm busy for the next 6-8 weeks but cclib is the easiest entry point to customizing your "contract".  i have a copy of a chat with jl777 that has been passed around to a few ppl.  i was due to publish it, but better docs were decidedly written by a full time dev & the tech team, so my version was scrapped due to time constraints on the rebrand.  maybe i can publish it in the future anyways?

Here is some the documentation for creating custom contracts.

**sdk**: the team will build these for specific use cases.  they have a games one on the way if you look at the github
**account abstraction**: probably do-able as a CC.  the torus project creates a simple identity bridge between oauth & eth.  similarly, an access token & refresh token in oauth can probably be used with a privkey in a similar way. using tokens etc off this type of account, probably more suited than UTXO.


go-sdk, not sure how many ppl are using it.
substrate has a lot of help from the parity team to help new projects, the same happens in kmd already - just not so many well funded projects hitting kmd atm.  but this will change as the utility and value is realized.


[24-Dec-19 07:29 AM] Mylo#8306
Haha hofstadter law...

Devs are virtually unmonetizable.  The new chain tech (pegs, prices etc) is to create services within ecosystem.  There‚Äôs likely to be great support for btc in this new tech.  Btc is the most valuable. The race to create btc interop services is currently on.

The new services are super valuable to kmd because of the innovative way it is created.  Collateralized debt, margin trading - no other platform offers this out of the box & in a building-block independent way.  Projects like kava & synthetix now exist but are also in early days.

New fintech start ups will literally be able to tweak existing CCs in that ‚Äúweekend‚Äù, but to create even more innovative services will need to invest some resources...on the other hand, accessing the powerful building blocks is accessible by any programming language - via wrappers, but none are developed, endorsed or maintained by Komodo for security & other reasons unfortunately.

Timing...currently it is a bear market afaik.  Kmd marketing only really existed from 2019.  The eth ecosystem has a 3-4 year headstart in this where books and courses have been invested in with the eth foundation providing a lot of funding.  Cosmos had a valuable ico and seed funding.

I‚Äôd really like to get into c++ again, but it‚Äôs been 19 years & I have financial commitments that I need to continue to uphold.  I have my own ambition for helping out in the onboarding of new ventures - which I have finished mapping out this morning.  I have set myself to implement in 6 months.  Most of it exists, just not automated.

I think there‚Äôs plenty of opportunity, it is still being built out and the only real value currently is in btc.

@artik123 strategic multipliers is a marketing / business dev problem, not a dev problem.  Atomic Dex is one way to leverage other users, coin gateways etc thru pegged dev as you mention.  But not a dev problem.  Dual daemon with coda protocol or other is also a new paradigm to explore.

Happy to continue chat in new year, but maybe not in discord.  Perhaps medium articles imo would have better stickiness

those are some good points but it is the multichain compatibility that   pisses upon the competition from a great height. If a cosmos ecosystem product could atomically swap btc for eth, or even cosmos natively, it would be heralded as the second coming. Kmd's only real problem is that it's not holding hundreds of millions of ico funds and/or bagholders to throw at crypto carnival barkers. I hope maybe once the dex is out of beta some dev bandwidth can be more effectively pointed at cc origination, things will probably get a little easier to put together. defi is a giant buzzword now but if the price of eth is any indicator, concentional investor interest and corporate devs are likely mostly being thrown at permissioned and ip secured blockchains right now.


[25-Dec-19 05:55 PM] Mylo#8306
100% agree @artik123 thanks for articulating. From a pragmatic point of view, there are a few devs - yes.  UTXO based contracts - yes harder than a VM at this stage.  Accounts, yes, has not been focus by devs.  100s millions in marketing budget, no.

So, to use your ship analogy because I am a passionate sailor ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚õµÔ∏è, the wind is blowing a bear market, and the goal is around the corner of the point in the distance, the current is against us, but it will change with the tide.  Current course is out to sea where few people can see us, but we have radio contact and good relationships with key people.  When we are headed on final tack with solutions to some key integration points (atomic swaps, btc security in dPoW, nspv light clients with existing CC support, FSM & better community mgmt) headed to the goal - we will have a welcoming party behind the point at our goal.

Timing.  Ppl are hard at work, stuff is still in alpha/beta.

[25-Dec-19 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
i have trained several devs to make CC, not just to code them, but to be able to design them. the reason we dont have a lot more is simple: budget


[25-Dec-19 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
if we can hire 100 devs, we can have 100 CC devs


[25-Dec-19 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
but devs dont work for free and this is where the 100s of millions raised in ICO makes a difference, they can and do hire hundreds of devs


[25-Dec-19 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810
with CC, it is harder to make than an ETH smart contract, but easier to do than a ETH smart contract to invoke an existing CC. and this using of the existing CC is far more what is the level of the less serious developer


[25-Dec-19 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810
from command line arguments, you will be able to create a pegged and backed chain using any crypto and pegged to anything that has a price API


[25-Dec-19 09:47 PM] jl777c#5810
think of it as writing bash scripts


[25-Dec-19 09:47 PM] jl777c#5810
not anything hardcore, yet a lot has been created with bash scripts.


[25-Dec-19 09:48 PM] jl777c#5810
as it is the handful of CC devs are making enough new tech to keep the marketing side saturated. if we had 100 CC devs... there would be way too much tech and the 1/tech effect will kill the price


[25-Dec-19 09:49 PM] jl777c#5810
saying that KMD is a closed system because it is open source but not using the most trendy languages is silly


[25-Dec-19 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
you can write anything in one language that you can in another, i was just an simple C programmer, yet i seem to have been able to write a lot of relevant blockchain code.


[25-Dec-19 09:52 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a reason almost all the core cryptographic code is written in C


[25-Dec-19 09:53 PM] jl777c#5810
having the CC being based on C (C++) is not any disadvantage in the difficulty to create full featured CC, and nothing stops bindings in other languages to be made.


[25-Dec-19 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
we have experience of making language bindings in many different languages with supernet_api, hardly anybody used these other languages. but nothing stops anybody from doing the same for the CC


[25-Dec-19 09:55 PM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr to have inexperienced weekend coders be able to create a CC in a weekend is not realistic (nor anything that should be desired), but in a weekend you can do "shell scripts" that invoke existing CC and that is 10x to 100x the programmers that can do things at that level


[25-Dec-19 10:20 PM] jl777c#5810
yes


[25-Dec-19 10:21 PM] jl777c#5810
more C code has been written than in most other languages. there are millions of C coders


[25-Dec-19 10:21 PM] jl777c#5810
anybody who wants to is able to read the bitcoin, zcash , komodo source code


[25-Dec-19 10:22 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing needs to be paid, nor registered or even an email signup. just go to github, it is all there and documented.


[25-Dec-19 10:22 PM] jl777c#5810
there are plans for onboarding consulting companies who have experienced coders


[25-Dec-19 10:23 PM] jl777c#5810
this imaginary goal of getting coders who dont want to learn the bitcoin protocol, to be able to make CC, is wrong. there are many who understand bitcoin protocol and C/C++


[25-Dec-19 10:24 PM] jl777c#5810
in a weekend, any experienced coder that knows the bitcoin protocol and C/C++ can write a CC. and only the utxo aspect of bitcoin protocol is needed. if they cant be bothered to learn this, they should not be writing consensus code


[25-Dec-19 10:27 PM] jl777c#5810
why dont you suggest to linux that they rewrite the kernal so that coders who only fancy some of the new languages can write device drivers? that they shouldnt need to bother to learn what a device driver should do, but still be able to write one. unix is a total failure since you need to know C to be able to contribute to it


[25-Dec-19 10:31 PM] jl777c#5810
the reality is that some types of coding is difficult, like consensus code. only the best coders should be writing the most difficult code, otherwise you just end up with broken consensus.


[25-Dec-19 10:32 PM] jl777c#5810
there are thousands of blockchain projects, but probably only hundreds who are experienced and capable of doing consensus code. CC actually makes it a LOT easier to write consensus code than just making mods to the bitcoin source. if you have not done both, you are not in a position to make credible statements about the difficulty level


[25-Dec-19 10:34 PM] jl777c#5810
give me 100 senior C++ coders and in a few months there will be 100 CC coders, if that is not enough wait another 6 months after that for those 100 to train 1000 more. So the problem here is not the tech stack. I there can be 1000 CC coders within a year, clearly the lack of CC coders is not the problem


[25-Dec-19 10:35 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, paying for 1000 coders... that is the issue and making sdk for other languages wont solve the problem.

@richardt yes, of course and we dont lack depth in the tech stack so artik theory that KMD is a failure without allowing CC to be created by less experienced devs, it is flawed


[26-Dec-19 07:24 AM] LocoMB#8593
looking at the crypto industry it seems to me as if there are many talented devs, but because it is all so new everybody gets sort of tunnel vision and is blinded by their particular own shiny shiny Blinkenlichten (_this_ is the one that is better than BTC), oblivious to everything else out there- atomization of talent pool is what I am getting at.. some shinies get more attention than others, but once initiated into a particular guild, it is hard to even realize others, let alone switch to them- maybe good strategy would be to slowly build a cult following (as KMD is doing I think) ... just my 2cents


[26-Dec-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo has a habit of incorporating most of the interesting blinkenlichtens, from what i have seen the other multichain platforms are not being used to create new consensus mechanisms anyway (that seems to be the premise of KMD is failing to get adoption narrative)

[26-Dec-19 08:22 AM] richardt#2807
@jl777c If the tech is solid, more funding would only make it better. As to how to obtain more funding - probably only through angel/venture investors at this point


[26-Dec-19 08:23 AM] richardt#2807
However, KMD isn't a company


[26-Dec-19 08:26 AM] richardt#2807
Either that or wait till the next bull market and really capitalize on it


[26-Dec-19 08:28 AM] richardt#2807
As we've seen with previous bull and bear markets (2013 and 2017), many projects slowly die off, even those with promising tech.


[26-Dec-19 08:30 AM] richardt#2807
I think there's a decent chance if KMD is unable to fully take advantage of the next bull market, it could also slowly fade. As many of us have already seen, the competition only gets more fierce and in the end - the project with both tech and funding will come out on top


[26-Dec-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
in spite of everything, KMD still ranging between #50 and #60 indicates it will be one of the long term survivors. we do have enough funding to keep going for many more years and being in the surviving top 100 for the next bull cycle, will only increase our position. a lot of the top 100 are filled with projects that wont last

Hello! Went to sync my Ocean wallet, and saw there's been a whole recent upgrade to KMD. Hopefully I'm not too late to get a new wallet going...

I'm not all that savvy with computer stuff, so I thought I'd just quickly ask here first before charge ahead and maybe break something: I just downloaded the latest release of the Ocean-qt wallet thing, the 3.0.0 one... have extracted the files... now, do I need to delete everything from the previous Ocean wallet I was using first (apart from the wallet.dat file, of course!), and then run the new wallet files? They would then proceed to download all the blocks and stuff, right?

Or can I just replace those three extracted files over the top of where the old ones were, and then run the wallet?

(BTW, I am using Ubuntu 18.04.3 LTS)

Thanks!

@David Jackson when was the last time you have started the wallet?
if it was in the last week, you have to delete the blockchain data(except wallet.dat) and start the latest version of the wallet
it will sync from scratch
if you are in a hurry, you could use the bootstrap
happy to answer any questions!


[26-Dec-19 09:40 PM] David Jackson#9229
@gcharang Thanks for the reply! Yeah, I started it in the last week - yesterday. I try to sync it once a month, so I opened it yesterday, and it loaded blocks for a while. Then I saw it wasn't opening the wallet like it usually would, so I thought I'd better check Komodo's twitter feed, and then I saw the upgrade or hard fork or whatever it is. Thus I went to download the new one.


[26-Dec-19 09:41 PM] David Jackson#9229
So, I will need to delete all the Komodo folders, then, apart from the wallet.dat file?


[26-Dec-19 09:41 PM] David Jackson#9229
including the .zcashparams one?


[26-Dec-19 09:43 PM] gcharang#6833

[26-Dec-19 09:51 PM] David Jackson#9229
@gcharang OK, that's not too hard... what about the "database" folder? shall I leave that one? komodo.conf? does that need to be the new one from the latest wallet files download?


[26-Dec-19 09:52 PM] gcharang#6833
every file other than wallet.dat and komodo.conf can be deleted


[26-Dec-19 09:54 PM] David Jackson#9229
Brilliant. Delete the whole .komodo folder, then, or just the contents of it? What about the "KomodoOcean" folder? Keep that, of delete also?


[26-Dec-19 09:57 PM] gcharang#6833
the .komodo folder has wallet.dat and komodo.conf . so, delete all the files/folders in .komodo other than wallet.dat and komodo.conf
"KomodoOcean" folder can be deleted
the newly downloaded files from https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta1-9979ca2 are enough for running the latest version

you could use a bootstrap if you don't want to wait

"A block chain reorganization has been detected that would roll back 212 blocks! This is a larger than the maximum of 99 blocks, and so the node is shutting down for your safety."

@The Digital Link did you delete the local data and then extract the bootstrap or you overwrite the data?

@gcharang I overwrote the data.

@The Digital Link my recommendation is to 
1) backup wallet.dat, then
2) delete the directories  and files blocks/ , chainstate/ , notarisations/, komodostate, komodostate.ind from your data directory
and then use the bootstrap

@9oklp if you want, you can post your suggestions about the functionality you would like to see in the wallet in the Veruscoin discord in the suggestion channel. It's no guarantee that it will be implemented in a future release, but it is valuable feedback for usability.


[18-Jan-20 06:24 PM] 9oklp#8901
@ùôäùôûùô£ùô†, good suggestion, I like Agama as an easy to use multi token wallet, and for VRSC it has one button staking option, but for some things like tx history it is not so good. It's very frustrating that select & copy don't work, and the tx csv export is very buggy for me.


[19-Jan-20 11:23 AM] erav3n#9290
You can't use Komodo-Qt wallet with VRSC chain. VRSC is different project, it's not a Komodo Assetchain.


[19-Jan-20 01:03 PM] Oszy#5734
of course you can, although kmd version might be missing some features. for tx export it's sufficient

[21-Jan-20 06:02 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
if your OS took 18,738,103,566 bytes (or less) of data and turned it into 27,944,280,064 bytes, then there's a definite OS issue or a huge corruptive flaw in whatever app you used to decompress


[21-Jan-20 06:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
did you delete the original `blocks` folder before you extracted the new one?


[21-Jan-20 06:05 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
if not, then maybe that's it; maybe the extractor didn't overwrite but rather kept both sets of files


[21-Jan-20 06:07 AM] weldon.gull5#3242
I don't know why


[21-Jan-20 06:08 AM] CHMEX#0686

@gekomodo it can be used to recover privatekeys from a corrupted wallet.dat file
from <https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/a/52374>
```
-salvagewallet does carefully try to recover a broken wallet database (wallet.dat file).

What it does is:

Copy the wallet.dat file (wallet.<date>.bak)
Tries to recover only the private keys

@haha5lan if you locked your wallet with passphrase wallet will ask you for passphrase when you'll try to send funds. When you'll enter correct passphrase your privkeys will be unlocked for sign and broadcast tx. If you need to unlock wallet to perform some operations, like dumpprivkey, exportwallet, etc. - use `walletpassphrase` RPC. Type `help walletpassphrase` in Debug Window -> Console to read about it.

I've been experimenting with this wallet, in conjunction with a smartchain, and everything seems to function correctly, but I did notice some commentary (of course I cannot find it atm) regarding incompatibilities with chains that utilize -ac_ccenable ...  What is the issue?  Or am wrong about that?

suggests that all the cc functionality present in a komodo daemon (komodoplatform/komodo --beta) is present in this wallet too
 maybe you read about adding -ac_ccenable causing incompatibilities in chains that have already been launched without it? thats a seperate issue

[18-Mar-20 01:54 PM] Decker#3767
"Hardware flavoured" Komodo-Qt will be available soon. With a new version that has the latest changes ported from Bitcoin upstream it will use CPU hardware instructions for almost all common operations: SHA256 hashing [sse4 ], merkle root calculating [sse41, avx2, shani, shani ] , etc. For end-users it will mean: more faster block loading, faster blocks / transactions validating, probably more faster staking. More changes coming, stay tuned ... and wish all of you good health!

Just for compare on KMD chain:

24678.5 vs 19902.4 ms ... so, it's a 4776.1 ms startup boost. Not very big, but it's boost anyway, and improvements affect not only startup stage.

New Komodo-Qt binaries **v3.0.1-beta3** published: https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v3.0.1-beta3-b8d315b .


[22-Mar-20 05:32 AM] Decker#3767
*v3.0.1-beta3 (v3.0.1.2-b8d315b)*

**What's new?**

- Bump QT to LTS release 5.9.8
- Removed redundant dependencies and unused features from Qt dep. build. Now it should be build faster, also on Linux it's independent from libX11-xcb and libX11 since this release.
- Fixed missing QR codes support. Now you can request payment and get (or save) QR code for it. This feature was broken before and QR code placeholder was empty.
- Better logging and progress displaying on startup. Now you won 't have to wait forever for "Loading blocks ...". Every step have clear progress (%) indication, even in `debug.log`.
- **SHA256 hardware improvements** (sha256d64_sse41, sha256d64_avx2, sha256d64_shani, sha256_shani). As hardware implementation of SHA256 and SHA256D affects almost every hashing operation in core, it should give perfomance boost on startup, loading and validating blocks, transactions, staking and other things. 
- Other minor fixes and improvements.

Btw ... most of us heard about SSE4 / AVX2 instructions. But may be not all know about SHA-NI. If you interesting what is it, you can read - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20692386/are-there-in-x86-any-instructions-to-accelerate-sha-sha1-2-256-512-encoding . The long and short of it, it exists in Goldmont microarchitecture (Intel) and also supported by AMD Ryzen's. Don't sure from which Ryzen it supported, but on Ryzen 3900x Komodo-Qt showed very good perfomance during loading guts, much better than on Intel 9900K. So, Ryzen owners should be happy, bcz Komodo-Qt now uses almost all the hardrware features of their CPU.

@manga by this, do you mean a wallet.dat file?

Is it possible to stake using an encrypted wallet?  Doesn't appear to be, but checking for one of our users


[08-Apr-20 08:11 AM] gcharang#6833
if you mean the pos from -ac_staked, no, an encrypted wallet can't do it. also, if your chain has z-txns enabled, the wallet can't be encrypted
@mediast


[08-Apr-20 08:15 AM] mediast#1110
@gcharang Thanks. It's my understanding (ie: several have done it) that it you can encrypt the wallet on a chain with z-txns, but not if you create a priv transaction from that specific wallet

This may give you more info on why wallets on zk-snark enabled chains cannot be encrypted: https://zcash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/rtd_pages/security_warnings.html

i was still using agama versus 0.6.0.13.... is it safe?


[09-Apr-20 08:26 AM] gcharang#6833
@bbillionaire it can be used if it works for your coin/use case. but the recommended lite wallet to use is Verus Desktop from here: <https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html>


[09-Apr-20 08:27 AM] bbillionaire#8270
and why is agama abandoned? the ocean qt without a lite ver. is really a strange choice .


[09-Apr-20 08:41 AM] gcharang#6833
@bbillionaire the verus agama version 0.6.0.13 you are using was released by the Verus team. later they released a improved version called "Verus Desktop". just try it, you will see what I mean.

If you need a lite wallet created by the Komodo team, you can wait for the AtomicDEX desktop.


[09-Apr-20 08:59 AM] bbillionaire#8270
ok. thx

Hello. Does anyone know why KMD blockchain stopped at a certain block. I go to debug window and type get info. Longest chain says "0" and it stopped on block "240383"


[13-Apr-20 03:21 AM] gcharang#6833
@gus0219 use the latest release <https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v3.0.1-beta3-b8d315b>
if that doesn't solve the problem, resync: <https://community.komodoplatform.com/post/5e285723d79932740a493879>


[13-Apr-20 04:50 AM] gus0219#3509
Thanks alot


[13-Apr-20 05:12 AM] gus0219#3509
@gcharang this doesnt apply to asset chain blockchains on Komodo Ocean correct?


[13-Apr-20 05:13 AM] gus0219#3509
For example I have THC asset chain blockchain not synching. It stopped at 60%


[13-Apr-20 05:15 AM] gcharang#6833
the data directory will be komodo/THC
rest of the instructions are the same
you can find THC's bootstrap on the same link as well


[13-Apr-20 05:15 AM] gus0219#3509

[13-Apr-20 05:50 AM] gus0219#3509
@gcharang sorry to be such a noob. I already resynched with the bootstrap for THC but when I launch Komodo Ocean with THC params the wallet shows 0 connections to Komodo network and connecting to peers just loads but no peers no connections. is it supposed to be like that?


[13-Apr-20 05:52 AM] gcharang#6833
1) make sure the THC params are correct
2) did you make sure you are using the latest version?

which OS do you use and how do you launch the wallet?


[13-Apr-20 05:54 AM] gus0219#3509
I am using windows and I lanched it from command prompt by attaching THC params.


[13-Apr-20 05:54 AM] gus0219#3509
I did use the latest version


[13-Apr-20 05:56 AM] gcharang#6833
@gus0219 using properties of the shortcut?

v3.0.1-beta3-b8d315b-dirty

that looks like the correct version. did you check if anyone in the THC discord is facing the same issue?


[13-Apr-20 06:26 AM] gus0219#3509
Support sucks there. But I will keep trying. Right now THC blockchain is resynching. Not sure why the bootstrap didnt apply. But I really appreciate the help.


[13-Apr-20 06:28 AM] gus0219#3509
Justone last question sorry. So there has to show at least some connections to Komodo network correct?


[13-Apr-20 06:30 AM] gcharang#6833
if the blockchain is syncing, there should be connections, and the connections are to other THC nodes, not to the Komodo network btw 
can you DM me the screenshot of the 0 peers screen?

@gcharang Hi, you helped me some month ago with my migration using the ocean_qt_wallet when I had problems with importing my privkey. Now someone else is trying to do so and he also gets a "code-5" error when using "importprivkey <THC WIF> "" true 0 212".  His privkey starts with "R" - need to change the "true 0 212" argument or anything else? Thanks.


[14-Apr-20 12:40 AM] gcharang#6833
@DreadBeard I don't know if a old THC wif starts with "R"
@Alright will know for sure

you can import that WIF starting with R into komodod daemon, but it's probably not what you're looking for

there also is an export wallet command (that exports a list of addys/wifs), but the app needs to be ran with an `exportdir=location/path` first

You can use the same seed words in the Verus Desktop wallet https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
create a profile -> select it -> wallet -> add coin -> KMD -> lite -> input the seed (activate vote coin similarly.  add coin -> VOTE2020 -> lite)

Hi, does KMD only recommend Verus now? Is Agama now no longer recommended/ supported/ safe?


[03-May-20 09:51 AM] Kay Gee#2313
I'm currently on Agama Version 0.6.1-Tech-Preview-02 (0.6.1.402), installed through the Komodo website in January (I think), haven't accessed or updated for a while, but moving everything to Ledgers (thought I'd put my time to good use during lockdown).

[03-May-20 10:00 AM] gcharang#6833
@Kay Gee if it was this one: <https://github.com/VerusCoin/Agama/releases/tag/v0.6.1> it is safe enough. You could use it as long as it works. but, the wallet is deprecated. the recommended lite wallet is Verus Desktop for now.
You can use the same seed words from Agama in the Verus Desktop wallet https://veruscoin.io/wallet.html
create a profile -> select it -> wallet -> add coin -> KMD -> lite -> input the seed (activate vote coin similarly.  add coin -> VOTE2020 -> lite)

[15-May-20 02:05 AM] gcharang#6833
@ShitcoinWhale it is not recommended to continue using Agama wallet.  for Komodo in native mode, use the Ocean QT wallet <https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases>, for hush, I think, there is a new wallet called Silent Dragon, you can find more info in the hush discord https://discord.gg/kFZunpZ

Hey guys! I'm trying to play with the KO a bit, and I've run into a bit of a pickle, I'm not sure if I'm compiling things correctly, as when I compile a windows executable using debian. When I attempt to run it on my fresh windows box, I get the following error. I followed the steps to the letter from readme, any idea where I went wrong?

@[HysMagus] you just need to download the zcash parameters and the error has nothing to do with compilation problems
- download `komodo-qt-win.zip` from any release here <https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases>
- extract it and use the `fetch-params.bat` script in there

@gcharang  Awesome, I was able to resolve that issue and then ran into an error about valid dlls, found I was missing a vital dll in the directory and got it working, I then moved to https://github.com/ip-gpu/KomodoOcean as that seemed to be active and then started making my mods üôÇ

[04-Jun-20 08:30 PM] gcharang#6833
> cuz QT shit the bed
I don't know what happened previously. but, the current Komodo Ocean QT wallet works well @Janosheek


[04-Jun-20 08:31 PM] Janosheek#8153
It's all this back and forth migration that is frustrating as hell! Especially when your a top notch dumb ass like me juggling 70+ coins. I'm losing my mind!!!!


[04-Jun-20 08:35 PM] gcharang#6833
@Janosheek if you are using native mode, other than installing the app and using it, you don't need to change anything else


[05-Jun-20 12:12 AM] Oszy#5734
> So first we get migrated over to Agama, cuz QT shit the bed....now we need to go back to QT? Wtf??
I don't recall that "migration" but since it's about Agama, it must have been more than a year ago, because there is no Agama anymore. 
As a "top notch dumb ass like you, juggling 70+ coins", you should already know that wallets are updated/renewed yearly to improve security/add new features, or go deprecated.

By the way "migrating" in native mode only means: download and start the other app. all native komodo wallets are using the same folder for blockchain and wallet data.


[05-Jun-20 04:13 AM] gus0219#3509
The version on the QT wallet will still stay the same after replacing old files correct?


[05-Jun-20 05:17 AM] gcharang#6833
old

Hello.  A little confused when looking at the Komodo github.  Is the Ocean wallet the current wallet or the "Komodo" repo?  The Komodo repo is more recently updated than Ocean.  Been trying to compile from the Komodo repo but get an lcurl error.


[14-Jun-20 03:12 AM] gcharang#6833
@Mike-H if you compile from the komodo repo, you will get just the cli versions, no GUI
if you want to do it, follow <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/installing-from-source.html>

to get the qt wallet (GUI), download it from here <https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v3.0.1-beta3-b6f33fa>


[14-Jun-20 03:13 AM] Mike-H#4395

[27-Jun-20 12:14 AM] Oszy#5734
to claim rewards you can log in to lite mode with Verus Desktop or AtomicDEX(Desktop/Mobile) with your WIF key, and claim rewards. (degug>console>dumpprivkey ADDRESS)

meanwhile you can make a clean install of native mode. delete /blocks & /chainstate from your `.komodo` folder and bootstrap it from https://eu.bootstrap.dexstats.info/KMD-bootstrap.tar.gz

Shutting down for your protection."  I just updated it to 3.0.1 and I get the same error. Would appreciate any information or assistance.


[11-Aug-20 07:21 PM] joe_land1#1088
@ybcninja have you tried deleting all ur data and syncing from scratch? mine synced fine.


[11-Aug-20 07:22 PM] joe_land1#1088
*is syncing fine


[11-Aug-20 07:50 PM] ybcninja#5620
@joe_land1  I didn‚Äôt try that yet. Should I delete the chainstate folder under Users/AppData/Roaming/ Komodo ? Or is it the blocks folder that you deleted?


[11-Aug-20 07:53 PM] joe_land1#1088
@ybcninja I would delete both, less things to go wrong


[11-Aug-20 07:53 PM] ybcninja#5620
@joe_land1 Ok I will give that a try and just do a full resync of the blockchain. Thank you for your help.

Hello, the blockchain synchronization does not advance I am at 0.19% in 14 hours, is it possible to manually download part of the blockchain ?

@BOOMER make sure you have the latest version of the wallet.

If you are already on the latest version, there is a bootstrap at https://www.dexstats.info/bootstrap.php

A long time ago I had lost access to my KMD I think maybe I managed to find my wallet.dat generated by agama as can I access it with my seed?

I tried with komodo ocean but I can't indicate my seed anywhere.


[18-Aug-20 07:58 AM] Oszy#5734
wallet.dat is for native wallet, seed is for lite wallet either this or that


[18-Aug-20 04:10 PM] BOOMER#3399
Ok thank @Oszy 

If I have the original seed from the lite wallet, why did I lose my KMD ?

To make the speech in two words, two years ago I bought komodo to put it in stacking, used lite wallet in agama with the seed I made no mistake, I sent a first transaction to test close the reopened wallet.

I went on vacation and two weeks later, i have opening my wallet and nothing for the bonus a new adress.

I was never able to recover them I tried the coinomi tool to recover the private keys of the seed but whithout succes.

I hadn't exported my private key and since then they are blocked on this addresses.

And today i have searched on my hard drive, I found a .dat file that dates from that time. (I used the lite wallet well, so disappointment it is probably not access to my wallet)

[18-Aug-20 07:00 PM] smkhound#7640
which OS are you using? if the wallet.dat you found is not encrypted (or you know the password), you should try launching in native mode connected to the wallet.dat


[19-Aug-20 12:03 AM] BOOMER#3399
Windows
Dat file is from agama and it is encrypted but i have the password i need to browse them again or Kmd Ocean ask me a password?


[19-Aug-20 03:31 AM] smkhound#7640
ocean would ask for wallet encryption password when you try to transact

@Decker hey mate, how much effort it might be to add the capability to start `KMD` and other Assetchain with provided `-pubkey=` param for the daemon?


[20-Aug-20 02:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
because having it will be a huge help with the setup of Shurli


[20-Aug-20 02:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have tested by including `pubkey=public_key_here` in the `.conf` file assuming it will start the assetchain/KMD with that pubkey, but found it doesn't.

[20-Aug-20 02:40 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
afaik `-pubkey=` needs to be included as a daemon startup option. Never seen it work when placed in the `COIN.conf`


[20-Aug-20 02:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, that's what I came to conclusion in test I did with you @ùôäùôûùô£ùô†


[20-Aug-20 02:42 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
NOt really familiar with Ocean-QT, but I seem to remember you can start with the `-ac_chain=` option in the startup command. (just like starting the daemon itself)

[20-Aug-20 02:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but for `SHURLI0` smartchain I need the DEXP2P params support


[20-Aug-20 02:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for this command


[20-Aug-20 02:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
```
‚ûú  ~ cat /usr/local/bin/shurli0d
komodod -pubkey=03732f8ef851ff234c74d0df575c2c5b159e2bab3faca4ec52b3f217d5cda5361d -ac_name=SHURLI0 -dexp2p=2 -ac_supply=10 -addnode=67.207.76.33 -daemon -handle=satinder -recvZaddr=zs1zqks0tergf6nk69evm6awte4xmhf2fd9epnv946vzlhfxztkls6a9lyfmuafda00krvkvj0xagp -recvTaddr=RBthCSgNLE3rwvAKce8JNSo7xDpxQEiRTX $@
```


[20-Aug-20 02:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if DEXP2P is not supported by QT UI, I'll just have to work a bit on making the setup process of `SHURLI0`


[20-Aug-20 02:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will do that


[20-Aug-20 03:00 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
In that case I would use this startup (in a script, obviously):
```
\path-to Ocean-QT\Ocean-QT-binary -pubkey=03732f8ef851ff234c74d0df575c2c5b159e2bab3faca4ec52b3f217d5cda5361d -ac_name=SHURLI0 -dexp2p=2 -ac_supply=10 -addnode=67.207.76.33 -daemon -handle=satinder -recvZaddr=zs1zqks0tergf6nk69evm6awte4xmhf2fd9epnv946vzlhfxztkls6a9lyfmuafda00krvkvj0xagp -recvTaddr=RBthCSgNLE3rwvAKce8JNSo7xDpxQEiRTX $@
```
and just see if it works or not...


[20-Aug-20 03:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I understand, it will work


[20-Aug-20 03:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but the reason I assume it won't work is because the DEXP2P specific code is not even merged in Komodo beta/dev branch from jl777


[20-Aug-20 03:02 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Then I guess your assumption is a viable concern indeed


[20-Aug-20 03:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and I think it  might not be merged with QT code too


[20-Aug-20 03:59 AM] SHossain#0007
i use a start script that contains the pubkey with QT wallet like `komodod` supports.


[20-Aug-20 03:59 AM] SHossain#0007
it works exactly same as native komodo daemon


[20-Aug-20 04:07 AM] ca333#0333
yes - OceanQT natively supports ACs - will post you code sections you have to adapt for "automagic" AC start (for comfortable enduser distribution) after breakfast @grewalsatinder


[20-Aug-20 04:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks @ca333 üôÇ


[20-Aug-20 04:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I figured just using the chain params in the command like we use in `komodod` starts the assetchain.
what will help is if the icon for that assetchain could be defined along the command line param so that user does not confuse seeing multiple KMD icon wallets showing in TaskBar and startup screen of Ocean QT if started the wallet with assetchain params

I have downloaded the Komodo Ocean qt wallet for storage of my THC(HempCoin). I started to sync my wallet, but after a few hours, it had not gone up any percentage at all. I deleted the files in order to reindex. After trying to sync again, I waited another 5 hours for the same exact thing to happen. I installed the bootstrap before trying to reindex for a second time. The same issue had popped up again, not syncing even .01%. I have no idea what the issue could be. Would someone be able to try and assist me please? It would be greatly appreciated. I am using the Windows 10 OS @everyone

When I ran the start_thc file, a message popped up saying

is this issue resolved?

does the file name start with a capital "K" ? or a small "k" ? @djk00lata

Capital


[24-Sep-20 06:35 AM] gcharang#6833
did you change the file name or did it start with a capital K since you downloaded it?


[24-Sep-20 06:37 AM] gcharang#6833
you can delete the zip file "THC_KMDocean" and the extracted folder then download from the website again
backup your wallet.dat file and delete the remaining files/folders in `%appdata%/Komodo/THC` then run the `START_THC.bat` file


[24-Sep-20 06:38 AM] djk00lata#1215
The file name when I downloaded it was not changed at all. It had started with the capital K since downloading


[24-Sep-20 06:39 AM] djk00lata#1215
So I should close out of the wallet and redownload the KMDocean file again is what you are saying?


[24-Sep-20 06:43 AM] gcharang#6833
>  So I should close out of the wallet and redownload the KMDocean file again is what you are saying?
yes
- stop the wallet.
- backup your wallet.dat file and delete the rest of the files in the folder `%appdata%\Komodo\THC`
- delete both the zip file and the extracted folder named `THC_KMDocean`
- download the zip file from the website https://hempcoin.org/wallets-thc.html
- extract the zip file and run `START_THC.bat` from the extracted folder

I am trying to import my private key into my Ocean wallet. The priv key is for HempCoin. When I do the debug console window, I type in importprivkey, and my priv key. When I go to enter the command, a message pops up that says
Invalid private key encoding (code -5) 
What does this mean and how do I resolve this issue?


[03-Nov-20 07:08 AM] lightspeed393#5403
It means the private key is incorrect format. Make sure you copied it exactly and that it's not too long/too short, ie. missing a character at the end or something along these lines.


[03-Nov-20 07:25 AM] djk00lata#1215
Alright thank you. I will triple check to make sure.


[03-Nov-20 07:32 AM] djk00lata#1215
I triple checked to make sure I didn't make a mistake on the priv key. I copied the priv key exact, and I still get that message. How should I go about fixing this


[03-Nov-20 07:34 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I don't know much about HempCoin, but I'm pretty they migrated from an old chain to a smartchain. Are you trying to import a priv key for a new HempCoin address (starts with R) or for an old hempcoin address?


[03-Nov-20 07:36 AM] djk00lata#1215
An old one that starts with Y


[03-Nov-20 07:37 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I would say that's probably the issue but I have no idea how the Hempcoin old chain -> new chain migration is suppose to happen.


[03-Nov-20 07:38 AM] djk00lata#1215
Is there a way that I can update the priv key I already have? If not, how am I supposed to get my priv key to install


[03-Nov-20 07:38 AM] lightspeed393#5403
Not sure, check with HempCoin team about it.


[03-Nov-20 07:39 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I'm only assuming the wallet doesn't like your priv key because it doesn't match KMD address type.


[03-Nov-20 07:44 AM] lightspeed393#5403

[03-Nov-20 07:47 AM] lightspeed393#5403
The 212 allows for a privkey from the old chain


[03-Nov-20 07:50 AM] djk00lata#1215
I didn't do that part with the true. I appreciate your help. Now when I am going to back up the wallet, where should I save the backup data to? Which directory should I save it to


[03-Nov-20 07:53 AM] lightspeed393#5403
Wherever you want to keep it. A backup should be somewhere safe so probably not on the same hdd that your wallet is on incase of failure.


[03-Nov-20 08:01 AM] djk00lata#1215
I did those steps and a different key was made 
It starts with the letter R
My coin balance is still 0. 
What do I do with that new key


[03-Nov-20 08:03 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
A private key for a public address in the komodo ecosystem typically starts with a `U`, so it looks like you're trying to use your public address as a key.


[03-Nov-20 08:04 AM] djk00lata#1215
How do I get my balance to show up? Under recent transactions, it shows my coins, but my available balance is still 0


[03-Nov-20 08:05 AM] djk00lata#1215
Do I need to grab a priv key from the CLI based wallet, or from the old qt desktop wallet


[03-Nov-20 08:07 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
it should not make a difference: afaik all wallets use the same chain and wallet location for an asset-chain. But if your transactions show up, it would indicate you used the right key at some point.
Let me read back a bit what the entire story is. I just reacted to your message that your key started with a `R`.


[03-Nov-20 08:54 AM] lightspeed393#5403
@djk00lata 1st. are you in sync? 2. are you using the THC komodoocean wallet or just regular KMD? Not sure why they didn't rename that to avoid confusion.


[03-Nov-20 09:15 AM] djk00lata#1215
Ocean wallet and yes I am in sync. At the end of the letters and numbers, it says "dirty". Does that mean I am on the right wallet chain?


[03-Nov-20 09:15 AM] lightspeed393#5403
Does it say THC at the top before KomodoOcean?


[03-Nov-20 09:26 AM] djk00lata#1215
No it does not


[03-Nov-20 09:27 AM] lightspeed393#5403
then you're not on THC chain, that's KMD's wallet.


[03-Nov-20 09:27 AM] djk00lata#1215
How am I supposed to transfer it to the THC chain instead of it being on the KMD wallet?


[03-Nov-20 09:28 AM] lightspeed393#5403
use the THC komodoocean wallet


[03-Nov-20 09:28 AM] lightspeed393#5403
downloadable on the hempcoin site


[03-Nov-20 09:28 AM] djk00lata#1215
I downloaded it straight from the HempCoin website


[03-Nov-20 09:29 AM] djk00lata#1215
The file name is 
THC_KMDOcean


[03-Nov-20 09:32 AM] djk00lata#1215
I downloaded directly from HempCoin website


[03-Nov-20 09:35 AM] lightspeed393#5403
Not sure how to help you then. The THC_KMDOcean wallet displays [THC] KomodoOcean at the top when I launch it. Maybe try THC's discord for support instead: https://discord.gg/cgEQ5wh


[03-Nov-20 09:35 AM] djk00lata#1215
Can you screenshot and send? Just so I know where to look


[03-Nov-20 09:36 AM] lightspeed393#5403
The top of the window. The same bar with the minmize, maximize, close buttons


[03-Nov-20 09:36 AM] djk00lata#1215
Ok


[03-Nov-20 09:38 AM] djk00lata#1215
I double checked again. It does say THC.


[03-Nov-20 09:53 AM] djk00lata#1215
What should I look at now? Because when I imported my priv key, it rescanned for about 10 minutes. After rescanning, the balance remained 0, but it showed a couple transaction histories

when you create the wallet, just do "import seed" instead of creating new wallet.

[10-Nov-20 07:56 AM] Oszy#5734
ah okay, to claim you need atomicdex, in verus you can't claim i think.

@ùôäùôûùô£ùô† correct me if i am wrong (claiming kmd in mobile verus wallet? )


[10-Nov-20 08:00 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Claiming in mobile should be no issue, at least not to my knowledge. There's no specific claim button, but sending your entire balance to your own address is what any claim button would do.


[10-Nov-20 08:50 AM] Oszy#5734
Ok thought so just wasn‚Äôt 100% sure on it

Good evening, I am using Mac OS Catalina with Komodo qt wallet (latest version), when I try and run the wallet it says ‚ÄúError: Cannot parse configuration file: Missing Komodo.conf. Only use key=value syntax. What does this mean please as I would like to restor my KMD dat file, thanks


[17-Nov-20 05:51 PM] gcharang#6833
In the location: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Komodo/`
create a file named `komodo.conf` and fill it with the following contents:
```
rpcuser=nickname
rpcpassword=password
txindex=1
bind=127.0.0.1
rpcbind=127.0.0.1
addnode=5.9.102.210
addnode=78.47.196.146

addnode=88.198.65.74
addnode=5.9.122.241
addnode=144.76.94.38

replace `nickname` and `password` with any random strings. you don't need to memorize them

hi fellas, i can sincronice my ocean wallet only till june 2020, i¬¥d like to export the private key to use it in an updated wallet. I can¬¥t export the private key in the debug window because i have to unlock the wallet first, but i don¬¥t know how to unlock it, could you help me please?


[21-Nov-20 07:26 PM] gcharang#6833
@Porta you must have encrypted your wallet with a password. without the password, there is no way to export private keys

Also, to use the updated wallet, you don't need to export private keys. Simply run the new wallet and either it will start syncing to the current block or it won't. if it doesn't, shutdown the wallet, backup the wallet.dat file and bootstrap the data directory. Instructions here: https://community.komodoplatform.com/post/5e285723d79932740a493879

your wallet.dat file contains the privatekeys btw

I know with THC you need to use a .bat file to have the ocean-qt wallet open up THC so I would think that might be the same with those other assists

New to Ocean, are my KMD tokens automatically 'staked'? I see some minor 'rewards' and just not sure what to do with them.  The Komodo instructions say send to yourself using 'available balance' button, but that pulls in my coin holdings as well.  Thanks in advance


[19-Dec-20 07:50 AM] gcharang#6833
you have to send all your balance once everymonth using a comapatible wallet. for example, the kmd ocean wallet. that is how you claim your rewards

@gcharang sent DM still having issues with Ocean


[21-Dec-20 10:05 AM] The Digital Link#1826
Can anyone point me in the right direction? Quick summary of what happened in my case. Dedicated computer for storing Komodo and Ocean QT failed, so fixed comp with new hard drive and downloaded newest version of QT. From there I restored using my "Wallet.bat" backup file, and then from there download the bootstraps file provided from the link GCarang provided. Now when opening the program it goes through it's normal opening process, but freezes and will not proceed past "Activating Best Chain." again this is on the loading menu screen when first opening Ocean QT. My own troubleshooting so far was to delete and wipe the wallet completely from hard drive and re-install and do the entire process over again only to have the same result happen. 

Am I doing something wrong? My wallet.bat backup file was from about 3 days prior to my computer failing. 

Any advice to what I am possibly doing wrong would be certainly appreciated.

Hey folks!  We're having a bit of an issue with our custom build of KomodoOcean.. Everything seems to be working fine, but it's taking FOREVER to sync with our smartchain.  Chain is 384,436 blocks and < 2.5GB.  Client has been running since yesterday, has synced < 80,000 blocks, and consumed approximately 150GB of data.  Whereas I just booted up a fresh node and it's almost fully synced after just a couple of hours.


[23-Dec-20 10:01 AM] mediast#1110
We haven't seen this sort of behavior before..


[23-Dec-20 10:05 AM] mediast#1110
Synced headers at 87%


[23-Dec-20 10:09 AM] mediast#1110
Showing massive ping times (> 10000) for every node, yet the Linux version is 55-115ms.


[23-Dec-20 10:09 AM] mediast#1110
Same network


[23-Dec-20 10:11 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
sync speed is mostly related to the up speed of your connected peers


[23-Dec-20 10:18 AM] mediast#1110
That doesn't explain it.  Only affects Windows client.  Same nodes.


[23-Dec-20 10:19 AM] mediast#1110
And 150GB of data transfer?

I know you know more about this software than I do, but does it make sense to you that KomodoOcean would behave this way, but not the Komodo software, when connecting to the same nodes?


[23-Dec-20 11:13 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
that would suggest to me that your speed is being throttled by your sharing with other nodes


[23-Dec-20 11:21 AM] mediast#1110
Because the qt client is allowing connections?  Even though only our public nodes show on the list of connections?


[23-Dec-20 11:22 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
I would try the cli commant `getpeerinfo`. It shows you (among other things) the pingtime to each peer you are connected to.
You can disconnect the nodes with high latency


[23-Dec-20 11:22 AM] mediast#1110
That's 150GB of inbound data transfer to the qt client


[23-Dec-20 11:22 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's a full node, you'll have to look in debug log to see when clients connect/disconnect automatically

No.  Same public nodes though.  Latency is fine.


[23-Dec-20 11:25 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
then it's likely local network related

the qt wallet **is** a full node, it literally shares the same codebase as the daemon

Alternatively you can use the `connect=IP:PORT` in the `ACTN.conf` and use a known trusted peer for that. That way it will only pull in data from that node (disable any addnodes in your `ACTN.conf` if they are present)

change `addnode` to `connect` and the IP to a known fast node

if no change, then networking issues locally

IP is Google cloud.  It's known to be fast.

then connect to only it and see if there's an improvement, if not it's almost certainly a local networking issue

firewall, blocked/forwarded ports, etc

[23-Dec-20 11:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
"on the same network" could be that upnp is sending data to that PC and not the one you want now
that's why I gave specific advice to narrow down the cause


[23-Dec-20 11:35 AM] mediast#1110
Hmmm.. okay, that makes some sense, except that machine was shutdown overnight.  Doesn't explain what appears to be the same issue overseas.

I can think of 130 reasons why a node will sync slow; some may effect one person and an entirely different issue or set of issues for another

I've decided to switch from Ocean to AtomicDex, as my ISP says I'm over my data limit. Evidently using a full node is not the thing to do on metered link.  I've installed Atomic, and sent all my KMD from Ocean to new wallet. I can't find an 'uninstall' option in Ocean, how do I delete all the files I no longer need? What directories are they in?  All I found in programfiles was the executable.  Thanks much

Man just lost for words right now as I got hacked and my coins stolen, just want to list out the scenario on what I did, so maybe someone can enlighten me to where I went wrong in my processes or my method of storing coins.

I used Ocean QT to store my KMD coins, but once the initial transfer was made about a year ago I immeaditely took that desktop that had the wallet installed on it offline. No internet connection to it whatsoever let along even a ethernet cord plugged into it. From there I backed up my wallet.dat file and stored that on a USB drive along with passphrase. I would only bring the computer online from time to time for windows updates and etc. On December 15th my motherboard failed and I rebult the computer. I had some issues installing the QT Wallet as I'm sure some of you have seen my posts on here over the past month about trubleshooting. Nevertheless I got QT installed again,  and retstored using my backup dat file. Then downloaded bootstraps to get caught up. In doing this I found out that someone somehow gained access to my wallet and sent my entire KMD stash to two seperate addresses on 12/9/2020. 

What does not make sense to me is I thought I was doing everything right to protect my assests kept the computer offline, did all my backups, transfers, passphrases with the computer 100% offline from any network. The backup file was in cold storage. While I know my wallet which held my funds was still online on the QT network or however that works I just have zero idea how someone could have gained access to my funds???? My passphrase was shared with no one not even my wife and the usb drive was stored in a safe in my home. 

Based on the details I listed above can anyone offer me insight to where I went wrong and how in the hell they gained access to my KMD?

The QT wallet doesn't use passphrases

did you use some other wallet at some point?


[07-Jan-21 10:34 AM] The Digital Link#1826
@ComputerGenie thank you for the reply, I am just using the wording shown in the wallet itself under "Settings > Change Passphrase" 

I did use the old was it called Antara or something like that. Whenever the community identified a security issue with that wallet I briefly switched, but this was all over a year ago now.


[07-Jan-21 10:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
If you used the same address after Agama was compromised as before, it's possible that it was compromised back then
as far as that settings bit, that's for encrypting your wallet.dat file and isn't the same passphrase or even the same type of thing


[07-Jan-21 10:38 AM] The Digital Link#1826
Sorry my lack using the correct terminolygy is bad when it comes to wallets. I know for a fact though that my address was not the same address as the Agama wallet.

So I'm trying to recover a wallet made with Agama. I can see the address has my single transaction from whatever I did during the vuln making a fresh address... 

But I can't get the mnemonic to resolve to my address in AtomicDEX no matter if I use trailing space, no space, all caps, no caps... It's always a different address and key... 

I did YOLO into my old agama installation and test the mnemonic (yes I realize the implications) and it resolved, and the funds weren't immediately swept, so now I'm trying Ocean and if the mnemonic doesn't work then I do have the private key. 

Is this a common issue? Trying to restore an Agama wallet that is

Can anyone help me?

In 2018 I was using the Agama wallet, I created a new wallet seed/WIF.

KMD was sent to the new wallet in Lite (SPV) mode, I was claiming staking rewards but I had used Native Mode at one point and a new address had generated, so the KMD was sent to the newly generated address.

Stupidly I had formatted my hard drive and I can no longer access the wallet.dat file, All I have is the WIF key.

I tried importing the WIF key into the Komodo Ocean Wallet but the account doesn't show the newly generated address with the funds.

wif's corrrespond to addresses so it may be that the wif you saved was to a change address or perhaps it's just a typo.

[20-Feb-21 04:43 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
what I mean is that, for example, the link above uses:

`convertpassphrase "<seedphrase>"`
instead

If you're a newb you may have better luck getting hands on support with verus wallet. all I'm saying. It's hard for me to say if you're boned or not. If you're seeing a balance you may just need to try dumping privkeys and reimporting any that may be there. Genie knows way more than I do about it in any case

I'm sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but the funds are in a change-address, that was indeed generated in the old, deleted (formatted drive) `wallet.dat`. Unless you  have a backup of that  `wallet.dat` or an walletdump textfile somewhere, those funds are regrettably inaccessible.

Hi, at this moment I received 643 GB of traffic. 10 hour period.

current block 812000

maybe the statistics on debug window > network traffic, are not correct? I checked the router, and it shows 29.64 GB for the past 8 hours. 96% of the traffic is tcp port 7770

@michelvankessel you can launch wallet with `-fixibd` to reduce overhead during initial block downloading, when syncing KMD chain from scratch. Or as an alternative - you can use bootstrap - https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php .

Hello, I am using the Komodo Ocean wallet. Do you know how to add jumblr to this wallet?


[26-Mar-21 04:07 AM] t_dan#3334
Komodo Ocean is not a multi chain wallet, but you could either run the komodod daemon with the JUMBLR chain parameter as a full node CLI wallet, or use AtomicDEX Desktop and add Jumblr in Light mode.


[26-Mar-21 04:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
For win, just create a shortcut, edit the shortcut, and add ` -ac_name=JUMBLR -ac_supply=999999`

KomodoOcean is multi chain wallet. You can use it with any existing assetchains.

you can update to the latest version so the chain will sync. Then if you have any transparent funds you can access them. I'm not sure about the coins in z-address, I guess they are lost now.


[15-Apr-21 10:57 PM] gcharang#6833

and you did download the ocean qt wallet from here: https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v3.0.1-beta5 ?

@Decker any idea why this error can happen?


[20-Apr-21 03:36 AM] Decker#3767
Looks like wrong / corrupted wallet.dat file, probably not from Komodo. Export all keys from this wallet.dat with any method (using walletutility for example, or on other machine from which it was copied), start the Komodo-Qt without wallet.dat to allow it create new one and import all your privkeys then. Also, you can use import/export wallet RPCs for same purposes. But main idea is to import all privkeys instead of just copying wallet.dat.

[25-Apr-21 09:15 AM] lightspeed393#5403
if you go to that bootstrap link, there are 2. One says PIRATE and it's before the december 2020 update. I would try that


[25-Apr-21 09:24 AM] 24052019#7280
@lightspeed393 okay, got any reccomendations for nodes to connect to (to paste into my .conf file)


[25-Apr-21 09:48 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
delete the data files (except wallet.dat and PIRATE.conf) and let TreasureChest bootstrap itself with the correct bootstrap


[25-Apr-21 09:49 AM] 24052019#7280

[25-Apr-21 09:49 AM] 24052019#7280
the treasure chest wallet loads fine, but my .dat file that works with the 2019 ocean qt wallet wont load into it. it gets stuck


[25-Apr-21 09:50 AM] 24052019#7280
i can load other .dat files, something is wrong with the specific .dat file i want to load


[25-Apr-21 09:50 AM] 24052019#7280
which is the back up i got from the ocean qt wallet back in 2019


[25-Apr-21 09:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> the 2019 ocean qt wallet wont load into it. it gets stuck
because there have been 2 hardforks since then
you need to update the GUI (no matter what GUI you use)


[25-Apr-21 09:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the 2019 ocean qt wallet will never accept current notarizations


[25-Apr-21 09:52 AM] 24052019#7280
right. Well one .dat file from 010619 loads fine into the wallet. but the newer 050619 wont load into it


[25-Apr-21 09:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> but the newer 050619 wont load into it
because you're looking at one thing and thinking it's another
the image you posted is because TC looks at the chain files differently than KO does and you need the bootstrap that goes with that
or........
if you choose to stay with KO then you must update KO to the latest KO


[25-Apr-21 09:54 AM] 24052019#7280
im not sure if i understand. Sorry i was talking about the treasure chest wallet

the newer one that wont load into treasure chest, im trying to load into ocean qt 2019 wallet


[25-Apr-21 09:55 AM] 24052019#7280
under the pirate deamon


[25-Apr-21 09:55 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, the image you posted from that is related to the chain files, not the wallet.dat file


[25-Apr-21 09:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> im trying to load into ocean qt 2019 wallet
ocean qt 2019 wallet will not sync for any chain
if you want to use the ocean wallet you must update to the newest ocean wallet


[25-Apr-21 09:56 AM] 24052019#7280
but thats treasure chest?


[25-Apr-21 09:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
no


[25-Apr-21 09:57 AM] 24052019#7280
ah, thats the fork ocean wallet?


[25-Apr-21 09:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
"prate ocean" was a fork of "komodo ocean"
"pirate ocean" is now "treasure chest" because of it's move towards only the z bits
if you want to use "pirate ocean" then you must update to "treasure chest"
if you were using "komodo ocean" in 2019 then you need to update to the current "komodo ocean" which is at: <https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/latest>


[25-Apr-21 10:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
either way, you cannot still use the old app


[25-Apr-21 10:01 AM] 24052019#7280
can i load the new komodo ocean under pirate deamon to load in my Pirate wallet?


[25-Apr-21 10:02 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
also, you cannot run a daemon and either GUI on the same PC at the same time (the GUIs have the daemon code internally)


[25-Apr-21 10:03 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
but, yes, komodo ocean (when updated) will work for the pirate chain


[25-Apr-21 10:05 AM] 24052019#7280
right so if i load the new kmd ocean wallet with my pirate dat file, that should show my pirate wallet?


[25-Apr-21 10:07 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
should be in the readme on the git


[25-Apr-21 10:08 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes
however, you may need to use the bootstrap again if the block files got mixed up while you were trying both earlier


[25-Apr-21 10:17 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes, the bits below it


[25-Apr-21 10:18 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

OK,
close the app completely
go to
`~/Library/Application\ Support/Komodo/PIRATE`
copy `wallet.dat` (the one you copied there from before) to someplace safe
delete everything else except `PIRATE.conf`
run the app (with the params for pirate [-ac_name=PIRATE, etc])
it will download what it needs from other people


[27-Apr-21 10:30 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

can you confirm that you did something like this:
1) placed your wallet.dat file in `%APPDATA%/Komodo`
2) opened agama wallet and it started withot trouble and shoes no errors
3) didn't change the wallet.dat file present in `%APPDATA%/Komodo`
4) stopped agama and then started komodo-ocean-qt wallet and it crashed ?

do you see any other text in there other than the address you want? any text in english or a long string that starts with `U` ?

it show name and address

[11-May-21 07:11 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
Hi there!
I wonder what's the difference between a send button and z-send?


[11-May-21 07:12 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
send  -> transparent?
z-send -> private?


[11-May-21 07:18 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's a different transaction creation function internally
but most users (especially with KMD or any t-to-t) will not visually notice any difference when sending to 1 address


[11-May-21 07:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
on an unseen level, z transactions have a different data structure
but z-send is able to also do t send


[11-May-21 07:21 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
@ComputerGenie What should I use then? I'd like to make some transactions like follows:
1. t-to-t
2. t-to-z
3. z-to-z
4. z-to-t
5. t-to-t


[11-May-21 07:22 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
Also, I want to be sure that z-to-z is 100% untraceable. Is it?


[11-May-21 07:22 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
for ease of use, I'd use the z tab for all the above (just to avoid tabbing back and forth)


[11-May-21 07:22 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes


[11-May-21 07:23 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
note: KMD chain no longer has z txes


[11-May-21 07:23 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
That's great! I should use z tab then!
Thank you üôÇ 
What do you mean by z txes?


[11-May-21 07:24 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> What do you mean by z txes?
I mean that on the KMD chain private transactions (to or from z) are disabled because the anonymity on PIRATE is much stronger than the optional use of it was on KMD


[11-May-21 07:26 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
It seems like a bad news to me. I'm not quite following. üò¶


[11-May-21 07:27 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
OK, are you trying to use this for KMD?


[11-May-21 07:27 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
or some other chain?


[11-May-21 07:27 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
KMD to KMD Yes.


[11-May-21 07:29 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> 2. t-to-z
> 3. z-to-z
> 4. z-to-t
all of these are disabled on KMD (they do work on some other chains)
they were disabled because on the PIRATE chain everything is z-to-z and that is best privacy


[11-May-21 07:29 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
Cryptocurrency exchange -> Komodo Ocean -> private address -> back to the same exchange


[11-May-21 07:29 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
KMD no longer has private addresses

Oh! I get it now

{Reactions}
üëçüèΩ 

[11-May-21 07:30 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
What should I use then?


[11-May-21 07:30 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
I wanna transfer KMD securely and privately.


[11-May-21 07:31 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
From one exchange to another.


[11-May-21 07:32 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
from one exchange to another, I wouldn't bother (especially if one of them is binance) because they generally use a pooled address and everything gets mixed


[11-May-21 07:36 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
The transaction leaves the withdrawal history trail if I make it from there to another. So I wanted to make transaction private between exchanges.


[11-May-21 07:38 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
For example,
Binance to Binance (transaction history remains)
Binance -> KMD private address -> Binance (Maybe?)


[11-May-21 07:38 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
that's just kinda the nature of transparent chains and exchanges


[11-May-21 07:39 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
or just transparent chains themselves, for that matter


[11-May-21 07:39 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
z-send won't help here?


[11-May-21 07:40 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
not for KMD, no


[11-May-21 07:40 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
Which one should I use then? Any ideas?


[11-May-21 07:40 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
You've told me that z-to-z is 100% untraceable. I thought that should do.


[11-May-21 07:42 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
So this isn't true?

[11-May-21 07:42 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
my suggestion would be to use PIRATE
it's fully z-z and secure
that doesn't help with how you want to do exactly what you want to do, but it's the only fully private chain


[11-May-21 07:43 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
KMD is one chain
that is platform documentation that covers the core functions for many chains


[11-May-21 07:43 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
PIRATE? You mena ARRR?


[11-May-21 07:44 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

on the KMD chain, yes


[11-May-21 07:50 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
Oh! the platform you mean KomodoOcean is the platform?


[11-May-21 07:50 AM] lavieenbluu#4985
So KomodoOcean do support z-to-z transaction by using z-send tab, but the KMD chain doesn't. Right?


[11-May-21 07:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
no, KomodoOcean is just an interface


[11-May-21 07:52 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
correct, it works "as expected" on any chain that allows z transactions

I have a question about QTOcean Wallet ver: v3.0.1-beta3...How do I check my 24 word passkey?  I have it written down but I want to make sure it matches what the wallet used for my private keys.  I surfed through all the menu options in the wallet but I havent found how to display it.  Is it a CLI command or in the menus somewhere?


[14-May-21 05:28 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
there isn't a way
the only "passkey" that the wallet has is for locking down the ability to spend and you wouldn't want that to be displayed as displaying it somewhere would defeat the point of having it


[14-May-21 05:54 PM] lightspeed393#5403
you can use `convertpassphrase` and it will display the address and private key associated with your seed

Yes, you need to manually send it to yourself. You can do it with a few clicks. I think it's not too hard.

Btw, for all who probably had issues during downloading ZCashParams via `fetch-params` script (.sh on Linux and MacOS and .bat, .cmd on Windows) - try to change `https://z.cash/downloads` URL in script on `https://komodoplatform.com/downloads` .

So I wasnt paying attention and I missed installing the mandatory wallet update  before June 14th...my bad I apologize.  I did install it about an hour ago after seeing that the previous wallet lost its connection yesterday.  So my issue is that the v0.7.0-beta is also not connecting now.  I seem to recall using command line in the past to resolve similar issues.  Will that process work for me now?  If so I need  refresher on what to do so I can get reconnected....

Silly me some patience was all that was needed...I think...its been stuck at 34 hours behind for over an hour now.  But my wallet balance finally appeared.  So  ima gonna wait more and see what happens

Hi everyone, like Sputboy999, I'm also having connection issues after updating the wallet. Will attach a screenshot. Using Ubuntu.


[19-Jun-21 01:04 AM] David Jackson#9229
OK; can't figure out how to put the screenshot in here, so this is what it says:

Number of Blocks Left:4753
last Block Time: Thurs Jun 17 17:41:08 2021
Progress: 99.81%
Progress Increase per Hour: calculating...
Estimated time left until synced: calculating...

Connecting to peers... (2 days behind)

Is KomodoOcean version v0.07.0-beta1 (64-bit)

Thanks in advance for help; sorry to not be smart enough to figure it out myself ü§ì

If you are stuck on a block and not able to sync to latest, make sure to use the latest wallet version and then if it doesn't work, you can either start the wallet with reindex or use a bootstrap

hi, i tried opening my ocean wallet for the first time in about a month and i get the following msg: "a block chain re-organization has been detected that would roll back 434 blocks! this is longer than the maximum 99 blocks, and so the node is shutting down for your safety... de-organization details: (lists a whole bunch of stuff)... Please help, human!" .... what do i do? i updated to the most recent wallet, and still getting the same msg, and cant open wallet

Hi guys, bit of a weird one here: Basically i have a Pirate wallet in an old Ocean qt wallet. I have everything working with the wallet back in april (100%synced) and then tested it( i sent 2 ARRR to an exchange, it worked). I've come back to the wallet and its at 92% synced as it needs to catch up. However i left it an hour to sync and when i came back, i still had no peers online. 

Is there away to add peers/speed up the sync or do i need to literally wait until it happens?


[24-Jun-21 04:19 PM] 24052019#7280
FYI the .dat file does not work in the new PIRATE wallets; im in the middle of switching them over to a newer fresh wallet, hense trying to get this working again.


[24-Jun-21 04:45 PM] 24052019#7280
Right so tried it again, im now back to 0% for some reason. Any help witht he old wallet would be appriciated. Also dont tell me to get a new one or download a PIRATE wallet, it doesnt work.

just scrolled up and read what we talked about. im going to sync it from 2009 for about 5 days straight since i have limited peers online


[25-Jun-21 11:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
a wallet that synced in April that hasn't been updated will not sync in June (this year)
we have a yearly update that is required in order to read notarizations of the current batch of NNs

I've gone from 0 peers to 1 peer and back to 0, but i mean its better than the 0 peers i've had for a couple days. (bootstaps havnt been working for me either)

Regarding the update to the latest wallet, my ARRR .dat file is corrupted when put into the new ARRR wallet (tried them all extensively) . The old Ocean QT wallet is the only one that has worked so far (APRIL), and my last hope really. I appeiciate the help yourself and computergenie have given. I'll give an update once the wallet has had some time to sync. 
Thanks


[30-Jul-21 11:40 AM] Decker#3767
1. Launch the Qt wallet.
2. Make sure that you used correct params `-ac_name=PIRATE -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777 -ac_private=1` and wallet shows `[PIRATE]` in the window header, also check the version (it should be `v0.7.0-beta1`).
3. Enter Help -> Debug Mode -> Console menu (or just press Ctrl+Shift+C).  RPC console should open.
4. Add peers by typing:
```
addnode <peer_ip> onetry
```

thanks. im using the original i was first given when storing my ARRR :

User agent: /MagicBean:2.0.15-rc2/
using Berkeley DBVersion: Berkeley DB 6.2.23: (March 28, 2016)


Im reluctant to change, as i know my funds are accessible through it.( accessed them in april.)
Regarding the peers, i keep getting 'null' back after each entry?

That version isn't going to work as there has been a hard fork since then, you'll never be able to spend with it.

If I were you I'd export my private key using the version that works and then import them into a new TC wallet.


[01-Aug-21 11:25 AM] Forge#7731
If TC is corrupting (or reporting a corruption) then there is probably an issue already in the wallet.


[03-Aug-21 04:15 PM] 24052019#7280
But when it synced in April I sent ARRR from the wallet to ensure it worked, I received it on the other end


[03-Aug-21 04:18 PM] 24052019#7280
TC is not an option, it corrupts my   . Dat file. All I need are peers that work.


[07-Aug-21 08:32 AM] 24052019#7280
Any ideas of peers that work and not return with null?


[07-Aug-21 08:43 AM] Decker#3767
All you need (ideas, suggetions, advices) is above. You'll need to:

1. Make sure that you have latest (`v0.7.0-beta1`!) Komodo-Qt installed, don't use old versions, they will not work / will not sync correctly anyway.
2. Download and unpack bootstrap - https://eu.bootstrap.dexstats.info/PIRATE-bootstrap.tar.gz .
3. Start Komodo-Qt.
4. Add peers as described above `addnode <peer-ip> onetry` if needed (note, that you shouldn't enter `<` or `>` symbols), for example for adding IP `8.8.8.8`, you'll need to enter the following `addnode 8.8.8.8 onetry`
5. Return `null` after `addnode` command - is normal behavior, so don't worry.
6. After your wallet will be full synced - stop it, place your `wallet.dat` in the right place and start your wallet again.

null is the result of any command
there is no "reply" with a command
"null" is a placeholder of sorts, to let you know it was executed


[07-Aug-21 08:44 AM] Decker#3767
I don't have any idea why you ignoring advices ... many people said you "DON'T USE OLD / OUTDATED VERSIONS", but you anyway trying to use v2.0.15-rc2-6d31f03-dirty. I don't understand why.


[10-Aug-21 02:26 PM] 24052019#7280
I'm not ignoring advice, I'm saying I've only ever accessed my arrr wallet with the one I have at the minute, it worked in April.
If a newer kmd qt wallet will allow me to load my pirate wallet then I'll try it. Just no one has confirmed it.  I also don't know too much about loading things if it goes wrong, whereas I have notes helping me for the older dirty wallet


[10-Aug-21 08:05 PM] gcharang#6833
copy and paste your good wallet.dat file in a safe place and don't delete/modify it. Now you can experiment as many times as you want and don't need to fear wallet.dat getting corrupted. 

now, if you can't make your old wallet.dat work with any of the newer wallets, you can export privkeys using the old wallet.data nd old wallet and import them in a freshly created wallet and wallet.dat pair

I think this issue maybe because the treasure chest wallet and ocean-qt wallets became incompatible at some point


[12-Aug-21 03:46 PM] Forge#7731
@gcharang it's not that they become incompatible going from Ocean -> TC, it's that Treasure Chest has a lot of extra stuff added to optimize usage of z transactions, this will cause the wallet to zap all the transactions, and reindex. Going from TC -> Ocean will probably cause problems....

I have tried downloading that file 5 times and it always fails after certain amount of time. I have a 10Mb download connection and throttling at 800kb for 17GB üò¶ The only solution that worked for me is add a node that is up to date. It seems the kmd qt wallet config doesn't have any working node ips.


[15-Aug-21 04:01 PM] oDinZu#1137
Would it be possible to add qt bootstrap file to IPFS? Then many are able to share, rather than be specific to one eu server


[15-Aug-21 04:03 PM] oDinZu#1137
these ips don't work; resulting in unable to connect to peers. These are default QT nodes on fresh install of komodo qt wallet. 
addnode=5.9.102.210
addnode=78.47.196.146
addnode=178.63.69.164
addnode=88.198.65.74

addnode=89.248.166.91


[15-Aug-21 06:51 PM] Decker#3767
To get the fresh KMD seeds list you can always do:
```
nslookup kmd.komodoseeds.org
```
or
```
nslookup kmdseeds.lordofthechains.com
```


[15-Aug-21 06:52 PM] Decker#3767
In next version of Komodo-Qt these DNS seeders will be used by default. For now, you can obtain list of live nodes manually and just insert some of them into `komodo.conf` via `addnode=...`.


[19-Aug-21 06:42 AM] Exile13#4458
Do we access this info by inputing this command into the console? Does the chain (kmd) need to be referenced? There's a user from TG with this question. They are having problems finding the seed ips.


[19-Aug-21 08:02 AM] gcharang#6833
run
```
nslookup kmd.komodoseeds.org
```
in a terminal.
take one of the ips from output and run for example
```
addnode 49.12.127.114 onetry
```
in the console

[21-Aug-21 11:40 AM] Decker#3767
@24052019 Did you use bootstrap for PIRATE chain or just continued from "old state", remained from your old wallet? If you continued from "old state", i'll recommend you to delete everything from your `Komodo\PIRATE` folder, except your `wallet.dat` file and restart the wallet. The issue could be in that your old wallet went on fork (bcz it was old) and your blockchain contained unappropriate data, that's why better to download fresh blockchain snapshot - https://eu.bootstrap.dexstats.info/PIRATE-bootstrap.tar.gz and start with new wallet once again. What about fresh peers list, here are few:
```
88.99.212.81:45452                                                                     
157.90.94.239:45452 
185.151.240.221:45452
173.212.200.221:45452        
94.130.38.173:45452
195.93.180.221:45452
```

Yep, fresh wallet on v0.7.0-beta1 with latest bootstrap. im still getting  no peers attached. entering like

Just to update, i've managed to get it working by enering the nodes into the terminal.  rather than the debug window.

Thanks!


[22-Aug-21 02:12 AM] 24052019#7280
for reference this is what was pasted into terminal (the nodes were confirmed on the PIRATE disc)

[27-Aug-21 01:14 PM] Decker#3767
There are 3 ways to add node(s):
1. Via command-line arg, as in example above. (before start)
2. Via `*.conf` file (mean, `komodo.conf`, `PIRATE.conf`, `SUPERNET.conf`, etc.) (before start)
3. Via `addnode` RPC `addnode "node" "add|remove|onetry"` (at runtime)
You can use any of these methods, or combine them if needed.

Whenever an application wants to make itself accessible over the network, it claims a TCP/IP port, which means that port can‚Äôt be used by anything else. So how do you check open ports to see what application is already using it?

Best way is to allow your ocean wallet to pass through your windows firewall: https://www.makeuseof.com/how-to-allow-apps-windows-firewall/

How to Allow Apps Through Windows Firewall
Here's how to allow a new app through Windows Firewall, plus manage the apps currently allowed or blocked.

[05-Oct-21 05:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
this is the problem I'm having currently, the application is allowed over the firewall... Node/service on the peers tab keeps flashing some nodes but neither are stable to make a complete connection


[05-Oct-21 05:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
the port is open


[05-Oct-21 06:17 AM] h6y34ui98#1695
Can you establish a VPN tunnel by any chance? Just to bypass your ISP modem/router which may introduce some NAT issue. Basically, redirecting your ocean wallet network traffic through a VPN.


[05-Oct-21 07:01 AM] Decker#3767
@Deleted User what if you'll try to delete all files from `%APPDATA%/Komodo/KOIN` folder, except KOIN.conf and your wallet.dat and will try to sync from scratch? Will it estabilish connection with peers or the issue will remain the same?


[05-Oct-21 08:00 AM] Deleted User#0000
I'll try that see what happens


[06-Oct-21 01:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
the issues still remain the same, no peers connecting and cant establish a connection yet.


[06-Oct-21 01:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php on this site I can see other assets with their Logos on them but the KOIN coin does not have a logo, does it mean we are missing some pre-installed parameters to make the KOIN work for the   with the Komodo Ocean qt wallet @Decker  @gcharang

[06-Oct-21 01:52 AM] gcharang#6833
it just means that the site's maintainer doesn't have the logo file for KOIN.
trying to run the app without a bootstrap also doesn't work?


[06-Oct-21 01:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah, it doesn't work either without the bootstrap. the only issue is connecting to the peers which seem i can't find any at the moment, and port 10701 is still open on the firewall


[06-Oct-21 01:56 AM] gcharang#6833
can you let me know how you are starting the KOIN chain using ocean-qt wallet? which parameters you are using etc.,


[06-Oct-21 01:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
i have loaded the KOIN bootstrap on the KOIN folder, changed the parameters to "C:\Program Files\KomodoOcean\komodo-qt-win.exe" -ac_name=KOIN, i have also tried to addnode for the peers provided by @Decker.


[06-Oct-21 02:01 AM] gcharang#6833
```
"C:\Program Files\KomodoOcean\komodo-qt-win.exe" -ac_name=KOIN
```
is definitely not correct. who suggested you to use it?
you have to use:
```
"C:\Program Files\KomodoOcean\komodo-qt-win.exe" -ac_name=KOIN -ac_supply=125000000 -addnode=3.0.32.10
```

i have loaded the correct one, is the next step to addnode? because the peers arent connecting yet


[06-Oct-21 02:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
should i use the above nodes or the one provided at addnode=3.0.32.10


[06-Oct-21 02:14 AM] gcharang#6833
first, clean up the data directory. it should have nothing other than the KOIN.conf file and wallet.dat file. then launch the app using the correct parameters. you can add the addnodes decker has shared too


[06-Oct-21 02:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
thanks its all good now


[06-Oct-21 02:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
sending and receiving on the wallet should reflect instantly right?


[06-Oct-21 02:20 AM] gcharang#6833
after the sync reaches 100% , sending and receiving will showup in your wallet immediately


[06-Oct-21 08:18 AM] Decker#3767
Issue above is easy to investigate. Wrong command line params -> gives wrong port. So, to determine that's something wrong, just need to do `getinfo` RPC call and compare `p2pport` with known value. If it differs - then command line args used are wrong.

Hey hey everyone, quick question on the new Ocean wallet... I just happened to see we need to update it, and so I have downloaded and I can see a whole bunch of files that I kinda recognise. Do I just need to replace the old versions of these files with the ones that I just downloaded, and then the wallet will be updated? Thanks.

Hello,
I stored komodo in agama wallet back in 2018, i have the wallet.dat file and the seed phrase.
Now that I want to access my funds through ocean wallet, the seed phrase i have should work just fine with ocean right?


[31-Oct-21 02:31 AM] gcharang#6833
the seed phrase and wallet.dat are different things and will give you access to different wallets. seed phrase to 1 address and wallet.dat to many addresses to be specific. ocean wallet will let you access addresses in wallet.dat

[03-Nov-21 10:39 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it depends on where the passphrase came from
if it's the old Agama style `convertpassphrase "put your phrase here"` will work in the debug console window to convert to an actual privkey/wif

[18-Dec-21 08:46 AM] Polaire#4403
But nothing has sync ? it's the first launch , what  i need to delete , i'm on windows


[18-Dec-21 08:52 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
everything in `%AppData%\Komodo\`


[18-Dec-21 08:55 AM] Polaire#4403
i do this  time , but nothing change


[18-Dec-21 08:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Decker any ideas?


[18-Dec-21 09:04 AM] Polaire#4403
Maybe because i'm on windows 11 ?


[18-Dec-21 09:31 AM] Polaire#4403
I reinstall Ocean qt, and download zcash params with the installer , now everything is ok

tnks for letting me know, will keep that in mind for future if anyone else runs into same issue üëçüèΩ 
I never thought about params because that generally throws up a warning message and not a error like that

checking the `debug.log` would have made the cause visible. I've learnt not to trust wallet messages, but go to the source.

Hi to all, I contacted some weeks ago to try to rescue some kmd I had in my chameleon wallet but with no success


[27-Dec-21 11:29 AM] Javi35#6771
I have the 12 words of a camaelon wallet with a few kmd. In the atomic dex I recovered the wallet using those 12 words and the password that I used in the chameleon wallet. It does not seem to work because when the recover wallet is created it appears zero. what should i do or am i not doing right? ps: if I look at the chameleon wallet, my kmd keep showing up.


[27-Dec-21 11:30 AM] Javi35#6771
Please any idea or help? Many many thanks

follow this guide: https://chainzilla.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/43000533132-how-to-export-your-privatekeys-from-chameleon-pay
use the privatekey to login to atomicdex in the place of seed. select the "allow custom seed" option

[28-Dec-21 02:24 AM] Javi35#6771
Thanks a lot but i already tried without success. The problem is that I have my kmd in chameleon wallet and I can see the number, but when I recover the seed for instance in the atomic dex, using the same password I used in chameleon, there are no kmd in it ...


[28-Dec-21 02:25 AM] Javi35#6771
So maybe I am doing something wrong or I have lost my kmd ... but I do not think so cause as I said I can see the kmds in my chameleon... it is a bit weird


[28-Dec-21 02:34 AM] Javi35#6771
Maybe trying with agama wallet could be a good option?


[28-Dec-21 02:42 AM] gcharang#6833
please open the link I shared and follow the instructions in it. the guide allows you to export private key (NOT seed words). the private key can be used in atomicdex instead of seed words


[28-Dec-21 02:57 AM] Javi35#6771
Ok thank you I am going to try


[28-Dec-21 02:58 AM] Javi35#6771
Thanks again for your help and patience


[28-Dec-21 03:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Under 0 circumstances is that a good idea
`convertpassphrase "put your phrase here"` will work in the debug console window of Komodo QT-wallet to convert to an actual privkey/wif
Check that the resulting address is the same as the address that Chameleon has
If it is different then Chameleon uses a different encryption scheme and no Komodo product will produce the same result


[28-Dec-21 03:55 AM] Javi35#6771
Ok thanks. But for example, could I recover my kmd in chameleon using the seed in Coinomi wallet?


[28-Dec-21 03:55 AM] Javi35#6771
Or do I only have to export private keys?


[28-Dec-21 04:08 AM] gcharang#6833
you only need to export private key from chamaleon and use it in atomicdex


[28-Dec-21 04:09 AM] gcharang#6833
chamalean uses a different key derivation scheme for sure


[28-Dec-21 04:20 AM] Javi35#6771
Ok thank you again

Hello again, sorry for chasing once more but I could not get my kmd from chameleon to atomic dex. I put my password but it does not work (100% sure is the correct password). So i have the password, i have the 12 words seed and even the transaction of the kmd recorded, what else can I do??? Thank you again for your support and help


[30-Dec-21 09:22 PM] smkhound#7640
did you export the private key (not seed)?


[31-Dec-21 12:20 AM] Javi35#6771
No because the password does not work so I can not recover anything


[31-Dec-21 12:21 AM] Javi35#6771
Cause the wallet does not seem to support it

I think this can be a solution for me


[31-Dec-21 06:05 AM] gcharang#6833
but you said you were able to see your balance etc in chameleon wallet?


[31-Dec-21 06:05 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, that will work


[31-Dec-21 08:44 AM] Javi35#6771
Ok I will try thanks again

To encrypt the CLI wallet, up to how many words and characters can I use for the passphrase? 12 to 24 words, right? With this passphrase I will also be able to log in via the GUI, correct?


[10-Jan-22 06:47 AM] gcharang#6833
that's not really how it works. native mode(CLI) wallet creates a wallet.dat file that can have hundreds of adderesses each with a different privatekey. here you are encrypting the file with a "password" it can be any reasonably long string like any other password. it doesn't need to look like "seed words"

Lite wallets like atomicdex generate a set of seed words for you and one set of seed words corresponds to exactly one address (currently) 

these 2 modes have no direct relation with respect to backup/restoring of addresses/privkeys


[10-Jan-22 07:16 AM] Seko#7408
Thanks, that's exactly why I asked. You have helped me, thank you.

New **Komodo-Qt (KomodoOcean) v0.7.1-beta3** is available:

- rpc: getblockchaininfo added size_on_disk output param
- qt: bump version to Qt 5.12.11
- bump macOS SDK to 10.15.6 (12.1)
- additional logging (debug.log) about Qt info on startup
- macOS toolchain bump
- add icon colorization on mac os
- add privacy feature to Overview page
- minor fixes and enhancements

It's intermediate release, upgrade preferred, but not mandatory. Most of the changes are kind of "internal", but MacOS users should have more nice GUI. 

Download: https://github.com/DeckerSU/KomodoOcean/releases/tag/v0.7.1-beta3

Btw, for all who had/have incorrect app window and/or captions proportions on HiDPI displays - try to launch the app following way:
```
QT_AUTO_SCREEN_SCALE_FACTOR=1 ./komodo-qt <other_params_if_needed>
```

[28-Jan-22 10:10 AM] PTYX#6840
no but management wants this condensed into General support. There was hesitation to even split up the channels between 2 dex channels and one general but there should be an influx of new users in the coming weeks when the dogedex is relaunched and they will be directed to dex-mobile or dex-desktop


[28-Jan-22 10:19 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

and then everything after that points to "yes"

how do we ever get more devs involved in a thing if that thing keeps getting hidden away?


[28-Jan-22 01:08 PM] Decker#3767
A rhetorical question: if every new user will come to `dex-*` and run SPV wallet, who will run full nodes and support network? üôÇ  From my personal point of view archiving / hiding core things from users is not very straight.


[28-Jan-22 02:06 PM] SHossain#0007
this channel shouldn't be in archived section


[28-Jan-22 08:28 PM] PTYX#6840
It's not about hiding core things from users. The reason to reduce the amount of channels was to condense important conversations into as few channels as possible and make it easier to navigate for newcomers.


[28-Jan-22 08:29 PM] PTYX#6840
I don't make the rules, I just follow them. I'm not the one who decided what gets removed or doesn't. In regards to this channel, it was decided users can ask questions about the Ocean wallet in the #ü§ù‚îÇgeneral-support channel. Devs or whoever needs these channels can assign the dev role in #üí•‚îÇcommunity-roles to see these archived channels


[28-Jan-22 08:30 PM] PTYX#6840
In that line of question, why can't someone ask a question about a full node in #ü§ù‚îÇgeneral-support?


[28-Jan-22 08:33 PM] PTYX#6840
Assigning the developer role gives devs access to the dozens of channels hidden from the normal user. Maybe we should change the name from "archived channels" to developer channels. Or we move the important dev channels to a dev section so it doesn't seem like they are inactive?


[28-Jan-22 09:10 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
That would make sense to me
I can see thinks like labs and "dead" things, but imo this is one of those that's a staple and necessary
Granted most folks don't want to do the non-fad things like "old school" Qt, but it's more likely to get new blood when it doesn't seem like it's tossed in the gutter


[28-Jan-22 09:12 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
> why can't someone ask a question about a full node in ü§ù‚îÇgeneral-support?
No one's saying they can't do that *too*, but shoving it in "archive" is the equivalent of saying "this is a dead thing we no longer care about, but we're saving the chat for posterity"

Admittedly, @Decker has been carrying the full dev load almost from day 1, but burying the channel/project pretty well ensures that's true throughout eternity
If I didn't have a specific interest and noticed it here without his newest update, even I would have thought it was being scrapped ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[29-Jan-22 07:28 AM] PTYX#6840
Yeah i agree with that, I'll ask for a section to be created and we'll add the most active channels instead of it being called archived


[29-Jan-22 07:28 AM] PTYX#6840
For sure, tons of work has gone into it.
