@Audo led a wrap-up over the previous chapter we've come to cover since the start of the internship and set some thing we can expect while moving forward in the internship the coming weeks.  

@sakata equihash community and Bitcoin community has an interest in us because of the dPOW,  there is a DEFI community which we haven't tapped, and consider the dAPP community.


[19-Aug-20 09:28 AM] Jcharming#2693
@CryptoJesus Mining pools are a set of community that has an interest


[19-Aug-20 09:32 AM] Jcharming#2693
@Artakush ideas on gamification represents a community of interest itself , and content creators as a community that can be captured


[19-Aug-20 09:33 AM] Jcharming#2693
@Churro  comments on learning communities and those that are seeking knowledge over blockchain as a whole, many that are newbies
Interns ourselves are representative of that group some


[19-Aug-20 09:34 AM] sakata#4279
If we are marketing AtomicDEX as an interoperability engine, there's a whole new array of opportunity for interest (mostly an extension of dapps)


[19-Aug-20 09:35 AM] Jcharming#2693
@joe_land1 comments that for gamers may have a niche community, but not in the mainstream.  So small community of interest?
@Artakush makes a case for gamer interest for games that are accessible and where blockchain is something that happens as part of the process but isn't up in their faces.  @joe_land1 adds that the mainstream capture just isn't happening atm bc there just isn't as heavy of interest in learning, and it doesn't sound like the mainstream community wouldn't be against incentives, but it wouldn't matter if it was blockchain incentives or other.


[19-Aug-20 09:39 AM] joe_land1#1088
I think an exampel could be the cs go market. Ppl participate in the cs go market cuz they like skins, want to make money, or the steam economy is just an interesting place. It's similar to crypto kinda, but you dont NEED a blockchain to do it, so ppl willl just stay with wut thye know

@CryptoJesus giveaways for KMD if they hold it they have incentive to be a part of the community.  

@Jcharming AtomicDEX and CC both have a very strong opportunity to be exploited in creating a community of activity. 
How about incentivizing milestones or activity not for KMD for crypto but instead doing KMD for active platforms loot crates and redeemable gift certificates.  

@Artakush tech incentives for tech savey, content incentives for content creators.  
If AtomicDEX can setup swaps for anything, then lets set-up swaps and giveaways for redeemable content that people want.  
Work with @CryptoJesus idea that step 1 is come for the KMD giveaway. step 2 is if you don't want the KMD you can trade it for redeemable memberships, amazon gift cards, or content on your favorite platform.


[19-Aug-20 09:56 AM] Jcharming#2693
@joe_land1 speaks on meshing the economics with the tech side to proliferate the ideas of blockchain and the tech regardless if it's directly about KMD or not


[19-Aug-20 09:58 AM] sakata#4279
think we're in the wrong channel 🙂


[19-Aug-20 09:58 AM] Jcharming#2693
hype as one of the options to look into.  Hype 1000 people and capture 1%


[19-Aug-20 09:58 AM] joe_land1#1088
nah this is right one


[19-Aug-20 09:58 AM] Jcharming#2693
Yea our voice channel is in the community hangout


[19-Aug-20 09:58 AM] sakata#4279
internship-voice normally i think


[19-Aug-20 09:58 AM] Jcharming#2693
but it's kind of cool that other people are stopping by,


[19-Aug-20 09:59 AM] sakata#4279
for sure


[19-Aug-20 09:59 AM] Jcharming#2693
aren't we trying to make a community?


[19-Aug-20 09:59 AM] Jcharming#2693
lol


[19-Aug-20 09:59 AM] Jcharming#2693

[19-Aug-20 10:08 AM] Jcharming#2693
@Jcharming suggests that atomicDEX *is* one of our 'physical spaces' that we can meet up as a community.  Enabling chat functions and a way to communicate with eachother could be a big deal, even if it's just a troll box. 

Oink suggests online and virtual meetings gives great feedback over the idea that since (unknowingly to him) we the internship accidently loaded into the community hangout voice channel, it's a thing that if it happens on a weekly basis people will just join in and talk about community.  
This is all under the guise of having a topic every week to talk about, that's a great way to get ideas from the community.


[19-Aug-20 10:10 AM] Jcharming#2693
COVID19 as a marketing oppertunity


[19-Aug-20 10:28 AM] Jcharming#2693
Lots of great ideas, Audo is making a better list of comments on the streamed document, please reference that for further.

[19-Aug-20 10:32 AM] Churro#4832
It would be cool once we share our ideas to the community maybe we can have them choose which areas we should focus on so that way we have a good direction that includes everyone

[19-Aug-20 10:35 AM] Jcharming#2693
We could run with that, maybe post internship? @Churro  and do a once a week open chat with the community where we just show up in channel and talk about ideas like or even get @Audo  to lead something if possible.
