when talking about 'rituals' 
@joe_land1  makes a good point that he comes from a POV of a moderator.  
Great reminder that users will be coming not just as users and trad user rituals, and also those users will come from different views.

@Jack.  makes a mention of the 'hyprr' app by howdo  which is a blockchain styled application.


[11-Aug-20 09:43 AM] Jack.#4200
It's in beta faze, I'm friendly with Jason who's the CRO of Howdoo. I could potentially pull some strings there, but I will have to play it by ear for the moment 🙂

@Jack. please do any resource is a good one to check out imo if for nothing else to just determine that 'it wasn't the right tool for us' kinda thing. 
This is awesome

Concerning idea of pathways @Churro mentions a really great way to give more rewards or access to more or higher level teirs.  

@sakata mentiosn decentraland opp to make a KMD property place there and then have it be something fun to be connected to the project as-well-as help show KMD involvement in the space.


[11-Aug-20 09:57 AM] Jcharming#2693
> ^we can conduct monthly community meetups, where everyone and anyone is invited
@sakata as from @Churro  comments, + where people are incentivized and rewarded for participating too.  'Here's one of the ways you can move higher up on and advance your path and understanding of KMD'  
Fun > grind

Best chain name wins make multiple chains?

Documentation is hard to come by IMO :/


[11-Aug-20 10:08 AM] Jcharming#2693
This^, well imo 'easy to read' documentation. unless you're a dev


[11-Aug-20 10:09 AM] sakata#4279
imo you should be instantly able to locate direct access for where you can use our tech

@Jack. bybit is running a program we can draw inspiration from: they have a competition


[11-Aug-20 10:10 AM] Jack.#4200
https://www.bybit.com/bybit_games - reference; To potentially have beta testers take part in a trading competition


[11-Aug-20 10:13 AM] Jack.#4200
- the rewards are very high, but the concept and branding I think could give inspiration (to give people another reason to use the platform)


[11-Aug-20 10:21 AM] sakata#4279
soooo, decentralands token (mana) is up 200% in the past month, to buy a plot of land is at least 1k usd atm

Building a badge award system for participators of activities in the crypto community.   These badges could be transferred so people can aquire them, badges can be one of the things that people get rewards for participating in which then show up on the KMD portal.  Build it out like a popular game that other people can connect with already.  (season rewards etc) 
Eventually driving connection to atomicDEX 

A major player in game engagement is to make the goal that the team wants (KMD) a by-product of participation.  Participators don't want to be the product, they want to play a game and have fun and then if they learn something along the way (our goal) that's great.  BC we're not Coinbase we don't have to measure the metric of 'did they learn' so strictly that we have to cut corners and suck more fun out of learning tuts and games. 


@joe_land1 mentions about steam market and that brings the idea that there are more than just white hats that are involved in markets.  These people can be engaged with. 

Chaingames opportunity where you can engage black hats and /biz for example. 
Build a chain with some basic conditions set into it.  500 coins, a coin burns if it doesn't transfer every 10 blocks, whoever has 51% of the blocks can 'pho-fork' the chain to 'claim ownership' who has this ownership at the end of 10,000 blocks when the second to last block is burned get the bounty at the end.  

DiCO contest of 'who can make the most interest chain analytics/metrics and name combo'  reward for participators.

@Audo comments on 10 second penny contracts from ETH and how we can do that with CC which can cause deeper engagement, what a great idea. 

@Audo also comments on chips and pangea poker and the opp to come with it

I rate that shirt

<https://darknetdiaries.com/episode/12/> if you want to know about thei history of this (imo really important movement) that I think is an underlying value of the entire KMD community.  The story is here covered really well in brief by a cool investigative podcast journalist I enjoy.

Yea I'll give that a read. I don't suppose you know if there's a whitepaper around anywhere that was released post 2018?

@sakata for which thing?


[11-Aug-20 10:41 AM] sakata#4279
Anything tbh, the only whitepaper I have is an early 2018 edition

@sakata whitepaper for what, I'm not sure I follow.


[11-Aug-20 10:47 AM] sakata#4279
I mean the copy I have covers everything from BarterDEX (that old) to dPoW & smart chains, but fresher literature is would be nice; 2 years is a lot in this space


[11-Aug-20 10:48 AM] sakata#4279
I think we should clear the convos when their not needed anymore to keep this chat concise btw 🙂


[11-Aug-20 10:49 AM] Jcharming#2693
Oh word I understand I'll move over to #deleted-channel 
I think Audo is going to archive these meeting channels and extra the notes to build a document out of and make a fresh meeting day channel everyday.


[11-Aug-20 10:50 AM] Churro#4832
👍🏻


[11-Aug-20 10:50 AM] Audo#5667

[11-Aug-20 11:28 AM] Artakush#4285
sounds like a secreat mission ;D


[11-Aug-20 11:29 AM] sakata#4279
@Artakush There was a lot more confirmation for myself on what I would like to achieve, our discussion was looking at opportunities and ways of expanding. Everything's been noted so you haven't missed out 🙂


[11-Aug-20 11:29 AM] Artakush#4285
It was funny, that One thing I asked the person to do is to write out brainfarts and ideas she would like to see in the app or general culture,.. and she felt that she must meet me.
To which I replied that I did not want to share my ides before NDAS will be established, and we had a nice chuckle ;D


[11-Aug-20 11:29 AM] sakata#4279
Yes, objective KMD has been initiated


[11-Aug-20 11:30 AM] Artakush#4285
