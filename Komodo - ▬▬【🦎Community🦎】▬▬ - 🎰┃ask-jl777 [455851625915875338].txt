Not sure where to ask this 
are the holdings ZCASH and DECRED in SN Nav written off or just not accessible for the moment.


[13-Jun-18 02:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[13-Jun-18 07:59 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Yes they are written off or not accessible?


[13-Jun-18 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
both


[13-Jun-18 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
written off as they are not accessible now


[13-Jun-18 09:24 AM] Mark81#4505
why those are not accessible?

You would have a multi million dollar withdrawal on your identity :/ how do you explain that. Lol


[13-Jun-18 05:40 PM] BlackJesus#6161
If it isn't multi million anymore it's still easily 100k+


[13-Jun-18 09:48 PM] Chipmoon#7477
Just say , invested early, and it should be fine and don't withdraw to a country with high tax, because a lot of questions and paperworks. I plan to check out Singapore next year. I heard it doesn't tax long term crypto holding.

@BlackJesus  you can have someone that lives in a tax friendly country do it


[14-Jun-18 12:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
let them sign a contract beforehand


[14-Jun-18 12:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
pay a small fee to them for the effort


[14-Jun-18 12:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362
or cover possible taxes


[14-Jun-18 12:07 AM] Cryptoon#3362

I'm really sorry to ask this question in this channel but I really need to have the JL's reflexion about this. My question is : How do you deal with the idea that those who benefited the most of an illegitimate system of money are the one that will be able to buy the largest parts of the currency you create ?


[14-Jun-18 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
they could have but at least the playing field is a bit more level than it used to be. the more crypto market becomes the more level. You cant fix things in an instant, it will take decades and we are off to a good start


[14-Jun-18 11:23 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
"If a cryptocurrency network is sufficiently decentralized and purchasers no longer have expectation of managerial stewardship from a third party, a coin is not a security, Hinman added. "      This makes the landscape much more navigable .


[14-Jun-18 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
having the ecosystem of many independent companies/projects working on KMD certainly helps us get more and more decentralized, not just from a nodes standpoint but from an overall ecosystem point. Also, in some sense each notary node is an independent business contributing to KMD ecosystem, contrary to some uninformed critics who call notaries some centralized entity since they all have the same function. this would be like saying all miners are a single centralized entity as they are all doing this "mining" thing

before crypto, you had to be rich already to make any meaningful amounts of money. crypto has changed this. of course money can still be used to make money, but so can knowledge and hard work. That alone is a big win and if half the value of crypto is still in hands of the non-establishement that is hundreds of billions created for those who previously were locked out of such gains. There is no need for total domination for there to be victory and a decntralization of money making


[14-Jun-18 12:28 PM] lard-on#2754
that's a good start. Yeah let's say it's a first step toward the end of extreme accaparation of the earth's weath by the few. But not the ultimate answer


[14-Jun-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the path to the ultimate answer must start with the first step and we have already made many steps. Some small country will make a national crypto that can be atomic swapped with the existing cryptos. As soon as that happens there will be a decentralized pathway into and out of fiat world


[14-Jun-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
dozens of countries are investigating making a national crypto, but there isnt any actual crypto tech that works to support even a small country. KMD is likely the closest to solving this as the security aspect is also solved, which most  (all?) the other scaling solutions tradeoff in order to achieve the scaling. But scaling without security is just a disaster waiting to happen


[14-Jun-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
all the sharding solutions appears to also fragment the mining power across the shards, which weakens the security proportionally


[14-Jun-18 12:55 PM] lard-on#2754
I understand that and I'm so enthousiast about country being able to free themself on a financial point. (I know too well how the IMF works, especially with  "third world"). But I find the climate/migration/energy crises rises so fast that I don't know if we actually have time to build alternative before it all colapse.


[14-Jun-18 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
there is time. things are progressing ahead of schedule. the fact that the establishment are at least partially vested in crypto now, the seeds are planted and it is a matter of time

[14-Jun-18 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
I am just one person, but now there are dozens (maybe even 100+ now) working just in the KMD ecosystem, not to mention the thousands across the entire  crypto space.  Most projects have at least some decentralization spirit, certainly compared to the banksters

@jl777c  Marshall Islands has proudly declared that they have a sovereign cryptocurrency.

Have you looked into adding them to the DEX?

If so, they would be a great fit, because Marshall Islands are a territory of the United States, and the US government is ashamed of how they tested nuclear bombs in their territories. 

It's unlikely the US would have public support in stopping the marshall islands from being the first sovereign atomic swappable currency.

Would be a great way in and out of USD, too.


[15-Jun-18 08:14 AM] elPataDeLana#9387
@carl  can we bridge this to Matrix?


[15-Jun-18 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure about the technical details of the marshall islands coin


[15-Jun-18 12:09 PM] Ludom#5832
Notary nodes are working for the ecosystem


[15-Jun-18 12:09 PM] Ludom#5832
It's not always visible


[15-Jun-18 12:09 PM] Ludom#5832
But as I know they are making great work


[15-Jun-18 12:10 PM] Ludom#5832
We are ambassadors of Komodo


[15-Jun-18 12:11 PM] Ludom#5832
@jl777 You made the possibility to make delayed Proof of Stake right?


[15-Jun-18 12:13 PM] Ludom#5832
What is the consensus model? Based on Nxt consensus ("transparent forging") or something more like peercoin ?


[15-Jun-18 12:13 PM] Ludom#5832
Sorry for my old references


[15-Jun-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW is original, nothing at all like PoS


[15-Jun-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a PoS mode for assetchains that is not so different than peercoin


[15-Jun-18 12:35 PM] Ludom#5832
Ok


[15-Jun-18 12:35 PM] Ludom#5832
That was my question


[15-Jun-18 12:35 PM] Ludom#5832
It's peercoin with always the possibility to mine or only staking ?


[15-Jun-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
not fo rKMD, but for assetchains with -ac_staked=<perc> where the perc is 1 to 100, setting the percentage of PoS blocks


[15-Jun-18 12:36 PM] Ludom#5832
The staking participate to the securisation or is it just "for the pleasure"?


[15-Jun-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
and it is different from peercoin


[15-Jun-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
for the assetchains, it is the consensus mechanism to create new blocks


[15-Jun-18 12:37 PM] Ludom#5832
Ok


[15-Jun-18 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
but most of teh security would come from dPoW


[15-Jun-18 12:37 PM] Ludom#5832
Yes I know


[15-Jun-18 12:38 PM] Ludom#5832
But dPoW is not the single mecanism to secure the chain


[15-Jun-18 12:38 PM] Ludom#5832
Because I possibly can propose a PoS system for a project


[15-Jun-18 12:39 PM] Ludom#5832
But I think it's better to propose something with notarisation as dPoW


[15-Jun-18 12:39 PM] Ludom#5832
PoS is interesting because it's an easy consensus to explain


[15-Jun-18 12:40 PM] Ludom#5832
It's a nice solution for "federeted organisation".


[15-Jun-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
well easy explaining is not the best way to decide on the consensus mechanism


[15-Jun-18 12:41 PM] Ludom#5832
Right


[15-Jun-18 12:41 PM] Ludom#5832
But sometime explaining/understanding is good for adoption


[15-Jun-18 12:42 PM] Ludom#5832
And PoS give interesting scale of weight on a system


[15-Jun-18 12:42 PM] Ludom#5832
In federeted organisations


[15-Jun-18 12:43 PM] Ludom#5832
Consensus and mechanism is a question of politic too


[15-Jun-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is why for assetchains made it so you can set 0 to 100% PoS to PoW ratio


[15-Jun-18 12:43 PM] Ludom#5832
It's great


[15-Jun-18 12:44 PM] Ludom#5832
If you have a 100% PoS ratio, do you need the Komodo notaries?


[15-Jun-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
notarization  is always optional


[15-Jun-18 12:45 PM] Ludom#5832
Is it easy to launch such a chain?


[15-Jun-18 12:46 PM] Ludom#5832
Because the project about I speak could make their own notary nodes


[15-Jun-18 12:47 PM] Ludom#5832
And it's a goal to be independant and PoS could be a good way to organize this new network


[15-Jun-18 12:48 PM] Ludom#5832
It's just the first steps of reflexion


[15-Jun-18 12:48 PM] Ludom#5832
We are in competition with sytems like Ethereum


[15-Jun-18 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
./komodod -ac_name=POSCHAIN -ac_staked=100 -ac_supply=100000000 -ac_reward=1000000


[15-Jun-18 12:49 PM] Ludom#5832
Ethereum sucks I know


[15-Jun-18 12:50 PM] Ludom#5832
But the decisions are not taken just about rational arguments


[15-Jun-18 12:51 PM] Ludom#5832
Is it possible to set up  assetchain without anonymity?


[15-Jun-18 12:52 PM] Ludom#5832
I think yes but it's native to the assetchains right?


[15-Jun-18 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
you could just not use it


[15-Jun-18 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
to disable it would require code changes


[15-Jun-18 12:53 PM] Ludom#5832
PoS could be good without the possibility to mix the token (except with atomic swap)


[15-Jun-18 12:55 PM] Ludom#5832
If I speak about that it's because I'm privileged advisor for local crypto-projects with university and politics


[15-Jun-18 12:56 PM] Ludom#5832
And I want to propose some Komodo related solutions


[15-Jun-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
ok


[15-Jun-18 12:57 PM] Ludom#5832
And politics are difficult to convince because they fear the fails


[15-Jun-18 12:57 PM] Ludom#5832
And full anonymity is not very popular


[15-Jun-18 12:58 PM] Ludom#5832
Specificaly if you want to propose solutions used by the state services


[15-Jun-18 12:58 PM] Ludom#5832
pseudonymity like Bitcoin is more appreciated


[15-Jun-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
for a nation state we can make customizations


[15-Jun-18 01:00 PM] Ludom#5832
It's not a nation state, it's just a little canton in Switzerland


[15-Jun-18 01:00 PM] Ludom#5832

[15-Jun-18 01:01 PM] Ludom#5832

[15-Jun-18 01:03 PM] Ludom#5832
They are triing to pay the subvention with Bitcoin


[15-Jun-18 01:03 PM] Ludom#5832
Because Ind√©Nodes don't have any Bank account


[15-Jun-18 01:03 PM] Ludom#5832

[15-Jun-18 01:04 PM] Ludom#5832
But it's complicate for them for legal reasons


[15-Jun-18 01:04 PM] Ludom#5832
And the accounting service is lazy


[15-Jun-18 01:06 PM] Ludom#5832
The old world takes time to change


[15-Jun-18 01:07 PM] Ludom#5832
But it'll change if we help them and give them the tools


[15-Jun-18 01:09 PM] Ludom#5832
We experiment decentralization in crypto world for years


[15-Jun-18 01:09 PM] Ludom#5832
But the non crypto world want to experiment themself too.


[15-Jun-18 01:10 PM] Ludom#5832
They can't trust totaly our own experience becaus "you know, our reality is not the same"


[15-Jun-18 01:11 PM] Ludom#5832
But it's very important to let's them have a try. Perhaps they'll fail as lot of crypto projects fails in the past


[15-Jun-18 01:12 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
@Ludom  for blockchains / public leadger I believe full anonimity is needed. See - in bank account no one publicly sees how much money you own. If BTC your addresses can be linked and you can be in danger if you got enough money.


[15-Jun-18 01:13 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
Imagine you pay with your BTC somwhere and the guy is linking your payments and wallets / analitical tools, and checks if make sense to rob you.


[15-Jun-18 01:13 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
With bank account he cant do this - not public.


[15-Jun-18 01:13 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
From what I understand Zcash is protecting you


[15-Jun-18 01:13 PM] Ludom#5832
I don't speak about a project that will be about anonymity and wealth holding


[15-Jun-18 01:14 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
The only "problem" may be it's protecting you even from official check üòÉ So also gov, which they may not like.


[15-Jun-18 01:14 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
However BTC  not being anon is a dangerous thing for regular user


[15-Jun-18 01:14 PM] Ludom#5832
If you want anonymity you can have it anyway


[15-Jun-18 01:14 PM] Ludom#5832
You swap your coins with KMD and that's it


[15-Jun-18 01:15 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
ok


[15-Jun-18 01:15 PM] Ludom#5832
Speaking with politic is different as writing on a slack

or discord üòâ


[15-Jun-18 01:16 PM] Ludom#5832
Most of people in crypto don't have to be accountable


[15-Jun-18 01:17 PM] Ludom#5832
They play their own money and they are not elected publicly as a politician is


[15-Jun-18 01:19 PM] Ludom#5832
I really think that anonymity is a good thing to propose


[15-Jun-18 01:19 PM] Ludom#5832
I personnally don't care about it because I actually don't need it


[15-Jun-18 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
it helps them get contributions privately


[15-Jun-18 01:20 PM] Ludom#5832
But who know that some day I'll need anonymity to protect myself, I'll be happy to have an easy solution for that


[15-Jun-18 01:21 PM] Ludom#5832
I think if Satoshi made Bitcoin totally anon as  Zcash it wouldn't be a success


[15-Jun-18 01:21 PM] carl#3101
@elPataDeLana yes, I will create a link to matrix


[15-Jun-18 01:21 PM] Ludom#5832
Because trust is a building


[15-Jun-18 01:22 PM] Ludom#5832
Bitcoin transparency was a first step to trust in the blockchain


[15-Jun-18 01:23 PM] Ludom#5832
The anon coin are a second level


[15-Jun-18 01:23 PM] Ludom#5832
Smart contract are a new level too


[15-Jun-18 01:24 PM] Ludom#5832
And when I speak with autorities (political or economic), they are on the ground zero of trust.


[15-Jun-18 01:24 PM] Ludom#5832
They need to understand things by themself and you can't propose something to complex for the beginning


[15-Jun-18 01:25 PM] Ludom#5832
And something that doesn't change too much their thinking model


[15-Jun-18 01:26 PM] Ludom#5832
Anonymity is a big big step

Hi jl777, I would like to ask which coins you currently find interesting besides KMD


[16-Jun-18 03:06 AM] Hegelian#0018
Also, how good odds do you give BCH in the long term


[16-Jun-18 03:08 AM] jl777c#5810
all the ecosystem coins like VRSC, CHIPS, OOT, etc.


[16-Jun-18 03:08 AM] jl777c#5810
odds for BCH? for BCH to do what in the long term


[16-Jun-18 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810
also this channel is not really for my personal opinions on other coins, more for questions about KMD ecosystem tech


[16-Jun-18 03:13 AM] Hegelian#0018
OK. I really enjoyed reading your views on bch and segwit and blockstream on slack. Unfortunately I cant search for them now


[16-Jun-18 03:14 AM] Hegelian#0018

I'm curious how Komodo could reach 1 million tx/sec without compromising security & centralization, @jl777c  could you explain a little bit ?  If Komodo could be that scalable, then with the upcoming smart contract support + the security of Bitcoin network, Komodo would become the best platform out there

[16-Jun-18 04:54 PM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
@polycryptoblog  can you elaborate  ? as  I understand  with dPoW  Komodo is able to "save its history" on other blockchain such as bitcoin blockchain, but how does it help Komodo reaching 1 million tx/sec ?


[16-Jun-18 05:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
@PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator the 1 mil tx/s are due to Merkle-on-Merkle, SPV validations and a Burn protocol. Thousands of coins being able to swap against each other thanks to a Burn protocol, maintaining their total emission. And they trust each other because they are being notarized on KMD blockchain (and indirectly onto BTC blockchain).


[16-Jun-18 06:05 PM] Alright#0419
It's my understanding that storing the MoMoM in the KMD chain allows a user to verify a tx on any of the parallel chains by looking at the KMD chain. Is that correct?


[16-Jun-18 06:05 PM] Alright#0419
MoMoM being merkle root of merkle root of merkle root for anyone wondering


[16-Jun-18 06:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator  the DPoW provides the security if the application accepting the KMD/assetchain waits for a notarization.


[16-Jun-18 06:17 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Alright   yes, merkle root is included in block header of parallel chain,  this allows parallel chain to verify tx was good on its own chain,  since the MoMoM is a cascade effect of merkle roots   one couldnt change original merkle root without changing the rest, so you are correct.


[16-Jun-18 06:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
you can view the momom in the kmd chain to verify tx

KMD Scalability Story
Scaling Without Compromises About Komodo Komodo team is concluding that we are not a platform but rather a technology provider. We build end-to-end blockchain solutions The vision is to create a decentralized, scalable, interoperable, and secure ecosystem. Scalability is an i...

Maybe that can help answer some questions.


[16-Jun-18 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD chain will be required to be able to generate the proofs for the tx, but any tx on any chain can be validated. it is quite powerful


[16-Jun-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
with each notarization the assetchain sends in the MoM for the blocks since the prior notarization, KMD then calculates the MoMoM for all MoM from all assetchains to add to that notarization. It gets notarized, KMD updates the set of indexes so that now any tx covered by the MoM is able to be proven via nested SPV proofs


[16-Jun-18 07:41 PM] jl777c#5810
building on that is a burn protocol that allows to preserve total coins across  all the chains in a cluster by only allowing to recreate coins that were burnt, onetime on one chain

The coins who use KMD notary service. That arnt asset chains, they have to buy KMD for it to work? What does it cost?


[17-Jun-18 02:23 AM] Hegelian#0018
Another question: how soon after zec does the sapling update, the one that allows z tx with only 40 mb ram, will kmd upgrade?


[17-Jun-18 02:24 AM] Hegelian#0018
Also, is there a timeline for a mobile agama? Do you think kmd will be first zksnarks coin that does mobile z tx?


[17-Jun-18 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. about 300KMD/yaer. not sure. probably zec will be the first


[17-Jun-18 08:27 PM] chinmaydshah#6404
Where do the 300 kmd go to? Also I see that notaries are elected - how centralized is the election and reward (deciding who is a notary) process? How much human vetting is involved?


[17-Jun-18 08:37 PM] BlackJesus#6161
holders of the CRYPTO asset chain receive those payments.


[17-Jun-18 08:37 PM] BlackJesus#6161
the notaries do notkeep that


[17-Jun-18 08:38 PM] Hegelian#0018
DEX get dex fees, jumblr get junblr fees, crypto get notary fees and what do the other assets get?


[17-Jun-18 08:39 PM] Hegelian#0018
Like HODL and supernet?


[17-Jun-18 08:43 PM] BlackJesus#6161
hodl is a closed end asset it holds a ton of other coins and trades on face value. Supernet is about the same as hodl except it dividends its holdings of DEX/CRYPTO and whatever else actually is a paying asset


[17-Jun-18 08:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
mshark is also another fund like hodl


[17-Jun-18 08:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
supernet has by far the biggest pot and just recently bought 2% of all utrum tokens


[17-Jun-18 08:51 PM] Hegelian#0018
Are all dividends for supernet paid out in kmd?


[17-Jun-18 09:16 PM] BlackJesus#6161
yes


[17-Jun-18 09:16 PM] BlackJesus#6161
all dividending assets payout in kmd


[18-Jun-18 12:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Once the kmd scaling goes live, how will this affect daily tx number on the kmd ‚Äòmain chain‚Äô? Will this also significantly increase these numbers? We recently saw the switch with regards to the claiming of rewards to montly instead of yearly, to increase usage security and anonimity. Can we expect a similar effect from the scaling efforts? Or even bigger?


[18-Jun-18 01:15 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless of the tx, each new chain will add its notarizations to KMD. So a one price of 300KMD to pay the notarization txfees and you can have 1 tx per day or a million on one chain. Of course if there are a million such chains, that is millions of notarizations per day, which would use up most of the chain. And 300 million KMD per year of KMD fees... It seems before then we need to deploy the solution for allowing billions of chains


[18-Jun-18 01:15 AM] jl777c#5810
all possible, just no need to solve years ahead of time


[18-Jun-18 01:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I was more thinking in the sense that short term it will increase the useage of the main kmd chain


[18-Jun-18 01:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Which is a good thing and the same reason why kmd switched from yearly to monthly reward claiming


[18-Jun-18 01:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But as you say, I dont think it will become an issue or problem that the main kmd chain would be to bloated or whatever


[18-Jun-18 01:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Short term more of an advantage


[18-Jun-18 02:17 AM] jl777c#5810
short term advantage. long term even bigger advantage, especially to those who hodl KMD through the bear market

@chinmaydshah notary centralisation is touched on in the whitepaper.  for the hypothetical case that notaries became centralised, the worst they could do is not notarise to btc.  for this to happen, more than 50 out of the 64 notary nodes need to conspire with each other to have that effect.


[19-Jun-18 03:07 AM] Mylo#8306
the voting process is open to all kmd holders.  notary elections are open to anyone.  approximately 30 of the 60 available (out of 64) notary nodes are elected each year.  the other 30 are automatically elected.
what decides auto-re-election?  the top performing notary nodes (the ones that participate in the multisig transaction to btc, "the notarisation"), so it is in the notaries interest to perform their function to be auto-re-elected, otherwise, they must stand for election with freshly enthusiastic candidates.


[19-Jun-18 03:08 AM] Mylo#8306
30+30 != 64.  what about the other 4?
There are 4 notary nodes that are used by dev team afaik


[19-Jun-18 03:25 AM] gcharang#6833
Also the Komodo notary election process is costless to the voter. They get airdropped VOTE tokens equivalent to the amount of KMD they hold. So voters don't need to  actually spend real money to make their opinion heard.


[19-Jun-18 06:51 AM] Mark81#4505

is jumblr really as easy as it seems? lets forget backend for a second. In the frontend I basically would need 2 addressess where i hold the prkeys for? Send some coin to the deposit address and the coins will be jumblrd to the destination address. Is this right?

yes


[19-Jun-18 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i tried to make the api as easy to use as possible, how the addresses are managed is up to the caller.nothing is saved on disk (other than the ztx) so restart the daemon and no record of what you jumblred

im wondering if theres a case if people would want to look back at some overview or status of what they jumblrd in a gui


[19-Jun-18 09:42 AM] Meyse#0952
so if i were to create a new seed with agama for example, i can use all of these addressess of different coins to jumblr all those different coins?

or are there limitations, some coins cant be jumblred?

jumblr only works with KMD, we need to aggregate all the jumblr activity

there is a reason half the notaries win automatic spots

that way we have half the notaries that will adopt the new version, especially if some of the existing notaries win spots in the elections.

also if you use a barterDEX deposit address as a jumblr secret address

BTCH has as much point as  most of the other BTC forks, it also cloned the BTC utxo set with 250MB of space and it is secured by dPoW and inherits KMD codebase enhancements


[21-Jun-18 04:58 AM] Hegelian#0018
Yes but that is true of every other asset chain, no?


[21-Jun-18 04:59 AM] Hegelian#0018
It shows good way to do airdrop but what reason is there to use it?


[21-Jun-18 05:00 AM] Hegelian#0018
In fact I had btch before and it took me all day to make deposit to coinexchange because I look on explorer and there were hours without a single transaction


[21-Jun-18 05:04 AM] jl777c#5810
what reason to use any of the BTC forks? you can always do some very small tx to get the blocks generating


[21-Jun-18 05:08 AM] Hegelian#0018
Yes, that is what I did, sent the same amount to myself every 5 minutes. As for why use any of the forks, the user here was saying to promote btch to get volume and I said how could it bring volume when it has $2 of volume on coinexchange and isnt even on coinmarketcap


[21-Jun-18 05:09 AM] Hegelian#0018
I just mean I think promoting btch to get traffic for bdex is not the best idea, nothing more


[21-Jun-18 05:10 AM] Hegelian#0018
Oh, I'm sorry he actually said promote to get more btc holder to claim. And I dont see that happening. One btch is worth how much a btc in percentage terms? Most bitcoin gold was left unclaimed and it was $400


[21-Jun-18 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as BTCH goes I think it needs to come up with some specific use case first, if it doesnt, then it wont have any specific use case and while that is ok for coins with a p+d team behind it, we dont do such things


[21-Jun-18 11:12 AM] Hegelian#0018
Yes a use-case. And also something that worries me about btch is that cryptopia controls address to 800k plus btch. That's fine now but I'd be worried if price ever went up


[21-Jun-18 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
at least you always have something to worry about


[21-Jun-18 11:23 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
cryptopia is the last CEX I'd worry about, them doing something with btch would entail them doing something

I have a question about the future of these chain clusters. Let's say there is a cluster that is a national currency. Let's say large companies would each have their own chain.(at least this is how I understand it would work) How would a new company add their new chain to the cluster? Just consensus by the notaries to start notarizing it?


[22-Jun-18 02:53 AM] Hegelian#0018
In the long term I am worried what if there are major vulnerabilities found with zk-snarks? Wouldn't that mean the coin with zksnarks should be abandoned? If the solution in such a case to do airdrop of new coin for holders?

[22-Jun-18 03:29 AM] gcharang#6833
It's part of the inflation mechanism coded into the coin(Similar to block reward awarded to miners). All the komodo miners accept the claim of reward because that is a part of the consensus protocol.


[22-Jun-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright we are still working out all the details on dynamically expanding a cluster. first step is to get it to work and we just achieved that. I think it would be a good test to make a new chain with same clusterid and see if this unauthorized chain can do the burn protocol with the official cluster chains. If so, it is a bug and we will fix it

I'm curious about the Turing completeness of Komodo smart contract, will it be Turing-completed ?


[22-Jun-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont design things to meet abstract litmus tests, like "turing complete" (which i think actually requires infinite storage which no practical system can have). Rather, I design to solve the actual things that need to be solved. So describe a specific useful smart contract and I can tell you if it will be supported


[22-Jun-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
from wikipedia: To show that something is Turing complete, it is enough to show that it can be used to simulate some Turing complete system. For example, an imperative language is Turing complete if it has conditional branching (e.g., "if" and "goto" statements, or a "branch if zero" instruction; see one instruction set computer) and the ability to change an arbitrary amount of memory (e.g., the ability to maintain an arbitrary number of data items). Of course, no physical system can have infinite memory; but if the limitation of finite memory is ignored, most programming languages are otherwise Turing complete.


[22-Jun-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so an incomplete turing completeness litmus test?


[22-Jun-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
I ask why is that important


[22-Jun-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
let us make a list of specific smart contracts and then just make sure all of them are supported, ie be able to change parameters and other practical customizations that real world usages will want to do


[22-Jun-18 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
atomic swaps are a smart contract, it does the job it is supposed to do, yet it isnt turing complete, even the incomplete definition. So does that make atomic swaps not useful?


[22-Jun-18 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
If the problem at hand is solved, I claim that the problem at hand is solved, regardless of its turing completeness


[22-Jun-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
Also, notice that if we dont have to make a turing complete contracts, we can avoid a massive amount of security  issues  not to mention the effort required to make it turing complete. So why build something that will certainly create security issues if it isnt needed.


[22-Jun-18 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
I like to iterate from the simplest possible solution and if that isnt sufficient to add a bit more. I stop when the problem is solved. I expect we wont have to go to full turing completeness (with finite mem) in order to be able to run 99% of the useful smart contracts


[22-Jun-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
I think the logic used is that "a turing complete contracts system can solve any smart contract, so if we had a turing complete system we are golden"


[22-Jun-18 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
this misses the very real risks satoshi designed the bitcoin script system to avoid and then then disabled most of those opcodes!


[22-Jun-18 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but the turing question is a misdirection!! The better question is "can the smart contract system solve the problem it needs to solve without creating giant security attack vectors and unknowns"


[22-Jun-18 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
So while a turing complete system would be able to say it can implement any contract, it isnt without a giant caveat, ie. any contract includes a lot of contracts with undesirable behavior.

MoMoM burn protocol is just one of the nearly infinite possible types of contracts. The MoMoM burn can maintain the total coins in a cluster, even while coins are moved from one chain to another. they are kind of like all being sidechains to each other. this wont work for generalized DEX

I have a question about dPoS.


[26-Jun-18 12:02 PM] vasa#4326
The dPoS Wiki says that: Within this scheme, each notary is allowed to mine one block at its current difficulty rate, while the other notary nodes must mine at 10 time higher and all the normal nodes will always mine at 100 times the difficulty rate of the notary nodes.


[26-Jun-18 12:03 PM] vasa#4326
What is the reason behind putting high difficulty to the other nodes than the mining node?


[26-Jun-18 12:03 PM] vasa#4326
I couldn't figure out the problem it is solving...


[26-Jun-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW not dPoW, this text appears to be confused.


[26-Jun-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
the notaries get to mine at easy diff once per 65 blocks


[26-Jun-18 12:10 PM] vasa#4326
Yeah..sorry about that


[26-Jun-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
other than that the diff works normally


[26-Jun-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
no matter how high the hashrate goes, the notaries will get about 75% of the blocks


[26-Jun-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
this allows notaries to know they will get revenues coming in


[26-Jun-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
also it is ASIC resistant


[26-Jun-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
also it makes it that much harder to get 51% the hashrate as many of the notaries would have to be compromised


[26-Jun-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so it solves the problem of paying for notary nodes, securing the chain, resisting ASIC


[26-Jun-18 12:13 PM] vasa#4326
That's great...the thing that :the notaries will get about 75% of the blocks


[26-Jun-18 12:13 PM] vasa#4326
Is this some rule in the consensus?


[26-Jun-18 12:14 PM] vasa#4326
Or it is derived from the difficulty other nodes are facing?


[26-Jun-18 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
we tune the notary mining to achieve the 25%


[26-Jun-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
the lower the external miner percentage gets, the slower the notaries take to mine


[26-Jun-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the real hashrate has no effect on notaries, they can always mine one in 65 blocks, whether external miners are 10MH, 10GH or 10TH or even 10PH


[26-Jun-18 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
but we need to calibrate it to reality, or the diff can explode. in our early days on testnet the diff did explode up into the billions, so we added the free for all mining, once per 2000 blocks where notaries are not able to mine at easy diff, but they still notarize during this time. This resets the diff to the actal hashrate


[26-Jun-18 12:18 PM] vasa#4326
According to above: 25 % for the non notary miners. right?


[26-Jun-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
approx


[26-Jun-18 12:20 PM] vasa#4326
And I read it in your google docs: Our latest stress test had 1024 chains, and we achieved 20k transactions per second (TPS).

On Komodo, we can include multiple payments on a single transaction, so thus we can also say we made over 800k payments per second.


[26-Jun-18 12:21 PM] vasa#4326
Is it really 800k payments without any failure?


[26-Jun-18 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it was blockchain based payments

not sure if you know, but komodod has the insight-core support built into it now. there are many -addressindex rpc calls also a -spentindex to allow an explorer like insight explorer to just call the coin daemon

then there is the electrumX server that does mostly the same thing to implement api: https://electrumx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/protocol-methods.html

What I am thinking is that it could be a very small layer that publishes the electrum api and then calls the komodod -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 daemon and for things that dont exist right away (like generating spv proofs, we actually have that code from the MoMoM work)

this is how soft forks generally work, the miners that are in the minority in the soft fork fall behind and stop being able to mine blocks

BadMiner could do it between notarizations, but it's impossible to predict when a notarization will happen


[26-Jun-18 03:29 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Okay, so imagine this attack on an asset chain notarizing every 20 blocks:
 - Bad Miner has 65% of asset chain hashrate
 - We are at block 100 (it has been notarized)
 - Bad Miner starts mining block 101. He is mining privately so he doesn't publish when he finds a block.
 - Good miners (35%) start mining 101
 - This creates competing private and public chains
 - Bad miner only publishes his chain every 20 blocks so that his chain keeps getting notarized.
- I don't the maths off the top of my head but as you exceed 50% hashrate your chance of being the first to 20 block becomes exponentially greater
 - As miners stop getting rewards they will leave, furthering your hold on the assetchain


[26-Jun-18 03:30 PM] Alright#0419

will wait for jl to confirm if its the case for this discussion


[26-Jun-18 03:45 PM] ProficieNt#0001
but like I said, the more often the blocks are notarized the less likely a majority miner completes his chain faster


[26-Jun-18 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
notarization rounds start for heights that are 0 mod duration


[26-Jun-18 03:56 PM] jl777c#5810
duration being 2, 5, 10, etc


[26-Jun-18 03:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"The BadMinerA can reject the GoodMiner blocks and outpace them. This way, if they dont comply with his censor list, they wont get their blocks mined"
@ProficieNt How do you propose that happens?
If you imagine that BadMinerA  is rejecting the blocks from "good miners" then you have to assume that BadMinerA is, factually accepting NN blocks or mining a dead fork
In any other situation, at the point of notarization, BadMinerA would have to *always* get the next block in order to continue the attack and that's simply against the Law of Averages


[26-Jun-18 03:59 PM] ProficieNt#0001
The bad miner only needs to build X blocks faster than a good miner


[26-Jun-18 03:59 PM] ProficieNt#0001
It's not a simple statistical chance


[26-Jun-18 04:00 PM] ProficieNt#0001
If notarizations are infrequent, the chance that the bad miner finishes first grows exponentially with hash power and duration in between notarizations


[26-Jun-18 04:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
The only way the "attack" would work is if BadMinerA had 100% of the hash
even if BadMinerA "outpaced" the other 40%, "good miners" would have to ignore both BadMinerA and NNs in order to never get a block


[26-Jun-18 04:00 PM] ProficieNt#0001
The bad miner is mining privately


[26-Jun-18 04:01 PM] ProficieNt#0001
A hyperbole example:

- Notarization every 100 blocks
- Attacker has 99% hash power


[26-Jun-18 04:01 PM] jl777c#5810
oliver is right


[26-Jun-18 04:02 PM] ProficieNt#0001
The good guys don't have a 1% chance of winning the race


[26-Jun-18 04:02 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if BadMinerA is working on a private chain, then BadMinerA is working on a higher diff in order to complete the attack and the 60% becomes < 50% effectively


[26-Jun-18 04:02 PM] ProficieNt#0001
They have an immensely small chancd


[26-Jun-18 04:02 PM] ProficieNt#0001
@ComputerGenie howd you figure that?


[26-Jun-18 04:02 PM] jl777c#5810
reorging each time so his chain gets notarized allows a censorship attack. not a double spend, but censorship


[26-Jun-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
reorging right before the notrization happens


[26-Jun-18 04:03 PM] Deleted User#0000
like "my blocks are genuine" ?


[26-Jun-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
for a pure PoW assetchain


[26-Jun-18 04:03 PM] jl777c#5810
making it have a PoS component would avoid this


[26-Jun-18 04:03 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Basically the chance and duration of a successful censorship depends on the frequency of notarizations and the percentage hash power that is byzantine


[26-Jun-18 04:04 PM] ProficieNt#0001
@jl777c are we talking Casper FFG style hybrid or how do we do this?


[26-Jun-18 04:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i think at 5 blocks it is not very practical

[26-Jun-18 04:05 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c How can I predict a notarization? Don't they sometimes take a couple blocks for notaries to "agree"?


[26-Jun-18 04:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm not saying that it's not possible to do, I'm saying that it's economically infeasible and impossible to sustain.


[26-Jun-18 04:05 PM] Alright#0419
could you tell me block heights for DEX, for example


[26-Jun-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but the height of the notariztion is at known heghts


[26-Jun-18 04:05 PM] jl777c#5810
not the block the notarizztion gets confirmed in, but what is being notarized


[26-Jun-18 04:06 PM] ProficieNt#0001
@ComputerGenie please go research selfish miner attack, there are plenty of economic games to be played in pure PoW


[26-Jun-18 04:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
then the random block +/-1 ntrz could just fuck that prediction


[26-Jun-18 04:06 PM] ProficieNt#0001
At 5 blocks per Notarization you need to have a serious chunk of the hash power to do this successfully


[26-Jun-18 04:06 PM] jl777c#5810
so the censorship attacker gets his private chain being notarized by publishing it when he is ahead of the public chain


[26-Jun-18 04:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@ProficieNt I've literally done what you're suggesting; I don't need to "research it" üôÑ


[26-Jun-18 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but it seems it is a matter of time before bad luck makes you unable to reorge


[26-Jun-18 04:07 PM] ProficieNt#0001
But if you can add a pos component you can potentially negate all this


[26-Jun-18 04:07 PM] jl777c#5810
-ac_staked=<perc> sets the PoS percentage to the specified amount


[26-Jun-18 04:07 PM] ProficieNt#0001
The problem is that probability scales exponentially in this scenario. So with each % more hash power I buy the time it takes for chance to process a successful how at notary goes up by a big multiple


[26-Jun-18 04:08 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Pure pow chains won't work unless they are notarizing almost every block or have a decent chunk of hash power


[26-Jun-18 04:09 PM] ProficieNt#0001
@jl777c where can I read up on the stake mechanism?


[26-Jun-18 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a utxo based staking


[26-Jun-18 04:09 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Also, of note:
by the time there is any probative economic incentive to carry out such an attack at any sustained level, I have faith that we'll be far moved on from the current things.

All addresses refers to what pool of addresses?


[26-Jun-18 04:11 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"That's like saying it's okay to build a flawed system because we'll build a better one in the future"
No, that's saying that you're imagining a scenario in tech that, literally, changes every day


[26-Jun-18 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810
so based on coinage and stake you get chance to win a block, but the frist 2 seconds only 1/64th are eligible


[26-Jun-18 04:11 PM] jl777c#5810

this 64 way segmenting makes it hard for majority stake to dominate


[26-Jun-18 04:12 PM] jl777c#5810
in fact, it is possible for a small minority stake to get disproportionate blocks if the others are not paying attenction

Thanks @Alright


[26-Jun-18 04:13 PM] jl777c#5810
basically we get 64 different staking battles


[26-Jun-18 04:13 PM] Alright#0419
A new block is eligible to be staked 1 second after median blocktime. For example, segid0 for a given height will be eligible to submit a block 1 second after median blocktime, whereas segid1 will be eligible to submit a block 2 seconds after median blocktime. For the next block, segid0 from the previous block will now be segid63 and will be eligible to submit a block 64 seconds after median blocktime. This means by 64 seconds after the median blocktime, all segids are eligible.

Should this say 2 seconds?


[26-Jun-18 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
I remembr  it as 2 seconds. let me check


[26-Jun-18 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes 2 seconds


[26-Jun-18 04:14 PM] jl777c#5810
proper allocation of funds in segments becomes like a mining


[26-Jun-18 04:15 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to see how each segment is distributed and your incentive is to move coins to the underweight segnents

but that is what everybody might do, so maybe better to wait and see

I have to read how staking works


[26-Jun-18 04:16 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Does staking actually mint blocks or give you an edge at mining?


[26-Jun-18 04:17 PM] jl777c#5810
it mines a block


[26-Jun-18 04:17 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Hopping off now, will look into staking tomorrow. If it's safe, seems like a great solution to the PoW censorship problem


[26-Jun-18 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the PoW diff adjusts very quickly to the specified percentage


[26-Jun-18 04:18 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Is it based off any existing staking mechanism?


[26-Jun-18 04:18 PM] jl777c#5810
the previous 100 blocks are used to see what it has been and the PoW diff multiplier adjusted

Like do stakers have to be online?


[26-Jun-18 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just like being a miner


[26-Jun-18 04:20 PM] ProficieNt#0001
If so, would a miner on a private chain have his private chain halt or would he be on a higher diff


[26-Jun-18 04:20 PM] jl777c#5810
in fact the staking does mine at easy diff


[26-Jun-18 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
PoS = ultra low diff PoW that 1st requires existing coinage


[26-Jun-18 04:21 PM] jl777c#5810
mining on a private chain without stake will be difficult

hard to have the longest chain


[26-Jun-18 04:22 PM] ProficieNt#0001
So, on a public chain, if 1 in 10 stakers is offline


[26-Jun-18 04:22 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Does diff adjust to speed up for the other stakers


[26-Jun-18 04:23 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Or does the chain just become slow as people go offline


[26-Jun-18 04:23 PM] jl777c#5810
diff adjusts if the blocks are coming in too slow


[26-Jun-18 04:23 PM] ProficieNt#0001
And why doesn't it adjust for private chains?


[26-Jun-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, sure it will adjust but to a 2 minute ave blocktime


[26-Jun-18 04:24 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Or does it take a bit of timd


[26-Jun-18 04:24 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Okay, if you go private you will start really slow


[26-Jun-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
but depends on coin allocations in the 64 segments


[26-Jun-18 04:24 PM] ProficieNt#0001
And the idea is that someone public notarizes before you


[26-Jun-18 04:24 PM] jl777c#5810
and what segment is the 0 segid next


[26-Jun-18 04:24 PM] ProficieNt#0001
So you can't fuck with the diff and start doing a long range attack?


[26-Jun-18 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
only with the non-notarized chain


[26-Jun-18 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
which isnt very long range


[26-Jun-18 04:25 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe you can fiddle with the diff a bit

Hmm


[26-Jun-18 04:26 PM] jl777c#5810
but how to stay ahead of the publci chain without half the stake and majority hashrate


[26-Jun-18 04:26 PM] ProficieNt#0001
When you submit your 10 blocks and Notarization starts, do you ahev to include the returning notarizations before your next Notarization


[26-Jun-18 04:26 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Or could you drop 50 blocks and the notary would make 5 main chain notarizations


[26-Jun-18 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
you could drop 50 blocks


[26-Jun-18 04:27 PM] ProficieNt#0001
But you have to do it before someone does 1p


[26-Jun-18 04:27 PM] ProficieNt#0001
10


[26-Jun-18 04:27 PM] ProficieNt#0001

[26-Jun-18 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
before anybody else notarizes after your private fork


[26-Jun-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810
not per notary


[26-Jun-18 04:28 PM] jl777c#5810

Sorry, corrected


[26-Jun-18 04:29 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Okay, I understand how it works. You'd need to have majority pos and pow to be able to censor. Will need to think about how successful you would even be if you had majority of both

@Alright plz document the censorship attack on 100% PoW parallel chains, attribute it to Oliver


[26-Jun-18 04:37 PM] ProficieNt#0001
I'm not convinced staking really fixes the problem if you can get majority POW and POS. Once you're in control, you cement your position. However, with POS the community could always fork out the coins of bad actors. If there is some sort of deposit delay that would let the community act, this isn't a bad solution


[26-Jun-18 04:37 PM] ProficieNt#0001
It's late so maybe I missed something but I think pos might not solve censorship


[26-Jun-18 04:37 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Will look further tomorrow, keen to be proven wrong


[26-Jun-18 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly if majority control of PoS is also required that is a much bigger burden for censorship


[26-Jun-18 04:38 PM] jl777c#5810
I think minority stake allocated in the 64 segids can create high probability to stake a block


[26-Jun-18 04:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it requires active coin movements to achieve this


[26-Jun-18 04:39 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Not necessarily, as you fracture the network you fracture security. But, you don't need super meme tier TPS for a long time. If staking is expensive enough then you can wars off bad miners that way


[26-Jun-18 04:39 PM] ProficieNt#0001
@jl777c maybe I misunderstood the staking mechanism then, will go over tomorrow

The good public only needs to reach Notarization once, while the attacker needs to win every time. And if pos is simple probability, the chance that the public  eventually notarizes isn't too bad (assuming not too high delays in between notarizations)


[26-Jun-18 04:48 PM] jl777c#5810
we might have to go to 5 blocks per notarization for chains that want to be censorship resistant

I know @jl777c but pos isn't as bad as pure pow. That said it's not a major improvement if delays between block notarizations is long


[26-Jun-18 04:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so the more coinage and more coins, the easier diff


[26-Jun-18 04:51 PM] jl777c#5810
diff = (iter + blocktime - txtime - minage);
            if ( iter > 0 )
                diff += iter + segid*2;


[26-Jun-18 04:52 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, need to recommend notarizations every 5


[26-Jun-18 04:52 PM] ProficieNt#0001
This is why most sharding systems have a source of randomness for allocating stake. However, each of these sidechains should be more significant than a shard so you can probably get away with it


[26-Jun-18 04:53 PM] jl777c#5810
this is reverse of sharding,


[26-Jun-18 04:53 PM] ProficieNt#0001
You're still cutting up network security resources?


[26-Jun-18 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
well its not that these parallel chains were ever KMD itself


[26-Jun-18 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
"I'm attacking your ideas, not your qualifications. I think it's foolish to not respect the fact that when you split a network you split the pos and the pow"
I never said it wasn't possible, I'm merely trying (in vain it seems) to point out that it's not sustainable for anyone not willing to piss away tens of thousands of dollars. Yes, it's "cheap" in the short term; however, in the long term, community hash can/will grow to combat it. This is one of the things I'm addressing in my multi-chain stratum.


[26-Jun-18 04:54 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt diluating KMD security resources


[26-Jun-18 04:56 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Okay but these chains need to organize their security in a way they can't be strong armed easily


[26-Jun-18 04:56 PM] jl777c#5810
in the world with thousands of fungible chains in a cluster, if any one of them is constantly censored, then people will use a different one


[26-Jun-18 04:56 PM] ProficieNt#0001
@ComputerGenie if you're mining an asset chain and not getting any block rewards you're going to increase your hashrate towards it?


[26-Jun-18 04:57 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Selfish mining cuts other miners out of rewards


[26-Jun-18 04:57 PM] ProficieNt#0001
It means they're incentivized to abd on the asset chain


[26-Jun-18 04:57 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Because their being frotnrun by a bigger player

for PoS


[26-Jun-18 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
I am thinking of capping the diff at 10 or so, so CPU is enough to get blocks


[26-Jun-18 05:04 PM] jl777c#5810
assetchains can use anything, yes. VRSC made their own hashing and PoS


[26-Jun-18 05:05 PM] jl777c#5810
and regarless  of the massive hashrate, it wont give any big advantage to attacker


[26-Jun-18 05:06 PM] jl777c#5810
@Alright it would be good to see how high you can push up the diff on a PoS chain


[26-Jun-18 05:07 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Do you envision most asset chains not using Kmd for pos @jl777c ?

[26-Jun-18 05:08 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
imo, 10 should be good max for PoS, CURE normally runs 4-7

[26-Jun-18 05:12 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Okay fair enough, komodo is a utility hub


[26-Jun-18 05:12 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Not aikong to be a scalable Chain itself


[26-Jun-18 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
when we make a 1:1 KMD sidechain cluster, then you get effectively KMD tx throughput


[26-Jun-18 05:13 PM] jl777c#5810
but it wont be the real KMD


[26-Jun-18 05:13 PM] ProficieNt#0001
I'm saying 1:1 KMD clusters are at risk if a stake can choose exactly what chain to join

ok, that makes sense


[26-Jun-18 05:14 PM] ProficieNt#0001
But komodo is a-okay for other chains


[26-Jun-18 05:14 PM] ProficieNt#0001
And maybe with some randomization method for clusters could be stronger


[26-Jun-18 05:14 PM] jl777c#5810

the fees will eventually be paid a revenue to DEX holders

how is it converted to KMD? what if there is no liquidity? what's a DEX holder?


[27-Jun-18 12:47 AM] CHMEX#0686
it will be sold  on a exchange like BarterDEX. if there is no liquidity it might not worth doing it for that token erc20 token.
DEX Holders are Owners of the DEX coin it's an assetchain with receives dividends from the fees


[27-Jun-18 12:50 AM] ito#3141
so what happens to the fees collected if there is nobody trading the ERC-20 for KMD? just sits there until liquidity comes?

by DEX coin do you mean InstantDEX?

Is there anywhere detailing the attacks (or lack there of) that malicious notaries can perform on Komodo? It seems the worst they can do is stop notarization of Komodo? Is there anywhere detailing why a minimum of 13 online notaries is needed?


[27-Jun-18 02:57 PM] ProficieNt#0001
If all the notaries got together and colluded, they could at worst simply refuse to notarize the chain?


[27-Jun-18 02:59 PM] ProficieNt#0001
Also, what percentage of blocks are mined by notaries?


[27-Jun-18 03:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the power of notaries is to notarize, but these have to be valid, so yes, the worset appears to be a witholding of notarization, which is a degrading of security, but visible to all.


[27-Jun-18 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
13 is based on the experimental results of needing a majority to be in sync to be able to get 13, it is quite a complex stochasitc process to choose the random 13 of 64 eah round


[27-Jun-18 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810
notaries mine approx 75% of blocks


[27-Jun-18 10:12 PM] NNoperator#3835
My node (karasugoi_NA) has an older version of GCC and it failed to build GCC 6.3  so I think I am stuck with the "array used as initializer" error with this latest komodo upgrade.  Do you think you will be able to get the upgrade to work on older versions of GCC, or should I attempt an OS overhaul ?


[27-Jun-18 11:22 PM] gcharang#6833
Regarding the discussion that happened with @ProficieNt :  Mostly the scalable asset chains are going to be used for utility/app tokens. The main function miners provide are validation(Checking the transactions are valid and making blocks), security based on decentralization(i.e., if one miner is bad(submitting invalid blocks), the rest of the miners won't accept his blocks), redundancy: some miners go offline - others can continue mining making the system resilient and large hash power (to protect from 51% attacks). 51% attacks are mainly double spend attacks - can be ignored for dPOW if the last notarizid block is considered as valid. As resulted from the  above discussion, a miner with large hash power can only attack by censoring transactions. Can the other miners simply block and stop accepting his blocks? For other block-chains this won't be feasible because the large hash rate is required for protection, but with dPOW this is less of an issue? 

Another conclusion was that by splintering into a huge number of chains, we are breaking up POW and POS security both by breakung up hash power and stake/wealth , I don't know about POS, but can't all the asset chains be merge mined so that all of them get the combined hash power?


[27-Jun-18 11:36 PM] ProficieNt#0001
The problem is, who decides when the chain gets notarized? How will the user know which chain to guest?


[27-Jun-18 11:51 PM] gcharang#6833
I think that the success of blockchains to provide trustless transactions and all the desirable properties is due to equal parts technical things and social/behavioral/game theoretic things. So for this problem too I think some form of hybrid social+technical solution exists and we just need to think it out.


[28-Jun-18 12:22 AM] jorian#4555
math decides when the chain gets notarized, right? after around 5 blocks of the chain that is being notarized, a notarization happens


[28-Jun-18 03:18 AM] ProficieNt#0001
@gcharang the core problem here is that Komodo uses PoW (only true consensus algo atm) and that you cant split PoW and still enjoy your security unless you have randomized assignment


[28-Jun-18 03:18 AM] ProficieNt#0001
that said, as a security platform for independent PoW chains it's pretty cool


[28-Jun-18 03:33 AM] ProficieNt#0001
@jl777c How does Komodo's difficulty algorithm work? It actively tries to award notaries 75% of the blocks, right? What happens if all notaries stopped mining, or if notaries started attempting censorship attacks / short range attacks?


[28-Jun-18 04:31 AM] Regnar#6164
I've always looked at the starting of an asset chain, not as splitting and pulling hash power away from Komodo, but adding hash power to the asset chain that didn't exist in the Komodo ecosystem yet. I thought when you set up an assetchain, it is your chain, all mining operations you must provide, or create incentive for others to mine the chain. So in this way it's not sharding Komodo and its mining power, but is simply adding a new chain that notarizes its blocks to Komodo, and in this way isn't like an ERC20 token. The asset chain could have small hash power and susceptible to censorship but the dPoW mitigates this threat by requiring the censoring party to either time their 51% control with notary hashes, or maintain it indefinitely. I'm not too sure on how the inclusion of PoS hybrid to prevent this (though I assume it's to create more mining power to supplement few miners on the chain). but beyond that it's over my head


[28-Jun-18 04:34 AM] ProficieNt#0001
Choose one of two:
 - Komodo is the world's most scalable blockchain through its asset chains.
 - Komodo is a hub providing security and interoperability to independent chains.

as far as I'm aware from reading in the scaling sections, Komodo scaling is not through the asset chains that are set up on it, it's about scaling the Komodo current chain with asset chains that are fungible with it. it's not saying there are 100 asset chains, each their own project and coins, therefore KMD tx/s is X(#of asset chains). it's saying Komodo can launch multiple of its own chains that are all KMD (not other projects) and all fungible with it, therefore providing n chains of Komodo. I don't think I've read anywhere that these asset chains don't need their own resources to scale either.


[28-Jun-18 04:43 AM] ProficieNt#0001
so it is relatively formal opinion held by Komodo


[28-Jun-18 04:44 AM] ProficieNt#0001
@Regnar okay, then why do I get told that asset chains bring their own PoW

``I've always looked at the starting of an asset chain, not as splitting and pulling hash power away from Komodo, but adding hash power to the asset chain that didn't exist in the Komodo ecosystem yet.``


[28-Jun-18 04:45 AM] Regnar#6164
Isn't that what I said?


[28-Jun-18 04:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think there seems to be a conflation of things here.
the chains that spin up for scale are not the same as the chains that get spun as asset chains
If KMD needs more headspace, the assets like MNZ and others aren't going to get flooded with transactions; these are separate from that


[28-Jun-18 04:47 AM] Meyse#0952
@ProficieNt did you read up on MoMoM?


[28-Jun-18 04:49 AM] ProficieNt#0001
@ComputerGenie what is the correct terminology for Komodo's own chains?


[28-Jun-18 04:50 AM] ProficieNt#0001
@Meyse I read a high level overview. Is it basically notarizing the markle tree into KMD main chain and then back into the asset chain. this would then allow cross merklized chain communication


[28-Jun-18 04:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
tbh, I just came back last week after a hiatus and I'm not completely up to speed, so I'm not sure what the actual term for what I'd call a "sub chain" or "side chain"is


[28-Jun-18 04:53 AM] ProficieNt#0001
kk


[28-Jun-18 04:54 AM] ProficieNt#0001
the way these chains would be structured is different because they need their own PoW incentive? is there any research into this?


[28-Jun-18 04:55 AM] Meyse#0952
Okay so as far as my technical skills go its like this: everyone can create an "assetchain", you can secure this assetchain with the notaries through dPoW. If you need lets say 1m tx/s, you create a whole bunch of assetchains and link them together, with the whole MoMoM thing, so they act as "one". These are also secured with dPoW then. EVERY assetchain needs their own PoW/PoS/whatever


[28-Jun-18 04:55 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you mean the scaling chains, they have no need for "incentive", the point of existence is "overflow"


[28-Jun-18 04:56 AM] Meyse#0952
so now you have scaling and security


[28-Jun-18 04:56 AM] ProficieNt#0001
so they run on PoW consensus with no block rewards? or what's the story


[28-Jun-18 04:57 AM] Meyse#0952
you run them however you want to run them i suppose


[28-Jun-18 04:59 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
given what I know of the protocol, I assume one *could* mine the scaling chain on it's own and get a 0.0001 block reward of 96c57ca8db8162fd3b501ee9edc16d69766dcda8308cca2f8854ab1772cef229 coin


[28-Jun-18 04:59 AM] ProficieNt#0001
so there is no incentive beyond transaction fees to run scaling chains?


[28-Jun-18 05:01 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm not sure there needs to be "incentive" for an "unseen" chain


[28-Jun-18 05:02 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
unless I'm missing something


[28-Jun-18 05:02 AM] Meyse#0952
all assetchains, which are the same as "scalingchains", are all customizable however the creator wants it


[28-Jun-18 05:03 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

[28-Jun-18 05:20 AM] gcharang#6833
I have access to both the docs at readthedocs and atlassian. The problem is, scaling solution is still in testing and it uses the exact same technology of asset chain creation(but enhanced with MoMoM stuff). For the assetchain/parallel chain part, they both mean the exact same thing and there were plans to phase out both the terms and make it just `blockchain` we will need to finalise all these either as a team or as a community which is a problem because of all the `decentralization`. There is no CEO here to say this is the final truth and make it so.

That is because historically only Komodo assets lived on these chains.

I have read all the scaling -test chat and libscott's explanations of cryto-condition explanations and all. I do understand at a high level what is being done. I am just saying that scaling is still in testing and it uses the same commands as creating asset chains to spawn scaling chains but with one extra parameter (`ac_cc`) and no one thought to name them


[28-Jun-18 06:12 AM] jorian#4555
yes, that burn protocol is what makes it different, essentially, it serves a complete different purpose than 'just an assetchain'


[28-Jun-18 06:13 AM] Meyse#0952
yes ok, but if you spawn a blockchain (asset chain), and later i have the need to scale, what do i do?


[28-Jun-18 06:13 AM] SHossain#0007
TXSCL chains are Komodo assetchains like any other AC we have. the difference is they are clustered using `-ac_cc=3`. If any other real projects wants to use `-ac_cc=x` they can. those will not be classed as scaling chains


[28-Jun-18 06:13 AM] SHossain#0007

[28-Jun-18 06:14 AM] SHossain#0007

[28-Jun-18 06:43 AM] xRobeSx#5136
just to add in from above my opinion (from my understanding).  since the scaling chains are essentially assetchains with  -ac_cc=3  or whatever it is, I'm not sure 2 names is really necessary. In the future wouldn't we want to promote anyone who's spawning an assetchain to include  -ac_cc=3  no matter what the purpose of their chain is?  that way in the future if they ever need to take advantage of the CC features, they don't need to create a new chain just to add this paramater


[28-Jun-18 06:47 AM] xRobeSx#5136
and that begs the question as to if there will need to be a snapshot of  SUPERNET/DEX/etc  assetchains  and then spawn new chains with the  -ac_cc=3  param


[28-Jun-18 06:49 AM] jorian#4555
do those chains need scaling?


[28-Jun-18 06:49 AM] jorian#4555

[28-Jun-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
VRSC will be automatically spawning new chains (actually the miner will be doing this) and they are called autochains


[28-Jun-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so the name is *chain


[28-Jun-18 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
where * can be anything


[28-Jun-18 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
having one name to describe every possible thing will lead to a name that is overloaded


[28-Jun-18 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
so no matter what single name is used, people will complain that it doesnt make sense in all the other cases. I try to avoid getting involved in things that dont have a deterministic conclusion as it can easily take infinite time


[28-Jun-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
I suggest that marketing create a marketable name for each different type of usecase. Maybe we can even get press coverage for each different name (usecase) from the same ./komodod -ac* runtime fork ability


[28-Jun-18 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
when I originally implemented this it was because I was too lazy to make N source code forks for all the different SuperNET assets, so I made -ac_name= option and called it assetchains


[28-Jun-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
then I added ability to be mined as on-demand chains only made sense for infrequently used assets


[28-Jun-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
then I added PoS/PoW and different coin emissions


[28-Jun-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
then -ac_cc=1 with CC enabled


[28-Jun-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
then VRSC added their options


[28-Jun-18 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
then with MoMoM -ac_cc=<clusterid>


[28-Jun-18 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so it has just expanded and evolved as it has been the path of least resistance from a technical side to add new abilities


[28-Jun-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
and what we havent released yet, but have announced are coin specific CC eval functions that allow to blockchain enforce any (and by any, I mean any) boolean evaluator. This might sound not so much, but when you can run native code to evaluate to a boolean, you can do things like evalpokerhand(op-return data of pokerhand, payoutvector)


[28-Jun-18 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
then given a poker hand (signed in realtime) you can approve a blockchain payout of a pokerhand, blockchain enforced and not needing any multiple signers


[28-Jun-18 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
The burn protocol was able to be implemented so quickly due to the fact that solving realtime poker being blockchain enforced has been the overall goal, with the assumption that most other decentralization problems will be easier to solve and likely some variation of a subset of the realtime poker solution


[28-Jun-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
so we can have a bunch of game specific chains, what to call them? is there a single name for chains with a boolean eval function, or do we name each subset of chains that have something in common (card games, casino games, multiplayer games)?


[28-Jun-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
this i leave to marketing to solve, it will be enough work to get all this tech working without having to worry about the perfect way to name it

"Asset Chain rename - Parallel Chains / ScaleChains"
imo, "ScaleChains" would bring up the implication issue from earlier, whereby the name suggests that those chains are somehow utilized to offset scaling of the network and the intended correlation to the lizard/komodo theme would be lost on most folks

Is merged mining just an implementation detail of mining software or only some kind of coins be merge mined? I am asking as I think that this could be a solution to the problem of splitting hashpower between a lot of fungible chains connected with `ac_cc` for the purpose of scaling tx/s

It would require code change, as merged mining is part of the consensus as far as I am aware, you can't merge mine any coin.


[29-Jun-18 02:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
Having a single miner for all chains, or even each 64 chain cluster, would mean we need even less CPUs.

```
To do any harm to the blockchains that are getting dPOW(i.e., not add a particular blockchain's checkpoint to BTC), all the notaries that get to sign a particular transaction have to collude and notaries don't get to choose which other notaries to sign the transaction with. On the random chance only the colluding notaries can get together and not notarize a blockchain intentionally, the community would just kick all of the colluding notories.
``` 
Is this statement true?


[29-Jun-18 04:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the power of notaries is to withold notarization


[29-Jun-18 04:29 AM] jl777c#5810
as each notarization is validated by all nodes


[29-Jun-18 04:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so not sure what "colluding" will achieve, other than reducing the notarization frequncy


[29-Jun-18 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
and such notaries that are coluding to withhold notarizations will have a lower notarizing total and have to go through election cycle. it wont be easily determinatble that a notary is part of the colluding non-notrizers

Naming suggestions - 
MoMoM -  Grandmother of Merkle. 
Branding of scaling solution:  Moebius scaling
Asset Chain rename -  Spore chains


[29-Jun-18 04:51 AM] PTYX#6840
Coming up with fancy animal names isn't the key thing. The goal is creating a technical name that describes the independent chains. Eth has ERC20, QTum has QRC, and NEM has Mosaics which fits them. An ideal name is easy to use and adds marketing value. If I hear the word Spore chains..... That doesn't tell me much. If I hear KIC and I research and find that KIC stands for Komodo Independent Chain. Then that makes more sense.


[29-Jun-18 04:52 AM] PTYX#6840
Verus calls theirs autochains


[29-Jun-18 04:52 AM] PTYX#6840
Which still has more marketing value than assetchains


[29-Jun-18 04:52 AM] PTYX#6840
Auto can be autonomous or automatic


[29-Jun-18 04:52 AM] PTYX#6840
Which in a way its both


[29-Jun-18 04:52 AM] gcharang#6833
What about `Komodo based Blockchains`


[29-Jun-18 04:53 AM] PTYX#6840

Komodo Independent blockchain


[29-Jun-18 04:53 AM] PTYX#6840
But KIC has more of a ring when you say it word by word


[29-Jun-18 04:53 AM] smkhound#7640
I don't mind technical names or unique acronyms. I was thinking more visualy .

btw, how does the community veto / kick notaries? can a vote be called?


[29-Jun-18 05:08 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries get to mine at easy diff once per 65 blocks


[29-Jun-18 05:09 AM] jl777c#5810
with 64 notaries there is room for some underperforming notaries, the annual election will sort that out


[29-Jun-18 05:10 AM] jl777c#5810
a single notary couldnt really do much to abuse their mining, a 1.6% attack isnt very strong


[29-Jun-18 05:10 AM] jl777c#5810
certianly if all the notaries are compromised, then we have a problem


[29-Jun-18 05:10 AM] jl777c#5810
but a lot of notaries are known community members


[29-Jun-18 05:11 AM] ProficieNt#0001
the ratio of notary mined blocks to standard is 3:1 but 64/65 blocks a notary will get a chance to mine one, how does that play out?


[29-Jun-18 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
the notaries add delayes to their mining where longer and logner random delays are added the loser the external mining percentage gets


[29-Jun-18 05:12 AM] ProficieNt#0001
is there a document on this algorithm?


[29-Jun-18 05:12 AM] ProficieNt#0001
or something i could search for


[29-Jun-18 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
a dishonest notary could get 20% more blocks, but they would be found out


[29-Jun-18 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the code is the documentation in this case:


[29-Jun-18 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
if ( gpucount < 33 )
            {
                uint8_t tmpbuffer[40]; uint32_t r; int32_t n=0; uint256 randvals;
                memcpy(&tmpbuffer[n],&My_notaryid,sizeof(My_notaryid)), n += sizeof(My_notaryid);
                memcpy(&tmpbuffer[n],&Mining_height,sizeof(Mining_height)), n += sizeof(Mining_height);
                memcpy(&tmpbuffer[n],&pblock->hashPrevBlock,sizeof(pblock->hashPrevBlock)), n += sizeof(pblock->hashPrevBlock);
                vcalc_sha256(0,(uint8_t *)&randvals,tmpbuffer,n);
                memcpy(&r,&randvals,sizeof(r));
                pblock->nTime += (r % (33 - gpucount)*(33 - gpucount));
            }


[29-Jun-18 05:14 AM] ProficieNt#0001
if honest notaries should be mining 1.17% of the blocks, you're saying a dishonest notary could mine 1.4% of the blocks but it would be obvious to the public


[29-Jun-18 05:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[29-Jun-18 05:15 AM] jl777c#5810
all the notary statistics are closely monitored by the notaries


[29-Jun-18 05:15 AM] jl777c#5810
doing such things would disqualify a notary


[29-Jun-18 05:16 AM] ProficieNt#0001
okay and if someone, or a group of people, start abusing the network the community could hardfork? or is there a protocol level way to kick notaries


[29-Jun-18 05:16 AM] jl777c#5810
if majority of notaries area compromised, a hardfork seems the only safe way to correct things


[29-Jun-18 05:17 AM] ProficieNt#0001
if around 5 start performing selfish mining attacks and trying to gain more control?


[29-Jun-18 05:17 AM] ProficieNt#0001
how could they be dealt with?


[29-Jun-18 05:17 AM] jl777c#5810
most notary operators are known community members


[29-Jun-18 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
loss of reputation would be a big loses, and wouldnt it take closer to 20 notaries to do selfih mining, unless you mean the 1.4%


[29-Jun-18 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
notary corruption is unlikely and in any case it is visbiel and correctable if the unlikely happens


[29-Jun-18 05:18 AM] ProficieNt#0001
correctable through a hard fork though?


[29-Jun-18 05:19 AM] jl777c#5810
yes,we have a sheduled annual hardfork


[29-Jun-18 05:19 AM] jl777c#5810
and we use it to activate new consusus changes at the same time


[29-Jun-18 05:20 AM] ProficieNt#0001
okay, and if someone is caught buying votes they are disqualified through social consensus?


[29-Jun-18 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
sometimes there is an in-between hardfork


[29-Jun-18 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems it is impossible to detect buying of votes


[29-Jun-18 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
and if KMD holder wants to give his voting decision to someone else, that in  a way is his decision


[29-Jun-18 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
there are all sorts of doomsday theories how all the notaries will be planted zombies and such nonsense. the reality is that the community makes a serious decision about who the 64 are, as the last elections showed


[29-Jun-18 05:22 AM] ProficieNt#0001
okay, fair enough. how do asset chains pay for notarization? As I understand, that is currently a manual process?


[29-Jun-18 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, notaries need to get the coin being notarized and the KMD to cover the notarizing txfees (but not the BTC txfees that are already paid)


[29-Jun-18 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
an the notaries have to start running the coin, and the notarize it. there is no way to automate that, so it is necessarily a manual pricess


[29-Jun-18 05:27 AM] ProficieNt#0001
I'm just wondering what the reason for requiring 13 notaries to reach consensus? Would it not be possible to let anyone notarize and it to just be a part of the normal mining process?


[29-Jun-18 05:28 AM] jl777c#5810
where is the incentive for them to notarize?


[29-Jun-18 05:29 AM] jl777c#5810
without a decent number notarizing how to know it is very likely the mainchain?


[29-Jun-18 05:29 AM] jl777c#5810
without knowing who the noataries are how would we know who is notarizing? and if they are not known then there is no reputation loss, to prevent playing games


[29-Jun-18 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
so, yes it is possible, but we have a public election process, etc. not sure what is gained from  anonymous randome notarizers


[29-Jun-18 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it seem you are trying to make problems out of non-issues


[29-Jun-18 05:35 AM] ProficieNt#0001
1) To secure their chain of PoW, with SCs you could attach a bounty to proving notarization.
2) Surely you can have individuals optionally run the Bitcoin blockchain. If someone tries to fake that Merkle tree, the nodes with the BTC chain can send a proof showing that the merkle was invalid and the others can ignore the previous notarization. (not sure how this works but might help: https://blog.kyber.network/chain-relays-or-a-practical-approach-for-cross-chain-trades-d0d7003f266b)
3) We build systems that don't need trust because they are more efficient and resilient.


[29-Jun-18 05:36 AM] ProficieNt#0001
if you make notarization anonymous using incentives, you can support many more chains and without any middleman handling the money

nice theoretical solutions are nice, but until  it is proven you can get regular BTC notarizations with miners upfronting the BTC and somehow coordinating with each other, it is unproven


[29-Jun-18 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
trusting  BTC relay to exist is not any better


[29-Jun-18 05:42 AM] ProficieNt#0001
maybe not the BTC cost


[29-Jun-18 05:42 AM] ProficieNt#0001
but from other chains into KMD


[29-Jun-18 05:42 AM] ProficieNt#0001
that should be automated and can be

such enhancements are not prohibited and likely will be done


[29-Jun-18 05:43 AM] ProficieNt#0001
and why do the miners need to coordinate?


[29-Jun-18 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
the BTC fees are the big hurdle


[29-Jun-18 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
you will trust a single anonymous notarizer? doesnt that open up a lot more minority attack vectors


[29-Jun-18 05:44 AM] ProficieNt#0001
you dont trust anyone, you trust the BTC blockchains

[29-Jun-18 05:47 AM] ProficieNt#0001
so, it seems that automatic notarization on KMD is relatively straight forward and would be a big bonus to the network? it decreases a central reliance on notary nodes and makes the protocol more resilient


[29-Jun-18 05:51 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure it is relatively straight forward, but I would definitely consider such a pull request as long as there are no issues found by the anonymous and lack of N nodes in agreement


[29-Jun-18 05:56 AM] ProficieNt#0001
where do you see problems? the main pre-requisite is a scripting language / smart contracts so these chains can manage their notarizations


[29-Jun-18 05:58 AM] ProficieNt#0001
the contract has a function submitNotarization() which takes a block header / proof as an argument. It has a second function submitChallenge() which lets someone challenge a previous submission by submitting a block that shows an earlier inclusion of the notarization TX. If they do this, the previous notarization is removed and the new notarization is accepted


[29-Jun-18 05:58 AM] ProficieNt#0001
that's probably a naive SC implementation but you guys are the devs here so you tell me üòõ


[29-Jun-18 06:01 AM] ProficieNt#0001
@jl777c the current solution requires notaries to run every child chain, right?


[29-Jun-18 06:04 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[29-Jun-18 06:04 AM] xRobeSx#5136
@ProficieNt I‚Äôm not sure this helps, but I saw you mentioning everyone should be able to notarize. Technically anyone can setup a tier 2 Notary Node network and notarize whatever coins they wanna run to KMD. So technically you could run your own private NN‚Äôs to notarize your private assetchain to KMD for example. As for notarizing to BTC, as James said it‚Äôs very expensive so that‚Äôs why the KMD team covers paying the btc fees for the elected (tier 1) NN‚Äôs.


[29-Jun-18 06:05 AM] ProficieNt#0001
@jl777c this will pose great scalability issues, issues that trustless notarization will solve


[29-Jun-18 06:05 AM] ProficieNt#0001
@xRobeSx but that mechanism still requires you to trust someone. someone who probably isnt as trustworthy as the current notaries


[29-Jun-18 06:06 AM] ProficieNt#0001
im suggesting a mechanism by which you trust no one, in the sense that anyone can be a notary and prove if someone is disingenuous


[29-Jun-18 06:06 AM] ProficieNt#0001
add a few economic incentives and you've got a highly scalable protocol


[29-Jun-18 06:07 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I‚Äôm just saying in the scenario I just mentioned, you wouldn‚Äôt have to trust the notarization to KMD as you could do it yourself with your own NN‚Äôs. As for the KMD -> BTC notarization of the previous, you‚Äôd be trusting just the elected NN‚Äôs


[29-Jun-18 06:08 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I‚Äôm not trying to persuade your thinking, just bringing up another angle, as I don‚Äôt think many people realize there can be sub NN tiers


[29-Jun-18 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
this is all in the realm of possible, the subNN is not enabled yet, it is needing a bit more work


[29-Jun-18 06:11 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Oh thanks for the clarification James. I thought it was possible and @SHossain was using a subNN to notarize the scaling chains


[29-Jun-18 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
it is called a notarizing testnet


[29-Jun-18 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
for testing, not mainchain use (yet)


[29-Jun-18 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
but yes, the notarization group can be customized with an external JSON config file


[29-Jun-18 06:23 AM] ProficieNt#0001
@xRobeSx are we building a blokchain or an SQL database? why should my network participants trust me to solely manage notarization?


[29-Jun-18 06:25 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm not saying just you. You could setup 1 private NN and maybe release documentation for anyone using your coin to notarize it?  Maybe you could make the first assetchain that has decentralized notarizations üòÉ

I have set-up TXSCL notaries for scaling test, I even have a repo that generates the chains, and all the config files needed to start it automatically. It uses momo branch KMD, which appears to make every -pubkey= passed to it, a valid notary. with -pubkey enabled it needed 0.0001 UTXO to mine.


[29-Jun-18 06:39 AM] ProficieNt#0001
and so anyone can write the assetchain into KMD and then broadcast the merkle back on the asset chain?


[29-Jun-18 06:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
I was going to try and docker iguana inside the mining node container, and have a seperate JSON file/iguana network for each chain


[29-Jun-18 06:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
This effectively would do what you are suggesting.  Auto creat a chain, and launch it with an iguana that notarizes to KMD, the only manual process is funding the KMD to the address of each notary.


[29-Jun-18 06:40 AM] ProficieNt#0001
how do you verify that the merkle is legitimately in the longest KMD chain?


[29-Jun-18 06:41 AM] ProficieNt#0001
why would you need to fund KMD @Deleted User im talking about a system where every miner is incentivized to notarize their chain and the first to do so gets rewarded

[03-Jul-18 07:23 PM] Mylo#8306
@jl777c  a short time ago you mentioned there was an assetchain parameter/feature for a single address receiving a "fee".
a)  is this testable in any branch?
b)  is the "fee" a set amount, or a "%" of the transaction.
c)  this "fee" - can it currently be a variable amount?  if not, do you see this as potentially do-able.

The use case is a franchise setup where the franchisor receives a "fee".  If the case for (c) can be implemented, the use case would be that the KMD value vs the BTC value vs the $ value  would be calculated by some data-feed (centralised or decentralised).

Failing that, would this be more useful for cryptoconditions looking forward?

Had to re-read it.  What a powerful option.
-ac_perc=10000000 (0.1 as a decimal of satoshis, therefore 10%)
User A sends 100 EXAMPLECOIN -> User B.
User B receives 100 EXAMPLECOIN & 10 EXAMPLECOIN are created from the transaction happening because of the ac_perc.

@grewalsatinder from my limited understanding atm, ILP is streams of characters.  CC is defined in ASN.1 notation (similar to SNMP MIBS and HL7 medical devices protocols).

https://interledger.org/rfcs/0027-interledger-protocol-4/

So in that page, you'll see that `amount` and `expiresAt`  are "fixed length fields".  Each field has it's identifier and type.

As a telecommunications example, using my CSTA knowledge: in ASN.1
```
0x02 = Integer

Codes:
0x80=Device
0x30=Sequence
```
And the format of a CSTA protocol string is:  Integer + Sequence + Length + Device + Length + DeviceAsString + More protocol functions.

e.g.
```
0x02 0x30 0x0c 0x80 0x0a 0x30 0x34 0x36 0x38 0x34 0x38 0x35 0x33 0x38 0x35 .........
```
In this case the length `0x0b` of characters that follow.  0x80.....
`0x80` + length of 10 chars counted in base16, then my old mobile phone number (0468485385) in hex ascii codes.

So in this example CSTA protocol can be decoded by any language that reads those bytes like that.

I presume, similarly with SNMP and our KMD-CC ILP stuff.

Hope this makes sense, and if you can confirm @libscott @libscott

as for dPoW requirements, i'm not familiar with how CC and dPoW are both required.  I think in the case of scaling across assetchains this was the way it was designed for many chains federating.


[10-Jul-18 05:26 AM] libscott#8867
Hi, If youre familiar with bitcoin‚Äôs scriptpubkey and scriptsig, CC provides a condition and a fulfillment which are similar. The first is a cryptographic lock of some kind, the second provides the data which unlocks. CC is a protocol for encoding trees of conditions, which would be a bit impractical to implement in bitcoin‚Äôs scripting language. The condition types are ed25519, secp256k1, preimage, message prefix and threshold (n of m).


[10-Jul-18 05:28 AM] libscott#8867
In addition we implemented an EVAL type so we can extend it with custom functions, to verify cross chain proofs and whatnot.


[10-Jul-18 05:29 AM] libscott#8867
In order for other chains to join our proof system we would need to be notarising them. And implement their transaction type in our code, or vice versa


[10-Jul-18 05:35 AM] libscott#8867
Youre quite limited in what you can do with CC, mainly because of the bitcoin data structure. UTXOs arent a good way to encode an application state, really. But what you can do is copy a payout vector from one chain to another, so you can do cross chain transactions.

As for interop, the interledger protocol is an interchain atomic swap protocol that uses marketmakers. Having CC should make it easier for us to become part of that network.

no i only read the hype about it and thought, ok....bundled swaps.


[10-Jul-18 09:16 PM] Mylo#8306
so would a "simple" execution of CC be something like "is it 3pm yet?" -> send tx


[10-Jul-18 09:17 PM] Mylo#8306
or can you suggest another simple style thing so i can poke around (by asking you more simple questions) üòÉ


[10-Jul-18 09:17 PM] Mylo#8306
or does the scaling stuff have a CC protocol (burn?) to peruse?


[10-Jul-18 09:18 PM] libscott#8867
the burn protocol to send coins across chains is orthoganal to CC.. doesnt really overlap

i'd like if blockchains could be like event loops, where you have a setTimeout function, but i havnt seen that yet üòÑ


[10-Jul-18 09:23 PM] libscott#8867
for the poker protocol we implemented a CC function which was: (EITHER (5 of 5 sigs) OR (1 of 5 sigs AND (timeout AND EVAL("poker"))). So either everyone agreed, or a timeout had to occur and an evaluation function over posted gamestates had to return a certain value...


[10-Jul-18 09:24 PM] libscott#8867
the question is what would we like to be able to do? üòÉ


[10-Jul-18 09:38 PM] Mylo#8306
How about something simple like escrow for 10 blocks and refund back to same address that initially sent.?


[10-Jul-18 09:40 PM] libscott#8867
You can do that! But it requires an eval function. Basically, you'll reject any transaction that doesn't wait the waiting period or has an output address different to the input address. CC EVAL conditions allow you to inspect a transaction, and if it's "wrong" you can reject it.


[10-Jul-18 09:40 PM] libscott#8867
which means you can constrain transactions to those that are "right" given the rules of your application. Not an easy programming model but it works


[10-Jul-18 09:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@libscott  would something like eval function work for account control.  ( restriction of an address ability to send or receive ). ?


[10-Jul-18 10:00 PM] Chipmoon#7477
can CC make DEX smoother/faster?


[10-Jul-18 10:01 PM] libscott#8867
@polycryptoblog Not really, except if your address is a p2sh address... You can't restrict receive, but if the address is a p2sh which contains a CC in the redeemscript then you can achieve some kind of send restriction. Depends on the rules you want

you can use connect=0 then addnode to only the IP's you want.

@jl777c could you please enlighten me on what we re trying to achieve with scaling, as we re spawning lots and lots of chains, what is the purpose. I assume this is linked with the ac_cluster option, but how does the clustering really work, what is the mechanism that will makes it act like the XXXXX chains are not different than just only one ? 
How transacting from one chain to another is done, via atomic swap ? smart contracts ?

It's for educational purpose, and I have to explain this into an upcoming conference, the jumping from one chain to another is a big point I'm not understanding. I understand the clustering, but how, let's say someone from chain A can transact with someone with chain B without acting on the supply, and so, is the global supply linked to the cluster, or on each independent chain of this cluster ?


[14-Jul-18 02:57 AM] jl777c#5810
each cluster builds in the ability to import coins burned from another chain in the cluster


[14-Jul-18 02:58 AM] jl777c#5810
so to go from A -> B (both in the same cluster), you first burn (or lock) the coins in A with a destination of B. Then B can verify that this burn on A was dont properly via the MoMoM mechanism (dont worry about details for a high level explanation), so B then creates new coins that match what was burned in A.


[14-Jul-18 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
reduce A  coin by X, increase B coin by X -> total supply in the cluster remains the same


[14-Jul-18 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it is this burn protocol that is enabled via MoMoM that allows a cluster of chains to act as a single one

Wow ok.. and how fingerprints are sent back to all chains ?


[14-Jul-18 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it is built into the (now extended)notarization process. with each notarization each chain sends in a MoM. That allows the komodod to know and be able to prove all transactions on that chain, and more importantly it can create a MoMoM to also be included in the notarization. This communcation loop is time shifted, so for notarization at time X, the MoM of time X is sent along with MoMoM for time X-1


[14-Jul-18 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a simplification, but I hope gets the idea across. there are some nice graphics that explain this


[14-Jul-18 04:40 AM] sœÜldat#8733
And this communication loop cannot create an overflow of resources that could hinder notarization in a long term ?


[14-Jul-18 04:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The Notary Node Servers are intend to be run not on just single server, but on multiple as I remember from old conversations as the scaling hit to it.


[14-Jul-18 04:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
means each notary node operator will most probably have to manage multiple servers.


[14-Jul-18 04:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
number of notaries will remain same. 64. it's just the resources will be divided into more servers for each.

you could make a custom eval function that queries oracles and controls behavior based on that


[15-Jul-18 03:59 AM] Mylo#8306
EVAL function also on blockheight or any other evaluation (even centralized feed) and then execute accordingly.  CCs don't happen automatically, they must be triggered by a transaction to set them "live" from what i understand.  once they have been started, then the blockheight example will check every block to see if it has the right conditions to be executed.


[15-Jul-18 04:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it does require writing custom functions, but in theory most anything is possible. we are working on a demo of a simple card game as a first step to better understanding the things needed to make CC easier to use


[15-Jul-18 04:05 AM] jl777c#5810
actually, the custom function is part of the consensus rules as all nodes need to validate the outcomes


[15-Jul-18 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
writing consensus code is not for weekend coders, that only leads to troubles. I think we will need to make working templates and then allow people to tweak the parameters and not have to do actual coding. even that is pretty dangerous

anyone can create a new chain with buggy code, but whether people would actually use it, that is up to them


[15-Jul-18 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
remember each custom eval is embedded in a specific independent chain


[15-Jul-18 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
being an independent chain it is independent of all the other chains


[15-Jul-18 04:08 AM] jl777c#5810
so it can destroy itself and no other chain would even know


[15-Jul-18 04:08 AM] jl777c#5810
well, i guess if you were doing atomic swaps with that chain, that is the only impact

having a system that allows anybody to deploy code that affects everybody... this is pretty brave (or insane)


[15-Jul-18 04:13 AM] jl777c#5810
presumably all the chains in the cluster are running the same contracts, so a bug in any one of them is a bug in all of them anyway


[15-Jul-18 04:14 AM] jl777c#5810
though I guess it is possible to run a different set of contracts on different chains in the cluster... so yes, at scale we end up with interaction issues

> `you would have to keep the web page open during swaps though, no way around that`

With the Push API we can wake the client application even when it isn't opened in the browser. The open question so far is whether a network of normal MM2 servers will be able to support a network of web-native MM2 apps. I hope we'll come closer to answering it during the MM2 port.


[28-Jul-18 10:41 PM] jusoaresf#3291
Wouldn't the browser still need to be open (i.e. the session "live") ?


[29-Jul-18 01:58 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
That depends. On mobile any app can be started in background by a Push notification, including the browser-based web apps. (The OS can stop a mobile app any time, so we needed a way to manually kick them up when necessary).
On desktop some browsers would like to do the same ( cf. https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/declare_permissions#background; https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=402456 ).

@Deleted User like NNs could write blockhashes in KV by their id or something, e.g komodopioneers_SH is [37]
so maybe [37_BTC,0349asd9hfisnfiuasnfiuheiufhsiudf] ?  and every NN did that, then we could all read KV.
Or every NN could put block hash of stuff.  And exchanges could sync KV and check against notary network ü§∑ rather than the web api

no not an iguana replacement.  more like a p2p log

instead of this ```  curl -s  https://komodostats.com/api/notary/summary.json  | jq '.[] | select(.ac_name =="CHIPS") | .blockhash'
```
look up KV.  no single point of failure (web api)

I think it would be great if SuperNet and Heat were aiming for more mutual collaboration... Supernet has Agama wallet that covers 95% of all tokens but lacks liquidity. Heatwallet strives to also cover many of the current crypto tokens. Supernet is for anonymity and safety security. Heat is for speed and efficiency. Both are Decentralized exchanges with universal wallets to hold crypto assets. Both offer ICO plans for private use of their tech in private chains. Both Supernet Komodo and Heat Ledger are striving to take over the ICO industry from ETH. Supernet does Decentralized ICOs Dicos... and Heat for Legal security issuances, ICOs, IPOs... The alignment is close to exact in purpose, but in their differences.. Supernet Anonymous, Secure with Dpow, with slow atomic swaps from direct wallet to wallet.... Heat Fast and high speed trading with tokens.
All ICOs on SuperNET and on HeatWallet with their private chains can be exchanged in both heat and agama wallets. Adding liquidity to both platforms.
-----------------
disclosure heat and komodo are in my top 5 holdings ....

@jl777c can crypto conditions be used to automate dividend payments?


[06-Aug-18 10:29 PM] Mylo#8306
a smart contract must be triggered by a transaction.  after it is triggered, whatever you want it to do. 
The comments for this rewards contract may be something of interest to you: https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/rewards.cpp

actually i just read the docs, it's more for locking coins and getting rewarded - not what you're after @ph03nix , apologies.  But the triggering statement still is true üòÉ

like once the barterdex fee account reaches a certain level of kmd, it pays out automagically


[06-Aug-18 11:18 PM] Mylo#8306
ok in that instance, and you can wait for a 'james reply', but you need a tx to trigger the contract.  the contract can then check the balance of another address, and then do an evaluation based on the result of that query.  if > threshold, go into the dividend logic - sure.   providing there is sufficient permissions to unlock the funds from the calling contract, again yeah it's all tx, vins & vouts signed by keys that provide the answers to the cryptographic puzzles.


[06-Aug-18 11:59 PM] jl777c#5810
@Mylo the rewards CC is about locking coins and getting rewarded, since its the rewards contract

{Reactions}

[07-Aug-18 12:01 AM] jl777c#5810
however, what happens after the coins are locked can be literally anything that can be coded. It would be possible to do a dividends contract, but I am a bit nervous about having to get consensus to the satoshi for thousands of payments. If your node is not current, it wont be able to validate it and if there is any problem with the DB it might go out of consensus. Maybe I am just being worried over nothing though as so far all seems to be in sync across the contracts, even after reorgs


[07-Aug-18 12:03 AM] jl777c#5810
The bigger issue with DEX dividend would be the cross chain nature also from a practical point it just seems easier to manually trigger a dividend payout with normal sendmany transactions. then it sidesteps needing to deal with massive tx vector with CC contract


[07-Aug-18 12:04 AM] jl777c#5810
for assets that are getting revenues to a single address, the easiest would just be to collect it in a CC address directly, which would have rules that only a dividend payout is acceptable way of doing a payout

I had a shower thought this morning, Since KMD has privacy on transactions, is there privacy on the asset chains, the smart contracts and information?
What about a partnership with Enigma?  They just released their test net and it would be an amazing logical next step for KMD to really make CryptoConditions take off.


[07-Aug-18 10:10 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts asset chains have all the features of the main KMD chain, such as shielded transactions, zaddrs, z_sendmany/etc


[07-Aug-18 10:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts smart contracts mostly operate on transparent addresses, but part of a smart contract could be "send X to this zaddr", and then the funds are shielded. But the smart contracts themselves, they are stored in the public part of the blockchain


[07-Aug-18 10:11 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So you've got the majority of it covered.  What about shielding the smart contracts?


[07-Aug-18 10:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
James can answer in more detail, but that is how I understand it. I just started working on the test suite + continuous integration for CryptoConditions


[07-Aug-18 10:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I think that would help alot more people feel comfortable with real world transactions of that nature.


[07-Aug-18 10:12 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Enigma is basically doing that, to my knowledge.    Smart contract privacy.


[07-Aug-18 10:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
the final action could be "Send to this zaddr", and that person has privacy. But all the detail of exactly how the smart contract works, needs to be public so the network can read it, verify it, etc


[07-Aug-18 10:13 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I could even offer it to my customers if there was a way to run it through a clearing house to convert their monthly payments to fiat.  A Smart contract for autopay would be fantastic.


[07-Aug-18 10:14 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But the contract has to have shielding, or thats gonna be a hard sell in my real estate world.


[07-Aug-18 10:17 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As a side note, every time I think of KMD I just get excited for the future of blockchain tech and this project in particular.  Keep it up! üé≤


[07-Aug-18 10:26 PM] Mylo#8306
@FishyGuts if you sent me KMD by transparent address, then i sent your customer KMD by z-addr, all that is known is that i sent to an amount to a z-addr.    Replace "i sent" with "contract sends".  Your customer still has privacy.


[07-Aug-18 10:41 PM] FishyGuts#5085
So how does the smart contract work in a case where say, a client signs up for automatic monthly payments?  Is their information for their loan servicing contract kept private?


[08-Aug-18 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
need a bit more details on exactly what the contract needs to do. You can send payments to a CC address and then restrict how it is able to be spent. from what you describe, what is missing is where the funds for the automatic monthly payments comes from. If it is all funded upfront, then it wouldnt be hard at all. the rule for payout would simply be, every month pay address X, a certain amount.  And it would be setup so either your node or the receipient node can collect the monthly payment


[08-Aug-18 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
the current examples are all variations on:
1. create a plan
2. add funds to the plan
3. payout funds the plan according to some specifiic set of rules


[08-Aug-18 01:07 AM] jl777c#5810
I guess we could define a payments CC, where anybody at anytime could create a plan and add funds to it as they have it. Separately, they would create/cancel? autopayments, which would authorize spending funds from the locked amounts


[08-Aug-18 01:08 AM] jl777c#5810
this would allow to collect earnings into a single address and not have to worry about sending payments out


[09-Aug-18 06:47 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I saw this discussed a bit earlier, but I‚Äôm just curious the highest # of connections you‚Äôve seen on a node, and is there anything limiting connections in komodo? I know you estimated around 1000. I started a komodod node with maxconnections=1000 in .conf as well as in net.cpp to see how many I could see, and hardly ever get above 90 connections, which I know there have to be more than that easily. I‚Äôve done the same thing on that server with Verus and have like 875 connections.


[09-Aug-18 06:48 PM] xRobeSx#5136
No big deal, just an experiment.


[09-Aug-18 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
I see 300+ on some nodes, but most komodod wallets default to 8 connections so it isnt highly interconnected, very decentralized

I just downloaded the test release and my OOT won't even show up in Agama Mobile dashboard simply because my OOT address changed.

I tried several possibilities but it looks like my OOT address is no longer connected with my paraphrase. Let's recall that i sended OOT not even 3 weeks ago.  Years of experience in IT Helpdesks but all that won't help me. 
I Feel so stupid all the time...

[14-Aug-18 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
given a cluster of chains with a specific total of coins, if we can allow transferring coins from one chain to another without creating (or losing) coins, then the entire group becomes a single fungible cluster


[14-Aug-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
that is what the burn protocol does


[14-Aug-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
burn it on one chain and import it in another


[14-Aug-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
like a cross chain utxo


[14-Aug-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the input is the burned coins on a different chain


[14-Aug-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
this allows coins to move from any chain to any chain


[14-Aug-18 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
in the fungible group


[14-Aug-18 09:23 AM] Mark81#4505
every chain have their own burn address? On a new chain how coins are created?  Can chain run  out of coins if every coin move to another chain and any ain¬¥t coming to it?


[14-Aug-18 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is no mining, then yes, a chain can run very low on coins

the coins are created via a cross chain utxo


[14-Aug-18 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
you burn the coins via opreturn


[14-Aug-18 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
this creates a "xutxo" that can be used in a specific other chain


[14-Aug-18 09:30 AM] Mark81#4505
Since this technology is in testing phase and not part of komodo chain scaling but would it be possible  to be used in komodo chain? Or would this be more like sidechain scaling technology?


[14-Aug-18 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be prohibitively expensive to do a million KMD tx/sec, that is 6000 KMD  per minute!


[14-Aug-18 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
I think KMD should be where the tx chains are notarized to, and then the txfee on these chains are minimal


[14-Aug-18 09:36 AM] Mark81#4505
Most people that i see discussing this technology are actually thinking that its komodo chain that performs this scaling. They dont realize that it is actually one of tools for developers to have once they come into this ecosystem.


[14-Aug-18 09:38 AM] Mark81#4505
whole scaling debate has made people minds so one blockchain centric that they dont see out of that box.


[14-Aug-18 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it is silly to do million tx on an expensive chain


[14-Aug-18 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
who has a few million to spend just sending a million tx


[14-Aug-18 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810

[14-Aug-18 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
so clearly a different solution is needed


[14-Aug-18 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
also bloating the main chain by TB per hour is probably going to be frowned upon


[14-Aug-18 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
you just cant ignore such "little" details when solving real world usage


[14-Aug-18 09:41 AM] Mark81#4505
How about if kmd chain input would be "burned" and taken into one of tx chains?


[14-Aug-18 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
going to the chain is much easier to do than coming back


[14-Aug-18 09:44 AM] Mark81#4505
how kmd chain would operate differently vs tx chain on that?


[14-Aug-18 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess not much different, just nervous to allow another chain to be 1:1 KMD, since anything that goes wrong on that chain would affect KMD


[14-Aug-18 09:49 AM] Mark81#4505
Yeah of course. Dont play with fire. isolate things and of course if komodo notarizes itself then it would technically notarizing itself through tx chains.


[14-Aug-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it just feels like great care would be needed and we wouldnt do this to a whole bunch of tx chains

a lot of can happen in few minutes and keeping eye on that would technically impossible.

Good day jl777. I have a question. Are you going to release a mobile wallet Komodo and do you plan to do  in the future so that you can pay for goods and services with the  Komodo coin?


[15-Aug-18 03:14 AM] jl777c#5810
I only do core cli code, so I wont be doing any GUI, mobile or otherwise. but others do and there is alreayd a mobile wallet. please let us not ask me about GUI, or exchange support issues, or future BTC price predictions, or politics or religion


[15-Aug-18 03:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@Takoy_Nahal yep, that's not a question for jl777. 

Our dev @pbca26 who coded Agama Wallet also coding Agama Mobile wallet. It works same ways the Agama Desktop wallet works as light weight cryptocurrency wallet.

https://github.com/pbca26/agama-mobile/releases

since it's in progress, you will be using it on your own risk, until we see final stable releases.

In short, work in progress.

There's more to Komodo Wallet. The things I wish to have in a mobile wallets is the capability to make Z transactions. I think for that you should first ask for it's answer from Zcash community, since it will be taken from the parent code fork for Komodo which is Zcash, and I heard some good optimisations and possibility of native mobile z transactions in updates from zcash in coming months. If happens, Komodo users can sure expect the same with such komodo mobile app. üôÇ

what makes UTXO model unsuitable for smart contracts like on ETH? or in other words, why must komodo currently use crypto conditions to develop smart contracts and what are the limitations? forgive me if this question is not even worded correctly.


[15-Aug-18 09:28 AM] butthole.finance#0577
is it that UTXO model can only support value transfer from the contracts whereas smart contracts on ETH can handle state changes?


[15-Aug-18 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
ETH is a balance based system, so it doesnt really have utxo. bitcoin protocol is based on utxo, so it has utxo


[15-Aug-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
CC is a proposed IETF standard, KMD is the first to get it live into a working blockchain. KMD doesnt haveto use it, but since we made it, it seemed like a good idea to use it


[15-Aug-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
CC contracts are turing complete and as such it can handle state transitions or anything else that is needed


[15-Aug-18 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
I think the differences are really more internal than anything else.I did make assets, faucet, rewards and dice CC contracts to demonstrate a hint of what is possible


[15-Aug-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can describe a contract and what state changes it needs to handle, I can write a CC contract to implement it

@jl777c thanks. to further my understanding what are the differences between CC on the komodo platform (not KMD) vs ETH? i was under the impression there were still some limitations for CC on komodo 2.0, but trying to get up to speed on motivations behind CC

I think I remember hearing before about language bindings for CC


[19-Aug-18 04:17 PM] lukechilds#2707
is that correct?


[19-Aug-18 04:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
if so, how would that work?


[19-Aug-18 04:18 PM] lukechilds#2707
would you be able to implement CC smart contracts in high level languages like Python/Ruby/JavaScript etc by importing a CC binding library or using an SDK?


[19-Aug-18 05:34 PM] Mylo#8306
yes, that's correct @lukechilds .  currently only cpp (maybe c as well?).  there is another dev working on python bindings for another set of features, not sure about py-cc at this stage.  i'll ask next time we have a meeting, maybe this week maybe next.  
@butthole.finance where there is a reference CC smart contract called "dice", it is actually an implementation of a popular pattern: "challenge/response", so if you have another type of challenge/response scenario (eg i have a rewarding global maths quiz for children game), this is where i've been told to look as my first port of call re: the challenge/response mechanism.  this is 1 of the 4 initial reference smart contracts - the other is a simple faucet, another tokenized exchange, and lastly rewards for locking up coins (like a masternode, staking style of thing - which i have to be vague about because i haven't looked into it yet)

This is really exciting


[19-Aug-18 05:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
but I can't quite wrap my head around how it can be integrated into a higher level language


[19-Aug-18 05:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
so for example if I was using JS


[19-Aug-18 05:56 PM] lukechilds#2707
with JS bindings


[19-Aug-18 05:57 PM] lukechilds#2707
does my JS code end up being compiled down to some kind of CC compatible byte code?


[19-Aug-18 05:58 PM] lukechilds#2707
or do I actually run a Node.js server and calling the CC lib functions is making some kind of CC TX and broadcasting it to the KMD network?


[19-Aug-18 05:58 PM] lukechilds#2707
or something totally different?

[19-Aug-18 06:22 PM] Mylo#8306
let's just stick to CC for now, not implementing server (nodejs etc.)
CC is binary (hex)  representation of data.  so 0x80 0x02 0x55 0x55 as an arbitrary value, is always that in hex.  It is interpretted by the CC protocol as meaning something.  For this arbitrary example, 0x80 might mean EVAL function, 0x02 might mean the length of the EVAL function and 0x55 0x55 is the value of the 2byte length of the EVAL function.  This is portable across languages because in bytes, it's the same.


[19-Aug-18 06:23 PM] Crypto80#4884
oh sorry, my bad.


[19-Aug-18 06:25 PM] Mylo#8306
The EVAL function/value is the ID of the smart contract: e.g. https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/eval.h#L40 are the currently defined catalogue of smart contracts

[19-Aug-18 06:27 PM] Mylo#8306
As for different languages, not sure how it would work exactly.  Maybe you compile your py/js/go languages down to a compatible shared object that can be loaded by komodod at startup (or with helper rpc command to load said library, like importwallet).  This part is just hocus pocus mylo babble.  You need the realjl777 and ca brains to think this one through üòõ


[19-Aug-18 06:32 PM] Mylo#8306
@lukechilds @Crypto80 
Draft standard: https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-thomas-crypto-conditions-04
It's described using ASN.1 notation which is used in SNMP (network monitoring mibs descriptions) and HL7 medical application protocols.
In both those cases, SNMP endpoints are embedded into equipment (usually low level language) but at the same time applications (and app servers like jboss etc.) can be MIBS for network monitoring information.  HL7 i know less about, but it's so an X-ray machine can talk to the application running on a DRs' computer to display the image which is transported from device to file storage, from file storage to application etc.  and then a related workflow is also tied to HL7 protocol stuff so the time sheet application can bill the patient record accordingly.  and similarly for nurses doing the rounds giving medication etc.


[19-Aug-18 06:33 PM] Mylo#8306
So similarly, once bindings to komodo's implementation of cc is available to other langs, we get lots of cross application, cross blockchain possibilities.... (with engineering work)


[19-Aug-18 06:43 PM] lukechilds#2707
very exciting stuff


[19-Aug-18 06:44 PM] lukechilds#2707
yeah I think I'll need to see an example app to fully grok how it all ties together


[19-Aug-18 06:54 PM] Mylo#8306
contract side is one thing on the server, loaded into komodod.
app side is accessible via rpc.
e.g. faucet rpc https://github.com/imylomylo/komodo-rpc-lib/blob/master/src/faucet/index.js
but the contract is https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/jl777/src/cc/faucet.cpp
faucet.cpp compiles to 0x22 0x50 0x........

your go/py/js serverside stuff smart contract which interacts with blockchain/wallet/transactions/utxo compiled down to 0x22 0x50 0x....... can be loaded by komodo.  it's the same bytes.  just at the high level was written differently, compiled down.

you provide an rpc to your smart contract functions.

app developers use your rpc and smart contract to write apps.

if that makes things a bit clearer.

[19-Aug-18 07:01 PM] Mylo#8306
you don't run a server along with komodod - there is no interactivity with an external server.  your smart contract just was written in a different lang for your own preference, and compiled down to bytes (that could have been written by another language).  "byte code" is the same.
the smart contract interacts with blockchain data/tx/etc.

if you are thinking to poll an external service for data to input into contract stuff, then which node would poll?  which node would insert into blockchain?  this is not the (ideal) architecture for a smart contract blockchain app.   the smart contract relies on blockchain data, so you'd need to find another way to get the data into the blockchain.  if you publish too many times into the blockchain then, which is the authoritative data?  how large would the data bloat the chain. your options for this line of thinking is either via oracle network or something.

that's my 2c.  sorry to flood channel üòÉ


[19-Aug-18 07:06 PM] lukechilds#2707
Oh wait, I think I get it, so I can write my CC in JS e.g an echo function, using the JS bindings, which compiles down to HEX, which I then broadcast to the KMD network (as a special transaction?).

Then I can build a web page that makes RPC requests to a local KMD daemon to interact with the CC. And the RPC request would be something like `{ccaddress: address, command: 'echo', value 'helloworld'}`

Something like that?


[19-Aug-18 07:15 PM] Mylo#8306
Yes something like that.
Except first step.  Yes you compile down.  Yes you then have your node with the CC smart contract you wrote.  But other nodes won't have it to reference except the tx they'll know, but won't know anything to do with it because they haven't got it installed in their node.  Each node then needs your special smart contract.

Might not be relevant to the KMD main chain to know about LukesJSEchoCCSmartContract (i mean it could, but unlikely), but some AC use case your smart contract solves can load your contract at start up - and decentralize/trustless verify the tx on it's own.


[19-Aug-18 07:16 PM] Mylo#8306
And yes, you make an RPC available for app developers to interact with your smart contract üòÉ

What is the reason utxo based smart contracts haven‚Äôt been thought or done by others in industry and what made kmd‚Äôs implementation different as comparison to others?


[19-Aug-18 09:35 PM] Mylo#8306
CC layer allows for smart-UTXO.  bind them to previous transactions (e.g. at creation time) and other types of relationships is my guess.  all on-chain.  so where you may have had two tx in the past and been able to make an app that behaves in a similar way, there was no blockchain binding - only an app that could mimic a what-if-we-could-bind-these-transactions-together-with-some-rules.  we now have these rules (conditions) on chain, instead of some random app developer.


[19-Aug-18 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
currently the CC contracts are done at the source level


[19-Aug-18 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
it is linked in and part of the komodod codebase


[19-Aug-18 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
now, it would be possible to make some sort of dynamic linked library to include external code


[19-Aug-18 11:43 PM] jl777c#5810
this library would have the identical code functions as the current CC contracts. look at faucet.cpp it is 100 lines and not very complex at all


[19-Aug-18 11:43 PM] jl777c#5810
so whatever language that can create compiled code that can be linked into komodod, those are the languages that can be used. I wouldnt recommend interpreted language


[19-Aug-18 11:45 PM] jl777c#5810
and the model now is to make a CC contract that can spawn new instances of it via rpc calls. and to limit any repetitive actions and rather be transaction invoked to get runtime. So for assets CC, you do a tx that locks coins/assets into a special address and the other party spends that tx to complete the trade


[19-Aug-18 11:45 PM] jl777c#5810
let us not get too abstract


[19-Aug-18 11:45 PM] jl777c#5810
let us stick to specific questions on how to do some specific thing.


[19-Aug-18 11:45 PM] jl777c#5810
I think that will then make it much clearer how it all works


[19-Aug-18 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
start by reading faucet.cpp, then rewards.cpp, then dice.cpp and assets.cpp if you are ready for that level of complexity


[19-Aug-18 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
probably we need someone to make onboarding doc to allow a new dev to come up to speed, however it will require knowing how utxo work. so if we can find pre-existing docs about utxo, a new dev can start with that


[19-Aug-18 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
once you understand utxo, then it will become much clearer. if you dont, it will just be confusing

I'm a noob to ETH smart contracts.
Would you say making smart contract on utxo based smart contracts would be easier for developers as compare to making smart contracts on balance based blockchain ?


[21-Aug-18 03:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
As I understand a little, ETH because of not being utxo based looks to be easier. But once a developer gets familiar with the concepts of like
how to make a address
how to generate a raw transaction
how to manage tx inputs/outputs 
that should make them feel easier with crypto conditions ?


[21-Aug-18 03:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
is my assumption correct ?


[21-Aug-18 04:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it will likely always be easier on a balance based system


[21-Aug-18 04:17 AM] jl777c#5810
however with my multipay CC, I will create a balance based system on top of utxo


[21-Aug-18 04:17 AM] jl777c#5810
utxo will be harder to deal with, but much much much safer

what will be the purpose of multipay CC? What will it solve ?


[22-Aug-18 01:16 AM] demols#8610
Could crypto conditions be used for derivative contracts like bitmex so there can be a decentralised bitmex  ?


[22-Aug-18 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
theoretically, yes


[22-Aug-18 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
after the next round of CC contracts are in place it will become much easier. the only issue is that it needs to be a "cash settled" contract and the "cash" would be the coin for the chain the CC runs on. so it would need to run on a chain with actual value and liquidity


[22-Aug-18 02:56 AM] demols#8610
And can barterdex or hyperdex be used to trade contracts ?


[22-Aug-18 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure what you mean about trading contracts


[22-Aug-18 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
you mean transferring an existing position to another party?


[22-Aug-18 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess that would be possible if it was implemented, but it seems simpler just to create the same position?


[22-Aug-18 03:31 AM] demols#8610
Iff i have a long position someone else does have a short position if i want out of the trade i sell my long position to someone else


[22-Aug-18 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is cash settled,so you can just cashout via the blockchain without needing to find someone to buy your position


[22-Aug-18 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
that is assuming we can get a blockchain enforced cash settled system working.


[22-Aug-18 03:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you can cashout without anybody else, why not do that?

Hi James, I'm trying to set up ms wallets on komodo using addresses from multiple wallets. I bump into problems when signing ("error": "Operation not valid with the current stack size"). probably I am missing a step in the process?

In ETH devs can code and push smart contracts on Blockchain.
In KMD so far the code is written and pushed to the Komodo source code adding additional RPC calls. 
Do we expect new model for third party devs which won‚Äôt require code acceptance PR to Komodo git source, or it will remain same?


[23-Aug-18 07:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Or it will be like VerusCoin, to fork Komodo source code and code smart contract in the forked code?


[23-Aug-18 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
once the foundational CC contracts are there, most normal dapps can be done via rpc calls to them


[23-Aug-18 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
which means normal app devs can make dapps


[23-Aug-18 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
long term automatic dividends will be the goal, but it wont be for a while as it isnt quite ready for consensus level revshares. however I could see doing a dice dealer type of realtime dividend. or maybe on-demand where you can request a dividend if it is over a threshold amount, for now I am concentrating on the most powerful set of foundational CC contracts so rpc calls can do as much dapps as possible

Once the multigateway CC is done, along with the prices CC and a special CC for this, then trades could be cash settled in BTC  or KMD or the onchain coin. it will be some months away as I am still at the design stages for the foundational CC contracts. however the scope of these contracts is quite limited and I did get the first four contracts coded in a week, debugged in another week and so far in testing there are no reproducible bugs. All in a one month span

A: my upcoming document will be a good place to start


[24-Aug-18 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
A: assembly language vs higher level language with functionality enhancements, ie. not comparable


[24-Aug-18 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
A: using wasm type of approach, JS can be made into a compiled blob, getting it to play nice with the komodod executable will likely require some tricks. And this is core code, so maybe it is best to stay with an actually compiled language


[24-Aug-18 06:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Q 5: Will it be possible to make CryptoConditions smart contract which work with only SPV clients ?


[24-Aug-18 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[24-Aug-18 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it works at the bitcoin protocol level, so if it is able to work via SPV subset, it would still need to work at the bitcoin protocol level.

[24-Aug-18 06:26 AM] CHMEX#0686
if somebody creates the cryptokitties chain on a assetchain he/she would need to create the kitties DNA in CC which would run on it's own compiled komodod (kittiesd) daemon is that correct?
if that chain is notarized all the notaries would need to run that particular binary / branch.


[24-Aug-18 06:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Q 7: What kinda of smart contracts will need to code the Komodo source code level CryptoConditions which won't be able to do via foundational CryptoConditons smart contract RPC calls ?


[24-Aug-18 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
@CHMEX yes, but with qualifiers. see the next answer


[24-Aug-18 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
The spanning set of rpc contracts possible to be created is based on the rpc extensions the foundational CC contracts have


[24-Aug-18 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so if there is a DNA CC that allows to specify via OPRETURN data the DNA characteristics, then it could well be possible to make a cryptokitties dapp via rpc calls + data

How to write utxo based CryptoConditions contracts for KMD chains
by jl777

This is not the only smart contracts methodology that is possible to build on top of OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITION, just the first one. All the credit for getting OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITION working in the Komodo codebase goes to @libscott. I am just hooking into the code that he made and tried to make it just a little easier to make new contracts.

There is probably some fancy marketing name to use, but for now, I will just call it "CC contract" for short, knowing that it is not 100% technically accurate as the CryptoConditions aspect is not really the main attribute. However, the KMD contracts were built to make the CryptoConditions codebase that was integrated into it to be more accessible.


[24-Aug-18 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
Since CC contracts run native C/C++ code, it is turing complete and that means that any contract that is possible to do on any other platform will be possible to create via CC contract.

utxo based contracts are a bit harder to start writing than for balance based contracts. However, they are much more secure as they leverage the existing bitcoin utxo system. That makes it much harder to have bugs that issue a zillion new coins from a bug, since all the CC contract operations needs to also obey the existing bitcoin utxo protocol.

This document will be heavily example based so it will utilize many of the existing reference CC contracts. After understanding this document, you should be in a good position to start creating either a new CC contract to be integrated into komodod or to make rpc based dapps directly.

Chapter 0 - Bitcoin Protocol Basics
There are many aspects of the bitcoin protocol that isnt needed to understand the CC contracts dependence on it. Such details will not be discussed. The primary aspect is the utxo, unspent transaction output. Just a fancy name for txid/vout, so when you sendtoaddress some coins, it creates a txid and the first output is vout.0, combine it and txid/0 is a specific utxo.

Of course, to understand even this level of detail requires that you understand what a txid is, but there are plenty of reference materials on that. It is basically the 64 char long set of letters and numbers that you get when you send funds.

Implicit with the utxo is that it prevents double spends. Once you spend a utxo, you cant spend it again. This is quite an important characteristic and while advanced readers will point out chain reorgs can allow a double spend, we will not confuse the issue with such details. The important thing is that given a blockchain at a specific height's blockhash, you can know if a txid/vout has been spent or not.

There are also the transactions that are in memory waiting to be mined, the mempool. And it is possible for the utxo to be spent by a tx in the mempool. However since it isnt confirmed yet, it is still unspent at the current height, even if we are pretty sure it will be spent in the next block.

A useful example is to think about a queue of people lined up to get into an event. They need to have a valid ticket and also to get into the queue. After some time passes, they get their ticket stamped and allowed into the event.

In the utxo case, the ticket is the spending transaction and the event is the confirmed blockchain. The queue is the mempool.

The thing thats good about CC is that they easily encode hierarchical M of N structures which is desirable for contract programming. For example, EITHER everyone signs to release OR we do some on-chain arbitration process is a common pattern for off chain state channels.

Chapter 1 - OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITION
In the prior chapter the utxo was explained. However, the specific mechanism used to send a payment was not explained. Contrary to what most people might think, on the blockchain there are not entries that say "pay X amount to address". Instead what exists is a bitcoin script that must be satisfied in order for the funds to be able to be spent.

Originally, there was the pay to pubkey script:
<pubkey> <checksig>

About as simple of a payment script that you can get. Basically the pubkey's signature is checked and if it is valid, you get to spend it. Once problem satoshi realized was that with Quantum Computers such payment scripts are vulnerable! So, he made a way to have a cold address, ie. an address whose pubkey isnt known. At least it isnt known until it is spent, so it is only Quantum resistant prior to the first spend. This line of reasoning is why we have one time use addresses and a new change address for each transaction. Maybe in some ways, this is too forward thinking as it makes things a lot more confusing to use and easier to lose track of all the required private keys.

However, it is here to stay and its script is:
<hash the pubkey> <pubkey> <verify hash matches> <checksig>


[24-Aug-18 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
With this, the blockchain has what maps to "pay to address", just that the address is actually a base58 encoded (prefix + pubkeyhash). Hey, if it wasnt complicated, it would be easy!

In order to spend a p2pkh (pay to pubkey hash) utxo, you need to divulge the pubkey in addition to having a valid signature. After the first spend from an address, its security is degraded to p2pk (pay to pubkey) as its pubkey is now known. The net result is that each reused address takes 25 extra bytes on the blockchain, and that is why for addresses that are expected to be reused, I just use the p2pk script.

Originally, bitcoin allowed any type of script opcodes to be used directly. The problem was some of them caused problems and satoshi decided to disable them and only allow standard forms of payments. Thus the p2pk and p2pkh became 99%+ of bitcoin transactions. However, going from having a fully scriptable language that can create countless payment scripts (and bugs!), to having just 2... well it was a "short term" limitation. It did last for some years but eventually a compromise p2sh script was allowed to be standard. This is a pay to script hash, so it can have a standard format as the normal p2pkh, but have infinitely more flexibility.


[24-Aug-18 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
<hash the script> <script> <verify hash matches>

Wait, something is wrong! If it was just that, then anybody that found out what the required script (called redeemscript) was, they could just spend it. I forgot to say that the redeemscript is then used to determine if the payment can be spent or not. So you can have a normal p2pk or p2pkh redeemscript inside a p2sh script.

OK, I know that just got really confusing. Let us have a more clear example:

redeemscript <- pay to pubkey 
p2sh becomes the hash of the redeem script + the compares

So to spend it, you need to divulge the redeemscript, which in turn requires you to divulge the pubkey. Put it all together and the p2sh mechanism verifies you not only had the correct redeemscript by comparing its hash, but that when the redeemscript is run, it is satisfied. In this case, that the pubkey's signature was valid.


[24-Aug-18 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
If you are still following, there is some good news! OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITION scripts are actually simpler than p2sh scripts in some sense as there isnt this extra level of script inside a scripthash. @libscott implemented the addition of OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITION to the set of bitcoin opcodes and what it does is makes sure that a CryptoConditions script is properly signed.

Which gets us to the CryptoConditions specification, which is a monster of a IETF (Internet standards) draft and has hundred(s) of pages of specification. I am sure you are happy to know that you dont really need to know about it much at all! Just know that you can create all sorts of cryptoconditions and its binary encoding can be used in a bitcoin utxo. If the standard CC contracts dont have the power you need, it is always possible to expand on it. So far, most all the CC contracts only need the power of a 1of1 CC script, which is 1 signature combined with custom constraints. The realtime payment channels CC is the only one of the reference CC contracts so far that didnt fit into this model, it needed a 1of2 CC script.

The best part is that all these opcode level things are not needed at all. I just wanted to explain it for those that need to know all the details of everything.

Chapter 2 - CC contract basics
Each CC contract has an eval code, this is just an arbitrary number that is associated with a specific CC contract. The details about a specific CC contract are all determined by the validation logic, that is ultimately what implements a CC contract.


[24-Aug-18 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
However, unlike the normal bitcoin payments, where it is validated with only information in the transaction, a CC contract has the power to do pretty much anything. It has full access to the blockchain and even the mempool, though using mempool information is inherently more risky and needs to be done carefully or for exclusions, rather than inclusions.

However, this is the CC contract basics chapter, so let us ignore mempool issues and deal with just the basics. Fundamentally there is no structure for OP_CHECKCRYPTOCONDITION serialized scripts, but if you are like me, you want to avoid having to read and understand a 1000 page IETF standard. What we really want to do is have a logical way to make a new contract and have it be able to be coded and debugged in an efficient way.

That means to just follow a known working template and only changing the things where the existing templates are not sufficient, ie. the core differentiator of your CC contract.

In the ~/komodo/src/cc/eval.h file all the eval codes are defined, currently:

#define FOREACH_EVAL(EVAL)             \
        EVAL(EVAL_IMPORTPAYOUT, 0xe1)  \
        EVAL(EVAL_IMPORTCOIN,   0xe2)  \
        EVAL(EVAL_ASSETS,   0xe3)  \
        EVAL(EVAL_FAUCET, 0xe4) \
        EVAL(EVAL_REWARDS, 0xe5) \
        EVAL(EVAL_DICE, 0xe6) \
        EVAL(EVAL_FSM, 0xe7) \
        EVAL(EVAL_AUCTION, 0xe8) \
        EVAL(EVAL_LOTTO, 0xe9) \
        EVAL(EVAL_MOFN, 0xea) \
        EVAL(EVAL_CHANNELS, 0xeb) \
        EVAL(EVAL_ORACLES, 0xec) \
        EVAL(EVAL_PRICES, 0xed) \
        EVAL(EVAL_PEGS, 0xee) \
        EVAL(EVAL_TRIGGERS, 0xef) \
        EVAL(EVAL_PAYMENTS, 0xf0) \
        EVAL(EVAL_GATEWAYS, 0xf1)


[24-Aug-18 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
Ultimately, we will probably end up with all 256 eval codes used, for now there is plenty of room. I imagined that similar to my coins repo, we can end up with a much larger than 256 number of CC contracts and you select the 256 that you want active for your blockchain. That does mean any specific chain will be limited to "only" having 256 contracts. Since there seems to be so few actually useful contracts so far, this limit seems to be sufficient. I am told that the evalcode can be of any length, but the current CC contracts assumes it is one byte. 

The simplest CC script would be one that requires a signature from a pubkey along with a CC validation. This is the equivalent of the pay to pubkey bitcoin script and is what most of the initial CC contracts use. Only the channels one needed more than this and it will be explained in its chapter.


[24-Aug-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
We end up with CC scripts of the form (evalcode) + (pubkey) + (other stuff), dont worry about the other stuff, it is automatically handled with some handy internal functions. The important thing to note is that each CC contract of this form needs a single pubkey and eval code and from that we get the CC script. Using the standard bitcoin's "hash and make an address from it" method, this means that the same pubkey will generate a different address for each different CC contract!

This is an important point, so I will say it in a different way. In bitcoin there used to be uncompressed pubkeys which had both the right and left half combined, into a giant 64 byte pubkey. But since you can derive one from the other, compressed pubkeys became the standard, that is why you have bitcoin pubkeys of 33 bytes instead of 65 bytes. There is a 02, 03 or 04 prefix, to mean odd or even or big pubkey. This means there are two different pubkeys for each privkey, the compressed and uncompressed. And in fact you can have two different bitcoin protocol addresses that are spendable by the same privkey. If you use some paper wallet generators, you might have noticed this.

CC contracts are like that, where each pubkey gets a different address for each evalcode. It is the same pubkey, just different address due to the actual script having a different evalcode, it ends up with a different hash and thus a different address. Now funds send to a specific CC address is only accessible by that CC contract and must follow the rules of that contract.


[24-Aug-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
I also added another very useful feature where the convention is for each CC contract to have a special address that is known to all, including its private key. Before you panic about publishing the private key, remember that to spend a CC output, you need to properly sign it AND satisfy all the rules. By everyone having the privkey for the CC contract, everybody can do the "properly sign" part, but they still need to follow the rest of the rules.

From a user's perspective, there is the global CC address for a CC contract and some contracts also use the user pubkey's CC address. Having a pair of new addresses for each contract can get a bit confusing at first, but eventually we will get easy to use GUI that will make it all easy to use.

Chapter 3 - CC vins and vouts
You might want to review the bitcoin basics and other materials to refresh about how bitcoin outputs become inputs. It is a bit complicated, but ultimately it is about one specific amount of coins that are spent, once spent it is combined with the other coins that are also spent in that transaction and then various outputs are created.

vin0 + vin1 + vin2 -> vout0 + vout1

That is a 3 input, 2 output transaction. The value from the three inputs are combined and then split into vout0 and vout1, each of the vouts gets a spend script that must be satisfied to be able to be spent. Which means for all three of out vins, all the requirements (as specified in the output that created them) are satisfied.

Yes, I know this is a bit too complicated without a nice chart, so we will hope that a nice chart is added here:

[nice chart goes here]

Out of all the aspects of the CC contracts, the flexibility that different vins and vouts created was the biggest surprise. When I started writing the first of these a month ago, I had no idea the power inherent in the smart utxo contracts. I was just happy to have a way to lock funds and release them upon some specific conditions.


[24-Aug-18 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
After the assets/tokens CC contract, I realized that it was just a tip of the iceberg. I knew it was Turing complete, but after all these years of restricted bitcoin script, to have the full power of any arbitrary algorithm, it was eye opening. Years of writing blockchain code and having really bad consequences with every bug naturally makes you gun shy about doing aggressive things at the consensus level. And that is the way it should be, if not very careful, some really bad things can and do happen. The foundation of building on top of the existing (well tested and reliable) utxo system is what makes the CC contracts less likely for the monster bugs. That being said, lack of validation can easily allow an improperly coded CC contract to have its funds drained.

The CC contract breaks out of the standard limitations of a bitcoin transaction. Already, what I wrote explains the reason, but it was not obvious even to me at first, so likely you might have missed it too. If you are wondering what on earth I am talking about, THAT is what I am talking about!

To recap, we have now a new standard bitcoin output type called a CC output. Further, there can be up to 256 different types of CC outputs active on any given blockchain. We also know that to spend any output, you need to satisfy its spending script, which in our case is the signature and whatever constraints the CC validation imposes. We also have the convention of a globally shared keypair, which gives us a general CC address that can have funds sent to it, along with a user pubkey specific CC address.


[24-Aug-18 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
Let us go back to the 3+2 transaction example:

vin0 + vin1 + vin2 -> vout0 + vout1

Given the prior paragraph, try to imagine the possibilities the simple 3+2 transaction can be. Each vin could be a normal vin, from the global contract address, the user's CC address and the vouts can also have this range. Theoretically, there can be 257 * 257 * 257 * 257 * 257 forms of a 3+2 transaction!

In reality, we really dont want that much degrees of freedom as it will ensure a large degree of bugs! So we need to reduce things to a more manageable level where there are at most 3 types for each, and preferably just 1 type. That will make the job of validating it much simpler and simple is better as long as we dont sacrifice the power. We dont.

Ultimately the CC contract is all about how it constrains its inputs, but before it can constrain them, they need to be created as outputs. More about this in the CC validation chapter.

Chapter 4 - CC rpc extensions
Currently, CC contracts need to be integrated at the source level. This limits who is able to create and add new CC contracts, which at first is good, but eventually will be a too strict limitation. The runtime bindings chapter will touch on how to break out of the source based limitation, but there is another key interface level, the RPC.

By convention, each CC contract adds an associated set of rpc calls to the komodo-cli. This not only simplifies the creation of the CC contract transactions, it further will allow dapps to be created just via rpc calls. That will require there being enough foundational CC contracts already in place. As we find new usecases that cannot be implemented via rpc, then a new CC contract is made that can handle that (and more) and the power of the rpc level increases. This is a long term process.

The typical rpc calls that are added <CC>address, <CClist>, <CCinfo> return the various special CC addresses, the list of CC contract instances and info about each CC contract instance. Along with an rpc that creates a CC instance and of course the calls to invoke a CC instance.


[24-Aug-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
The role of the rpc calls are to create properly signed rawtransactions that are ready for broadcasting. This then allows using only the rpc calls to not only invoke but to create a specific instance of a CC. The faucet contract is special in that it only has a single instance, so some of these rpc calls are skipped.

So, there is no MUSTHAVE rpc calls, just a sane convention to follow so it fits into the general pattern.

One thing that I forgot to describe was how to create a special CC address and even though this is not really an rpc issue, it is kind of separate from the core CC functions, so I will show how to do it here:

const char *FaucetCCaddr = "R9zHrofhRbub7ER77B7NrVch3A63R39GuC";
const char *FaucetNormaladdr = "RKQV4oYs4rvxAWx1J43VnT73rSTVtUeckk";
char FaucetCChexstr[67] = { "03682b255c40d0cde8faee381a1a50bbb89980ff24539cb8518e294d3a63cefe12" };
uint8_t FaucetCCpriv[32] = { 0xd4, 0x4f, 0xf2, 0x31, 0x71, 0x7d, 0x28, 0x02, 0x4b, 0xc7, 0xdd, 0x71, 0xa0, 0x39, 0xc4, 0xbe, 0x1a, 0xfe, 0xeb, 0xc2, 0x46, 0xda, 0x76, 0xf8, 0x07, 0x53, 0x3d, 0x96, 0xb4, 0xca, 0xa0, 0xe9 };


[24-Aug-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
Above are the specifics for the faucet CC, but each one has the equivalent in CCcustom.cpp. At the bottom of the file is a big switch statement where these values are copied into an in memory data structure for each CC type. This allows all the CC codebase to access these special addresses in a standard way.

In order to get the above values, follow these steps:
A. use getnewaddress to get a new address and put that in the <CC>Normaladdr = ""; line
B. use validateaddress <newaddress from A> to get the pubkey, which is put into the <CC>hexstr[67] = ""; line
C. stop the daemon and start with -pubkey=<pubkey from B> and do a <CC>address rpc call. In the console you will get a printout of the hex for the privkey, assuming the if ( 0 ) in Myprivkey() is enabled (CCutils.cpp)
D. update the CCaddress and privkey and dont forget to change the -pubkey= parameter

The first rpc command to add is <CC>address and to do that, add a line to rpcserver.h and update the commands array in rpcserver.cpp

In the rpcwallet.cpp file you will find the actual rpc functions, find one of the <CC>address ones, copy paste, change the eval code to your eval code and customize the function. Oh, and dont forget to add an entry into eval.h

Now you have made your own CC contract, but it wont link as you still need to implement the actual functions of it. This will be covered in the following chapters.


[24-Aug-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
Chapter 5 - CC validation
CC validation is what its all about, not the "hokey pokey"!

Each CC must have its own validation function and when the blockchain is validating a transaction, it will call the CC validation code. It is totally up to the CC validation whether to validate it or not.

Any set of rules that you can think of and implement can be part of the validation. Make sure that there is no ambiguity! Make sure that all transactions that should be rejected are in fact rejected.

Also, make sure any rpc calls that create a CC transaction dont create anything that doesnt validate.

Really, that is all that needs to be said about validation that is generic, as it is just a concept and gets a dedicated function to determine if a transaction is valid or not.

For most of the initial CC contracts, I made a function code for various functions of the CC contract and add that along with the creation txid. That enables the validation of the transactions much easier, as the required data is right there in the opreturn.

You do need to be careful not to cause a deadlock as the CC validation code is called while already locked in the main loop of the bitcoin protocol. As long as the provided CC contracts are used as models, you should keep out of deadlock troubles.

I could probably follow along with the instructions, especially if they were laid out in a guide, but I would definitely have to go to outside sources for some terms like "`CCcustom.cpp`".

Chapter 6 - faucet example
Finally, we are ready for the first actual example of a CC contract. The faucet. This is a very simple contract and it ran into some interesting bugs in the first incarnation.

The code in ~/komodo/src/cc/faucet.cpp is the ultimate documentation for it with all the details, so I will just address the conceptual issues here.

There are only 7 functions in faucet.cpp, a bit over 200 lines including comments. The first three are for validation, the last four for the rpc calls to use. 

int64_t IsFaucetvout(struct CCcontract_info *cp,const CTransaction& tx,int32_t v)

bool FaucetExactAmounts(struct CCcontract_info *cp,Eval* eval,const CTransaction &tx,int32_t minage,uint64_t txfee)

bool FaucetValidate(struct CCcontract_info *cp,Eval* eval,const CTransaction &tx)

int64_t AddFaucetInputs(struct CCcontract_info *cp,CMutableTransaction &mtx,CPubKey pk,int64_t total,int32_t maxinputs)

std::string FaucetGet(uint64_t txfee)

std::string FaucetFund(uint64_t txfee,int64_t funds)

UniValue FaucetInfo()


[24-Aug-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
Functions in rpcwallet implement:

faucetaddress fully implemented in rpcwallet.cpp
faucetfund calls FaucetFund
faucetget calls FaucetGet
faucetinfo calls FaucetInfo

Now you might not be a programmer, but I hope you are able to understand the above sequence. user types in a cli call, komodo-cli processes it by calling the rpc function, which in turn calls the function inside faucet.cpp

No magic, just simple conversion of a user command line call that runs code inside the komodod. Both the faucetfund and faucetget create properly signed rawtransaction that is ready to be broadcast to the network using the standard sendrawtransaction rpc. It doesnt automatically do this to allow the GUI to have a confirmation step with all the details before doing an irrevocable CC contract transaction.

faucetfund allows anybody to add funds to the faucet
faucetget allows anybody to get 0.1 coins from the faucet as long as they dont violate the rules.


[24-Aug-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
And we come to what it is all about. The rules of the faucet. Initially it was much less strict and that allowed it to be drained slowly, but automatically and it prevented most from being able to use the faucet. 

To make it much harder to leech, it was made so each faucetget returned only 0.1 coins (down from 1.0) so it was worth 90% less. It was also made so that it had to be to a fresh address with less than 3 transactions. Finally each txid was constrained to start and end with 00! This is a cool trick to force usage of precious CPU time (20 to 60 seconds depending on system) to generate a valid txid. Like PoW mining for the txid and I expect other CC contracts to use a similar mechanism if they want to rate limit usage.

Combined, it became such a pain to get 0.1 coins, the faucet leeching problem was solved. It might not seem like too much trouble to change an address to get another 0.1 coins, but the way things are setup you need to launch the komodod -pubkey=<your pubkey> to change the pubkey that is active for a node. That means to change the pubkey being used, the komodod needs to be restarted and this creates a lot of issues for any automation trying to do this. Combined with the PoW required, only when 0.1 coins becomes worth a significant effort will faucet leeching return. In that case, the PoW requirement can be increased and coin amount decreased, likely with a faucet2 CC contract as I dont expect many such variations to be needed.

Chapter 12 - limitless possibilities
As can be seen, CC contracts can do a wide range of things and since they are Turing complete, we know that this is true. However, what is more important is the added security gained from using a utxo based system. While in some ways it is more complex to have to deal with utxo, as can be seen by the above examples, it is either solved and made invisible at the rpc level, or actually used as part of the solution.

Being utxo based, automatically builds in a rate limit to how many tx per block a specific CC contract can do. The state advancing by one transaction at a time is another means that rate limits. Since more utxo can be made available to increase capacity, it actually offers a way for managing load.

I believe I have made one of the first operational utxo smart contracts, CC or otherwise and hope that there will be many more developers joining forces to create more foundational CC contracts. Feel free to contact me for feedback on the type of CC contract you want to make. I have not documented all my notes and it could well be I already sort of know how to implement what your want your CC contract to do. Just only so many I can actually make time to code and debug.

Our testing cycle went a lot faster than expected as the bugs found were few and far between. Considering the scope of the assets CC and the realtime response aspects of dice CC, this was quite unexpected. I can only attribute it to the fact that CC validation is just the final validation on top of all the standard bitcoin protocol validations. Not having to worry about double spends is sure a nice luxury, though dont get too complacent about chain rewrites! It is possible to wait for information to be divulged and then reorg the chain to take advantage of this knowledge in a chain which is rewound.

Yes, blockchains are complicated.

Chapter 13 - different languages
The current codebase is integrated into the komodod codebase, which is C/C++. However, it is possible to use different languages and integrate into the C/C++ as zcash has shown by using the rust language for some parts of the zcashd.

I think any language that is compiled and can create a linkable library while being able to call and be called by C/C++ functions can be used. If you are able to make such a language binding for a simple CC contract like faucet, this will be good for a 777 KMD bounty. Of course, you need to be the first to submit a properly working pull request.


[24-Aug-18 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
Chapter 14 - runtime bindings
Once build time linking works, then it is one step away from being able to do runtime linking, ie. dynamically linked libraries. There will be some work required to prevent duplication of eval codes and making sure it is a valid version of the CC contract plugin, but these are issues that have been solved before and I dont see any reason they cant be solved for CC contracts.

This would open up the door for quite an interesting ecosystem of CC plugins that blockchains can subscribe to.

Chapter 15 - rpc based dapps
Ultimately, I expect there to be so many new rpc calls (one set from each CC contract), that virtually any dapp can be made with rpc calls. We are just at the beginning now, but it is just a matter of time when we get there.

For now, we just need to keep listening to what the market wants as far as dapps go. Then make a new CC contract that enables doing as many of those as possible.

Repeat...

Imagine the scope that will exist after a year or two of continuous new CC contracts being created, along with all the rpc based dapps. I have seen some automatic GUI generators and it could be that for most cases, there can be a special GUI that not only create the dapp's GUI, but also all the rpc calls that are needed to make it work the way it is customized.

This codebase and tools in between the GUI and the rpc level will be a very good area for new initiatives.

##########

Conclusion
I hope this document has helped you understand what a Komodo utxo based CC contract is and how it is different from the other smart contracts. If you are now able to dive into the cc directory and start making your own CC contract, then I am very happy!

Chapter 7 - rewards example
The next CC contract in complexity is the rewards CC contract. This is designed to capture what most people like about masternodes, without anything else, ie. the rewards!

The idea is to allow people to lock funds for some amount of time and get an extra reward. We also want to support having more than one rewards plan at a time and to allow customization of plan details. One twist that makes it a bit unexpected is that anybody should be able to unlock the funds that were locked, as long as it ends up in the locking address. The reason for this is that SPV servers want to be supported and while locking can be done via normal sendrawtransaction, it requires a native node to do the unlocking. By allowing anybody to be able to unlock, then there can be a special node that unlocks all locked funds when they are ready. This way, from the user's point of view, they lock the funds and after it is matured, it reappears in their wallet.

The above requirements leads us to using the global CC address for the rewards contract to lock the funds in. That allows anybody to properly sign the unlock, but of course that is not enough, we need to make sure they are following all the unlock requirements. Primarily that the funds go back to the locking address.


[27-Aug-18 02:52 AM] jl777c#5810
The four aspects of the rewards plan that are customizable are:
APR, minseconds, maxseconds, mindeposit

This allows each plan to set a different APR (up to 25%, anything above is becoming silly), the minimum time funds must be locked, the maximum time they are earning rewards and the minimum that can be deposited.


[27-Aug-18 02:52 AM] jl777c#5810
So the tx that creates the rewards plan will have these attributes and it is put into the OP_RETURN data. All the other calls will reference the plan creation txid and inherit these parameters from the creation tx. This means it is an important validation to do, to make sure the funding txid is a valid funding txid.

Since it is possible that the initial funding will be used up, there needs to be a way for more funding to be added to the rewards plan.

Having multiple possible rewards plans means it is useful to have rpc calls to get information about them. Hence: rewardslist returns the list of rewards creation txids and rewardsinfo <txid> returns the details about a specific rewards plan.

A locking transaction sends funds to the rewards CC address, along with a normal (small) tx to the address that the unlock should go to. This allows the validation of the proper unlocking.

Chapter 8 - assets example
In some respects the assets CC is the most complex, it was actually the first one that I coded. It is however using a simple model, even for the DEX functions, so while it is quite involved, it does not have the challenge/response complexity of dice.

There are two major aspects to creating tokens. First is to create and track it, down to every specific satoshi. The second is solving how to implement DEX functions of trading assets.

The model used is "colored coins". This means that the token creating txid issues the assets as denoted by all the satoshis, so locking 1 COIN issues 100 million tokens. This multiplication will allow creation of plenty of assets. We want to preserve all the tokens created across all allowed operations. The way this is achieved is that all operations attaches the token creation txid in its OP_RETURN, along with the specified operation.


[27-Aug-18 03:33 AM] jl777c#5810
Ownership of tokens are represented by the colored satoshis in the CC address for the user's pubkey. This allows using the standard utxo system to automatically track ownership of the tokens. This automatic inheritance is one of the big advantages of utxo CC contracts that compensates for the slightly more work needed to implement a CC contract.

So now we have the standard CC addresss, list and info commands that provide the CC addresses, list of all tokens and info on specific tokens and the ability to create and transfer tokens. Any amount of tokens can be created from 1 to very large numbers and using standard addressbalance, addressutxo type of commands, the details of all assets owned can be determined for a specific pubkey.

Now we can solve the DEX part of the tokenization, which turns out to be much simpler than initially imagined. We start with bidding for a specific token. Funds for the bid are locked into the global CC address, along with the desired token and price. This creates a bid utxo that is able to be listed via an orderbook rpc call. To fill the bid, a specific bid utxo is spent with the appropriate number of assets and change and updated price for the unfilled amount. if the entire amount is filled, then it wont appear in the orderbook anymore.

asks work by locking assets along with the required price. Partial fills can be supported and the rpc calls can mask the utxo-ness of the funds/assets needed by automatically gathering the required amount of funds to fill the specific amount.


[27-Aug-18 03:33 AM] jl777c#5810
With calls to cancel the pending bid or ask, we get a complete set of rpc calls that can support a COIN-centric DEX. 

In the future, it is expected that a token swap rpc can be supported to allow directly swapping one token for another, but at first it is expected that there wont be sufficient volumes for such token to token swaps, so it was left out of the initial implementation.

With just these rpc calls and associated validation, we get the ability to issue tokens and trade them on a DEX!

Chapter 9 - dice example
The dice CC contract is actually more complex in the sequences required than the assets/tokens CC. The reason is the need for realtime response by the dealer node, but also having a way to resolve bets if the dealer node is not online. The dice CC contract shows how to build in such a challenge/response mechanism, which likely will be very useful for many other realtime interactive CC contracts.

First, let us describe the issues that the dice CC contract needs to solve. Foremost is that it needs to be random and fair. It should also have realtime response and a fallback timeout in case the realtime response doesnt happen. As with the rewards CC contract, multiple dice plans are supported. Each plan can be customized as to the following:  minbet, maxbet, maxodds, timeoutblocks

This allows each plan to control the risk exposure and also advertises to everyone when dicebets expire and a timeout win


[27-Aug-18 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
can be claimed. In event the dealer node does not process a dicebet in time, in order to prevent dealer nodes from simply not responding to dicebets that they lose, a timeout must go to the dicebet player. A short timeframe means that the dealer would need to be running multiple redundant nodes to make sure they can respond in time. If the timeout is set to long, then many players would prefer to use a different dice plan with a shorter timeout.

Now to describe how to ensure a proper random number that is fair. The method chosen was for the dealer node to create transactions with hash of their entropy in the OP_RETURN. Then the dicebet player would select a specific entropy tx and include their (unhashed) entropy to their OP_RETURN. This allows the dealer node to immediately determine if the dicebet won or lost. If the dicebet included the hash of the bettor entropy, then another step would be needed. However, doing so would allow some timeouts to end with a refund, rather than an automatic win for the dicebet player.


[27-Aug-18 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810
One additional technique used to keep all required data on the blockchain is the dealer entropy value calculation. The vin0 txid is used as one of the privkeys to calculate a shared secret and then hashed to remove links to the original privkey. This method allows recreating the dealer's entropy value (by the dealer node) given the blockchain itself, which means there is no need for any local storage.

This allows the dealer node to recreate the unhashed entropy value used and so when the dicebet transaction is seen (in the mempool!), the dealer node can immediately determine if it is a winner or a loser. This is done by creating a dealer hash vs. a bettor hash via:

dealer hash: SHA256(dealer entropy + bettor entropy)
bettor hash: SHA256(bettor entropy + dealer entropy)

The same values are used, but in different order. The resulting hashes are compared arithmetically for 1:1 bets and the standard industry use is used for the higher odds: https://dicesites.com/provably-fair

The dealer creates a dice plan and then also needs to create entropy transactions. Each win or loss that creates change also creates entropy transactions by the dealer, but timeout transactions wont as it needs to be created by the dealer node to prevent cheating. The dealer tx are locked into the global dice CC address, as is the dicebet transaction, which selects a specific entropy tx to "roll" against. Then the dicefinish process by the dealer will spend the dicebet outputs either all to itself for a loss, or the winning amount to th dice bettor's address. For dicebets that are not dicefinish'ed by the dealer, anybody is able to do a timeout completion.

 vout.3: change to fundingpk
 vout.n-1: opreturn 'W' sbits fundingtxid hentropy proof

timeout:
 same as winner, just without hentropy or proof

WARNING: there is an attack vector that precludes betting any large amounts, it goes as follows:
 1. do dicebet to get the house entropy revealed
 2. calculate bettor entropy that would win against the house entropy
 3. reorg the chain and make a big bet using the winning entropy calculated in 2.

 In order to mitigate this, the disclosure of the house entropy needs to be delayed beyond a reasonable reorg depth (notarization). It is recommended for production dice game with significant amounts of money to use such a delayed disclosure method.

In https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/FSM/src/cc/CC%20made%20easy#L197 you refer to a deadlock.  Which I'm finding hard to picture...i guess an infinite loop, or some other programming error.

The <CC>Validate function returns a bool.  Whilst in there doing your custom validation rules, don't get caught in a "deadlock", because some-fundamental-blockchain-process is going on.   Must return true/false.

What is the PreventCC function in CCutils.cpp doing?

Constraining txid to start/end with 00.  Neat trick.

there is no need to add the JSON to coins again. there is also merge conflict


[28-Aug-18 06:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
now resolved


[28-Aug-18 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
but you are adding the same JSON again at the end of the coins file

to verify the ztransactions!


[29-Aug-18 04:14 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody will have any idea about anybody else's coins, but can be assured it is valid and verified by the blockchain


[29-Aug-18 05:08 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, waiting for someone to launch such a chain, it will be quite interesting. the blockreward is the only source of coins that are visible, so it will have some utxo

would trading that on barterdex be possible?


[29-Aug-18 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[29-Aug-18 05:23 AM] jorian#4555
so it will be a chain on its own, basically. can't a centralized exchange work though?


[29-Aug-18 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
if the central exchange accepts ztransaction deposits and sends out ztransaction withdraws, it can work


[29-Aug-18 05:27 AM] jorian#4555
exactly


[29-Aug-18 05:28 AM] jl777c#5810
but that is only because they havent implemented zaddresses


[29-Aug-18 05:28 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing stops them


[29-Aug-18 05:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
CC on z tx only chain would be really cool!


[29-Aug-18 05:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Any ideas anyone has of usecase?


[29-Aug-18 05:30 AM] jl777c#5810
CC works on transparent vins/vouts


[29-Aug-18 05:30 AM] jl777c#5810
how?


[29-Aug-18 05:30 AM] jl777c#5810

üÜó 

[29-Aug-18 05:30 AM] jl777c#5810
and zaddresses are only known to each node


[29-Aug-18 05:30 AM] jl777c#5810
so you want a CC contract to somehow get chainwide consensus on private info only on some node's wallet.dat, in a different chain


[29-Aug-18 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
sure sounds like magic would be required


[29-Aug-18 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
well, it would be possible, just not anything that has been done yet


[29-Aug-18 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
but it cant get consensus


[29-Aug-18 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe it isnt even possible


[29-Aug-18 05:34 AM] jorian#4555
so this chain would be completely private, with only block rewards as public info. these then 'disappear' into z-addresses


[29-Aug-18 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[29-Aug-18 05:34 AM] jorian#4555
it is what a lot of people complained about in the zcash vs monero debate, that zcash didn't force z-transactions


[29-Aug-18 05:34 AM] jorian#4555
now there is a chance to do it anyways


[29-Aug-18 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
likely a practical way is via human escrow

what would be the advantage of a zk-snarks coin over monero?

[29-Aug-18 05:44 AM] jorian#4555
i wonder how much of KMD is shielded


[29-Aug-18 05:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the docs don't have the example of different ways of creating blockchain.
I remember James also gave those examples when he mentioned the assetchain params as he developed


[29-Aug-18 05:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
does anyone has those?


[29-Aug-18 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
Maybe a gateway coin that is all private will be good


[29-Aug-18 05:57 AM] jorian#4555
ah: ```Zcash: offers the best anynomity set of the three. When you make a Z to Z transaction it is hidden among every private Z transaction ever made at the time of the transaction and into the future. (This is not to be confused with Zcash's public T addresses which offer no anynomity, or Z-T, or T-Z which show the transparent side if the transaction)```

or in case not, can @jl777c please give me the set for creating BTC exactly assetchain ?


[29-Aug-18 05:57 AM] jorian#4555
it's all in the docs


[29-Aug-18 05:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm reading it, but it's without exact command examples


[29-Aug-18 05:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I remember you gave the example command to make exact BTC mining assetchain


[29-Aug-18 05:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm thinking to make an experiment chain which is z tx only


[29-Aug-18 05:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
want it to be exactly as BTC


[29-Aug-18 05:59 AM] jorian#4555
bitcoin behavior would be -ac_reward=5000000000 -ac_halving=210000
KMD behavior would be -ac_reward = 300000000 -ac_end=7777777


[29-Aug-18 05:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
`./komodod -ac_name=HIDDEN -ac_reward= 5000000000 -ac_halving=210000 -ac_private=1 `


[29-Aug-18 06:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
had this thought for a moment, but I coiuldn't think of usecase


[29-Aug-18 06:00 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
gateway like other chains do the CC contracts but end up on a z tx only chain ü§î


[29-Aug-18 06:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
since we have the capability to do cross blockchain contracts


[29-Aug-18 06:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but missing pieces here are z tx enabled CC


[29-Aug-18 06:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
at least an example hasn't been written as I know


[29-Aug-18 06:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hmm.... yeah thought again... üòÑ won't happen


[29-Aug-18 06:02 AM] jl777c#5810
meaning each coin in the HIDDEN chain is 1:1 convertible to some external coin


[29-Aug-18 06:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes James, something like that


[29-Aug-18 06:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
with sapling activated such assetchain we can have it hopefully on mobile too


[29-Aug-18 06:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so a z tx only chain for a mobile wallet! üòé


[29-Aug-18 06:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but need to figure out the usecase üòÑ


[29-Aug-18 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
there would need to be a MGW type of system


[29-Aug-18 06:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like BTC this HIDDEN Chain having :
total supply of 21,000,000 coins,
halving every 2 years/210,000 blocks,
block mining time of about 10 minutes,
starting with 0 pre-mine, so all can mine it,
z tx only chain, no public tx other than mined utxos.


[29-Aug-18 06:08 AM] jorian#4555
i don't think it's 10 minutes


[29-Aug-18 06:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
while we'll have this, we can think of it's usecase while playing with it


[29-Aug-18 06:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in LN the LN happen offline, and settle on BTC chain.
I think of assetchains, as like whatever tx happens there and kinda somehow settle on this HIDDEN Chain....
just a raw thought... ü§î


[29-Aug-18 06:11 AM] jorian#4555

@jorian I yet to reset my hetzner, can use that soon for IP


[29-Aug-18 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt need to match all of BTC aspects, just as long as 1:1 is ensured


[29-Aug-18 06:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
right....


[29-Aug-18 06:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so what will it be then... a smart 1:1 only chain ü§î


[29-Aug-18 06:15 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
a burn protocol chain


[29-Aug-18 06:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like it having 0 or lil more than 0 coins initially,
but if other chain send it's tx to it, it creates those and if sends back those are burned


[29-Aug-18 06:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like that? ü§î


[29-Aug-18 06:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I know no contracts.... but then how will it be 1:1 ?


[29-Aug-18 06:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for me identity and reputation. these two are fascinating in blockchain tech


[29-Aug-18 06:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I want to see it solved on komodo tech


[29-Aug-18 06:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@jorian give me the command to start the chain


[29-Aug-18 07:46 AM] jorian#4555
can you try `./komodod -ac_name=HIDDEN -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=500000000 -ac_halving=2100000 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225 &`


[29-Aug-18 07:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
you will need to divide the supply and blockreward by 10, because the blocktimes are 1mins not 10min


[29-Aug-18 07:47 AM] jorian#4555
there is no initial supply


[29-Aug-18 07:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
halving and blockreward then is it?


[29-Aug-18 07:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
either way the amount of coins per block


[29-Aug-18 07:47 AM] jorian#4555
isn't it times 10 then?


[29-Aug-18 07:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe its reward divide by ten and halving x 10


[29-Aug-18 07:48 AM] jorian#4555
yes


[29-Aug-18 07:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so the same command or you changing ?


[29-Aug-18 07:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
if you want same as BTC you need to times halving by 10 and divide block reward by 10


[29-Aug-18 07:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
`./komodod -ac_name=HIDDEN -ac_supply=0 -ac_reward=5000000000 -ac_halving=2100000 -ac_private=1 -addnode=136.243.102.225 &`


[29-Aug-18 07:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
50 * 100,000,000 = 5000000000
21,000,000 / 10 = 2100000


[29-Aug-18 07:52 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jorian you have to start fresh, as reward is adding 1 more 0


[29-Aug-18 07:52 AM] Deleted User#0000

bitcoin style mining, but in minutes instead of 10 minutes


[29-Aug-18 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
mimicing BTC coin emission doesnt seem to make much sense

a KMD style is fine too, right


[29-Aug-18 07:55 AM] jorian#4555
without any premine


[29-Aug-18 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
i think just having enough block reward so there are miners, not much else matters for testing purpose


[29-Aug-18 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
at first it would need to be a trusted manual gateway that handles redeems and such, but if the mining reward is big, it will be diluting any external peg


[29-Aug-18 07:57 AM] jorian#4555
how about we call it MOLE


[29-Aug-18 07:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

256 isn't allowed either, you have to subtract 0.0001 for the fee. so 255.9999 works

it seems similar to DCR tickets, just with a more fun name bees/hive


[31-Aug-18 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
In DCR you purchase a ticket, which then can vote on a PoW block, it lasts for a finite time, during which it can vote and voting earns some DCR


[31-Aug-18 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810
creating a time limited PoS mechanism on top of a PoW, maybe it is a bit different than other things and not sure how these bees will prevent the attacker from having their own hive of bees

maybe the machine economy would be where machines earn money on their own, then if they spend it, it is ok

replay protection is about protecting the users for a planned chain split

it seems there is no concern over users


[02-Sep-18 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
I will refrain from using BCH until dust settles. hopefully the sum of the two will be about what BCH is now, but likely over time it will degrade. it almost never makes sense to split something into weaker pieces

[02-Sep-18 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
hard to predict. i doubt the two BCH forks will add up to much more than current BCH price

any coin that relies on masternodes to lock up supply and inflate prices... it seems it is on shaky ground and its price could be quite unstable. I made the rewards CC that does the locking up of funds in exchange for rewards, so chains have the option to do this

Hi guys. I would like to know if komodo platform is suitable for my project kryptoloop.com

Based on peoples accuracy of prediction they gain reputation/points, which these points can then be used to cash out in a native token. (the reason for the reputation not being directly converted into token is a logistical, legal reasoning).

So what is needed is a chain with:
- Almost zero or zero tx fees
- Hi volume of tx/s

The reason for putting the idea on the blockchain, is to be able to prove immutably that people have earned their reputation without cheating the system.

Thank you for your time. please tag me if you reply


[03-Sep-18 02:15 AM] jl777c#5810

@jl777c to be honest, what i am dealing with is that: 

- Have a client, with a good working product
- The client wants to know what blockchain platform to approach and use for his project.

I have not gone through this procedure before, and i assumed each platform would have some sort of business ambassador to help people like me through such a process

Somewhat of a rhetorical question: Why do you think the media (and many in the crypto community) pay no attention to the power of Bitcoin's security coupled with storing a hash of something important and verifiable in OP_RETURN. 2nd Question: Any idea if KMD's Dpow is the largest external business process using OP_RETURN?

@jl777 Hmmm, I have trouble believing it's that close. I don't think we will get there in our lifetime, it's possible tho. What are your reasons for believing we are so close? @Deleted User I feel like we should all choose to live forever just by looking at game theory. We are not sure what happens after death. We can somewhat guess that there will be eternal life due to technology tho. It seems more likely than an afterlife. My guess is this, we will live forever and be the masters of our own individual realities. We will then get "bored" of being god and having control so we "die" by giving up everything we had (infinite power) and going into a decentralized reality. One where there is a consensus on the rules and you don't have full control. Is it possible that we are part of a human/computer- conciousness blockchain of sorts?

Every cell and atom of the body has an existence beyond the cessation of the beat of the heart, biochemically the processes of disintegration actually accelerates metabolic activity in the body after death. Each one of these individual units atoms, cells and molecules goes on beyond the dissolution of the corpse to be re embodied as another creature or another form of life, why would not the higher psychological entity that inhabited the body not continue on to live once more, the more ethereal a being the more eternal, the more material the being the more finite.

@jl777c i was testing rpc libs last week - for the architecture of dapps.
currently
```
[webpage]<------->[local OR remote proxy server]<------->[KMD RPC]
works
```
however
```
[local webpage]<------>[local KMD daemon] 
does not
```
and the reason is web browser has CORS error when talking to local daemon directly.

`geth` (ethereum client) has a command line argument --rpccorsdomain [1]

Would it be possible to add a similar setting in komodod.conf so  komodod will allow web browsers to connect to kmd rpc directly.

It's the CORS pre-flight check which needs support [2].  Browsers automatically send these HTTP OPTIONS requests, which rely on the server side to respond with the cross-origin "access-control-allow-origin" and "access-control-allow-methods" and "access-control-max-age".  Otherwise current dapp architecture i think would be limited to proxy-requests either by sending requests through to an intermediary on the same host as the daemon (could be same machine, but just adds the "backend" to connect to from a web application).

Lots of Info about CORS here [3] in case you're not familiar.

[05-Sep-18 06:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
@jl777c Working on documentation, trying to clarify things.

The following is the current text. It's an example for the `getaddressbalance` method.
```
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getaddressbalance", "params": [{"addresses": ["12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX"]}] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:7771/
```
This general idea is repeated throughout the documentation.

Is this for executing on a remote server? Or are there circumstances where I would execute this locally?


[05-Sep-18 06:29 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Is this a leftover from the Zcash documentation?


[05-Sep-18 06:39 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Also, is there a limit to how many addresses can be requested in `getaddressbalance`?


[05-Sep-18 09:48 PM] gcharang#6833
```
> komodo-cli getaddressbalance '{"addresses": ["12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX"]}'
> curl --user myusername --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "getaddressbalance", "params": [{"addresses": ["12c6DSiU4Rq3P4ZxziKxzrL5LmMBrzjrJX"]}] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:7771/
```
both are equivalent. But `./komodo-cli` is easier to use while a person is accessing the node through a terminal or using shell scripts.
The curl command can be used both locally or remotely(with the appropriate settings and permissions). The rpc interface is mainly for writing other programs(ex:wallets that need GUI) that access komodod

Hmm, interesting. I'm about to go to bed. Will need to pick this up again tomorrow.

Would it be possible to run the marketmaker on mobile phones (with the current marketmaker). And/or would it be possible to have a simplified version of the marketmaker, that works on mobile?

Assuming the answer is yes, that governments will utilize blockchain tech someday in some way, do you foresee government entities emulating KMD (or using KMD) and notarizing to BTC for accountability to citizens/validity purposes or more likely going to roll their own solutions not connected to any existing public blockchain.

HI! how far we from zk-snark micropayment channels like z-channel or bolt proposals ?


[12-Sep-18 02:18 AM] jl777c#5810
until fiat implements hashlocks and timelocks, you cant atomic swap with it, so how could there be barterdex support?


[12-Sep-18 02:19 AM] jl777c#5810
i am not clear on the exact definition differences between security token, utility token, cryptocoin. KMD is a crypto coin, it allows to create both security tokens and other cryptocoins and utility tokens


[12-Sep-18 02:20 AM] jl777c#5810
we are not working on zksnark micropayments, but we have in development a channels CC

Chips does use CC already its in the CHIPS code.


[13-Sep-18 10:52 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
Channels have nothing to do with replacing CHIPS but I think they could be used in place of LN for the same purpose, that is creating temporary gaming tables for CHIPS


[14-Sep-18 01:01 AM] jl777c#5810
channels isnt LN, it is dPoW secured mempool transactions. So it is backward compatible with existing infrastructure, but it is all onchain tx, not offchain. So it is different solution and wont help with scaling

we aren't holding a dico. it's a normal ICO with kyc. One of our partners is interested in barterdex tech and we are discussing ways of adding a KYC layer to BarterDEX. We still need a proof of concept.


[14-Sep-18 09:40 AM] PTYX#6840
the concept is simple though. You whitelist an address and make sure that your BOB doesn't trade with any addresses that aren't whitelisted.


[14-Sep-18 09:41 AM] PTYX#6840
the whitelisting process would involve various apis depending on your KYC provider.

I have a question about the burn protocol for cross-chain tx, I read that Notary Nodes are the ones checking and providing the proofs for this to work. The inner details are of beyond my understanding but do you see it possible in future to use CryptoConditions to blockchain-enforce such cross-chain tx? Without NN having to play a part


[17-Sep-18 04:57 AM] jl777c#5810
NN post the merkle roots to the chains during the notarization process. they are not involved in creating the proofs


[17-Sep-18 04:57 AM] jl777c#5810
NN notarized


[17-Sep-18 04:57 AM] jl777c#5810
using that notarization, the node doing the cross chain can create the proofs


[17-Sep-18 04:58 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont see how we can keep notarizing without NN


[17-Sep-18 04:58 AM] jl777c#5810
so I think your assumption is incorrect


[17-Sep-18 04:58 AM] jl777c#5810
however, gateways CC uses the oracles CC to get merkle roots onchain and that doesnt involve notary nodes, just the multisig signer nodes

I've been reading about the Komodo CryptoConditions. Congratulations! It looks to me like a very powerful technology. My question, which I've not found answered in any of the current texts, is: How a zk-snark transactions can be used with UTXO based smart contracts? Is there any way with the current implementation?


[20-Sep-18 02:21 AM] d3n#0940
Of course I'm thinking on privacy powered Voting system. For such thing we need mainly:
+ A way to sign claims (like address X is able to vote). This might be achieved by just adding a signed claim to a blockchain  block
+ A way to create a temporary assetchain. This seems that can be avhieved using CryptoConditions
+ A way to use this temporary assetchain tokens from a Zk-snark transactions which will have the voting option encapsuled in MeMo field

Can patreon.com be replicated via cc? It needs an address1 for the creator which will receive payments in regular intervals(1 month/1 week) and address2 for each donor that will hold funds to be sent to all the creators the donor wishes

Also oracle cc can be used to replicate the pay per video/music/blog post produced model

[21-Sep-18 03:45 AM] gcharang#6833
Model1: Content creator posts address ---> Donor will tell his dapp send this creator 1 KMD every month

Model2: Content creator posts address + somehow notifies the that he has produced a new  video --> Donor tells his dapp to send the creator 10 KMD for each video produced

these are what are happening at a high level

I see similar behaviour from brc core in terms of backwards api compatibility which we had with nxt.
In your opinion could this be an issue for dPoW somehow? I know we make it with custom raw tx, but still I wonder at what level we may have issues with btc core, if any.

when we say 1-month expiration for interest do we mean 30 days or X blocks? thinking if i should look into an optimal claiming or just do it at random


[22-Sep-18 07:41 AM] snowdamn#2414
within the month

Hello! I have a simple question that might appear pointless, but I must know the answer to.
Is JL777 obsessed with reptiles? I'm asking as an amateur myself. I love the Komodo project and the reptile references are really fun.


[24-Sep-18 11:42 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
being in this community for so long and have many interactions with jl777 during this time, I'd say the reptile names isn't an obsession.


[24-Sep-18 11:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it all started with a project evolving to new iteration/version and naming it to "iguana"


[24-Sep-18 11:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
we did not had any official cryptocurrency which was made by jl777, there was NXT that jl777 made project on top of, and there was BTCD, which was created by another developer and jl777 joined him help this coin.


[24-Sep-18 11:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Komodo got many technologies jl777 built in "iguana" and it's earlier codebase versions which derived from MultiGateway tech and it's related required parts of evolving code and various different ideas.


[24-Sep-18 11:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and since Komodo was from lizard family, the project's sub features also got names from the same theme


[24-Sep-18 11:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like Basilisk, Agama, etc.

hey jl777 just wondering what're your thoughts on alternative mining algorithms? Obviously PoW is proving to be solid and mixed with dPoW is even better. But I'm curious on what you think Komodo providing additional mining algorithms to be available for KMD ACs (already have PoS and hybrid, as well as MN using nlocktime).


[25-Sep-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
support for other hashing algo will come with verus pull request


[25-Sep-18 03:15 PM] Regnar#6164
You mean the VerusHash algorithm?


[25-Sep-18 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
specifically, but it adds support for changing of hashalgo


[25-Sep-18 03:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the first one is always the most work, adding a second, third, should be much simpler to do


[25-Sep-18 03:17 PM] jl777c#5810
I dont think many appreciate just how much new territory VRSC has achieved


[25-Sep-18 03:22 PM] Regnar#6164
It's definitely impressive, and the most recent spotlight did a great job showing that. But that makes a lot of sense, changing the algorithm becomes easier after the first time. I was reading about that solar-powered transaction using shortwave radio waves on the Burst blockchain and remember reading a couple years ago about their Proof of Capacity and was curious if those drastically different consensus mechanisms could eventually be available.


[25-Sep-18 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as the hashalgo is in C/C++, it would be possible to add, really not much interaction with anything else, so it is a relatively safe and easy change to make to consensus. that is why you see a lot of coins where all they change is the hashalgo


[25-Sep-18 03:27 PM] Regnar#6164
Cool, I assumed dPoW could still be a viable option for these non-PoW coins, like PoC, as it's storing the hash of their chain, but would probably need some additional aspect to prevent reversing transactions (not too fluent on PoC). It seemed that PoC could be susceptible to genesis attack.


[25-Sep-18 03:31 PM] jl777c#5810
anything with 256byte blockhash can be dPoW'ed


[25-Sep-18 03:37 PM] Regnar#6164
Cool, good to know, pretty sure their project came from NXT, anyway seemed like a cool algorithm to eventually add to the KMD AC options, seeing as it's based on open disk space and external hard drives are getting bigger and cheaper (5TB is like 110KMD). Thanks for the info

Hello


[25-Sep-18 10:59 PM] djay#5234
I wanted to ask about jumblr, how secure is that against blockchain analysis, I understand that blocks are processed at the same hour for everybody but example if I will run 20k KMD through Jumblr from wallet A - it will do the shufling and even if I break it down into 20 or more wallets I will end up having 1K of komodo each but than if I will exchange all those into BTC the wallets will be linked together the alltogether value can be calculated and it's obvious that it was my wallet that shuffled 20k of KMD especially if Jumblr doesn't have any other activity


[25-Sep-18 11:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
@djay  im no expert on this, but just use different wallets on komodos barterDEX, or just use a few different exchanges withdrawing to different wallets, and youll have like 1btc here, 1.4553 there, 2,2424 in another


[25-Sep-18 11:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
nothing will link those btc wallets together


[25-Sep-18 11:47 PM] djay#5234
I think there is no or very few people using jumblr isn't that a point of failure ?


[26-Sep-18 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
yes until there is more JUMBLR usage, external analysis is possible. PIRATE aims to solve this by dramatically increasing the ztransaction activity within KMD


[26-Sep-18 02:07 AM] sœÜldat#8733
pirate and pex, can't it harm jumblr's activity and utility?


[26-Sep-18 02:20 AM] sœÜldat#8733
Or jumblr mechanism will be directly implemented in pex for KMD ? It's not clear in my mind


[26-Sep-18 02:22 AM] SHossain#0007
You can use JUMBLR only using Komodo native mode. Other coins or assetchain doesn't have this tech.


[26-Sep-18 02:23 AM] jl777c#5810
@sœÜldat my prediction is that PIRATE and pex (especially) will dramatically increase KMD zaddr usage


[26-Sep-18 02:23 AM] jl777c#5810
which in turn should create a critical mass of ztx within KMD to enable JUMBLR to be much more effective


[26-Sep-18 02:24 AM] jl777c#5810
since zaddr is required for PIRATE, it will force anybody that wants to buy PIRATE to make KMD zaddr

hey jl777 what enforces the momom hash on each assetchain to ensure interoptability?


[28-Sep-18 08:27 AM] sidhujag#3327
also how would assetchain a ensure dbl spend protection for payments of assetchain b without rebuilding the momom root and verifying the header hash of each assetchain in the tree?


[28-Sep-18 09:23 AM] allbits#5898
Will Supernet be taking a position in pirate


[28-Sep-18 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
@sidhujag the notaries create the momom hash, the momom hash builds in all the chains merkle roots


[28-Sep-18 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
@allbits I am not sure yet as there is no way to see the PIRATE balance.


[28-Sep-18 02:44 PM] sidhujag#3327
@jl777 so notaries have access to blocks of every asset chain in entire tree they verify the header hash and then create a momom hash and stick it in every asset chain including the same hash rooted to kmd chain?


[28-Sep-18 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, notaries are all running KMD and the assetchains they are notarizing. the KMD instance maintains the MoMoM out of all the MoM hashes being notarized and sends back to the notarizer the MoMoM to use


[28-Sep-18 02:47 PM] sidhujag#3327
how are funds protected from double spends? its a new concept to me is it similar to eths merkle root for balances of plasma chains?


[28-Sep-18 02:49 PM] sidhujag#3327
ok so after block gets created kmd then sends the final momom hash to stick into next  assetchain block?


[28-Sep-18 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the MoMoM are being sent in via notarizations, and once notarized the block cant be reorged


[28-Sep-18 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
if it cant be reorged, it cant be double spent


[28-Sep-18 02:53 PM] sidhujag#3327
the notaries can withhold?


[28-Sep-18 02:54 PM] sidhujag#3327
whats the recourse? being voted out? so what if aggregate value to withhold or to modify hash is greator than the bonded value and fees?


[28-Sep-18 02:55 PM] sidhujag#3327
is there BFT on the notarization layer


[28-Sep-18 02:57 PM] jl777c#5810
there needs to be a consensus on the current hashes


[28-Sep-18 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
notarization uses a stochastic process that converges toward a majority consensus value


[28-Sep-18 02:59 PM] sidhujag#3327
are notaries chosen using a quorum or all of them are tasked every block?


[28-Sep-18 02:59 PM] sidhujag#3327
is 64 a magic number or dynamic grows?


[28-Sep-18 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
annual election by KMD stake weight for 64 notaries


[28-Sep-18 03:03 PM] sidhujag#3327
so in any block the aggregate value should be below some amount to avoid notary from becoming bad actor?


[28-Sep-18 03:04 PM] sidhujag#3327
or does the consensus on the hashes take care of that thus the trust is distributed to 32+1 notaries?


[28-Sep-18 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no notarization unless there is consensus


[28-Sep-18 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
only 13 nodes sign each notarization, but it is based on a 64 node consensus


[28-Sep-18 03:07 PM] sidhujag#3327
cool.. is there a fundamental num of asset chains where it gets hard for notaries to do their work? it seems notaries need to store all that data across all nodes and that can become an issue.. i guess plasma does fraud proofs instead and exit to parent chain


[28-Sep-18 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
most assetchains are pretty small


[28-Sep-18 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
we are working on ways to have multiple nodes per notary


[28-Sep-18 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
but the notarization process has been made pretty efficient so hundred(s) of chains can be notarized on a node, if all the coins can be run


[28-Sep-18 03:09 PM] sidhujag#3327
each chain would be its own dapp no?


[28-Sep-18 03:09 PM] sidhujag#3327
like an identity chain for example


[28-Sep-18 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the idea is that each chain localizes its activity to that chain alone


[28-Sep-18 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe a few related dapps are running on it, but the sharding is automatic, things are never combined into a single chain so we dont have the problem of needing to shard


[28-Sep-18 03:11 PM] sidhujag#3327
wait dapps are sharded across assetchains?


[28-Sep-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
no


[28-Sep-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean the concept of sharding is not needed


[28-Sep-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
the data is automatically already "sharded"


[28-Sep-18 03:11 PM] sidhujag#3327
oh ok yea


[28-Sep-18 03:11 PM] sidhujag#3327
same as plasma chain


[28-Sep-18 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
sharding is only needed as everything is combined together and it needs to be split apart


[28-Sep-18 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
with assetchains, nothing is combined together into a single chain


[28-Sep-18 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
just the notarizations are sent to KMD


[28-Sep-18 03:12 PM] jl777c#5810
and a LOT of chains can be notarized to KMD


[28-Sep-18 03:13 PM] sidhujag#3327
right.. no its cool stuff im proud of you to follow through man.. ive had some more time to read what you guys did


[28-Sep-18 05:59 PM] lukechilds#2707
Hey @jl777c currently implementing KMD interest claiming for Ledger, are you able to give me a solid breakdown of the interest/reward consensus rules.

As far as I'm aware it's based on the coinage of any UTXO over 10 KMD. The UTXO value is multiplied by coinage which is then mulitpleied by a specific number to result in the 5% apr.

I'm aware there was also a recent change that caps the interest amount once per month.

I'm assuming age is estimated approximately by number of blocks, so in pseudo code it would be something like:

```
const  interestPerBlock = <interest%earned every block>
let interestAmount = UTXOamount * coinage * interestPerBlock;
const interestAmount = Math.min(interestAmount, maxMonthlyInterest);
```

Is that more or less correct? I need to get this exactly correct to not violate network consensus rules. Feel free to point me to any docs if this is aleady documented in detail.

Cheers

possibly noob Q


[28-Sep-18 06:08 PM] lukechilds#2707
```
to be eligible it needs to be more than an hour old, have nLockTime in the tx set to be a valid timestamp
```
is nLockTime already set on all normal P2PKH transactions?


[28-Sep-18 06:09 PM] lukechilds#2707
```
the times between the current block and the utxo's nLockTime are subtracted and divided by 60 to convert it to minutes
```
Does this mean the time is measured as "blocks since TX had 1 confirmation = 1 minute"


[28-Sep-18 06:11 PM] lukechilds#2707
```
rewards once accrued doesnt go down as minutes since nLockTime never goes down, only up
```
can you expand on this statement?


[28-Sep-18 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
nlocktime needs to be set explicitly if you're creating the raw txs yourself


[28-Sep-18 06:13 PM] lukechilds#2707
```
the rewards amount stops after one year
after one year, the rewards are still all there, the principal value is still there, it never goes away, even after 77 years
there is all sorts of misinformation, stuff like you have to transfer funds every year or you lose your funds, that is nonsense
```
slightly confused by this.
So if I have a 10 KMD UTXO that's 1 year old I get 5% interest.
If I have a 10 KMD that's 2 years old, I still only get 5% interest beacuse it's capped
What if I claim my interest after 1 year. Can I reclaim the next year to get anther 5%

[28-Sep-18 06:15 PM] Alright#0419

[28-Sep-18 06:15 PM] lukechilds#2707
not quite, I need a 100% accurate spec for this so I can implement it perfectly, otherwise interest claims will get rejected from the network

[28-Sep-18 06:16 PM] lukechilds#2707

I have been reading through the source and found `komodo_interestnew()` and `komodo_accrued_interest()` which look relevent but I could really do with a concrete specifiaction in writing


[28-Sep-18 11:54 PM] jl777c#5810
use komodo_interestnew()


[28-Sep-18 11:54 PM] jl777c#5810
the (chaintip->nTime - nLocktime) is the elapsed time


[28-Sep-18 11:55 PM] jl777c#5810
for specific utxo you can do gettxout and it prints "interest" field (I didnt change it for technical backward compatibility reasons)


[28-Sep-18 11:55 PM] jl777c#5810
needs to be >= 10 KMD


[28-Sep-18 11:55 PM] jl777c#5810
of course needs nLockTime set, else you cant calculate elapsed time


[28-Sep-18 11:55 PM] jl777c#5810
must be over an hour as 59 minutes are subtracted from elapsed time

[29-Sep-18 04:21 AM] ted#5473
The problem with the KMD solution is that the FLO community cannot participate in running a notary node because:
1. Voting in a notary node happens once a year and only a few of them are re-elected
2. Voting in a notary node requires voting with KMD

The FLO community should not be required to also buy and hold KMD to vote on a node to be able to have a small amount of control over the network. Anyone   can participate in the VBK network at any time
Unless I'm mistaken, GAME credits was the first coin to implement the dPoW algorithm, and they've only been using it for 2 or 3 months


[29-Sep-18 04:23 AM] jl777c#5810

the design is that each chain takes care of making its own blocks. having one coin controlling another coin doesnt sound so good, so making that some sort of requirement is strange. if they need that then it is better they use a different solution

it is like not using bitcoin since bitcoin wont let you mine some percentage of blocks

[29-Sep-18 04:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@ted 
>The problem with the KMD solution is that the FLO community cannot participate in running a notary node because:
this logic incorrect.

Every assetchain in a project or every other 3rd party blockchain (hush, verushash, gamecredits, etc) don't need to participate in notary node elections.
But to pay for their assetchain notarisation. even a community member can donate for an yearly notarisation or a community fund can probably do that. aprox of 300 kmd per year I don't think is huge cost to save a blockchain worth multi thousand/million/billion against 51% attack.


[29-Sep-18 04:33 AM] ted#5473
so they think veriblock is better,and i think many other teams which want to use kmd solution,also worry about those problems


[29-Sep-18 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
making it a requirement to have one or more notary nodes to utilize the dPoW service, this is a totally unreasonable thing


[29-Sep-18 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
if that cannot be understood, then it is ok that they use something else


[29-Sep-18 04:37 AM] jl777c#5810
they can just setup their own notary nodes, and pay for BTC txfees themselves


[29-Sep-18 04:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if every new blockchain utilising dPoW notarisation required to have a notary node of their own, there probably would have need of 1000s of notary nodes. doesn't make sense.
only 64 notary nodes.
community elect with their token weight power
notaries don't hold the power to change or manipulate a blockchain
only thing these notaries can do is just send the transaction and do notarisation.

```
The problem with the KMD solution is that the FLO community cannot participate in running a notary node because:
1. Voting in a notary node happens once a year and only a few of them are re-elected
```
Yes they can participate.  Get voted in.  This is part of any voting process.
```
2. Voting in a notary node requires voting with KMD
```
Voting in the elections is one part of the KMD ecosystem.  If you want to vote, be a part of it by getting KMD around that time of year.  The Vote coin gets airdroped to holders of KMD.  It is a community process.  How else can a community process be voted on?
```
The FLO community should not be required to also buy and hold KMD to vote on a node to be able to have a small amount of control over the network. 
```
Nobody is controlling anything.  Notary nodes don't control anything.  They notarize.  The voting process is how it is, if you think there is a better way, please submit details of a better way.


[29-Sep-18 04:51 AM] Mylo#8306
You actually don't need to hold any KMD.  Just run for elections and get votes from the KMD community - ultimately KMD community decides.


[29-Sep-18 04:53 AM] Mylo#8306
dPoW is a security service for blockchains.  You either use the service or you don't.   You don't have to be involved in it.  If you want to be involved, you run for notary election and become an integral part of the KMD ecosystem.

at the end of the day, it's their team decision.   i'm not going to lobby them to come to KMD - we have dPoW and it's approaching the third election cycle in the coming months.   They have good ideas, just a matter of securing their network.  Looks similar to settlemint on eth.

[30-Sep-18 07:52 AM] joey#9690
Hi, FLO team guy here, I can answer some of the questions posted above. The tl;dr is that apps on the FLO blockchain have features allowing users to increase the security of our chain. Removing those features is a dealbreaker. 

> why would they want to be controlling notary nodes? the idea is to not have to worry about such things
Caltech, Medici, and Alexandria projects all expressed deep concern about not having any option to allow users to participate in the security of the network. We don't want to "not worry about the security", we want to build applications in which our users can participate in the security of the network the same day that they learn about the network. In fact, in all of those projects, users are encouraged and rewarded for participating in the security of the network at the protocol level.

> they wanted duke to basically work for free
> they only had $500 
The offer was $500 in BTC upfront plus any amount of FLO you felt reasonable after the job is complete. I was asking for an hour a week in a conference call to help review our code and answer questions. I think our offer was fair, and actually better in terms of dollars per hour than a fulltime engagement where you are coding for months and responsible for delivering the entire completed software.


[30-Sep-18 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing about using dPoW stops people from securing the FLO blockchain. it is not needed to invade into notary space to secure things


[30-Sep-18 08:16 AM] joey#9690
I think we could unpack that statement and find points to agree and disagree on but it's moot. There is a philosophical disagreement stemming from the wishes of the applications and users in our community


[30-Sep-18 06:16 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@joey  traditional PoW is still required,  can you explain how they would not have a hand in the security of their own network?  And how that having FLO controlling a Notary node would be that hand in the security?


[30-Sep-18 06:20 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I think there is a misunderstanding about the nature of the notary nodes


[30-Sep-18 06:23 PM] joey#9690
If FLO is susceptible to a 51% attack and the notary nodes help prevent a 51% attack then having control over a notary node is significant in the context of our chain's security


[30-Sep-18 06:42 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The mechanism by which Notary nodes help other chains  secure against 51% attacks is through group signed tx ( vast oversimplification ) onto bitcoin chain.  3rd party chains piggyback through the cascade effect.   1/64 of possible signatures is not any sort of hand of security.  Notary nodes are elected delegates,  which have a mining privilege in the Komodo chain ,simply handing over a notary node is the equivalent of paying you to secure to your chain.  If you want control of a Notary node your community can gather votes to be elected as one.   What you are paying for with DPoW integration not only making FLO compatible but the running of FLO nodes on all Notary servers, a necessary audit to confirm that running your nodes isn't going to compromise our setups.  500$ doesn't come close to the costs of integration and while yes you offered FLO which I'm sure could be taken in part,  the truth is much would have to hit the market to recover costs which would not be beneficial for FLOs price.   TLDR :  notaries secure through sending tx in Komodo chain of FLO blockhashes to prevent private mined 51% attacks and mitigate other attacks controlling one node of 64 does nothing in that process and the cost of integration is much more than offered even at modest IT rates

That's just the Komodo cost of the notarization itself not all the things that go into it

[30-Sep-18 06:47 PM] joey#9690

[30-Sep-18 06:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
You mentioned the offer being fair earlier on,  this is one of the points of contention in integration isn't it?


[30-Sep-18 06:49 PM] joey#9690
Duke asked for $1500 up front for a full integration (2 month full time engagement), and my offer was $500 up front for 1 hour a week conference call. Does that seem unreasonable?


[30-Sep-18 06:50 PM] joey#9690
In the second case, we would be doing 100% of the coding


[30-Sep-18 06:50 PM] joey#9690
I think I made that very clear in my original comment


[30-Sep-18 06:52 PM] joey#9690
Integration costs were not a point of contention by the way


[30-Sep-18 06:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Compared to what will be charged in the future 1500 is a steal.   Regardless,  FLO would still have a hand in accepting notarized blockhashes without control of a Notary node,  there is nothing about a Notarization that affects FLOs consensus mechanism ,  basically all we do is write public blockhashes.  Still up to your community to mine blocks.  Still up to the community to agree upon notarization in the event of the attack,  in fact without FLO communities accepted public blockhashes ,  done through consensus mechanism which Komodo has no hand in, what purpose does DPoW  have?   FLOs base security determines the effectiveness of DPoW


[30-Sep-18 07:00 PM] joey#9690
We agreed to his original ask


[30-Sep-18 07:00 PM] joey#9690
He suggested taking a lesser role due to his workload


[30-Sep-18 07:01 PM] joey#9690
Anyway, the point about being able to contribute to the security of the network is a philosophical disagreement that the devs building the apps running on FLO have with the notary node system


[30-Sep-18 07:02 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
From my point of view, it isn't much reasonable.
@dukeleto has much good understanding of Komodo/Zcash ecosystem and internal code, and he's already experienced by implementation dPoW in HUSH, and if he's one of few (I don't know any other than Duke and jl777 ) who can take this job with assurance of delivery.


[30-Sep-18 07:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
from a freelancer market, if the task a project wants, and there aren't many who can do it, it raises the value of one who can offer to do it.

dPoW is consensus level changes. It is not just a part time task. It becomes fulltime considering the urgencies it can reflect in it's implementation and testing and any urgent bug fixes.

yes I have heard this argument many times


[30-Sep-18 07:08 PM] joey#9690
The consensus among the community was that without a way to incrementally contribute to that process, we couldn't fit our apps into it

@joey  Interesting discussion!
I'm also interested in making use of dPOW security and in particiating as a NN.
As mentioned, surely there are many others out there among all of the projects that would like the same.  And yet there are only 30 (+3?) NN positions available at the next election.  
In my case, for practical reasons, I view these as 2 separate matters.
If I were to consider them as one in the same I would need to seriously consider the advice from jl777 above and create my own network notarizing to BTC. Not a realistic possibility for me at the moment.
The #üíéÔΩúnotarynode channel is open to all to participate in.  Of course, that's not actually sending transactions to BTC (who does that is rightly decided by the Komodo community).  It can be a form of active participation by those who choose to use it as such though.
This discussion is useful for me to clarify the best course of action for the near future.
Hopefully further discussion generates other ideas that I can use :)
btw FLO sounds like an interesting project!

@CrisF  the reason for only half of the notaries being reelected is for a logistic reason,  imagine the headache if a majority of the nodes were new ,  catching everyone up to speed with what is going on especially with the rate James puts out stuff would be very stressful and would interrupt operations,  keeping a core of already trained nodes mitigates this issue greatly

@joey Yeah, I've found the resources and forum for ideas here to be quite amazing.  And the opportunity Komodo is providing for people like me, with ideas but without deep technical knowledge or resources, is truly something that can make those ideas a reality.


[30-Sep-18 07:40 PM] joey#9690
@grewalsatinder the problem is we have 3 production apps using our blockchain and they each incentivize security of our network at the protocol level by contributing a % of sales to mining rewards. Adding another layer of security (notary nodes) without a way to contribute to the strength of that second-layer security breaks the security guarantee of the apps we've built. Technically, we don't *need* to implement anything additional, but the app developers have voiced their opinion that the guarantee of increased security based on sales % should not be altered. As someone else here said, it's an idealistic decision more than a practical one, but such is the will of the community. If it were up to me things would have been done differently, but I'm not the dictator of FLO, otherwise I would have named it joeycoin üòâ


[30-Sep-18 07:41 PM] CrisF#3405
@polycryptoblog Yes, I feel that the current system of keeping on notaries is good for many reasons.


[30-Sep-18 07:46 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I guess where I am confused is how DPoW affects that system at all?


[30-Sep-18 07:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The second layer is directly dependent on the first.


[30-Sep-18 07:49 PM] CrisF#3405
@joey Perhaps, when you present your finding from here, the app developers will be able to come up with some solutions that suit their need?  That could then be further discussed here, to all of our benefit.


[30-Sep-18 07:49 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@joey okay, still unclear if it's decentralisation issue or not. Anyway, there are some options to consider.
- a 3rd party project like FLO can also setup their own independent Notary Nodes (64).
  - implement dPoW to FLO code
  - let community elect these 64 notary nodes. however the voting is managed to elect these notary nodes is up to the project and the community.
  - benefit is still getting your own set of notary nodes.
  - but at cost of btc/kmd notarisations paid by these set of notary nodes.

Secondary Notary node network ,  much more intensive cost,effort and time but it would meet your requirements and be cheaper than doing direct to btc notarizations

Every time you add more coins to the KMD 64 notary nodes, it takes away secudity form KMD. That  is very bad.


[30-Sep-18 07:59 PM] joey#9690
@Deleted User do you mean it takes away security because the cost of resources to audit the code and upkeep grows per project added?


[30-Sep-18 07:59 PM] joey#9690
or because it's more surface area for attack?


[30-Sep-18 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
That is one aspect... .also running millions of coins from the same set of pubkeys causes all kinds of issues. I have fixed this as best as it possibly cna be done, with a patch to iguana that uses `lockunspent` to stop utxo conflicts, but there is really no reason not to just use more sets of keys.

Seperation... Also if the private key for a KMD notary node  is imported into a thrid party coin, they could get the KMD notary node keys... and that would be game over if they were a bad actor, or were over taken by a bad actor.

So for a single coin, you could use somehting very small... as long as you have enough ram/swap to build the coins deamons and sync the chain. Iguana itself is very low on recource, only RAM and SSD is required.

Well yes and no... You would likely need a single perso to be trained up, but the STAKED stuff is extremly easy to use, not having to worry about updates for extra coins etc.... its almsot a set and forget thing, with some kind of notification if out of utxo, or iguana stopped working, login and restart it or send some funds. thats just about it.

@joey thanks for dropping by for discussion üòÉ 

Running your own notaries as per #private-staked may be an option, it increases delay to btc level security if notarizing to kmd is a step involved as well (which I still recommend).  On one hand running your own notaries could be viewed as ‚Äúcentralized‚Äù without a similar voting process etc. but that would be something for FLO ecosystem to work out.  Each app could run some servers, as more apps use FLO, more nodes.  Keep in mind 64 nodes connecting to each other is 4k connections, more would be a new set of problems.

The dPoW has no interference w the apps reward systems on FLO.  If offering the users an opportunity to participate in security, what level of participation?  NNs mark checkpoints in a very expensive system.  FLO users would participate in the NN process, it would be completely insecure for your node to not be operated by a v.small team of trusted ppl.

Further, once engaged in the Komodo community, getting votes from creating ecosystem collaboration would be something the community looks for.  The notary voting is open to anyone, it is a friendly competitive and collaborative effort once elected, but certainly not something that can really be expected to be involved with, with no prior Komodo collaboration or input as there is no history that would appeal to community voters.

Either way, if you‚Äôve got ideas with DEX and the rest of the tech, might see you around more in the future üëç

A coin could run their own notaries, but there is *a lot* of work in getting that setup. They'd need to consider the server costs, man hours of maintaining each, maintaining the network itself, cost of notarization itself, politics behind who can/can't be a notary, how to incentivize notaries to have good up time and not collude

I know you may have answered that before, but I can't seem to recall why it's a requirement


[01-Oct-18 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it can be added to the check of the consensus rules. since it is a more permissive thing it would be a hardfork


[01-Oct-18 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
but since there is no production -ac_perc chain I can make the change

For some time now wanted to ask JL777 a question. Was the decision of KMD apr cap switched from yearly to monthly yours? Or were there some kind of public vote implemented. I mean, that's a major change to the blockchain protocol. For me personally that made a lot of complications. I keep everything paper-wallet style. It's now a monthly headache for me with generating new addresses, printing, resyncing, deleting and all that long time consuming stuff I was hoping to avoid with KMD. I do what I need to do, I understand, but was that decision voted? Thanks.


[01-Oct-18 09:44 PM] CHMEX#0686
The reason was that this reward should be given to people who make an effort and help KMD.
More transactions on the network increase the value of the network -> increase in price and more z transactions increase the privacy.
On the possitive side this new 31 Days cap forces you to get 5.11% Rewads per years and not 'only' 5%
So it is possible ( not to say this will happen any time soon or ever ) that in the future maybe you will only get rewards if you participate in a z transaction.
As all the Notary Nodes Updated to the new code base, the decision was accepted by them.

Hi @jl777c  Is there a plan for Komodo to get more community adoption and subsequently end-user adoption? 

For the former, I feel that VeChain have masternodes and x-nodes who can join in on the community ICO round (prior to public round). So it's  not just private VC vs public fundraising. 

For the latter, it is based on the assumption that ICO/dICO is a good way to get more use cases and users onto the Komodo platform by way of the coins/token gamification or incentives and dApps.


[05-Oct-18 03:12 AM] CrisF#3405
Hi @Fai, I'm sure others will be along to answer your question soon.
Have you had a look through #komodo-team, #team-business-dev , #deleted-channel, etc channels?  I think you'll find a great deal of information there and give a good idea of what's happening regarding end-user adoption.

>based on a vulnerability in the code that the Komodo team was aware of but did not patch. While, as with many such things, it is difficult to separate truth from conjecture in this case, leaving vulnerabilities in your code to exploit against competitors is likely to leave many developers cautious about working with Komodo.

Almost all of komodo's security patches are block height triggers. SAFE didn't bother to change any of these. When they launched they had all of the security holes that ever existed in KMD.

@jl777c I am seeking a small bit of advice. I have little to no, programming experience. But I do have a good foundation in computer networking & security--enough to pass a Cisco CCNA cert exam. And, at the moment, I'm spending most of my time in the Verus discord. However I do recognize most all of the Komodo dev team, from researching various cryptocurrencies--or probably just because you are one hell of a talented group of guys--and you tend to value privacy. I am different. I appreciate the developers.
So,  I want to get into programming and, for some odd reason, I want to work with crypto wallets--desktop & mobile. I really enjoy crypto & I was lucky to read the BTC white paper in '11 & I agree with the core argument of the right to individual privacy and the right for financial fair play, at any level. 
Like I mentioned, I'm very happy to be a part of the Verus community & to see what Mike Tout., and the Verus dev team has accomplished, so far. I'm sure that between Komodo and Verus-- you'll probably find the most talented group of developers, in all of cryptocurrency. So for me, to spend time in the Verus discord and Komodo discord, and to read some of the work you guys are doing in Pirate channel in the Komodo channel or Staked, I think it is lol--it made me think what a waste it would be to just not ask, for a piece of advice. Because I want to be involved in cryptocurrency, on the developing side. 

In as short or as long, as you want to answer--what do you think would be the best first step to take? I did jump right into networking & that worked out. But I also understand that a good first step into anything, is so beneficial. I understand that guys ask questions like this, all of the time, and they probably bullshit 99 percent of the time. If you don't have time to answer, it's not a big deal, I don't take it personal. My plan, as of now, is to start with C, and spending time in the Verus GitHub--trying to look and pick up on, what I can.

Thats the best way. I learnt most of my skills but just reading code, then trying to break said code, until i understood how it works. You will find things that nobdy else thaught of looking for. Because they read documentation and followed instructions.

Hi  @J-Dog üëã 
That is great advice above üëÜ 
I'm envious of your experience (or any experience really) üòâ 
I'm pretty much a living example of a zero-knowledge proof, often proving zero knowledge when it comes to comput*.  So no specific advice.
I will say the best thing I've done towards any progress has been to actively participate.  As you mentioned, you have 2 awesome communities to become more involved in.  Jump in!


[06-Oct-18 04:23 AM] jl777c#5810
test


[06-Oct-18 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
in order to be a coder, you need to be able to find the vast majority of your own bugs


[06-Oct-18 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
but, like riding a bicycle, there is not anything you can read to magically know how to find bugs


[06-Oct-18 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
just do it


[06-Oct-18 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
read the docs, understand what the rpc calls are supposed to do and then find when it doesnt behave right


[06-Oct-18 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
that is is first step. finding a possible bug


[06-Oct-18 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
then isolate it


[06-Oct-18 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
get the minimal sequence needed to duplicate the bug reliably


[06-Oct-18 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
at this point you can describe the bug in detail, how to reproduce it quickly and the dev will be able to fix it quickly


[06-Oct-18 04:26 AM] jl777c#5810
I am very good at testing as I spend about half my time testing


[06-Oct-18 04:26 AM] jl777c#5810
by the time I feel my code is ready for others to test, there are still bugs, but usually really easy to find and fix ones or really hard to reproduce ones


[06-Oct-18 04:28 AM] jl777c#5810
now, once you are able to test effectively. then coding becomes much easier as you are always thinking what sorts of bugs will this have, how can i find them and isolate them, while you are coding. And you dont bother coding something that cant be tested, saving a lot of wasted time. so many devs have no clue about testing they release code that just cant be debugged


[06-Oct-18 04:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i like to code by making one change at a time.


[06-Oct-18 04:28 AM] jl777c#5810
and test it


[06-Oct-18 04:28 AM] jl777c#5810
then no matter how strange the behavior, i know what change caused it.


[06-Oct-18 04:29 AM] jl777c#5810
think about it. how often is the cause for a bug in a totally different area of code than made sense based on the bug? Quite often. So if you have two or N such bugs at the same time, it becomes  unknowable what code change led to what bug


[06-Oct-18 04:29 AM] jl777c#5810
and most of all keep the code as simple as possible, everywhere possible. complexity is the enemy


[06-Oct-18 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
even with that the entire system will become quite complex. better to have a lot of simple components, than one giant complex beast

Question: (I know you have said KV is being replaced by Oracles CC but I'd still like to use it for something..) I've talked to a few members that stated that KV values used to be printed to stdout from mempool before the actual block was mined. It was disabled at some point. Would you be able to point me in the right direction to re-enable them?


[06-Oct-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo_kv.h 175?:                 //fprintf(stderr,"KV add.(%s) (%s)\n",ptr->key,valueptr);
uncomment that line


[06-Oct-18 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it will show new KV entries being added


[06-Oct-18 10:10 AM] jspook16#3059
Sweet ..... thank you very much!!


[06-Oct-18 10:46 AM] jspook16#3059
I uncommented and rebuilt and no joy. I'll keep poking around. Thanks


[06-Oct-18 11:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jspook16 try a `make clean` before rebuilding again, then try it again


[06-Oct-18 11:44 AM] jspook16#3059
trying now


[06-Oct-18 11:53 AM] jspook16#3059
i tried it but only getting the following in stdout


[06-Oct-18 11:53 AM] jspook16#3059
duration.1440 flags.0 current.27506 ht.9013 keylen.5 valuesize.36


[06-Oct-18 11:54 AM] jspook16#3059
only see the KV after the block mines


[06-Oct-18 12:07 PM] Alright#0419
@jspook16 are you getting the above print as soon as the tx hits mempool of your node?


[06-Oct-18 12:08 PM] jspook16#3059
yep immediately


[06-Oct-18 12:09 PM] jspook16#3059
@Alright


[06-Oct-18 12:10 PM] Alright#0419
and what is the print that shows the actual value?


[06-Oct-18 12:10 PM] Alright#0419
after it's mined that is


[06-Oct-18 12:12 PM] jspook16#3059
couldnt find (test7mytest)
KV add.(test7) (mytest)


[06-Oct-18 12:27 PM] Alright#0419
just tried it, can't get `fee 0.00100000 vs 0.00100000 flags.1 keylen.4 valuesize.5 height.4459 (74 65 73)` this print to print from mempool


[06-Oct-18 12:28 PM] Alright#0419
do you have that printing from mempool already? Did you do anything in particular to get that working?


[06-Oct-18 12:28 PM] Alright#0419
@jspook16


[06-Oct-18 12:30 PM] jspook16#3059
yes i just did it again .....i uncommented all of komodo_kv.h except for //search rawmempool, and did a make clean before i rebuilt


[06-Oct-18 12:30 PM] jspook16#3059
not sure i did anything in particular though


[06-Oct-18 12:33 PM] Alright#0419
so if we can't get it printing from mempool, I thought of a dirty hack that would work


[06-Oct-18 12:34 PM] Alright#0419
we can create an on-demand blocks chain and force it to have a static easy diff then dpow it with staked


[06-Oct-18 12:34 PM] Alright#0419
that way, as soon as a message hits mempool, it will be mined and the diff won't raise after many messages


[06-Oct-18 12:35 PM] Alright#0419
and with dpow it can't be reorged, so I don't see easy diff as a problem


[06-Oct-18 12:35 PM] Alright#0419
seems like a really round-about way to accomplish what we need though


[06-Oct-18 12:36 PM] Alright#0419
actually might be a good test for what @Deleted User has been working on


[06-Oct-18 12:36 PM] Alright#0419
he's been fixing the StakedNotary repo so that we can have chains with different consensus rules


[06-Oct-18 12:42 PM] Alright#0419
@jl777c what do you think about the above idea? Static easy diff on-demand blocks chain, so txs always mined immediately


[06-Oct-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
sure


[06-Oct-18 12:42 PM] Alright#0419
seems easy enough to do, but like I said very round-about way to accomplish what we need


[06-Oct-18 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
more experimentation more experience more better


[06-Oct-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing wrong with getting what you need done with least effort, regardless of where the effort is


[06-Oct-18 12:44 PM] Alright#0419
@jspook16 do you want to try to go this route?


[06-Oct-18 12:45 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah you may have to guide me since im not up to speed on what @Deleted User is doing


[06-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Alright#0419
need to find the checks that reject blocks with lower diff than target and remove them


[06-Oct-18 12:46 PM] Alright#0419
then set target in getblocktemplate to a a static value


[06-Oct-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810

isn't as simple as that, setting target in blocktemplate to static value has seemingly no effect on the built in miner

Referring to the recent announcement by VerusCoin. What is to stop a malicious actor from gaining large enough control and "finding" their own attempt to cheat the stake reward? This system essentially gives them a legitimate way to create coins by discovering their own attempt to cheat. Additionally, what does this do the the total block reward over time?

{Reactions}
ü§î 

[08-Oct-18 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
doesnt change the blockreward at all


[08-Oct-18 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
well if someone cheats and then discovers their own cheat, what did they gain?


[08-Oct-18 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
they gained a mining reward, and then lost it and then gained it


[08-Oct-18 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
so net gain of 1 reward instead of 1 reward


[08-Oct-18 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
this maliciousness seems quite misguided with a ROI of 0%, even if it works


[08-Oct-18 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and they are competing against the entire rest of the network to mine the cheat claim, so odds are very good they wont recover the stake they put up


[08-Oct-18 06:09 AM] Kalash#2884
Maybe I don't understand, but it seems like they would gain double the reward. The cheated reward, and then the reward for finding the valid block.


[08-Oct-18 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
remember the entire network is mining the cheating utxo, so your chance of being able to claim it is your percentage of overall hashrate


[08-Oct-18 06:10 AM] Kalash#2884
which if repeated would only compound over time


[08-Oct-18 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
how do they gain double the reward if the first reward is lost?


[08-Oct-18 06:10 AM] Kalash#2884
the first reward isn't lost if they are able to validate their malicious attempt


[08-Oct-18 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
win a block, then cheat and lose it 95% of the time is the outcome if they have 5% the hashrate


[08-Oct-18 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
yes they lose the first one, just to regain it via the cheating claim


[08-Oct-18 06:11 AM] Kalash#2884
But it allows them to make their cheated claim valid


[08-Oct-18 06:11 AM] Kalash#2884
and yes, of course it requires a majority of hashrate


[08-Oct-18 06:12 AM] Kalash#2884
but with a small cap coin that's not very difficult


[08-Oct-18 06:12 AM] Kalash#2884
do that enough times and they then gain an exponentially increasing claim of stake rewards


[08-Oct-18 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
ok so say they have 100% the hashrate, they lose the first block reward, just to gain it via cheat claim


[08-Oct-18 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
how is that any better than just keeping the first blockreward???


[08-Oct-18 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
do you realize they lose the original blockreward if a cheat claim is made?


[08-Oct-18 06:13 AM] Kalash#2884
only if one of their nodes doesn't find it


[08-Oct-18 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
and that assumes they are the miner 100 blocks later


[08-Oct-18 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
but if their node finds it, then either the original blockreward is kept or the cheat claim is not done


[08-Oct-18 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
how is there any gain?


[08-Oct-18 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems the best that happens is the same as if no cheating was attempted, but the worst is that the cheater doesnt mine the cheat claim and then loses


[08-Oct-18 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
so we have net neutral or net negative. there is no positive that I see. maybe you can describe how you plan to make gains with this


[08-Oct-18 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
1 - 1 is 0


[08-Oct-18 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
1 + 0 is 1


[08-Oct-18 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
1 is 1


[08-Oct-18 06:21 AM] Kalash#2884
I see what you mean, but it does seem to be a way to allow a "free" doublespend. I need to read more, but something about this doesn't seem right.


[08-Oct-18 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
looking forward to an actual attack scenario. likely would be a VRSC bounty if you can find it


[08-Oct-18 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
it isnt "free" since to do the cheat claim the original blockreward is spent. how you think that is a double spend, i have no idea

Thank you all, very very much, for your advice.. And I sincerely mean that.

@jl777c How you ended up with Ripple at start ?


[09-Oct-18 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
i found NXT first, but ripple had a very profitable mining program and i needed some capital

Any chance Maxcoin will be listed on Barterdex?

Barterdex is an open platform,  their team will just need to send their request , they can even advance part of it directly with Github

@jl777c  would it be possible to connect a blockchain on komodo platform with a digital coin on a site , 2 ways? i am asking because there is a token on ethereum that was, and is even now, being airdropped to anybody with a social account, the project is https://powtoken.com/ they are struggling to create a working gateway to let people transform the digital coins in ERC20 tokens, and i was wondering if contacting them to solve their problem might give a push to komodo too seen they have thousands of people that claimed the tokens, i think that seen the incredible talent of the komodo's team this should be a piece of cake.


[12-Oct-18 06:47 PM] jl777c#5810
what type of digital coin are they airdropped


[12-Oct-18 09:48 PM] criptobear#6402
POW lite is a digital coin, centralized and to be bridged to POW on Ethereum platform


[12-Oct-18 09:49 PM] criptobear#6402
the main idea of the project was to give everybody on the planet coins using facebook plugin


[12-Oct-18 09:50 PM] criptobear#6402
and to allow people to use it on and off blockchain with zero fees on the off version via their website interface, you can find info on https://powtoken.com/


[12-Oct-18 10:10 PM] Mylo#8306
@criptobear there is work being done in #deleted-channel and a brief update https://komodoplatform.com/tech-tuesday-update-5/ for bridging between these kinds of projects.

Tech Tuesday Update #5: A Summary Of Last Week's Development - Komodo
Komodo Platform is starting a weekly briefing on the progress the Komodo Dev Team is making. It's called Tech Tuesday Update. Here's the first one.
https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/5mM-oiRXPZqjXgvgfZbbafJQt6TUjYRR-YWovzFebXc/https/komodoplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/tech-tuesday-update.jpg


[12-Oct-18 11:32 PM] criptobear#6402
@Mylo I asked if it was possible a bridge between pow as a digital currency centralized on their server in their database and a POW coin on the Komodo platform


[13-Oct-18 12:01 AM] jl777c#5810
just do an airdrop


[13-Oct-18 12:03 AM] Mylo#8306
Yes is the answer.  From their whitepaper however, they‚Äôve already been hacked in the past w centralized approaches.

Converting from erc20 to kmd would be possible once we have fungibility between the two.  But as jl says do an airdrop from a db.


[13-Oct-18 12:05 AM] Mylo#8306
10 billion tokens to the first user may need to be split into 5 separate 2 billion lot transactions.  And what is total supply?  I think kmd max is 764 billion


[13-Oct-18 12:07 AM] Mylo#8306
But these things are not deal breakers, invite them to test what the need.  https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/create-Komodo-Assetchain.html if they need assistance, just ask here in discord


[13-Oct-18 12:12 AM] Mylo#8306
The agama wallet is open source, desktop and android, so the just need a logo and their users have a multi coin wallet too!


[13-Oct-18 12:58 AM] criptobear#6402
And after creating the assetchain it would be possible to swap centralized version of the token automatically with the corresponding asset on kmd like it was done with btcd? The total supply is 230 billions.


[13-Oct-18 01:11 AM] jl777c#5810
make a chain with 230 billion, then centrally send coins to registered addresses. why not?


[13-Oct-18 01:20 AM] criptobear#6402
Ok I will try to convince the team to contact Komodo platform thx for the help


[13-Oct-18 12:49 PM] jspook16#3059
@jl777c can the -ac_cc=# value be changed once set? so if it was originally set to ac_cc=2 can i later change it to ac_cc=100?


[13-Oct-18 12:55 PM] Alright#0419
@jspook16 you'd need to source code fork komodo and add an exception for your chain


[13-Oct-18 12:55 PM] jspook16#3059
Copy. Im better off making a new chain then


[13-Oct-18 12:56 PM] jspook16#3059
@Alright I cant sync back up with hollow for some reason. I get two magic bean notifications...one for 30644 blocks and the other for 24 blocks


[13-Oct-18 12:56 PM] jspook16#3059
then it syncs up to the 24block one


[13-Oct-18 12:56 PM] Alright#0419
what's in block 25?


[13-Oct-18 12:57 PM] jspook16#3059
nothing in mempool


[13-Oct-18 12:57 PM] Alright#0419
no errors? just stopped syncing?


[13-Oct-18 12:57 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah it syncs up to 24 and it's ready to go...I may just have to start fresh


[13-Oct-18 12:58 PM] jspook16#3059
so if I set ac_cc to 100 I should be good to go in general right?


[13-Oct-18 12:58 PM] jspook16#3059
if i make a new chain that is


[13-Oct-18 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
I'd like to figure out why ac_ccactivate didn't work as expected


[13-Oct-18 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
would like to try to save the chain even if you are going to scrap it afterwards


[13-Oct-18 01:00 PM] jspook16#3059
I'd rather save it ..... I stopped all of my nodes. I confirmed with hollow his was till running last night


[13-Oct-18 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
maybe stopping all nodes at the same time wasn't a good idea


[13-Oct-18 01:00 PM] jspook16#3059
I restarted my nodes with ac_ccactivate=30635


[13-Oct-18 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
@siu used it on COQUI, maybe he'd have some insight


[13-Oct-18 01:00 PM] jspook16#3059
well hollowman's was still running


[13-Oct-18 01:01 PM] Alright#0419
and now you can't sync from his even without it?


[13-Oct-18 01:01 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah so now ive stopped all my nodes and am just trying to sync one up to his without -ac_cc


[13-Oct-18 01:02 PM] siu#3920
What happen?


[13-Oct-18 01:02 PM] Alright#0419
what are the chain params?


[13-Oct-18 01:02 PM] jspook16#3059
I tried ti activate CC on a chain


[13-Oct-18 01:02 PM] jspook16#3059
./komodod -ac_name=LIZ -ac_supp=100000000 -ac_reward=10000000000 -ac_halving=250000 -ac_end=3000000 -ac_staked=50 -addnode=73.201.153.236:52927


[13-Oct-18 01:02 PM] Alright#0419
siu, he tried to use ac_ccactivate on a chain, and it completely borked it


[13-Oct-18 01:03 PM] siu#3920
Whay did he do?


[13-Oct-18 01:03 PM] siu#3920
What*


[13-Oct-18 01:03 PM] jspook16#3059
all my nodes are shafted....only @Hollowman9000 s node is still running the original chain


[13-Oct-18 01:03 PM] jspook16#3059
I stopped my nodes.....restarted them with -ac_ccactivate=30635


[13-Oct-18 01:03 PM] jspook16#3059
the nodes started over at block 1


[13-Oct-18 01:04 PM] Alright#0419
did you have -gen set?


[13-Oct-18 01:05 PM] jspook16#3059
i dont remember but i dont believe so because 3 of the nodes have very limited resources....how ever I did pass komodo-cli setgenerate true 2 to my local node once i saw the blocks werent moving


[13-Oct-18 01:05 PM] Alright#0419
I don't think hollow has the port open


[13-Oct-18 01:05 PM] Alright#0419
can't get it as a peer


[13-Oct-18 01:05 PM] siu#3920

yeah


[13-Oct-18 01:05 PM] jspook16#3059
I'll check with @Hollowman9000


[13-Oct-18 01:06 PM] Alright#0419
oh why do you have that port appended to the ip like that?


[13-Oct-18 01:06 PM] Alright#0419
that's not the p2p port of the chain


[13-Oct-18 01:06 PM] siu#3920
If yoy have hollows node ip. Just resync pulling data from his node


[13-Oct-18 01:06 PM] siu#3920
Then try again.


[13-Oct-18 01:06 PM] siu#3920
What branch did you do it?


[13-Oct-18 01:06 PM] jspook16#3059
thats what i tried

LIZ: p2p.40053 rpc.52928 ü§î


[13-Oct-18 01:07 PM] Alright#0419
why is this not off by 1?


[13-Oct-18 01:07 PM] jspook16#3059
oh i dont even know anymore.....Im sure it was master that had the latest updates for the 1M update


[13-Oct-18 01:07 PM] Alright#0419
I didn't set that rpc port in conf


[13-Oct-18 01:07 PM] siu#3920
Had someone done contract calls before the fork?


[13-Oct-18 01:07 PM] Alright#0419
./komodod -ac_name=LIZ -ac_supp=100000000 -ac_reward=10000000000 -ac_halving=250000 -ac_end=3000000 -ac_staked=50 -addnode=73.201.153.236


[13-Oct-18 01:07 PM] Alright#0419
you sure those are correct?


[13-Oct-18 01:08 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah i just entered those and i got the right ports


[13-Oct-18 01:08 PM] jspook16#3059

[13-Oct-18 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
what ports?


[13-Oct-18 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
O.o


[13-Oct-18 01:08 PM] Alright#0419
consistently getting LIZ: p2p.40053 rpc.52928 on my node


[13-Oct-18 01:09 PM] jspook16#3059
then i get this   sage: /MagicBean:1.0.15/: version 170003, blocks=30645, us=70.119.217.80:52927, peer=1


[13-Oct-18 01:09 PM] jspook16#3059
which shows the correct blocks


[13-Oct-18 01:09 PM] siu#3920
Im out of my house and have had no ibternet today from home


[13-Oct-18 01:10 PM] jspook16#3059
but later ill get another version message with blocks=24 and then it syncs to the 24 blocks


[13-Oct-18 01:10 PM] Alright#0419
-ac_supp=100000000


[13-Oct-18 01:10 PM] Alright#0419
that's what you just pasted, you sure you're not doing that?


[13-Oct-18 01:10 PM] siu#3920
I recommend you delete everything and start over with the old chain pulling from hollows node


[13-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jspook16#3059
damn


[13-Oct-18 01:12 PM] Alright#0419
I can't connect to hollow's node. I don't think he has the port open or node running


[13-Oct-18 01:12 PM] jspook16#3059
is it -ac_supply?


[13-Oct-18 01:12 PM] siu#3920
Ahh, he night not have public facing ip


[13-Oct-18 01:13 PM] siu#3920
Ask him to share his chain on a zip file then


[13-Oct-18 01:13 PM] siu#3920
Yes, its ac_supply


[13-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jspook16#3059
I'll get with hollow and try -ac_supply.... i have to get going but thank youguys


[13-Oct-18 01:14 PM] jspook16#3059
I'll be back later and let you know what happened


[13-Oct-18 01:15 PM] siu#3920
Ok


[13-Oct-18 01:15 PM] siu#3920
The ac_supp might be the issue


[13-Oct-18 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
ac_cc=100 is the same as ac_cc=2, except much fewer other chains in that non-fungible group


[13-Oct-18 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
if you want a fungible cluster at least 101 or more

I asked about reward claiming in here before, but would I be able to get a channel created for discussing Ledger reward claiming progress and Qs? Ideally with me, James and a few other devs that know their way around the komodo codebase?


[19-Oct-18 02:51 AM] jl777c#5810
here is fine


[19-Oct-18 04:08 AM] lukechilds#2707
would be good to get a channel anyway to keep everything in one place, I'll probs come back with regular questions regarding the reward claiming


[19-Oct-18 04:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
we hit a little road block with the app, it turns out the current official KMD app implements BTC consensus rule checks on the TX before signing


[19-Oct-18 04:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
and having an output amount larger than the input amount violates this and causes the Ledger to throw an error


[19-Oct-18 04:10 AM] lukechilds#2707
You can see the function here: https://github.com/LedgerHQ/ledger-app-btc/blob/master/src/btchip_transaction.c#L48-L71

Allow Ledger to sign Komodo reward claim transactions ¬∑ lukechild...
https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/bQBzy0KW6jZ-hTWOkyCrmoKcXGxpRBlknScP3aa6N8s/%3Fs%3D200%26v%3D4/https/avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/2123375


[19-Oct-18 04:11 AM] lukechilds#2707
it works, and bypasses the check for KMD


[19-Oct-18 04:12 AM] lukechilds#2707
However the txfee amounts shown to the user now overflow for reward claim transactions


[19-Oct-18 04:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
I wanted to implement the reward amount calculations on the device but:
1) It is completely incompatible with the current BTC protocol coin codebase
2) I'm almost certain Ledger won't accept a PR with all that code

The device has no concept of UTXO height or current block height, it just knows about inputs and outputs and signs them. So we'd need to completely fork the BTC app, add support for passing block height info to the Ledger, implement all the KMD interest consensus rules on the device, and then fork their API client and add the block height support to that too. :/


[19-Oct-18 04:14 AM] lukechilds#2707
so the current solution is preferable to that


[19-Oct-18 04:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
just force allowing any output amount


[19-Oct-18 04:15 AM] lukechilds#2707
Just wanted your opinion on if this change is ok, I don't think it should have any negative effects


[19-Oct-18 04:16 AM] lukechilds#2707
The only down side I can see is, if the outputs are larger than the inputs the txfee value overflows so it displays the txfee as like a bazillion KMD


[19-Oct-18 04:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
but that would only ever happen if the output amount is larger than the input amount


[19-Oct-18 04:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
e.g with an reward claim TX


[19-Oct-18 04:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
normal TXs will show up fine


[19-Oct-18 04:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
so no normal software is likely to encounter this


[19-Oct-18 04:17 AM] lukechilds#2707
worst case scenario possible, someone accidentally crafts a TX that has way more outputs than inputs and sends it to the ledger to sign, the Ledger signs it without error, then they broadcast it to the network and it gets rejected instantly


[19-Oct-18 04:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
no loss of funds


[19-Oct-18 04:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
it will just sign TXs that break the consensus rules in the single scenario that the outputs are too large


[19-Oct-18 04:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
_I think_


[19-Oct-18 04:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
but yeah, I'm a little out of my depth, I'm not very familiar with C at all


[19-Oct-18 04:18 AM] lukechilds#2707
so would be great to get your opinion on that


[19-Oct-18 04:19 AM] lukechilds#2707
and also if you or anyone else can see an obvious way to not make the txfee overflow so we can show negative fees like on explorers rather that ridiculously high numbers that would be great too


[19-Oct-18 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
I made a rewards channel

airdrop ended already, too late to the party
now you can buy pirate in exchange of kmd #deleted-channel

Or on the onboarding site


[20-Oct-18 07:55 AM] yorklab#7270
At one time is was stated that "KMD will be the fuel for our upcoming Komodo Smart Contract API enhancements" Does this still hold true?


[20-Oct-18 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
in order to do MoMoM cross chain CC, you will need KMD


[20-Oct-18 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
and of course komodod is needed for all


[20-Oct-18 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it is maybe more an indirect thing, like being on exchanges giving value to a coin


[20-Oct-18 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD being the core coin of the ecosystem gains value with each new ecosystem project, CC, etc.


[20-Oct-18 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not a zerosum game


[20-Oct-18 08:22 AM] yorklab#7270
I see . I asked because of this statement:

"Finally, UTXO-based smart contracts do not require ‚Äúgas‚Äù or any sort of fee for every process executed. Recall that the smart contracts and dApps built on Ethereum must pay for gas for every single process. This makes complex apps impossible."

Thanks for the reply.


[20-Oct-18 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
I wont be adding in monetization in the code just for the sake of monetization. The key to mass market scalability is maximum value at minimum cost and if the cost is close to zero, even better. With millions of users in the ecosystem and all coins referenced against it, KMD is the main currency of the ecosystem. this alone is a big benefit as we see how BTC gains value as all is traded against it

@SHossain @jl777c @grewalsatinder solution suggestion - not sure if anyone already suggested this OR if it is already in dev, but otherwise would be a neat addition to Komodo services portfolio. It's just a shower thought, perhaps suitble for a community discussion, cheers ----- 

Asking the real questions here...
‚óè How can an OTC trade of arbitrary size take place, in a
decentralized manner, w/o any escrows?
‚óè How can bids/asks be placed/taken with a *chosen*
party, w/o an intermediate, and risk-free?
‚óè How can this be realised with Komodo‚Äôs existing tech
i.e. within Komodo ecosystem?

Komodo‚Äôs OTC Dex

 OTX: an OTC Dex solution by Komodo

for: miners, shallow and deep pockets, and anybody seeking to do quick
business w/o going via exchanges with imposed (low) limits

 It would work in a similar way the BarteDEX does with
atomic swaps, but
‚óè Instead of waiting for orders to get filled in the usual way through order matching, an immediate trade on agreed upon price can take place, with tx-fees e.g. shared equally between the parties, or optional buyer/seller bears all fees
‚óè Each party has permanent account (name) linked to, perhaps, reputation or scoring mechanism with stated coins willing to do business in (KMD,ARRR,BTC,etc)
‚óè TX fees are perhaps only in KMD or BTC
‚óè Some simple chat function per transaction/trade, with downloadable/archiving function, available only to involved parties per tx, and/or sort of trade summary as with atomic swaps
‚óè Log in, check out currents offers on the board, sort by coin, contact the buyer/seller and do business
‚óè Coin not found? Place an offer or a request...
‚óè If trade agreed upon > initiate automated trustless exchange of funds


[22-Oct-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
barterdex already has this pretty much possible. select a non-default netid get a bob node running as and FR node. then have alice connect to it and do the atomic swap


[22-Oct-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
likely a GUI can automate most of this process


[22-Oct-18 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
but nobody I know of is working on this


[22-Oct-18 11:02 AM] Jasmin.M.Collins#8462
thanks for the swift reply and the hint, did not know this- lately there are a lot of OTC activities related to ARRR, so, that why the suggestion


[22-Oct-18 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
jawarrr is implementing a trusted node to do the escrow, but yest for non-PIRATE an atomic swap escrow that is easy to use would be the ultimate


[22-Oct-18 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
likely would be a good bounty for anybody that delivers this


[22-Oct-18 11:04 AM] Jasmin.M.Collins#8462
but, instead doing a real atomic swap, a trustless exchange of funds as it is usually via OTC, woudl be a cool feature and perhaps a neat source of fees and exposure for komodo (marketing wise)...


[22-Oct-18 11:05 AM] Jasmin.M.Collins#8462
anyways, thanks for looking into this, I appreicate it

Hi @jl777c if a cryptocurrency like Equaliser wanted to implement crypto conditions what would they have to do? From reading it looks like crypto conditions were built and added to the Komodo blockchain recently. Does that mean that all cryptocurrencies on the Komodo blockchain would have access to the crypto-conditions functionality?


[01-Nov-18 03:25 AM] jl777c#5810
for existing chain an -ac_ccactive=height needs to be added to all nodes, CC will activate at the specified height so make sure to do it enough in the future to allow all critical nodes to update

@jl777c 
What are the odds of Komodo (Ecosystem) ever developing a blockchain of collectibles--or what's referred to as non-fungible? And I say this thinking of maybe using it, to teach---like smart contracts, for example.


[06-Nov-18 10:14 PM] jl777c#5810
assets CC has supported non-fungible token for months


[07-Nov-18 12:36 AM] Mylo#8306
@J-Dog i asked a similar question only yesterday about bundling unique digital assets
```
non-fungible tokens are possible right now with the tokens contract.
We just need to use 1 satoshi of KMD(or whatever base coin) to create the tokens, 
then only one token with an id is created (so it has a unique token id). 
Later, whoever has the token can add op-return data to it.
GUI side can deal with the rules on how the OP-return data is interpreted

creating bundles of assets can be done with another CC that enforces such restrictions
```

can you make a master komodod that assets connect to? with some api commands? or is this what is happening?  so many devs creating their own komodod - maybe a solution is to only accept certain acceptable comands  - I see komodod becoming extremely bloated very soon.  separate the base with the forks. there has to be an easier way  to have names and CCs connect.with the NNs...maybe I am missing something here . the variants are going to overwhelm  me - probably  not you --- I am guessing you have a value for Master you want to keep.

@jl777c  is there a limit to how many chains can be in a cluster?


[19-Nov-18 11:14 PM] jl777c#5810
60000 can be all running on the same node, but you start to run out of ports. however, you can visualize a cluster as a set of non-overlapping subsets, so theoretically there is no limit other than how many can be notarized. likely there will be some practical limit that is there though


[20-Nov-18 07:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
I would like to find this limit at some point, but I think its mostly hardware and network limited rather than. Software which makes it quite hard.


[20-Nov-18 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
you can have nodes that connect to only 10% of all the chains, randomly selected. even with port collision, netmagic would keep the networks separate, so maybe 600,000 chains? at some point the network contention of many chains on same port would likely be an issue

@jl777c plz talk about points monero foks will try to say when it comes to monero vs pirate excluding zk snark trustted setup what points can they say about dpow centralisation....plz tell


[20-Nov-18 11:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
- what is your definition of centralisation?
- how many dpow serving nodes there are in komodo network?
- how many operators manage these notary nodes?
- how they become a notary node? or how they got selected to be notary node?
- does it count as centralisation or matches the denifinition of you answered in first question?

about zk-snarks, 
- what was the process used to create zcash sprout trusted keys? learn here: https://z.cash/blog/the-design-of-the-ceremony
- how much confidence your have that Peter Todd, who is one of the trusted keys setup, that he possibly have **NOT** destroyed his setup and colluded with others *Even in case you think others have NOT deleted their setup* and colluded with others.
- komodo will possibly get sapling upgrade in by first quarter of 2019. How much confidence you have that the number of public created trusted keys are compromise able?
- In terms of upgrade not that far from few months from now to sapling, what threats you see from so far sprout trusted keys setup?

adding checkpoints is usually a centralized process, however dPoW adds checkpoints automatically using a randomized process between the 64 elected notary nodes. to call that centralized is being ignorant of what it is. basically hearing "checkpoint" -> "must be centralized"

@jl777c I heard in an interview about the ‚Äúexpense‚Äù of the dPoW process of notarizing KMD transactions to the btc blockchain...what is this expense and does it make the Komodo platform unsuitable for low cap, low value coins (thinking ETN)?


[21-Nov-18 05:24 AM] kriptek#7720
I like KMD platform and have an idea for an app or Dapp but this app would require an ETN like coin.


[21-Nov-18 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD already pays the same BTC txfees, whether it notarizes 1 coin or 1000


[21-Nov-18 05:37 AM] kriptek#7720
@jl777c looks like the website got an update: more platform on boarding focused. I‚Äôd like to create an app using a native coin on the kmd platform but I‚Äôd imagine there are significant upfront costs, but I have to ask...any possibility to share revenue or ownership with the Kmd community rather than upfront cash outlay?


[21-Nov-18 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
I think the cost is a few thousand dollars per year for dPoW. if your idea is good enough, you should be able to find someone in the community who can help or provide capital. there are -ac_founders option now to be able to recoup via coins mined


[21-Nov-18 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810

@hir0 yes you can make custom rules around protocol/consensus using crypto-conditions 
These are different level od smart contracts which can work from consensus level to app backend level


[22-Nov-18 02:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653

@hir0 
Re:  change consensus of your chain, yes - this is what crypto conditions allows a developer to do.   For instance, say you wanted to send all block rewards to a contract, then once per day you trigger a payout from that contract to ‚Äúpeople that play your game in the last 24 hours‚Äù - then you need to make this player-data available to the blockchain - you can do this through an oracle and you make your ‚Äúprotocol‚Äù/data-structure of the different players from the day.
The daily payout from the smart contract can be triggered by some specific node(s) to enquiry to the oracle data, and pay out proportionately to your players.

That is a hypothetical scenario atm, but do-able as a change of payout method, using off-chain data.

Hi,
```CC is not smart contracts - jl777 ```
 I've made the mistake of referring to CC as Smart Contracts.
Could someone please show me where I can find what the difference is, bearing in mind that I have little background knowledge?


[27-Nov-18 12:09 AM] gcharang#6833
When people refer to smart contracts, like in ETH, all the nodes+miners know a specific programming language(Ex: solidity). The contracts are written on the blockchain using the programming language and as all nodes know the language, they will evaluate them.

In Komodo's architecture, there is no such thing as solidity. The code for the contracts is already in the daemon. The only data that gets written on the blockchain is a reference to the contract and any other inputs it requires. So theoretically, the code in the daemon can be written in any language. This also gives us the possibility for a modular architecture, where you specify the contracts you want to run on your blockchain when compiling your daemon and only those contracts are usable on the chain created using it. Currently all the contracts get added to the daemon by default when you use it for assetchains but this modular functionality is planned for the future when there are more contracts


[27-Nov-18 02:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a custom consensus module


[27-Nov-18 02:05 AM] jl777c#5810
not a contract


[27-Nov-18 02:05 AM] jl777c#5810
just look at the initial CC that are being made and you will see it is not anything like solidity contracts

just when two chains are mined simultaneasly with same algo


[28-Nov-18 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the announced bitmain deal is merged mining with btc, using bitmain miners


[28-Nov-18 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
or half of them


[28-Nov-18 02:21 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
and weaker chain benefits from others higher hash rate


[28-Nov-18 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no single "BTC miner" you can do a deal with


[28-Nov-18 02:21 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
i see


[28-Nov-18 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
you would need to pay all the various bitcoin miners to specifically mine your coin


[28-Nov-18 02:22 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
still a positive it seems


[28-Nov-18 02:22 AM] jl777c#5810
this seems like a lot of work and costs


[28-Nov-18 02:22 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
ahh thats true


[28-Nov-18 02:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a miner opt in


[28-Nov-18 02:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i needed a system where we dont rely on anybody giving permission, or worse, having to proactively do something


[28-Nov-18 02:22 AM] jl777c#5810
optin by miners, vs. automatically supported


[28-Nov-18 02:22 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
is komodo development going well?


[28-Nov-18 02:23 AM] jl777c#5810
why do you ask?


[28-Nov-18 02:23 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
yes i get the automatic support but that doesnt take away from the coins's normal mining


[28-Nov-18 02:24 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
i guess its only been a week since last update

i have no idea what sort of limits that has or what sort of traffic your chain will get


[28-Nov-18 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810
you would need to create VM


[28-Nov-18 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810
I think 4GB of total mem is needed


[28-Nov-18 02:32 AM] Stephen Daniels#2943
so it would tax my macbook pro

@jl777c sorry for the late response, been working all day. I know that you had doubts about the pirate name from the start. I thought you may have some leverage in a rebrand as you are a lead dev. Sorry if this assumption was wrong but I thought I would reach out anyway as I want Pirate to succeed,  I am sure we all do. but let's be honest the name pirate is not great for any serious adoption. I will stick to the marketing channel from now on thanks for your reply . üëç

@jl777c what do you think about the importance of smart data feeds and oracles that connect real live data with blockchains and feed data into the blockchain for faster settlement and other data manipulation?


[28-Nov-18 12:20 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
theres a project called chain-link that is doing that but i was wondering cant komodo be used to create similar oracles to feed real world data to blockchains? ue cases would be to connect banks, live events, weather, and other data to blockchains and other sidechains


[28-Nov-18 12:31 PM] Alright#0419
@Stephen Daniels komodo already has it

it allows you to push arbitrary data on chain


[28-Nov-18 05:34 PM] Alright#0419
and have dapps and contracts make decisions based on that data


[28-Nov-18 05:35 PM] CrisF#3405
@Stephen Daniels Hi, are you thinking data like price feeds, GPS data, streaming data (video for example) etc?


[28-Nov-18 05:38 PM] CrisF#3405
Put on-chain through an oracle? Then used by other contracts?


[28-Nov-18 11:22 PM] jl777c#5810
@Stephen Daniels oracles CC allows to put offchain data onchain


[28-Nov-18 11:23 PM] Stephen Daniels#2943
is the system that collects and filters the accuracy of the date decentrlized?


[28-Nov-18 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
it depends on whatever is implemented


[28-Nov-18 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
usually an oracle is trusted to provide accurate data, hence its name "oracle"


[28-Nov-18 11:50 PM] jl777c#5810
oracles CC is a mechanism for getting offchain data onchain


[28-Nov-18 11:50 PM] jl777c#5810
but garbage in/garbage out still applies


[28-Nov-18 11:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if you put garbage data onchain, it is onchain, but still garbage

 How close are we to have assets and Oracle CCs ready for production usage?
What about gateways?
Thanks


[29-Nov-18 04:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it is certainly ready for dapps to be built with them, whether it is production ready would depend on the specific usecases


[29-Nov-18 04:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i would say oracles is pretty much ready as it is not putting any big funds at risk


[29-Nov-18 04:31 AM] jusoaresf#3291
True


[29-Nov-18 04:33 AM] jusoaresf#3291
So an App that uses just assets and oracles could attempt an alpha version already?

@jl777c what are you thoughts on MimbleWimble/Grin project?
Last time I checked, it wasn't possible to do all things what BTC could do (btc prior segwit and stuff). I haven't been keeping an eye on it's tech side much, not sure you might have, but still would like to ask if you know it got any better than what it started as and if does cover some things what BTC level does? Means other than privacy, how else good it can do in cryptocurrency ecosystem? 
Could MimbleWimble tech be of any use for komodo ecosystem either being 3rd party or any other way?

jl777, I've got a question in regards to dPoW. Do the NN run their own full node for each chain being notarized? and if so do they create the hash based on their own Nodes information?


[03-Dec-18 02:30 PM] SHossain#0007
They run full native node


[04-Dec-18 12:02 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries run a normal node to get the blockhash, all notaries participate in a randomized process to get consensus on the blockhash, then all the nodes in the network validate it


[04-Dec-18 12:02 AM] jl777c#5810
to call NN as centralized is like saying that when you send out a tx, it is centralized because only you were involved in creating the tx. it is a nonsensical point of view

Or a router... if tx goes through a router... is it centralized?


[04-Dec-18 04:20 AM] jl777c#5810
practically speaking minsigs over 18 has a hard time reaching consensus, but it can be set to some crazy high number like 50 and you wont ever get a consensus

NN is centralised because you have to rely on a third party who determines for you what the longest chain is and that reorgs, which are a normal thing with blockchains, can't happen anymore


[04-Dec-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
plz ignore that all nodes in the network validate all notarizations, invalid notarizations are ignored


[04-Dec-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the "third party" is actually a set of normal nodes that are generating a consensus among themselves and this hash is then validated by all nodes.


[04-Dec-18 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
claiming NN are centralized is like saying the tx you send out is centralized as only your node was involved in creating the tx


[04-Dec-18 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not the number of nodes involved in creating the tx that determines if it is decentralized, rather it is the number of nodes validating that does

using a third party decentralized solution does not make it centralized, it just makes it a third party enabled solution. which is likely the actual reason. they dont want to rely on any third party as they wrote all their codebase without the help from any third party


[04-Dec-18 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
they dont use any compilers or operating systems

[04-Dec-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the writeup is good, but I would use a much clearer example to disprove the "dpow is centralized" nonsense


[04-Dec-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the basic logic that is used is that some "small" number of 64 nodes gets to create the notarization and thus it is more centralized than not having these special 64 nodes. This is false logic!


[04-Dec-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
the level of decentralization is not based on how many nodes are participating in creating a transaction, but rather how many nodes are validating it. since all nodes validate all notarizations, it is as decentralized as any "centralized" tx that you make all by your self each time you create a transaction. Even though only one node is creating this transaction, it isnt centralized. the people claiming dpow is centralized is similar to claiming that anybody that sends a tx made on a single node is centralized.

[04-Dec-18 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you keep in mind that all nodes validating all transactions, this is the key to the decentralization as it avoids relying on any other node to tell you what happened

blockhashes seen by all nodes, notarized by a subset and then validated by all nodes. compare that to a transaction that a single node makes and it validated by all nodes

so is powers of TAU params just not used at all?


[05-Dec-18 02:11 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
I understand that powers of TAU was necessary first step to generate Sapling parameters


[05-Dec-18 02:12 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
"In order to ensure the toxic waste does not come into existence, our team designed multi-party computation (MPC) protocols which allow multiple independent parties to collaboratively construct the parameters. These protocols have the property that, in order to compromise the final parameters, all of the participants would have to be compromised or dishonest.

To this date, Zcash has created two distinct sets of public parameters. The first ceremony happened in October 2016 just before the launch of Zcash Sprout. The second was generated in 2018 anticipating the Sapling network upgrade later that year.

In the Sprout MPC, all participants needed to commit to their share of the ‚Äútoxic waste‚Äù in advance in order to protect against adaptive attacks. This meant that all of the participants needed to be available for the entire duration of the protocol, and nobody could abort without causing the entire protocol to abort. Participants needed to maintain custody of their hardware throughout the process, so this meant the ceremony could not scale beyond a handful of people.

The Sapling MPC allows participants join to the protocol, do their part and leave immediately. This allows the ceremony to scale to a large number of participants and take place over a longer period of time. It also decreases the surface area of attack for participants and avoids the need for expensive synchronization."

my understanding is powers of tau was part of the sapling parameters process


[05-Dec-18 02:26 AM] jl777c#5810
anybody that claims that having more people involved makes it worse, when just having a single honest person makes it secure is ignoring some basic math


[05-Dec-18 02:28 AM] jl777c#5810
odds of collusion among 100% of participants is a monotonic increasing function with more participants, ie. the more participants the higher the odds for it to happen. with 100+ people, it seems a lot more unlikely than 6. not that having 6 people all colluding was anything that was very likely

if there is a 51% attacker and a valid notarization is made, then there can only be one notarized chain, so the attacker would stop his own attack


[05-Dec-18 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so the only thing is for the attacker to prevent notarizations via collusion. but the absence of notarizations is in itself an indication that something is wrong, either the chain is not reaching consensus, or notaries are somehow colluding to not notarize


[05-Dec-18 06:21 AM] jl777c#5810
which means the worst case of dPoW is that it degrades to the state things would be without dPoW at all

So if you could control all the notaries and have them all submit the same invalid chain-states, would the validating nodes know the difference? Sounds like the validating nodes are just accepting some threshold number of replicated chain-states across the notaries.

Is this reply accurate:
"Validating nodes have their version of blockchain too. If one controls all notary nodes they can submit any chain state they wish, but it will only be accepted by the rest of the network if it follows the consensus rules. Once a chain state is submitted to the network, even notaries can't re-org it. So what ever chainstate is submitted, there will only be one valid chain ever. So double spending is not possible."

each validating node is a full node and has the full blockchain, as you say. and thus can easily tell if a notarization if valid or not


[05-Dec-18 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the validating nodes are using the usual satoshi consensus to extend the blockchain. when a notarization comes in, it makes sure that it is valid, ie. that it is in its current mainchain. if not, it is ignored


[05-Dec-18 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is, then it is marked as notarized and will in the future refused to reorganize it


[05-Dec-18 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a block that the validating node already had as in its mainchain

it is not trusting any external node about anything

`Got it, that's helpful - thanks! So there is still a problem of, if I know who the notaries are, I can potentially corrupt them. And as jl777 points out, that is as good as there being no notaries whatsoever. Which then opens up the KMD chain to 51% attack. But, I understand that the probability is low of that happening. It's just that, whenever there is a cap on participants who can notarize, that is always a strictly worse arrangement than having a market-based open system for anyone to participate in the notarization process.`


[05-Dec-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
not necessarily true. just because you have a market-baased open system for anyone to participate, doesnt mean that there is consistent participation. especially when it comes to upfronting BTC costs. what if you get only a sparse participation from the market based system as opposed to consistent dPoW notarizations? do you still prefer the market based system?


[05-Dec-18 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
until the market based system is proven to provide consistent notarizations, it is an unproven system to secure a chain

[06-Dec-18 11:17 PM] Mylo#8306
the NN "determine" the chain because they mine 75% of blocks that are verified across the network and every ~10 blocks multi sig agree (notarize) on the current blockhash (fingerprint) into bitcoin network

the process of notarizing into bitcoin every 10 blocks makes it very difficult to fork, because the network consensus (on every node) checks this notarization hash.   making block re-organization in the past very shallow and ineffective.


[06-Dec-18 11:22 PM] Deleted User#0000
If there is a community disagreement and half the nodes decide to notarise 1 chain and the other half anohter though... its the same. You cant really avoid a chain split/fork at least I think thats what he was reffering to ... like the split of BTC.

Hi Justin,
Thanks for the article. I think there are a some misunderstandings. On the recent Tech Tuesday for Komodo [1] I've detailed the process of dPoW that might clear up the caveats section?¬†
Figure 3 in your article is not possible. An attacker cannot mine past a notarization point and have the rest of the network just accept the attackers chain. If you read the Tech Tuesday (last article), the notarization hashes form part of the network wide consensus. The attacker does not have the recent hashes and will be ignored. The way you've drawn Figure 3 is just normal PoW ignoring dPoW features in the consensus.
Also, the KMD easy mining is only for KMD chain. Notary nodes do not get easy mining for any other chains.
Come to the komodo discord to discuss for any further discussion.
All the best with your writing, thanks for taking the time to check out dPoW‚Ää-‚Ääit has a history of protecting weaker chains.

[07-Dec-18 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
ALL nodes in the network need to validate blocks normally. ALL nodes in the network validate that all notarizations are valid. If anybody tries to reorg the chain past a validated notarization, it is rejected.


[07-Dec-18 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
What is a malicious block? If it includes a double spend, then it is invalid, and will be rejected. All blocks need to be valid to be validated


[07-Dec-18 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
Now the blocks that are not notarized are subject to the normal rules, but once notarized (and validated) it is not accepted to change it. any block that tries to change it is rejected. There is no valid block that is malicious, as it is a valid block. Once it gets notarized, then it cant change.


[07-Dec-18 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
At the moment of notarization, there can only be a single spend as at that moment in time the chain is valid, the notarization is valid, ALL nodes validate it. Once that happens, any tx that is notarized wont be able to be double spent as that would violate the notarization rule

the notaries notarize the public chain


[07-Dec-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise ALL the nodes in the network wouldnt validate it as a valid notarization


[07-Dec-18 09:07 AM] sgp#7572
Why do they need to do that though? Why not mine a private chain and only reveal to the network when notarized?


[07-Dec-18 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
how can it get notarized if it isnt public?


[07-Dec-18 09:07 AM] sgp#7572
They make it public as they notarize it


[07-Dec-18 09:08 AM] sgp#7572
but they notarize the data that doesn't include their transaction


[07-Dec-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i think you are missing that it is mutually exclusive


[07-Dec-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
a block is notarized or not


[07-Dec-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is privately mined, it cant be notarized and validated


[07-Dec-18 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
so the only way is to publish the private blocks and then notarize it


[07-Dec-18 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
once it is notarized, it cant be undone


[07-Dec-18 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
as the nodes already validated it with the initial tx


[07-Dec-18 09:10 AM] sgp#7572
Doesn't the ability to rule over any unruly PoW chains though also mean that they can rule over any non-malicious PoW chains? I don't understand how the scenario would prevent the notaries from acting malicious


[07-Dec-18 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no "ruling over"


[07-Dec-18 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
the notaries run normal nodes


[07-Dec-18 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
then then reach a consensus as to what a specific height blockhash is


[07-Dec-18 09:11 AM] sgp#7572
my point is simply to emphasize that the notarized blocks are valued more in consensus than non-notarized ones


[07-Dec-18 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[07-Dec-18 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
let me finish before you jump to your conclusion


[07-Dec-18 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
the notaries send out a tx with the height + blockhash of a recent block, usually 10 blocks from the last one


[07-Dec-18 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
this then gets mined by some miner (plz ignore that notaries easy mine KMD, that is nothing to do with notarization)


[07-Dec-18 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
now, when that notarization tx gets mined into a block, ALL nodes see it, ALL nodes check locally if indeed at the height that it had the same blockhash that they already had locally


[07-Dec-18 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no forcing a tainted block onto the other nodes


[07-Dec-18 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
if and only if a valid notarization is seen is the notarization height changed locally. this is done by all nodes (including the notaries)


[07-Dec-18 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
once we have this notarized (and validated by all nodes) height, each node then applies it as a test for all new blocks coming in. If it tries to reorg past the notarized height, it is rejected


[07-Dec-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
so, once a tx gets notarized, it cant be double spent


[07-Dec-18 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
this has been tested extensively internally and also live in the field


[07-Dec-18 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
dPoW does not protect blocks that have not been notarized yet, that uses the normal satoshi consensus


[07-Dec-18 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
@sgp curious as to what problems you see. I am eager to fix any actual problems


[07-Dec-18 09:22 AM] sgp#7572
What would happen in an example were a malicious notary creates a new chain from the point of the last notarization and notarizes the next block at the expected blockchain height? It's my understanding the nodes would drop the other PoW chain in favor of the malicious one


[07-Dec-18 09:25 AM] Mylo#8306
notarization is a multi-signature process between 13 randomly allocated nodes (out of the 64).  a single notary cannot "just notarize if they want to".  it is distributed process.


[07-Dec-18 09:25 AM] sgp#7572
yes, I understand that.

[07-Dec-18 09:26 AM] sgp#7572
@Deleted User in this case, it simply indicates notaries acting against the interests of the greater network, that's all


[07-Dec-18 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
one malicious notary cant do anything, so we need to assume enough malicious notaries are colluding.


[07-Dec-18 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
now what exactly do these colluding notaries do?


[07-Dec-18 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
they can publish a notarization for a (height + blockhash)


[07-Dec-18 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
if ALL the nodes in the network have that (height + blockhash) it is validated, if not, it is ignored.


[07-Dec-18 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
so what exactly does the evil notaries do?


[07-Dec-18 09:30 AM] sgp#7572
This example is simply to indicate that 13 colluding notaries have an opportunity to regulate the new block generation. I want to ask another question about how the network would work if these notaries have less mining power than the normal chain. If they have less mining power, would it just cause a hard fork and the two networks would operate independently?


[07-Dec-18 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
no they dont have the ability to regulate block generation


[07-Dec-18 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
that seems to be where you are assuming things that dont exist


[07-Dec-18 09:31 AM] sgp#7572
my understanding is that they would if they had the majority of mining power and had the ability to collude to create these notarizations


[07-Dec-18 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
the KMD mining ability is totally independent from the notarization process


[07-Dec-18 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, for KMD, yes if enough notaries colluded they could control the mining but they could only notarize the public chain, so even then they cant double spend


[07-Dec-18 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
with 25% of blocks mined by external miners, notaries even if 100% collude, still cant censor


[07-Dec-18 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
so colluding evil notaries on KMD (but not on any other chain) generate blocks, but they cant force invalid notarizations to be accepted


[07-Dec-18 09:35 AM] sgp#7572
> with 25% of blocks mined by external miners, notaries even if 100% collude, still cant censor

this is where I'm confused. couldn't they theoretically force a reorg to remove these blocks?


[07-Dec-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
not if it was notarized


[07-Dec-18 09:35 AM] sgp#7572
I'm talking about all future block issuance


[07-Dec-18 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
100% notary collusion would only get 75% of blocks


[07-Dec-18 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
now the colluding notaries are either notarizing or not. if they are, as soon as one of the external miners mines a notarization tx, the notarization locks the chain


[07-Dec-18 09:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if they dont, then there is no notarization and that is a signal in and of itself that something is wrong


[07-Dec-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
we have the dpowconfs for "confirmations" field where it stays at 1 until it is notarized


[07-Dec-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you wait for 2 or more confirmations, you basically wont trust a tx until it is notarized


[07-Dec-18 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
once it is notarized, (that means all nodes on the network validated it) then the network will reject any attempt to double spend


[07-Dec-18 09:38 AM] sgp#7572
let me walk through the concern I have in individual steps


[07-Dec-18 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
ok


[07-Dec-18 09:38 AM] Mylo#8306
dpow confs for reference https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/dPOW-conf.html


[07-Dec-18 09:39 AM] sgp#7572
at the moment I'm only looking at the future block generation, not any previous block replacement


[07-Dec-18 09:40 AM] sgp#7572
the normal KMD miners continue on their jolly way, mining blocks as normal. they add new, non-notarized blocks to the end of the chain


[07-Dec-18 09:41 AM] sgp#7572
the notaries also decide to mine, but they do so on their own chain from the point of the last notarization. if they have enough mining power, they would be able to keep up with the pace of the normal miners. at the moment, this chain doesn't mean anything


[07-Dec-18 09:42 AM] sgp#7572
at a certain point, the notaries mine a block with the same or greater block height than the normal miners, and they share their malicious chain and the accompanying notarized block to the network


[07-Dec-18 09:43 AM] sgp#7572
nodes look at both the normal chain and the diverging chain, notice that one is longer and has the notarization, and thus reorg and drop the normal chain in favor of the other one


[07-Dec-18 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
sure, that is just normal mining


[07-Dec-18 09:44 AM] sgp#7572
Does this make sense?


[07-Dec-18 09:44 AM] sgp#7572
yeah


[07-Dec-18 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
for users that are looking at the "confirmations" field, it stays at 1


[07-Dec-18 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
and then if it was in the evil chain, it gets notarized and goes above 1 and now cant be changed


[07-Dec-18 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
if it wasnt in the evil chain, then it goes back into the mempool


[07-Dec-18 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so , sure the notaries could maybe boost their mining by preventing their mined chain from ever being orphaned, but they still have to mine


[07-Dec-18 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a slight economic advantage equal to the normal orphan rate of mined blocks


[07-Dec-18 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
is this really the giant disaster to make you write such articles as you have?


[07-Dec-18 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
well the premise that all notaries will collude together is quite a remote possibility, so as long as there are no significant attacks possible it seems keeping NN spots open to all is the best way

So, the dPoW of the non-KMD chains is not affected by these malicious notaries mining because they cannot mine other chains to compete with miners.   dPoW is 100% safe for those blockchains.  no colluding notaries.


[07-Dec-18 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
also, if a notarized chain starts having regular reorgs all the way back to the notarization, then it becomes pretty clear the notaries are doing evil mining to boost their mining ROI

[07-Dec-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
even on non-KMD the notaries can gain a small bit, by orphaning competing chains


[07-Dec-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
if the average orphan rate is 1%, this is a 1% boost of revenues


[07-Dec-18 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
but it will be visible that it is happening and requires majority of notaries to colllude

[07-Dec-18 09:51 AM] sgp#7572
KMD could configure its clients to not reorg under certain conditions, but I am also concerned about the possibility of an attacker spinning up a number of malicious nodes. What would prevent these malicious nodes from ignoring the notarized blocks and attempting to reorg further? I understand existing nodes could reject these changes, but how would new users know what chain to connect to?


[07-Dec-18 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
the new users can find the current notarized chain by following the historical notarizations


[07-Dec-18 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so unless a new user is only connected to the attacker, then it will see  a notarization and tend to get back onto the notarized chain. however, when there are competing chains we do see some peers get onto the non-notarized chain for a while, especially if the alternate chain is longer. As soon as the notarized chain is the longest, then it reorgs to the notarized chain and is locked in.


[07-Dec-18 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not easy to maintain a competing chain without notarizations against the notarized chain with notarizations as one will reject the other, while the competing chain wont reject the notarized chain


[07-Dec-18 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
@sgp any other concerns?


[07-Dec-18 09:57 AM] SHossain#0007
Notary Nodes mines only KMD with easy diff, and NO other chain. They don't have power to reorg another chain based on mining.

@sgp normally "control over blockchain" --> The following malicious actions are possible:

2)censor transactions
3)mine empty blocks

Are you satisfied that a dPOW'd system won't allow double spends?


[07-Dec-18 10:00 AM] sgp#7572
To be honest not really. I understand that a built-in protection against reorgs past a notarized block could complicate things, but I don't see how an attacker still couldn't attempt to fork off at a past point, run with it and make it longer than the notarized chain, and then throw a bunch of nodes on the network to cause confusion


[07-Dec-18 10:01 AM] Alright#0419

we have seen some cases where a node ends up on the longer chain and rejects the notarized chain as it is not compatible with it, but in this case "confirmantions" stay at 1

now you can play games by reorging a chain if it doesnt have notarizations, but whatever the currently valid chain is on a node, is a valid chain as far as that node is concerned

I don't see any situation where user would have to verify they are on the correct chain from a 3rd party source


[07-Dec-18 10:14 AM] Alright#0419
if there node gets *1* peer that is on the valid chain, their node will sync that chain


[07-Dec-18 10:14 AM] sgp#7572
if an attacker forks an old block, makes the chain longer, and gets a successful notarization, it would at the minimum cause a lot of confusion. at that point, it seems that the network would be protected by individual nodes' local caches. new participants would select the malicious chain as accurate


[07-Dec-18 10:15 AM] Alright#0419
What attack are they performing?


[07-Dec-18 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
but once the longer chain gets a notarization, that is the notarized chain.


[07-Dec-18 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the one thing you did find was that notaries have the power to orphan competing miners blocks back to the last notarization and have a much lower orphan rate


[07-Dec-18 10:16 AM] sgp#7572
@Deleted User I'm specifically referring to reorgs with two chains, each with their own set of valid notarizations


[07-Dec-18 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
this economic benefit is <1% increase in mining revenues and requires collusion of majority of notaries and expenditures of 51%+ mining power


[07-Dec-18 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
and it can be detected. so it isnt very economic and they will be caught. seems not a very practical attack


[07-Dec-18 10:17 AM] gcharang#6833
The very fact that a conflicting notarization came in, implies that the network is being attacked


[07-Dec-18 10:18 AM] sgp#7572
The difference is it for a longer history, allowing for notarization confirmations and double spends


[07-Dec-18 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no double spends, you keep making that up


[07-Dec-18 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
@sgp you need to think through the blocks being added to the chain and apply the notarization rules, not just make up that double spends are magically possible. what sequence allows a double spend of a notarized transaction???


[07-Dec-18 10:20 AM] sgp#7572
I'll have to make another diagram later to show you what I mean, but at this point I'm running out of time. ironically, it looks similar to the post I made earlier


[07-Dec-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
you cant double spend a tx in a notarized block


[07-Dec-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
since the notarized block cant be reorged, it cant be changed


[07-Dec-18 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
which means any utxo spent in a notarized block cant be double spent


[07-Dec-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
you can double spend non-notarized tx


[07-Dec-18 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
but once it is notarized, it just cant be undone. we have tried and tried to break this without any success


[07-Dec-18 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
the only advantage is notaries can gain a bit of mining ROI by the orphan rate, but that requires collusion that is detectable and actually 51% attacking a chain. no double spends of notarized tx


[07-Dec-18 10:25 AM] Alright#0419
likelihood of being able to pull that off is *slim*


[07-Dec-18 10:25 AM] sgp#7572
before I go (I dispute the above), do you have a formal analysis for your dPoW setup? anything beyond the whitepaper and recent blog post I should be referring to?


[07-Dec-18 10:26 AM] Alright#0419
getting a better mining ROI by getting notaries to collude


[07-Dec-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
checkpoints work to prevent reorgs past that checkpoint


[07-Dec-18 10:26 AM] Alright#0419
you would need significantly more than 13 notaries to collude because notaries can't pick and choose who they will notarize with


[07-Dec-18 10:26 AM] peritonlogon#7708
@sgp there seems to be a lot of talking past each  other  here.  Why not just perform your attack and prove you're right?


[07-Dec-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
dPoW is not doing anything mathematical, it is purely about the implementation


[07-Dec-18 10:26 AM] SHossain#0007
@peritonlogon i wanted to suggest the same


[07-Dec-18 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the formal analysis is that if a block is not reorged, no tx in that block can be double spent


[07-Dec-18 10:26 AM] SHossain#0007
try if you can double spend notarized tx and show us


[07-Dec-18 10:27 AM] SHossain#0007
he can also try that


[07-Dec-18 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the notaries can suppress notarizations


[07-Dec-18 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
but dpowconfs allows all nodes to detect lack of notarizations


[07-Dec-18 10:27 AM] SHossain#0007
how many nodes he can align by the attackers side?


[07-Dec-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
for attack analysis we assume 100% notary collusion


[07-Dec-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
we show even in that case, there is no meaningful attack


[07-Dec-18 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
I believe I have done that but @sgp feels there is still some chart that will show me notaries can double spend

yes, it is an interesting angle and we did find that colluding notaries can gain a bit of mining ROI to 51% mine a notarized chain


[07-Dec-18 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
but it will be detected, hard to miss reorgs with every notarization

@jl777c I still find that attack vector entirely implausible

it assumes that there aren't honest notaries


[07-Dec-18 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but that is what attack analysis is


[07-Dec-18 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
assume the worst and if the worst is a bit of mining ROI gained by orphaning competing chains, with the expenditure of 51% hashrate and it is discoverable


[07-Dec-18 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
if that is the worst, then you evaluate that it is not any practical issue


[07-Dec-18 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but if a suicidal attack could do massive double spends, that is one thing


[07-Dec-18 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
in this case it is an uneconomic attack

[07-Dec-18 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
but with the number of notaries, when there have been chain splits, the notaries stop notarizing as they cant reach consensus


[07-Dec-18 10:43 AM] GlorymanRTS#0512
because you see Komodo block chains work on delayed proof of work. All computers must approve of the mathematical result before a transaction is executed.


[07-Dec-18 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
realistically such a chain split will require corrective actions, ie. resync on nodes that end up on the shorter chain


[07-Dec-18 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
new nodes will automatically go to the longer chain, we have seen this


[07-Dec-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you end up on the shorter notarized chain, then you need to resync


[07-Dec-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but such things only happen very rarely and there is a way to resolve it, just messy


[07-Dec-18 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind all chain splits are a messy business


[07-Dec-18 10:45 AM] GlorymanRTS#0512
Komodo also creates a back up of itself to a different block chain, this is notarization.


[07-Dec-18 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
what conditions?


[07-Dec-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
that is very unlikely, as notaries wont reach consensus if there is a chain split


[07-Dec-18 10:47 AM] GlorymanRTS#0512
can this be prevented by making another notarized layer, like a back up of the notarized chain. Therefore adding another layer of secuirty?


[07-Dec-18 10:48 AM] GlorymanRTS#0512
ah, i see.


[07-Dec-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
that is very unlikely, as notaries wont reach consensus if there is a chain split


[07-Dec-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if it does happen, we certainly notice it and notary on the wrong chain, resync


[07-Dec-18 10:49 AM] GlorymanRTS#0512
So, what are the main factors causing the notaries to reach consensus


[07-Dec-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
agreement about (height, blockhash)


[07-Dec-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if they have the same hash, they reach consensus


[07-Dec-18 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
if by rare condition two chains are both notarized, the notaries wipe out the wrong chain and eventually all nodes sync to the right chain. eventual consensus after a messy mess

Thank you for this very interesting discussion, should we expect an attack on Komodo to definitively prove the solidity of dPoW?


[08-Dec-18 02:29 AM] jl777c#5810
it has been tried, but even skeptics now seem to admit that rewriting notarized blocks is futile, so now they are saying the big giant problem is that if all the notaries collude they can get a slightly higher mining ROI for notarized chains if they get more than 51% the hashrate for that chain. Of course, they will be found out quickly, and if it wasnt notarized they could just do double spends, but this is the worst attack so far discovered with all the notaries colluding to do evil


[08-Dec-18 02:30 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, our notaries are good people and they wont be doing any such colluding, it was just a thought experiment to find out what is the worst case

In this case it is obvious that the worst situations can be found in everything and therefore no technology is ever really perfect.  But there are solutions that sometimes remain the best in a specific field and this is the case of dPoW for blockchain security.

[08-Dec-18 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
chainB wont be accepted by nodes


[08-Dec-18 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
even evil notaries wont be able to convince them to accept it as the notarization already happened after the third block


[08-Dec-18 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
anything at or prior to the notarization will be rejected, by nodes that have validated a notarization


[08-Dec-18 10:38 AM] sgp#7572
Let's take diagram 1 and say a specific node saw chain B first. Would it reject chain A?


[08-Dec-18 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
first you need to realize the second slide scenario wont happen, as both A and B cant be notarized


[08-Dec-18 10:45 AM] sgp#7572
I'm talking about diagram 1 right now


[08-Dec-18 10:46 AM] sgp#7572
chain B doesn't have a notarization in diagram 1


[08-Dec-18 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, in that case a node sees chain B, but it wont be notarized


[08-Dec-18 10:47 AM] sgp#7572
right, so the node would accept chain B as correct, and ignore chain A, correct?


[08-Dec-18 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
chain B node will be operating as normal rules


[08-Dec-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
when chain A becomes longer than chain B, the normal rules apply and chain B node will reorg to the longer chain A.


[08-Dec-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
at that point it sees the chain A notarization and wont switch back to B


[08-Dec-18 10:49 AM] sgp#7572
all right, I understand where you are coming from there


[08-Dec-18 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
so in a chain split, nodes on the non-notarized chain can switch to the notarized one, but not the other way around. this reduces the time it takes for the "eventual consensus"


[08-Dec-18 10:50 AM] sgp#7572
understood


[08-Dec-18 10:51 AM] sgp#7572
now on to diagram 2


[08-Dec-18 10:51 AM] sgp#7572
can you explain why a notarization of the second chain isn't possible?


[08-Dec-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
all the notaries are running a full node and they need to reach consensus as to the (height + blockhash)


[08-Dec-18 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
since we have a chain A notarization after the third block, that means chain B is dead to the notaries and from the above discussion we see that a node wont switch from notarized to non-notarized


[08-Dec-18 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so the notaries wont switch to chain B and thus cant reach consensus for the chain B notarization


[08-Dec-18 10:53 AM] sgp#7572
by they need to reach consensus", are you referring to all the notary nodes or the 13 nodes?


[08-Dec-18 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
all the notary nodes reach consensus and 13 of them sign


[08-Dec-18 10:55 AM] sgp#7572
can you speak more about the consensus process where they all get on the same page?


[08-Dec-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
for a given notarization, the notaries are numbered from 0 to 63, the one that is 0 changes each notarization to give each notary equal chance over time to participate in notarization.


[08-Dec-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
now all 64 nodes broadcast to each other their notarization data


[08-Dec-18 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
along with the info they got from the other notary nodes


[08-Dec-18 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
based on this, nodes propose the 13 signers for this round such that all of them are in agreement.


[08-Dec-18 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
at first there is maybe not so many nodes that agree on all details


[08-Dec-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but the proposal with the most support is switched to by notaries that are not already there, so after several rounds things converge so that we get 13 nodes all in agreement


[08-Dec-18 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
then this is latched and the 13 nodes generate signatures, broadcast them


[08-Dec-18 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
all the nodes reconstruct the 13 way signed tx and broadcast it


[08-Dec-18 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it is actually quite a process and took a while to get it efficient with a high completion rate


[08-Dec-18 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
the notaries are tuning their systems to maximize the number of notarizations they participate in and you can ask them about the randomness, it is not possible to know ahead of time which 13 nodes the group will converge to


[08-Dec-18 11:02 AM] sgp#7572
so if even 1 node disagrees on the notarization, they can't notarize anything?


[08-Dec-18 11:02 AM] sgp#7572
actually wait let me think more


[08-Dec-18 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
it is resistant to a single node disagreeing


[08-Dec-18 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
all nodes can make proposals for the selected 13


[08-Dec-18 11:06 AM] sgp#7572
all right, so of the 64, 13 are selected who get to make decisions. all nodes propose blocks to notarize. do you need all 13 people to agree for a proposed block to be notarized?


[08-Dec-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[08-Dec-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is the 64 as a group that decides


[08-Dec-18 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
there are a LOT of possible 13 signers of 64, mathematically 13 choose 64


[08-Dec-18 11:08 AM] sgp#7572
what do the 64 as a group decide?


[08-Dec-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
so a deterministic algo is used to reduce the selected 13 for each notarization round, but still there are thousands of possible 13


[08-Dec-18 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
a 64 bit number is used as a bitmask to denote the chose 13


[08-Dec-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
the requirement is that it starts from the current iterations node 0


[08-Dec-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
must have 13 bits set


[08-Dec-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and each node in the bitmask must have the identical data


[08-Dec-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so this bitmask cant be created until several iterations of comms between all the nodes


[08-Dec-18 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
then nodes start proposing the mask to use


[08-Dec-18 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
nodes tally what the other nodes see and determine which is most popular


[08-Dec-18 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
they then switch if they are not already using the most popular mask


[08-Dec-18 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
critical is that all 13 signers agree on the mask, as if the other nodes select a bitmask, but any of the 13 are not also in agreement, it wont sign it and the notarization wont work


[08-Dec-18 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
it is somewhat similar to mining, randomized and hard to predict which 13 "win"


[08-Dec-18 11:17 AM] sgp#7572
yes, the 64 have a process for randomly selecting the 13. and if even 1 of the 13 disagrees, then it does not get approved


[08-Dec-18 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
over the years, the algo was improved to select the 13 that are all in agreement


[08-Dec-18 11:17 AM] sgp#7572
is there some sort of time-out process? what if 1 node disagrees with everything in perpetuity? can the 64 nodes select 13 other random nodes?


[08-Dec-18 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i must not have explained clearly...


[08-Dec-18 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not about 1 node agreeing or not


[08-Dec-18 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
all nodes broadcast to all other nodes what it things should be the 13, also it broadcasts what the other nodes sent to it


[08-Dec-18 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
so all the nodes can see what they get directly and also what the other nodes are seeing


[08-Dec-18 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
given that, they are able to select the 13 who are in agreement


[08-Dec-18 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
and converge to the 13


[08-Dec-18 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
if a node doesnt agree, and doesnt shift to the winning 13 bitmask, it is just ignored


[08-Dec-18 11:19 AM] sgp#7572
ok, makes more sense thank you


[08-Dec-18 11:20 AM] sgp#7572
you always select 13 nodes that are in agreement


[08-Dec-18 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
the group does


[08-Dec-18 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
using what is basiscally a decentralized process, even if only 64 nodes


[08-Dec-18 11:21 AM] sgp#7572
suppose there are two factions, each with 30 nodes, that are in disagreement. how would the selection process work?


[08-Dec-18 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
in a chain split scenario, consensus is not reached


[08-Dec-18 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
13 out of 64 does not sound like a giant percentage, but if there is any significant disagreement, the notaries wont be able to settle on a bitmask for 13, with all 13 signers agreeing to it


[08-Dec-18 11:24 AM] sgp#7572
how many nodes need to be in disagreement for them not to agree on selecting the 13 nodes?


[08-Dec-18 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
there is not exact threshold, but I estimate approx one quarter to one third


[08-Dec-18 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
you have to understand that unless there is a chainsplit, there is agreement on all nodes


[08-Dec-18 11:28 AM] sgp#7572
yes, but that's sort of like a statement like "there is no disagreement if everyone agrees." I'm trying to predict attacks that could happen if people disagree. Thanks for answering my questions so far. I will think more about the situation and get back to you if I have any other questions


[08-Dec-18 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
to create disagreement, the chain needs to be split


[08-Dec-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are mining in private, then none of the notaries would have that chain, so it needs to be broadcast, but if it is broadcast then it is subject to the notarization rules


[08-Dec-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
I guess if an attacker starts mining from the last notarization and propagates it to many nodes, well if they do that, it becomes the mainchain and gets notarized


[08-Dec-18 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
basically everything needs to be working properly for notarizations to happen. the notary operators can attest to this. so absence of notarization is a good signal that some sort of blockchain event is happening


[08-Dec-18 11:43 AM] sgp#7572
one last question: let's assume the unlikely event of 100% notary collusion. would they be able to notarize chain B as shown in figure 2, and if so, would nodes on chain A reog to chain B?


[08-Dec-18 11:53 AM] sgp#7572
yes, exactly


[08-Dec-18 11:54 AM] sgp#7572
I want to know what other nodes would do in that scenario


[08-Dec-18 11:57 AM] sgp#7572
would the process of switching to chain B from A be automatic?


[08-Dec-18 12:00 PM] sgp#7572
it seems to me that it would depend on how the code was written. if it's written for a node to never reorg past the last notarized block it has in its cache, then it would have to be manual. but if it's written for a node to never reorg past the latest notarized block it can find, then it could be automatic as it finds the latest one on the other chain


[08-Dec-18 12:01 PM] sgp#7572
I'm reading the logs now


[08-Dec-18 12:04 PM] sgp#7572
from what I can tell, the answer was to a different scenario


[08-Dec-18 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
if the chain B is the real chain and becomes much longer than chain A, then nodes will switch automatically


[08-Dec-18 12:05 PM] sgp#7572
even if chain A has a valid notarization after the split point?


[08-Dec-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean for new nodes.


[08-Dec-18 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
if a node got the chain A notarization, then they are stuck onthat chain until they invalidateblock the one with the notarization


[08-Dec-18 12:06 PM] sgp#7572
so that would require a manual pop process

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[08-Dec-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
usually a resync wont be needed, just to invalidate the chain A notarization, but that is up to each node


[08-Dec-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so any attempt to switch the main chain from A to B via notarizing B, this is a very noticeable process


[08-Dec-18 12:07 PM] sgp#7572
I understand it is very noticeable


[08-Dec-18 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
and there would need to be overall consensus on which chain it is the correct chain


[08-Dec-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
trying to get a double spend through via this mechanism is not very practical. it would be much easier to 51% attack a non-notarized chain


[08-Dec-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
my claim is that dPoW isnt perfect, but it sure is better than without having dPoW for a chain without a large hashrate


[08-Dec-18 12:14 PM] sgp#7572
yeah, but it by no means lives up to KMD's marketing that it has the security of KMD+BTC. In our discussions these past two days, we've talked about limitations where the attacker doesn't touch BTC at all. I plan to make another writeup that more clearly indicates the situations that can occur and what the possible damages are. I appreciate your time


[08-Dec-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
the notarynodes are validating to BTC


[08-Dec-18 12:19 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And the consensus of the protected chain


[08-Dec-18 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
sgps point is that if the notaries collude they can create confusion


[08-Dec-18 12:22 PM] sgp#7572
even without notary collusion, a 51% attack with the longest chain would create confusion for nodes


[08-Dec-18 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
even without notarization, a 51% attack can cause confusion AND double spends


[08-Dec-18 12:23 PM] sgp#7572
and with notary collusion, they could notarize a different chain, contradicting their previous notarizations


[08-Dec-18 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
the evil notaries can 51% attack a chain easier than if it is a notarized chain


[08-Dec-18 12:24 PM] sgp#7572
yes, a 51% can create double spends even without notary collusion for dPoW. That;'s the main point I'm trying to get across


[08-Dec-18 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
no, i mean a chain without dPoW


[08-Dec-18 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
you have not shown any case where a double spend can happen on a dPoW chain


[08-Dec-18 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
and just because you repeat that over and over, does not make it true


[08-Dec-18 12:25 PM] sgp#7572
this is exactly what figures 1 and 2 show the opportunity for


[08-Dec-18 12:25 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just do the attack if you can


[08-Dec-18 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
where is the double spend?


[08-Dec-18 12:25 PM] sgp#7572
figure 1 shows you can convince the network to use a different chain, even before the point of last notarization


[08-Dec-18 12:25 PM] sgp#7572
figure 2 shows you can convince the network also, but with added notary node collusion


[08-Dec-18 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
you can convince a node that didnt see the notarized chain that there is chain B


[08-Dec-18 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
once it is notarized, it cant be double spent


[08-Dec-18 12:26 PM] sgp#7572
if they resync, that's not true


[08-Dec-18 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
if they resync, chain A wins


[08-Dec-18 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
as it has the notarization


[08-Dec-18 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
chain B would never get above 1 "confirmations" as it never got a notarization


[08-Dec-18 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
so anybody on chainB wouldnt honor any payment


[08-Dec-18 12:27 PM] sgp#7572
that's a local user config though


[08-Dec-18 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
i think you are ignoring the part of following whether a tx is notarized or not


[08-Dec-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so if the user (exchange) allows deposits after 1 confirmation, then maybe you can double spend on the non-notarized chain


[08-Dec-18 12:28 PM] sgp#7572
I understand there are limitations that are put in place, but these simply make the attack harder, they do not make it impossible


[08-Dec-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
you are only talking about attacking the non-notarized chain, which doesnt have a notarization, so doesnt have the notarization protection


[08-Dec-18 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
dPoW protects the notarized chain, not the non-notarized chain


[08-Dec-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
you shouldnt be misrepresenting that notarization doesnt prevent double spends


[08-Dec-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
you can clarify that non-notarized chains can be double spent


[08-Dec-18 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
practically speaking what exchange credits altcoins after 1 confirmation??


[08-Dec-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i would say the attack even on the non-notarized chain is MUCH harder


[08-Dec-18 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
and for the notarized blocks, not possible


[08-Dec-18 12:30 PM] sgp#7572
jl777c that's semantics though, since you could replace the notarized chain with a non-notarized or even a different notarized one. That argument is basically saying that you can't double-spend if you only use one chain, which we know is false since an attacker spins up a different chain


[08-Dec-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
there is only one notarized chain


[08-Dec-18 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
it is either notarized or not notarized


[08-Dec-18 12:31 PM] sgp#7572
unless collusion, which we discussed


[08-Dec-18 12:32 PM] sgp#7572
@Deleted User you could say the same for a 51% attack


[08-Dec-18 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
that attacker can spin up a different chain, but it is either notarized or not

[08-Dec-18 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810

@Alright I did not make a new post yet


[08-Dec-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
chainB was never notarized


[08-Dec-18 12:34 PM] sgp#7572
It is in figure 2


[08-Dec-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
so it never gets the protection from notarization


[08-Dec-18 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so you finally agree that in figure 1, there is no double spend?


[08-Dec-18 12:34 PM] Alright#0419
chain b would never get notarized


[08-Dec-18 12:34 PM] Alright#0419

Your "what if" is a chain split due to differing consensus rules


[08-Dec-18 12:35 PM] sgp#7572
Figure 1 is a double spend to people who do not require a notarization, or simply count the # of block confirmations. It is not a double spend for people who count notarizations

@Deleted User not 100%, that was just the example


[08-Dec-18 12:36 PM] Alright#0419
transactions aren't truly secure until they're notarized


[08-Dec-18 12:36 PM] Alright#0419
so don't accept them as a deposit until they are


[08-Dec-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
but even if figure 2 happens, where is the double spend? each node is either on chain A or chain B


[08-Dec-18 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
and there is a massive chain split event for the community to resolve


[08-Dec-18 12:37 PM] sgp#7572
jl777c if an attacker makes a payment in chain A that is notarized (and therefore confirmed), then creates chain B with no transaction included


[08-Dec-18 12:37 PM] Alright#0419
chain B doesn't exist


[08-Dec-18 12:37 PM] Alright#0419

it's orphaned by the entire network

"improbable", but even there would be issues with figure 1


[08-Dec-18 12:38 PM] Alright#0419
Again, your "what if" is based on a chain split due to differing consensus rules

weird


[08-Dec-18 12:40 PM] sgp#7572
jl777c sure, but they could need it for a deposit, or a number of other scenarios, such that it was after a recent notary election, etc


[08-Dec-18 12:42 PM] sgp#7572
in this case, the attackers could use the notarization to their advantage, since services look for one notarized block confirmation rather than several normal blocks


[08-Dec-18 12:43 PM] sgp#7572
gives a 51% attacker an easier time since they need to produce fewer blocks


[08-Dec-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
again you dont understand and leap to conclusion


[08-Dec-18 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
the number of confirmations stays at 1, until there is a notarization, after that it is normal


[08-Dec-18 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so if an exchange makes no changes to the existing confirmations, it only makes it wait for notarization and never any easier

[08-Dec-18 12:44 PM] sgp#7572
I understand that. My point is that instead of waiting for 10 or so blocks, they only wait for 1 notarized block, which is less total work to attack


[08-Dec-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
no


[08-Dec-18 12:45 PM] freakbros#9074
How is this guy holy sheep shit Batman


[08-Dec-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
they should wait for 10 confirmations as normal, it just stays at 1 confirmation until a notarization


[08-Dec-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
so 10 is still 10


[08-Dec-18 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
unless it is more than 10 if the notarization took longer


[08-Dec-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
a notarized "10" is NEVER less than 10


[08-Dec-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems you are so eager to find some horrible flaw


[08-Dec-18 12:46 PM] sgp#7572
can you explain again the conditions where the software reports 1 or 2 confirmations?


[08-Dec-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
which is fine, but if you are not basing it on facts then it is fantasy


[08-Dec-18 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
the logic is that it reports as 1 confirmation until it is notarized


[08-Dec-18 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
it might never report 2 confirmations

so for chain B it stays at 1


[08-Dec-18 12:48 PM] sgp#7572
it could still be an issue of elections or some other situation though


[08-Dec-18 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
what does elections have to do with anything?


[08-Dec-18 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the worst that happens with new notaries is that maybe there are not enough and there are no notarizations until they are


[08-Dec-18 12:49 PM] sgp#7572
the elections would change the pool of notary node participants. if someone is not currently a notary node but knows they will be one in a few days, they could attempt this

[08-Dec-18 12:50 PM] sgp#7572
figure 2, where they make a deposit on chain A, then attempt to notarize chain B


[08-Dec-18 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
convince all the others to do a difficult to do chain split, dual notarization, combined with a double spend and convince the community to adopt the chain where they didnt deposit to the exchange that was 51% attacked? that scenario?


[08-Dec-18 12:51 PM] sgp#7572
You asked why someone would do so after creating a false notarization, and I'm giving some examples


[08-Dec-18 12:51 PM] Alright#0419
@sgp best to just ask us how the election works instead of making assumptions about it then basing attack vectors on those assumptions


[08-Dec-18 12:51 PM] sgp#7572
I never claimed they were practical


[08-Dec-18 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so impractical and uneconomic fantasy attacks?


[08-Dec-18 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
that is what you are making a big deal out of?


[08-Dec-18 12:52 PM] sgp#7572
no, I still find figure 1 concerning, since even if an attack isn't successful, it would severely slow down the network. there are other considerations, but you only seem interested in talking about a 51% attack


[08-Dec-18 12:53 PM] freakbros#9074

[08-Dec-18 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
@polycryptoblog there is no provision that prevents any to any within a cluster, but the GUI could limit all destinations to a single chain


[08-Dec-18 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
unless it is critical it can only go to a single chain

could happen with no malicious intent


[08-Dec-18 12:57 PM] Alright#0419
again unlikely


[08-Dec-18 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but it needs to be combined with a precisely timed 51% attack


[08-Dec-18 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
and then to convince the community to allow the double spend as the split chain will need to be resolved by the community


[08-Dec-18 12:58 PM] Alright#0419
get an exchange on each chain, sell same coins on both


[08-Dec-18 12:58 PM] Alright#0419
no 51% attack involved at all


[08-Dec-18 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
the important thing to observe is that even though it is theoretically possible, it would be much easier to 51% attack a chain without dPoW


[08-Dec-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
why add notarization to make things harder to attack


[08-Dec-18 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
in the event of a chain split, it'd be fairly hard to send the same coins to different addresses on each fork


[08-Dec-18 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
so it doesnt really increase the risk exposure to 51% attacks, in fact it seems to reduce the potential 51% attackers to the notaries


[08-Dec-18 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
not really related to what I was just saying, but I was trying to think of how you would even do that


[08-Dec-18 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
in a chain split, it splits really cleanly into two independent chains


[08-Dec-18 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
we've seen chainsplits that share mempool


[08-Dec-18 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
never understood how that happened


[08-Dec-18 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
DEX split in ~Feb


[08-Dec-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so using the chain split notarization for 51% attack, reduces the possible attackers to notaries, from everyone. seems an improvement


[08-Dec-18 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
mempool can have tx that havent been spend on either chain

@sgp even in case you are intentionally trying to find a problem in dPoW while there is nothing found, I enjoyed the whole conversation. Would love to see more of such conversations here again. 

I agree on the point that dPoW is not perfect, but I absolutely disagree with you that any of the marketing that Komodo Platform Team has done is either false or misleading. 

I still encourage you to feel free to ask as many scenario you can make up.

If you could find any legitimate loophole in the dPoW you for sure be even rewarded for your findings.

So far I see you couldn't find any.

Yes we have pos64 and versus Pos.. I think versus version only works with versus hash low though, and is fixed at 50%


[10-Dec-18 01:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Pos64 generally stable and works quite well, but does see some inconsistent block times.

I have not tested versus pos at all, but it seems to work find for verus. :)


[10-Dec-18 01:56 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
As I understand VerusPoS is flexible to adjust it's percentage of consens when creating an assetchain. It is possible to create less or more percentage than 50% VerusPoS chain.
Thanks for clearing on PoS64.


[10-Dec-18 01:56 AM] jl777c#5810
I call it Pos64. veruspos should work with equihash, but 50% is all it does

Hello @jl777c 

we in the German Telegram Channel are a little annoyed about Dr. Julian Hosp. You know him? Co-founder Ten-X and THE face in Germany, when it comes to crypto.

We know that a few months ago he was informed about Atomic Swaps via Twitter. He was in direct contact with some developers of Komodo.

He now claims that the Comit network, in which TenX is involved, makes Comit the world elite in atomic swaps. In detail, he speaks of an ERC20 swap about Lightning. No one would have done that before and Comit would be the world's elite. 

Can you say anything about that? Has Komodo ever done ERC20 on Lightning?


[12-Dec-18 01:29 AM] jl777c#5810
we havent done ERC20 on lightning. years ago i did what I call subatomic swaps, which were incrementally transferring value 1/777th at a time. It was really no big deal, so I didnt make any press release out of it. I didnt like the performance aspect as it required 777*2 small offchain transactions to complete and anything goes wrong during the process and things are left in an inbetween state. with a normal atomic swap, it either happens or unwinds so that it is as if it didnt happen. so any claim of atomicity when using lightning would need to have caveats, like it isnt actually atomic if the channel fails, or is closed, etc.

That's the one. In German-speaking countries, he is slowly being unmasked by those who looked up to him in the beginning and fell into it.
People, who deal more intensively with crypto currencies, see meanwhile the shadow side. But he does it well, is on German TV. Sells well, he used to be a doctor, professional surfer, sunny boy and TenX founder. Slowly the facade of the "Saubermann" (I translate it with "serious business men") is crumbling.

[19-Dec-18 10:47 AM] sgp#7572
@jl777c does Komodo search for the chains with the greatest work, or the greatest number of blocks? I'm trying to figure out how the notary nodes' mining of blocks with low difficulty factors into this


[19-Dec-18 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
it uses the standard consensus rules for the non-notarized chain


[19-Dec-18 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
and the NN easy mining is only for KMD, no other chain


[19-Dec-18 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so this seems to mean a shorter chain with more work could do small reorgs of the notary mined blocks, not giving notary mined blocks any special protections


[19-Dec-18 11:05 AM] sgp#7572
all right, so the chain with the most work put onto it. thanks


[19-Dec-18 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
that is notarized


[19-Dec-18 11:08 AM] sgp#7572
we already discussed this but just to be especially clear: suppose a node is on chain A with total work 100. It sees chain B with a more recent notarization, but the total work is only 50. It does not switch over. No issues with this, right?


[19-Dec-18 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
chain A is notarized? if so and B is in conflict, that node will stay on A


[19-Dec-18 11:10 AM] sgp#7572
chain A has 100 work and chain B has 50 work. both are notarized at point A shared between both chains. Chain B is also notarized at point B exclusive to chain B


[19-Dec-18 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the notarization is not messing with chain weight calcs, it is just filtering out new blocks that try to reorg a notarization, and all notarized blocks were achieved by global consensus as to the chain as of a recent height. Given those changes to the normal consensus rules, is the answer to what each node will do. 

In your example, you say both are notarized at point A, so all nodes have that notarized block. How could chain B then be the consensus block if it only hash chain work of 50? It seems chain B would not be a legal one as chain A has more weight, but if chain A is part of chain B, how can the weight of be end up at 50?


[19-Dec-18 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
A chain needs to be legal for there to be a consensus that it is notarized at any given height. If it is illegal, then no node would accept the notarization


[19-Dec-18 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
Only very small changes to the consensus rules were made. it is not like any random chain can be notarized and pushed onto all the nodes


[19-Dec-18 11:15 AM] sgp#7572
I'm not talking about the notarization process, I'm discussing a situation where one chain without a notarization has more work than the notarized chain


[19-Dec-18 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
i must have gotten confused as that is not what I read...


[19-Dec-18 11:15 AM] sgp#7572
there are many circumstances where this could be possible


[19-Dec-18 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
a chain that is not notarized cannot reorg a notarized chain


[19-Dec-18 11:16 AM] sgp#7572
notice how I never mentioned reorgs at all, let's put that aside for now


[19-Dec-18 11:16 AM] sgp#7572
suppose a node is currently on the longer chain A


[19-Dec-18 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
There are 2 places in the main.cpp that implement the dPoW. Where it currently looks at checkpoints and where it tries to disconnect the tip


[19-Dec-18 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the checkpoint code rejects any block that is earlier than a checkpoint


[19-Dec-18 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the disconnecttip change returns an error if it is the notarized block


[19-Dec-18 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if a node is on the longer chain A with a notarization, the above two rules would make it so it wont see blocks from chain B

that would be great. will have a bounty for it of course


[20-Dec-18 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it waits for the chain to obtain consensus and then makes what is basically a 13of 64 multisig tx as what is basically a proposed notarization


[20-Dec-18 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
then the nodes check to see if it is in their mainchain and updates their notarization state if it is


[20-Dec-18 11:18 AM] Ashley <3#8888
I'm looking at the gamecredits PR that added Komodo, and curious how the proof system. How does the GC chain actually get the notary proofs? Are they submitted to the GC blockchain as some special tx, or do nodes monitor some external network?


[20-Dec-18 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
PoS chains tend to have much less issues with 51% but having an external reference solves most (all?) the objections against PoS consensus


[20-Dec-18 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
normal nodes just look for a the 13 vin 1 output notarization tx in the blocks as they come in


[20-Dec-18 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
we cant assume that all nodes are connected to any other chain


[20-Dec-18 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the notarization tx puts the notarization height and blockhash in the opreturn

reading some of the answers to the questions that were posted. Interesting discussion.

@GlorymanRTS  Just like interesting new crypto tech that I come across üòÉ I'm a co-founder/lead dev on Qtum, though this isn't related to that. Just a personal interest


[20-Dec-18 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
the notarization p2p network runs a decentralized protocol and it doesnt submit the local notarization tx until the tx to the other chain is succeeded. Since the txid of the notarization is needed to be put in the local chain data, this is a prerequisite


[20-Dec-18 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be possible for all nodes to cross check the other chain for the notarization txid, but currently we are not doing that as we cant assume a node will be running both KMD and BTC


[20-Dec-18 11:25 AM] GlorymanRTS#0512
@Ashley <3 I was looking for some accessible and interesting articles on the comparison of KMD, raven coin, ethereum,  ripple, monero ect.


[20-Dec-18 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
@GlorymanRTS can you wait with your questions till later?


[20-Dec-18 11:26 AM] Ashley <3#8888
If a user node ran a local electrum/light wallet instance of btc (and kmd if you have that), they could use that to simply check that the notarization txid exists on btc/kmd though?


[20-Dec-18 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it would indeed be possible to do that


[20-Dec-18 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
thats a good idea! I can add an SPV crossvalidate option


[20-Dec-18 11:28 AM] GlorymanRTS#0512
ok


[20-Dec-18 11:28 AM] Ashley <3#8888
As it is right now though, if you had some group of colluding nodes, they could in theory communicate in private and submit a different notarization proof to GC than they do to the notary p2p network and/or kmd/btc?


[20-Dec-18 11:30 AM] Ashley <3#8888
That was where my idea got stuck heh... that and mine didn't involve a notary system at all, it was rather just some "here's proof that this chain existed at this point in time" which is useful for preventing long (>500 block) stake attacks... but then if it's consensus, it needs some way to communicate with BTC


[20-Dec-18 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
but it would need to be validated by all nodes as exisiting on the GC mainchain, by each node


[20-Dec-18 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
so yes, 13 evil notaries could create notarizations that dont follow the notarization p2p protocol


[20-Dec-18 11:31 AM] Ashley <3#8888
but only when they all win the lottery... I'm curious though of what effect that would have


[20-Dec-18 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
but the only advantage I have seen is they can boost their mining ROI by orphaning competing chains


[20-Dec-18 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
a notarization that a node sees that is not in its mainchain is just ignored, so has no effect


[20-Dec-18 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
this problem does seem to require a set of trusted nodes to be the oracle for blockhash data


[20-Dec-18 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
private chains are invalidated with a notarization


[20-Dec-18 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but in an evil notary cabal scenario, what we want is notarizations to have no effect


[20-Dec-18 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
which they can certainly do


[20-Dec-18 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and if there are no valid notarizations, the local node can rely on the dpowconfs method to detect there is some network event happening


[20-Dec-18 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/dPOW-conf.html


[20-Dec-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
recent discussions show that more confusion can be created by notaries if they ignore the delay, so I am considering adding the delay requirement to the consensus rules.


[20-Dec-18 11:36 AM] Ashley <3#8888
How do nodes determine the dpos-conf number? That'd require going off of the GC chain right? Like using a block explorer or that SPV method I said


[20-Dec-18 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
it uses the locally validated notarizations


[20-Dec-18 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so if invalid notarizations are submitted, the dpowconfs "confirmations" stays at 1


[20-Dec-18 11:37 AM] Ashley <3#8888
Also what do you mean about the delay?


[20-Dec-18 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the notarizer p2p protocol adds a delay before notarizing, usually 10 blocks


[20-Dec-18 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
this allows the network to reach consensus normally and get 10 blocks deep


[20-Dec-18 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
if a chain fork in parallel does not resolve after 10 blocks, then it seems there is a viable chain split happening and in such a case, the odds are very good that the notaries wont reach consensus


[20-Dec-18 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
without the delay, it would allow evil notaries to get a chain that hasnt reached full consensus yet to be the notarized chain


[20-Dec-18 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
this seems to be most of the attack scenarios people have come up with.


[20-Dec-18 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
we never had had any evil notary, let alone a majority colluding group of notaries, so this has not been any issue, but we could make it even theoretically impossible by requiring a 10 block (or 10 minutes worth) delay for a notarization to be valid


[20-Dec-18 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
a bit nervous about such a change as i can see in some cases not all nodes will be in consensus


[20-Dec-18 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
"fixing" these theoretical attacks can actually make things worse....


[20-Dec-18 11:44 AM] Ashley <3#8888
Ah, interesting. So that'd also resolve the issue in a chain split where no notary is malicious, but they disagree because their node is synced to a different fork


[20-Dec-18 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
that case is already solved


[20-Dec-18 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
the notaries run a stochastic protocol where the big majority needs to be in sync 100% or the notarization round fails


[20-Dec-18 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
so we see during times of an ongoing 51% attack, the notarizations slow down or stop as the network splits, then when it resolves, notarizations start again


[20-Dec-18 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why we came up with dpowconfs, to allow nodes to detect the network problems and to not transact any large amounts during this time


[20-Dec-18 11:49 AM] Ashley <3#8888
How does the network resolve a major split, developer intervention/blessing of one side of the chain?


[20-Dec-18 11:49 AM] Ashley <3#8888
ie, does it require developers or someone talking to the notaries to get notarization back to operation?


[20-Dec-18 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[20-Dec-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the only case where that would be needed if two different chains get notarized, which is quite unlikely and even in such a case (it happened once due to not all notaries having updated in time for hardfork), eventually it resolves itself.


[20-Dec-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as the miners are extending the notarized chain, it resolves very quickly, faster than normal as once you switch to the notarized chain, you dont switch back.


[20-Dec-18 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is "sticky"


[20-Dec-18 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
in the once case where multiple chains got notaries, we had all the notaries on the wrong chain to sync to the correct one and once that happened the rest of the network has an easier time to converge. but conflicting notarization is not anything that can be done without being notcied, it creates a messy situation


[20-Dec-18 11:54 AM] Ashley <3#8888
interesting. So in case of a chain split involving some programming bug that allowed both chains to be valid depending on network view. The devs could release some bug fix that invalidates the other fork. Notaries upgrade to that new wallet. They then begin notarizing the now only valid chain. Users with old software could then start seeing the notarizations and get pulled back onto the proper chain


[20-Dec-18 11:55 AM] Ashley <3#8888
Super interesting concept. Wonder if it could be exploited for a new type of fork in between soft and hard

{Reactions}
ü§î (2) PeepoThink 

[20-Dec-18 11:56 AM] Ashley <3#8888
Is there some communication channel for the notary nodes to be informed of a hard fork or other need to upgrade chain software?


[20-Dec-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, there are comms channels for notaries, it is its own sub-community that is quite active


[20-Dec-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
the incentives are setup for the notaries to want to notarize as much as possible


[20-Dec-18 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
so their game theory is to run the compatible notarizing p2p code

And these chain proofs... They're submitted to KMD network and then eventually make it into BTC. Does this work by BTC basically containing a proof of the overall KMD network? Or are multiple BTC proofs submitted for each blockchain/other notary operation? I assume the former, but just making sure


[20-Dec-18 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD notarizes to BTC which notarizes all tx on the KMD chain


[20-Dec-18 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
other chains notarize to KMD via tx, which was notarized when KMD is notarized


[20-Dec-18 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the former


[20-Dec-18 12:00 PM] Ashley <3#8888
That's what I was figuring. So to authenticate a proof on BTC, you'd also need to authenticate it on KMD


[20-Dec-18 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the KMD notarization would have a BTC txid, which can be checked on BTC

oh ok. Probably be back sometime later with more questions. Super interesting concepts here. Could even be something to consider for Qtum, though I'm not sure the 1 hard fork per year is something easy to sell, even if there's already at least 1 fork per year scheduled


[20-Dec-18 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the alternative is to have some dynamically updated process to update the notaries


[20-Dec-18 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
but that would mean the dynamic update being 100% correct. maybe we can work on that together?


[20-Dec-18 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
I had an initial implementation of ratifying a new slate, but that was 2 years ago and it wasnt reaching the ratification threshold, since then many notarizer aspects were improved so maybe it would work now, but we are doing annual hardforks for other things anyway


[20-Dec-18 12:11 PM] Ashley <3#8888
we have some tech that could be used for that. Unfortunately very poorly documented, but it's called decentralized governance protocol. Basically a way to change certain parameters on chain through a smart contract that implements voting.... The problem is who votes to change to the new keys and controls that power, even if it was restricted to only being changed at some certain time every year


[20-Dec-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
I used the notaries themselves to ratify the new slate of notaries


[20-Dec-18 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why 50% of them are automatically reelected so we always have notaries who want to ratify the new slate


[20-Dec-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
definitely willing to work with you to get a dPoW2.0 for QTUM


[20-Dec-18 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
I guess for QTUM you would have the QTUM stakeholders to approve a new slate


[20-Dec-18 12:14 PM] Ashley <3#8888
Well if it's always pegged to Komodo, it'd make the most sense for the previous notaries to be the voters, maybe with 75% requirement or something like that


[20-Dec-18 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, they could vote on the QTUM blockchain using their pubkeys to be validated. ok, that works


[20-Dec-18 12:16 PM] Ashley <3#8888
Anyway, talk later. Have to work on some other stuff now


[20-Dec-18 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe a bit lower than 75% as if such a super majority cant be achieved, it wont be able to be updated.

@stefjazar following from beam.mw site (it is alternate implementation to grin):
BEAM will support around 17 transactions per second. While this number is higher than Bitcoin and existing privacy coins, it is important to emphasize that it is not high enough to use BEAM as means of exchange. In the future, it will be possible to improve transaction throughput by using a second layer out-of-chain solution such as Lightning, Thunderella or similar. Then you should be able to pay for your lattes with BEAM. Until then, BEAM‚Äôs primary use case is store of value rather than day-to-day payments.

In BEAM, one block will be created approximately every minute. Each block will contain around 1000 transactions.

Instead of storing the full transaction history as in Bitcoin and other coins, a BEAM node only needs to store the current UTXO state, instead of entire transaction history. Validity of the history that brought us to this state can be confirmed by storing only the headers of the previous blocks which hold the proof of validity of previous states (using a structure called a Merkle tree) and Proof of Work that allows to reach consensus on which of the header chains should be considered the correct one in case of blockchain branching. This is achieved using cut-through, one of the core concepts in Mimblewimble.
We are still experimenting and evaluating, but it is a reasonable estimate that BEAM blockchain will be around 1/3 of Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain or less (assuming the same amount of activity).

approx the same


[22-Dec-18 04:04 AM] jl777c#5810
tx/s is very dependent on how many zutxo per tx,  it is more like 30 zutxo/sec throughput, which can be 30 tx/sec, 15 tx/sec 5 tx/sec, all depending on average zutxo per tx

but the MW protocol requires sender and receiver to both be involved. initial implementation uses a direct connection, but I hope the tx can be split into two halfs to gain noninteractiveness


[26-Dec-18 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea about grin implementation, just been fiddling with beam as it is in C++


[26-Dec-18 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
you can cancel a tx that didnt complete, so it isnt any loss of funds issues, just works in a way very different than other crypto so some additional work is needed. for v1 release i think just a working implementation is a great achievement

Thanks for your answer. I was an Ico investor in Supernet and I know the original vision change over the years. Is there plan for Supernet going forward?

i do try to increase the long term NAV with strategic trading, but as largest KMD holder, what is good for KMD is good for SuperNET. Over next year or so, I hope that 100% of the initial capital raised would have been revshared out. that would make any remaining value pure profits. The problem is that there isnt really anybody else that helps me with SuperNET side of things and only so much I can do

[02-Jan-19 04:22 AM] owerache#0341
Thank you I found more information about reddit it's not quite what I thought it was... but it remains an interesting topic... I was already investigating the generation of the 2FA sequence..


[02-Jan-19 04:26 AM] Dave123#3592
The asset holdings where there as a reserve for development cost and for investing and acquiring new rev streams. Supernet had a big vision in the beginning but it seems there is noone actively working on it anymore or even a future plan. So what is the point in keeping the Supernet asset holdings and not distribute it to the Supernet holders?
I as an investor am trapped in an iliquid asset.


[02-Jan-19 04:30 AM] owerache#0341
I was planning to develop a hardware + screen that would show me my 2FA keys in relation to different private keys


[02-Jan-19 04:35 AM] jl777c#5810
@Dave123 if in 2019 we cant get more forward movement with SuperNET, it will be something to be considered.


[02-Jan-19 04:44 AM] jl777c#5810
the downside is by doing this, it would prevent any future developments for the various other assetchains and it is a step that cant be undone


[02-Jan-19 05:18 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
please correct me if i'm wrong here jl777, but my understanding of supernet asset is that all the different elements of the ecosystem like CRYPTO, DEX, JUMBLR, PANGEA etc will start to produce revenues with ever increasing volumes.

is is just way too early to expect to see this. yes, the lack of liquidity can be/ is an issue for some people, but the intrinsic value of SUPERNET does not increase with more back-and-forth trading of the SUPERNET asset, but with the adoption of the underlying projects that SUPERNET own.

this reminds me of a saying of Warren Buffett: "I try to invest in such companies that even when the markets will be turned off for 10 years, i will still be confident that my investments are doing just fine" more liquidity is always good, but there is just too much emphasis on short term speculation.

SUPERNET is not an instrument for short term speculation, but a long term view on whole blockchain ecosystem. i suggest NOT to dismantle it. people just have to understand what they invest in.


[02-Jan-19 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
thanks. i guess if there are more people that feel this way and can help with developing the other assetchains, then it wont all be up to me


[02-Jan-19 05:21 AM] SHossain#0007
i would also agree that SUPERNET is not for short-term. hodl is the way since the SuperNET ico


[02-Jan-19 05:26 AM] Dave123#3592
You could distribute 90% of the asset holdings and keep 10% for future opportunities in KMD. I bet noone would be opposed to this.
No offense but the asset holdings of Supernet also lack accountability.
You are the one with the private kees and noone is able to verify if these coins are really in your possession or not and if something happens to you these holding are gone.


[02-Jan-19 05:31 AM] Dave123#3592
@crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy I am by no means a short term investor but I see little progress being made on Supernets original vision. There seem to be also very little further development cost so why not distribute these funds? I am not suggesting to dismantle Supernet at all.


[02-Jan-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
realistically without 90% of the funds, there is no way any meaningful development can be done with any of the assetchains


[02-Jan-19 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
even with 100% of the funds in bear market conditions there isnt enough


[02-Jan-19 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so if there will be a distribution it will be to shutdown the SuperNET


[02-Jan-19 05:37 AM] jl777c#5810
this process will take quite of bit of my time to do, so the path of least resistance is for things to proceed as they are. for people that want to cashout, maybe we can start an OTC trading?


[02-Jan-19 05:37 AM] jl777c#5810
or agree to price here and close trade on the exchanges it trades on


[02-Jan-19 05:44 AM] Dave123#3592
Hi so what develpment of assetchains are you referring to? I was curious about future plans for revenue streams but it seems all pretty vague.


[02-Jan-19 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
first step is to get a project manager for each


[02-Jan-19 05:46 AM] Dave123#3592
each?


[02-Jan-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
or just one


[02-Jan-19 05:47 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
most active assetchain now is probably DEX with marketmaker2.0 in development @Dave123


[02-Jan-19 05:48 AM] Dave123#3592
you are talking about CRYPTO, DEX, JUMBLR, PANGEA or what are you referring to?


[02-Jan-19 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
PANGEA and BET are also in progress via CHIPS


[02-Jan-19 05:48 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
yes, them too


[02-Jan-19 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
CRYPTO is basically complete as it is notarization fees


[02-Jan-19 05:49 AM] jl777c#5810
JUMBLR has been done, but few people use it so it is not such a direct revenue source


[02-Jan-19 05:50 AM] Dave123#3592
Ok maybe I just lost track along the way and things are still evolving.


[02-Jan-19 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
so really most of the tech aspects are complete or near complete


[02-Jan-19 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
I just dont have the bandwidth do to more than help on the tech side


[02-Jan-19 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and the strategic investing


[02-Jan-19 05:50 AM] Dave123#3592
Why is it that there is still very little volume on baterdex?


[02-Jan-19 05:51 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
Dave, all the info is out there, but not neatly packaged. one has to make an effort to keep on top of things


[02-Jan-19 05:51 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
makertmaker1.0 has some shortcomings


[02-Jan-19 05:51 AM] jl777c#5810
its not mm1 but the GUI for mm1 that have the shortcomings


[02-Jan-19 05:51 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
this is why MM2.0 is being done


[02-Jan-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
mm2 will allow simple GUI to be more effective


[02-Jan-19 05:52 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
it's the combo between gui and mm


[02-Jan-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
but still people like to use CEX more than DEX


[02-Jan-19 05:52 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
classic chicken-and-egg stuff


[02-Jan-19 05:54 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
not enough volume -> so people don't come
people don't come because not enough volume


[02-Jan-19 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if people want faster progress, some will need to step up. otherwise it is to wait as i make slow progress


[02-Jan-19 05:55 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
HyperDEX is a very good example of stepping up


[02-Jan-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
or we can just shut it down to appease the need for liquidity


[02-Jan-19 05:56 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
why on earth should things be shut down, because some people feel impatient?


[02-Jan-19 05:56 AM] Dave123#3592
@jl777c Ok maybe you can make an short update for Supernet holders on how things are progressing if you find some time. Its really hard to not loose track after all that time.

[02-Jan-19 06:06 AM] Dave123#3592
I invested and follow a lot of crypto projects but somehow I completely lost track of the SuperNET/Komodo developments. I think other projects do a better job in updating people and putting out the information what they are working on.


[02-Jan-19 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, if enough large SUPERNET holders come forward with request to liquidate, i will honor that


[02-Jan-19 06:06 AM] Dave123#3592

@Dave123 how much SUPERNET do you want to sell?


[02-Jan-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there are buyers


[02-Jan-19 06:29 AM] Dave123#3592

Thats the problem. Making an update once in a while about direction of development an progress would save you a lot of time by not answering questions to people like myself

[02-Jan-19 09:10 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
@Dave123  why do insist on concentrating on supernet? vast majority of updates regarding komodo tech also mean that "supernet stuff" is being improved.


[02-Jan-19 09:13 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
yes, it is possible to do better communication, but if you already have done your homework to invest in supernet then you understand that entails mainly concentrating on komodo ecosystem

[03-Jan-19 07:29 AM] dan.#2473
Supernet has always been interesting to me, i was also in at ICO. but i opted out and parked myself in komodo instead when mm1.0 was at its peak. the 5 percent reward and (in my opinion) gains will be larger with kmd itself. and, the illiquidity was worrisome. if there was a CC way for supernet to auto-buy and auto-sell holdings on bdex like an ETF, it could trade near NAV and be fully liquid. Though, as KMD is the base to get Supernet, there's a myriad of problems with this, such as being able to auto-buy-sell WAVES or auto-buy-sell illiquid holdings like some assetchains.


[03-Jan-19 07:36 AM] dan.#2473
if this could be solved, Supernet could exist indefinitely and people who want the NAV can get it


[03-Jan-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure how that would work without slippage and a large amount


[03-Jan-19 05:35 PM] richardt#2807
I don't think it's a good idea to liquidate SN at this point or anytime soon.  But, it might be a good idea to have a little summary of how fees collected have been flowing and maybe a forecast of when to expect the next dividend payout.


[03-Jan-19 10:13 PM] jl777c#5810
barterDEX is the main revenue engine other than dPoW fees. There are explorer addresses that show the dPoW fees. I just need to find some time to summarize things. short answer is we are a long ways to go before next revshare due to 80% correction of bear

`VBK currently accounts for roughly 19% of all Bitcoin mainnet transactions. `

I think if it pays the fee it's not spam, however @VeriBlock made about 1 million bitcoin tx with op_return from the 1st of December 2018, they call Proof of Proof but is it more Proof of Spam? Why more than one tx per block? https://t.co/As40AAr57E

1 million tx since 1st december? this seems crazy to me

I think they are full of it.  1 million BTC tx , with low fee of .0001  is 100 BTC .

@Alright yes, it's bad, that means less space for LN to save BTC

I dont know if you feel like answering to this kind of questions but here it comes. What are your thoughts regarding Greg Wright and his claims to be satoshi? He seems smart but very aggressive on his talks and especially on twitter account.  I just really cant rule out of that possibility.... Has anyone else done research on him? If you ask why and who cares.  Well it is that he has said to be destroying btc with his million coins. @jl777c


[08-Jan-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
he does not seem to be technically knowledgable enough to be satoshi


[08-Jan-19 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
seems after the police raid of him, he is acting against the interests of crypto


[08-Jan-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
his rhetoric during the SV fork was quite silly


[08-Jan-19 06:12 AM] Mark81#4505
Why is he pushing so hard to just get laughs?


[08-Jan-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
it overlooked that the moment ABC chain mined an incompatible block, there was no hash war, since there are two chains. one chain having more hash has no effect on the other. having no replay protection made doing tx risky. so the entire hash war was fake


[08-Jan-19 06:15 AM] Mark81#4505
Nobody with enough right mind would do that and to me he is either insane or really what he vlaims yo be. In his talks on youtube he speaks actually in away that he believes those things actually happened to him. ü§î

[08-Jan-19 08:23 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
is there any chance a compromised (50%+ attack) block makes it into the BTC Chain via the dPoW mechanism, if the attack is not recognized within the 10 minute timeframe?


[08-Jan-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
what does that even mean?


[08-Jan-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
a block is valid or invalid


[08-Jan-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is invalid, it isnt valid


[08-Jan-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is valid, it is valid


[08-Jan-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
only valid blocks are notarized


[08-Jan-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
in other words, notarizations allows to differentiate between two valid blocks


[08-Jan-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no need to differentiate invalid blocks as invalid blocks are not valid


[08-Jan-19 09:17 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
so any manipulated blocks cannot pass the validation process and be notarized into the BTC blockchain?


[08-Jan-19 09:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
block validation is a work of miners


[08-Jan-19 09:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
not notary nodes


[08-Jan-19 09:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
well to be more accurate, notary nodes validate a block just like any other regular network nodes


[08-Jan-19 09:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the network nodes having a full copy of blockchain on their machine


[08-Jan-19 09:21 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
how does the notarization knows it was not manipulated by an attack?


[08-Jan-19 09:22 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
I mean the notary nodes, how do they know


[08-Jan-19 09:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you the regular user have the bitcoin wallet with full blockchain on your machine.
and there is a double spend tx happened, you understand how that block with invalidate tx is invalidated?


[08-Jan-19 09:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is based on verifying the data from local synchronised database and the data coming from the network  validated by a miner


[08-Jan-19 09:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if a early block had the same tx spent, it invalidates the new double spend tx


[08-Jan-19 09:23 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
yes, and in case someone has more then 50% manipulated blockchain copys?


[08-Jan-19 09:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it is the usual satoshi consensus


[08-Jan-19 09:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the addition what dPoW adds to that is it adds a consensus rule of making it *impossible* to reorg the block height past the notarised block


[08-Jan-19 09:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if for example a last block known to be notarised is 2 blocks ago


[08-Jan-19 09:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the only time span is the time between the next notarised block you can plan and try any kind of 51% attack


[08-Jan-19 09:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
not so sufficient time


[08-Jan-19 09:25 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
you can only manipulate the last 10 Minutes that still are not notarized, yes, that I know


[08-Jan-19 09:26 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
but what prevents that a new manipulated block gets through?


[08-Jan-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
you are confused


[08-Jan-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
you are assuming there is an "evil" block and a "good" block


[08-Jan-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
but there is only valid blocks and invalid blocks


[08-Jan-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is valid, it is valid


[08-Jan-19 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless of who mines it, if a block is valid, it is valid


[08-Jan-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
once it is notarized, then it is prevented from being overwritten, even if there is a longer (otherwise valid) chain


[08-Jan-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
if an attacker is secret mining what he hopes to be the longer chain that double spends, the moment a height is notarized that is after the start of his secret chain, his secret chain is no longer considered


[08-Jan-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
the public chain is what gets notarized


[08-Jan-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
as the notaries can only see blocks that are public


[08-Jan-19 09:30 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
yes I may be confused, but I got that part, that the past blocks cannot be altered anymore if protected by dPoW. What I still not get 100% is, what prevents the notary nodes to be manipulated and to add a valid block, but some that was manipulated (is that posssible?)


[08-Jan-19 09:30 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
@tobias what matters isn't that a block is 'good' or 'evil' according to miner's intentions, it matters only that it can't be overwritten. An attacker can produce as many blocks as he wishes but, unless he can overwrite a previous block, there's no actual attack taking place!


[08-Jan-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming you corrupt the majority of notaries, you could make them make up any sort of invalid notarization


[08-Jan-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
which would then be IGNORED by all the nodes, that are validating all notarizations


[08-Jan-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
notaries that are not corrupted only notarize valid blocks


[08-Jan-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
but regardless, ALL nodes (miners,wallets, etc) are validating ALL notarizations


[08-Jan-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
so in a majority notary corrupted scenario, you cant prevent the wrong block from being notarized, but it wont have any effect as it is an invalid block and ignored by the rest of the network


[08-Jan-19 09:37 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
ok, but what happens to the notarized history then, if the last wrong block is already in the BTC chain as well and is ignored? Is it pulled then? I cannot imagine how it works as the blocks are nested.


[08-Jan-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
invalid notarizations are IGNORED


[08-Jan-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
what part of that is confusing?


[08-Jan-19 09:41 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
the last sentence you wrote I understood, that it could theoretical happen that a wrong block gets into the BTC chain via dPoW, or did I misunderstand?


[08-Jan-19 09:41 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
and I understood, that it would not be a problem, because that wrong block would be ignored then


[08-Jan-19 09:42 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
or did you mean it different?


[08-Jan-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
in the EXTREMELY unlikely event a wrong block gets into the BTC chain, it is IGNORED


[08-Jan-19 09:42 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
yes, ok


[08-Jan-19 09:42 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
that I udnerstand


[08-Jan-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
dPoW protects even against the extremely unlikely


[08-Jan-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
and all nodes validate


[08-Jan-19 09:42 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
yes, I believe that


[08-Jan-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
the only trust given to notaries are to differentiate between valid blockhashes and selecting the notarized chain


[08-Jan-19 09:43 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
and how can the blocks be ignored? by skipping? and the next block notarized is referring to the current block - 2  ?


[08-Jan-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but the normal consensus rules are always running and notarizations are crosschecking against that


[08-Jan-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
if a notarization is ignored, it is exactly like it didnt happen at all


[08-Jan-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
ignore, as in pretend it doesnt exist


[08-Jan-19 09:44 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
so it reffers to current block - 2


[08-Jan-19 09:44 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
?


[08-Jan-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
what referal?


[08-Jan-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
you are assuming things that dont exist, are somehow existing


[08-Jan-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
nodes check for valid notarizations


[08-Jan-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
if they see one, they update the notarized height


[08-Jan-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
dont overcomplicate it


[08-Jan-19 09:45 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
I thought that blocks are referred to the last block before


[08-Jan-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
nodes check for valid notarizations
if they see one, they update the notarized height


[08-Jan-19 09:48 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
ok, maybe I got it. So nodes are going through all the notarized blocks and those who are wrong are ignored, right? I mean, if someday that even would happen


[08-Jan-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
a notarization is a normal transaction


[08-Jan-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
as a new block comes in, it is scanned for a valid notarization


[08-Jan-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
by valid notarization, that means it is a valid block already in that nodes blockchain


[08-Jan-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if it sees such a notarization, it updates its state to have a new notarized height


[08-Jan-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
the other thing it does is that if it sees a block trying to overwrite a notarized block, it rejects it


[08-Jan-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
that is all that it does


[08-Jan-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
99.9% it is the same as normal consensus for the chain


[08-Jan-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no magic


[08-Jan-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
just scanning for valid notarizations and updating the current notarized height


[08-Jan-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is any magic, it is in the creation of the notarized tx, but the NN take care of that


[08-Jan-19 09:56 AM] Tobias Nunes#4493
ok, thank you, I think I understood it now.


[08-Jan-19 10:41 AM] richardt#2807
Just a thought:  Komodo could have a technology demonstration for more people to understand how the security mechanism works.  Create a test blockchain with dPOW enabled and try to 51% attack it and see what happens.  Has this been done before?


[08-Jan-19 12:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@richardt it's happened to EMC2 by an attacker pre-announcing the attack, and also Hush DPoW was recently tested by KMD people, to verify it works correctly. And it did üòÉ

Nice.  It would be pretty amazing for KMD if ETC decides to go with dPOW to secure itself.  It seems to me they're at a dead-end and need some kind of solution fast or people will stop trusting it altogether.

It requires you to problem solve independently way more than windows and most people aren't going to be able to do that. That's a big thing people forget paid services and software tend to have a alot of support behind them for help whereas open source won't due to that help not being funded.

@jl777c I know you must be sick of this question as it has been mentioned not only here but on forums/tweets talking about Komodo, but I see people talking about dPoW being "centralized". As you said once, Komodo's tech has too much for any "elevator pitch", but: What would be a simpler and more friendly way to explain that dPoW isn't centralized and something that people can trust?


[09-Jan-19 07:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
dPoW Notary Nodes are not primarily miners.
NN are like any other regular network nodes in any blockchain network.
They don't have the powers to easy mine a blockchain, except KMD.
They can not invalidate a block or reject a block since not being a miner.
Like any other regular network node, NN just accept or rejects the block based on verifying the validity of the block by checking it's local full blockchain data, against the data shared with the network peers.
NN has only 1 main power:
- Participate in Notarizing the block they get from network.
- Or don't participate.
That's the most weakest power they have, intentionally.

Just finished reading the Reddit exchange with Taek from three weeks ago. Amazing how someone with his proven intelligence and integrity can so hugely misjudge your character.  There's so much "drive by" analysis in crypto, and in the world in general. He seems to have pieced together a story based on just a couple of poor assumptions, and a whole lot of lack of information on publicly available information.

If you don't trust links, the text is this : 

So why not ask the community to pitch hardware through a network?

I've heard kmd can do wonders as long as they have the processing power to do so, and that this is what prevents you guys from showing off a little (like with the 1 million tx/s test). As a kmd hodler I was wonder if you could create a network that all of us can contribute cpu and let the chain(s) show off a little. Would do wonders to have people talking about how many tx/s you did with the help of the loyal community. Maybe I'm missing something, but no-ones talking about kmd speed (my friends don't even know anything about you).

Any thoughts on this?

j cooper¬Æ (bearmanpig)üè¥:
Anyone wanna comment on this I saw on Reddit?
When NEO or other chains talk about scaling to *n* TPS, they mean *n* TPS being processed by that one decentralized chain.

Komodo has very little native scalability, it instead adds a lot of different chains together, with a shared state being created every few minutes. 

E.g, On their scaling presentation, they noted achieving 20k transactions per second with 1024 blockchains. That means each blockchain has a limit of a little under 20 transactions per second. *n* for Komodo is 20, it's just 20x*1024. 

Say NEO hits 100k TPS, then starts 1023 copies. That's 102,400,000 TPS. Apparently. Would those copies be adequately decentralized? Probably not. 

So, it's a neat way around the scalability problem and a good thought experiment, but Komodo's asset chains don't scale and lack of decentralization (and in my eyes, that means lacking any value because I can have a faster and less complicated private server using AWS).


Is this a valid point?


[15-Jan-19 10:12 PM] jl777c#5810
first it is off by an order of magnitude, each chain can do about 200 tx/sec
second, last time I checked, a decentralized blockchain was decentralized
third and most importantly, what sense is it to have ALL transactions on a single blockchain? that means all users need to sync all other users data to run a full validation node.


[15-Jan-19 10:13 PM] jl777c#5810
we solve the scalability issue without requiring anybody to have TB of data and GB/sec bandwidth. surely having a practical solution is much much more important than having everything centralized in a single chain


[15-Jan-19 10:14 PM] jl777c#5810
I flip it back and say that any single chain that tries to handle all transactions will fail due to all the transactions, so clearly things need to be parallelized. I just designed it so it starts parallel, stays parallel and people just need to sync the chain they care about


[15-Jan-19 10:16 PM] jl777c#5810
already in the ecosystem there are almost 50 chains. this is an ecosystem capacity of 10,000 tx/sec, yet people only have to run the chain they care about. So the scaling is already happening and it works so well, nobody even realized. remember the runtime forks are all running the identical executable as KMD itself. it isnt that big of a stretch to claim the combined tx/sec for all the chains


[15-Jan-19 10:17 PM] jl777c#5810
using cross chain proofs allows many chains to have a single total supply if they are in a cluster. migrations between chains being automatic and without a counterparty.


[15-Jan-19 10:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you can do N times as many tx/sec, automatically transfer coins between chains without anybody else involved, then aside from the inconvenience of this crosschain transfer we have indeed achieved the combined tx/sec


[15-Jan-19 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the crazy thing is that projects like ETH are combining all the tx into a single chain and then wanting to split it out into smaller portions (sharding) and this is somehow ok? but a solution that starts out as independent chains and stays as independent chains that can do cross chain, that is not?

From my experience If you're not going to build daemon from source code - it's possible to run the daemon on even very low specs (just need big swap). I've succesfully ran the nodes on  very tinny AWS instances (like a 1/2 core). But it might take very much time to build on such machine


[15-Jan-19 11:34 PM] TonyL#3577

but you cant use rockets, the gases mess up the vacuum, so it needs to be electric

On some point tech should evaluate organically to such super roads. Like a when 1Mb memory in PC was a super high tech - it was possible to make a 1 Gig cluster but needed 1000 of 1Mb instances

just because everybody else is working on the wrong problem to solve, doesnt mean that komodo solution isnt valid


[16-Jan-19 12:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i just cant see a non-centralizing way a single chain can scale up in usage. you end up with TB chains needed GB/sec bandwidth, so really other than massive data centers you need to use lite wallets, ie. centralized


[16-Jan-19 12:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the komodo solution is the most decentralized possible solution to this problem. the fact that it isnt some theoretically pure solution isnt relevant when all the alternatives require unscrambling an omelet into the original eggs or TB +GB/sec centralized monsters that force lite wallets


[16-Jan-19 12:28 AM] jl777c#5810
dont compare to some fantasy ideal case when there are ZERO other scalable solutions

Sorry to change subject.

I have a scenario I'd like some direction on plz:
1.  There are two addresses: Rxyz1 & Rxyz2
2.  The blockchain is currently at block 10,000
3.  I would like to create a rule where Rxyz1 can only send to Rxyz2 when the height is at 10,9XX.
4.  In fact I am happy for Rxyz1 to send to Rxyz2 anytime in the blockchain life it is 100 blocks before the next thousand.  e.g. 11,9XX, 12,9XX, ... ... 505,9XX 

What is the best way?

5.  Instead of 505,9XX can we use a method similar to "time based sapling activation" that says 100 blocks after 9am UTC the transaction will be valid.
6.  Can we make transactions valid between set hours, e.g. 9am-5pm

?

the heir CC is similar to this

[16-Jan-19 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
you have a designated pubkey as heir


[16-Jan-19 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
you then have a special address that you can spend freely at any time


[16-Jan-19 12:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the heir can only spend if you dont do any spends for a specified amount of blocks


[16-Jan-19 12:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so you could setup a similar CC where there are constraints on when a specific pubkey is allowed to spend, how much, etc.


[16-Jan-19 12:38 AM] jl777c#5810
this CC does not exist, but CC are turing complete -> anything you can write a program for can be implemented


[16-Jan-19 12:38 AM] jl777c#5810
so the answer to the question of whether a CC can do X? is the same as the answer to the question "is it possible to write code that does X"

Here is the thing in my world every thing is about bargaining or trade of units (assets)
We are born and die with one Wealth In French we call that ‚Äúla th√©orie de l‚Äôindivisibilit√© et immutability du patrimoine‚Äù this wealth is constitute of debt and active combined on one ledger from birth to dead.

We could make the Platform Komodo a gateway where converge it all (barterdex Atomic swap). For each human or machine one asset chain, this one can record and display everything every transactions, every possession, every potential defaults. the asset chain can be use for KYC is the person agree to display push the info  (CC, like a token private key), for credit worthiness, identification etc‚Ä¶

@jorian that existing projects are written in jumbles of js doesn't mean that it's useful for them to stay that way

If you want to "jump in" on an existing project, then js is a "need to know"

Hello @jl777c  I have a question it is not directly  linked with KMD but linked to the blockchain. I am testing one competitor  of KMD they claim to have 2 sec block time what I did is to send 5000 transaction via script and I have noticed some steange things:
1 - the sender wallet ballance was jumping up  and down it goes 0 then 2min later to 1000 then 0 then 500 and eventually it went to 0 
Same thing with reception adress
2- my script log the response when sending transactions and i have notices that after some time is start to respond  with not enought funds and later it was send a teansaction and then not enoughr funds and send 5 or 6 trabsactions later

Usability and we‚Äôre into mass adoption.  I think getting games involved will be tipping point.
With chain migrations testing in #kmdlabs its not too far fetched to embed coin daemon into pc games.  Mobile will rely on lite mode integration somehow - proxy rpc or via web service and a bit of trust for roaming fun

[30-Jan-19 10:51 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Wow, I just realised something, but I'm having 1 problem of certainty. A company my company works with uses a system called LPS for supply chain management of car parts and to make sure each part individually goes through all the processes by making a log of when it goes from station to station with an attatched anotator  of whether the part passed or failed the previous process based on parameter window limits. A blockchain is literally keymade for this type of part of tracking but would decentralized nodes holding the database fair better than a Centralized super computer server managing this kind of push/pull query. Honestly on second thought it definitely has to be better, because of the local data holding over a Centralized server having to do pushes and pulls whereas a blockchain only has pushes.


[30-Jan-19 10:52 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Is my logic sound at the end


[30-Jan-19 10:53 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Having local databases that are queryable should be infinitely faster than having to do pulls from a central server that is also managing every pull and push of multiple machines that are integrated into this system(every cell has a LPS drop to log and pull down info of said process and to check if said parts previous process was successful based on an independent review of parameters against hard coded limits{not able to be edited by low level programming personnel}).


[30-Jan-19 11:35 PM] Mylo#8306
hi @BlackJesus 
This tech tuesday has a supply chain scenario.   have a look at the json data structure, and see if something similar will fit in your car part scenario.   if it's just checking somethiing off, it's changing the state of some json object maybe.   each tx to blockchain just adjusts state.   just becomes a GUI integration with object's state changes i guess...

@jl777c 
The info under ```nextblockhash``` from ```komodo-cli getblock <hash>```, when available, is looked up  (not included in the block we are looking at) right?
Like, the node replies with info from the block we asked for and, this bit, from what it currently accepts as being the next block?


[01-Feb-19 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810

[01-Feb-19 04:42 AM] jusoaresf#3291

[01-Feb-19 04:43 AM] jusoaresf#3291
not the newest block, previous ones like
```komodo-cli getblock 000000010c190aae0682b1e0e07b377714bb7a65d8ff4e5b21554b26432bfbd1```


[01-Feb-19 04:45 AM] jusoaresf#3291
it will show nextblockhash but that info i not on that block  itself (?)


[01-Feb-19 05:11 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
```$ komodo-cli help getblock
getblock "hash|height" ( verbosity )

If verbosity is 0, returns a string that is serialized, hex-encoded data for the block.
If verbosity is 1, returns an Object with information about the block.
If verbosity is 2, returns an Object with information about the block and information about each transaction.```


[01-Feb-19 05:14 AM] Mihailo#5902
@jusoaresf The nextblock hash cannot be on block itself as blocks are not modified when next block arrives. That info is shown from the deamon as it knows for each block which one is previous and which is the next.


[01-Feb-19 05:14 AM] Mihailo#5902

result.push_back(Pair("previousblockhash", blockindex->pprev->GetBlockHash().GetHex()));

[05-Feb-19 04:52 PM] Meyse#0952
I'm no jl777 but recognition from the masses is not important. I'm still here because I believe in the possibilities that Komodo offers which no other project offers. Recognition is achieved by other projects building on the Komodo tech


[05-Feb-19 05:43 PM] jspook16#3059

[05-Feb-19 06:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
But, from a similar mindset on working on this tech in this industry, I can share my views on this question.


[05-Feb-19 06:12 PM] jspook16#3059
Please do


[05-Feb-19 06:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Motivation:
- Even if you have everything, like enough money to survive where you don't even need to do anything to have good living and resources for your own lifetime and even for your next generation, a person who loves doing just does that for the sake of doing something meaningful. Self-fulfillment.

Constant improvement and Learning:
- The person who does 1 thing perfect, like is excellent in doing something which they have been doing for years, and loves doing it all day without feeling burdened will even do it for free. I know people from my circle who have the same mindset. Example, I go to same barber ever since I arrived in NZ. He has enough of fortune to not work ever, but he still does just because he loves doing it. This is not something which applies to some, but to many others who have achieved big success or things in life.
- What drives a person to keep learning, making, doing things, excelling is the self motivation of going 1 more extra mile, till the last breath one have before they die.
- The life is not all about struggles. It is amount the experiences you have going through it, good or bad, it makes a person what that person is because of all those past experiences. If you stop doing what you love to do, life will feel meaningless and empty.


[05-Feb-19 06:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Cryptocurrency industry is an infant:
- I'm not really sure how many people realize this, but even after the existence of Bitcoin for 10 Years which is 1 Decade, it is not even grown to the maturity level where it can be called something decent. This is experiment. Probably one of the most expensive one in entire history of humankind and the most widely social run experiment.
- There are not set standardization yet in cryptocurrency, and this whole industry is driving innovation and standardization in all directions.
- It will probably take a lot more years for things to get settled down before we can call it regular thing of everyday, may be another decade or two if I just have to guess.
- I see James' work not doing work and comparing itself to just today's industry project. It is paving the path to some very well thought out architecture which is in my opinion an outcome of years of experience one has from lifetime of work working in computer science in various areas. See it from this view point, it is really a long term project than short term. To my opinion it'd be very silly to compare KMD project to compare with today's project. Compare it to some future projects, as KMD is advance in innovations than others in years like 2-5 years!


[05-Feb-19 06:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also, there is no finish line for this project. It will always be improving further, even if jl777 is no more with the project. I hope that by that time this project is widely spread and known as one of the excellent piece of tech another anonymous dev gave to the world like Satoshi gave us decentralized internet money.

anonymous satoshi nakamoto backwards or hal finney.   if in the interest of national security, maybe the signals for making an alternative currency were there.   computers started off as a research of the air force or navy and economists iirc.  after ww2 and other wars, there'd be enough data to signal things going in the wrong direction.  banking failures is probably the biggest signal.   so start a bankerless money system.  might take 20-50 years, but it won't end in nuclear war.   crypto so far has not bombed the sh*t out of any country.

strcpy

strncpy should create a null term string if there is enough space. you can check if the last char is non-0

they are very simple functions. depending on what type of inputs you need to handle, then you can always add error checking and then call strncpy

Hi, sorry in advance if is a silly question, but, if Komodo can achieve 1M txs, and can emulate a Ethereum VM, can Komodo do more Ethereum txs than the Ethereum blockchain itself?

In other words, can Komodo have a Ethereum compatible sidechain with more tx than the original?

There is a bounty for an EVM implementation.  Details here for porting solidity to komodo crypto conditions https://komodoplatform.com/tech-tuesday-update-3/

EOS did have a project to achieve the same, but I think they stopped it.

If another project ports solidity to their environment, then depending on their devs, the license, the language, our devs - it would be a possibility.

I have just talk somone at the resdex telegram group and I ask about what relationships they had whit komodo and this what his answer
Daniel:

We aren't using Barterdex code, we have written our code from scratch : ) When we mentioned BarterDEX it was because we have similar features such as BDEX uses atomic swaps and we do so as well. Likewise they use snarks for Privacy.

My question is. 
I have read that you have mentioned that bdex could use resdex lp but how is that possible when they use a different code. Kind regards


[11-Feb-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
my understanding was they forked barterDEX. if it is different then of course it cant work together so easily


[11-Feb-19 11:04 AM] hastrup#8742
@jl777c maybe that is the case but there admin just don't know it. But if it is a fork would Dex coin also work in the fork?


[11-Feb-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
you are asking me to speculate about your speculations on what something someone else did?

might as well ask your dog


[11-Feb-19 11:11 AM] hastrup#8742
No I'm not. If I fork bdex and I have done nothing to the code would the original Dex coin still apply to the new fork


[11-Feb-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
if there are no changes, then you are asking if original Dex coin would work with an unmodified bdex?


[11-Feb-19 11:13 AM] Alright#0419
@hastrup if they want to share liquidity with bdex, they need to keep the DEX address the same

but it's trivial for them to change it

@hastrup do you have a link to their github or where ever their code is?


[11-Feb-19 11:15 AM] hastrup#8742
They just posted this to me

Daniel:
By the way Ole, re-read what I said again. I confirmed with devs we aren't using front-end code but we do use back-end code from Komodo : )
We wish to work closely with KMD ecosystem actually and related projects (planning to list most of them) 

By adding KMD & asset-chains to ResDEX we plan to improve liquidity for KMD projects and get us support of Komodo's traders : )


[11-Feb-19 11:15 AM] Alright#0419
if you find me the code, I'll tell you whether or not they changed it


[11-Feb-19 11:16 AM] hastrup#8742
Cool I ask

@hastrup @Alright @ph03nix @Cryptoon  If you're interested: Res DEX is scheduled to have live demo for their technical community on 13th Feb, 5:00 p.m. CET. It will probably be for a close circle only. I've got an invitation from Wolf of RES via direct message. Demo will be running on a separate channel, locked for a live video/AMA parcipitants only. But I don't have a technical skills so basically I am useless for your discussion. If you would like to know more, ask for an invitation.


[11-Feb-19 02:25 PM] Alright#0419
Do you have any idea when they'll make the code public?


[11-Feb-19 02:26 PM] Alright#0419
Think they might have to at that point according the license, but I could be wrong


[11-Feb-19 02:26 PM] halo kitty rules#2280
No. But you can probably ask them.


[11-Feb-19 02:27 PM] halo kitty rules#2280
I can show a print screen of a communication with Wolf of RES, but i'm almost sure you need persionalized invitation.

@Alright Daniel:
To answer your questions, Github will be launched later on not at this time (expect sometime in Q2 2019, will give you a set date when we announce it). But you can join Discord through https://discord.gg/7weECSh
Check out #dev-mining and #proof-of-research channels there, quite a lot of discussion goes there!


[12-Feb-19 03:42 AM] Wolf of RES#8148
Hiya @Alright  @Cryptoon @jl777c  : ) 
We are happy to have a Private demo / call for ResDEX exchange demo with Komodo developers. You can ask any other questions you guys have for Resistance core devs & team.

Our current one as scheduled for Wednesday has slots booked/ full now from our own community.  I can setup another invitation form for those who are interested.

Regarding code; yes it isn't public yet and by our current plans we aim to make it public in Q2 2019!

@jl777c incase BTC fails, how fast can KMD latch onto another strong PoW coin for security?


[12-Feb-19 08:46 AM] BlackJesus#6161
@Deleted User Komodo has already notarized to LTC in the past when BTC fees skyrocketed and BCH is probably a simple hotfix of switching the daemon around and where the oracle's check for their notarization.


[12-Feb-19 08:47 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Ethereum is highly unlikely for backups. If Komodo were to switch it will be to one of the two mentioned above.


[12-Feb-19 08:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
@BlackJesus but its a plug and play system, so they can switch and do it relatively fast? Dash is coming out with ChainLocks soon making 51% attacks not viable, is Dash on the menu?


[12-Feb-19 08:48 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Doubt it.

[12-Feb-19 08:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
I don't have faith in BTC or LTC, maybe BCH.

Weren't something like 30% of all dash in existence instamined during inception.


[12-Feb-19 08:51 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Hell they adhoc the max supply to make sure the instamined coins would always be substantial.


[12-Feb-19 08:51 AM] BlackJesus#6161

if the past contains a 2 million "accidental" instamine for the devs, who then reduce the coin emission significantly... well it wast a premine, it happened during the first weeks when it was still called Xcoin, so technically DASH was never premined. yet there was a large percent of existing supply that was mined by the dev

James, is a true physical bitcoin possible? One where users can trust that the coin holds a certain digital amount. Is it possible to use crypto conditions to create such a thing? For example, a meta ledger that tracks who can unlock an amount from a physical coin. A load and lock kind of mechanism. I put 5 dollars in a 5 dollar denomination coin and locked it. I now have the right to redeem it. I can pass this right to the next public wallet.


[12-Feb-19 09:58 AM] rainbro7#4735
But what if anyone can create and lock coins?


[12-Feb-19 09:59 AM] rainbro7#4735
They dont all have to look the same


[12-Feb-19 09:59 AM] rainbro7#4735
Redemption is the meta ledger tracking that you own the coins


[12-Feb-19 09:59 AM] rainbro7#4735
A DAO


[12-Feb-19 09:59 AM] rainbro7#4735
or smartcontract of sorts


[12-Feb-19 10:05 AM] rainbro7#4735
I'm not so technical. I'm just assuming fund can be sent to some type of smartcontract or DAO. They can only be redeemed if the next users public key was switch with the previous users public key (representing a transfer of ownership - like a meta ledger). Its not very efficient. I would imagine, given that you agree a central party is required, that some type of smartcontract or DAO could act as a trusted third party. I'm not sure how but if anyone could think of it it's probably james.


[12-Feb-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
a onetime use privkey could be implemented with CC


[12-Feb-19 10:06 AM] rainbro7#4735
But would a onetime use private key be useful for a coin that constantly changes hands?


[12-Feb-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. put it on the inside of the coin. it requires the coin to be destroyed to reveal the privkey


[12-Feb-19 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
problem is that there wont be a way to prove that it has any actual privkey inside


[12-Feb-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it is as centralized as you sending a tx to someone else


[12-Feb-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
the usage of the privkey is validated by the entire network


[12-Feb-19 10:08 AM] rainbro7#4735
I get what you guys are saying. There will always have to be someone with access to the private key.


[12-Feb-19 10:09 AM] rainbro7#4735
bummer :/


[12-Feb-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
the validity also. the problem is to properly prove there is a privkey inside would be to have a zero knowledge RFID that proves there is a privkey to the pubkey inside


[12-Feb-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no minting here, just putting funds into a privkey


[12-Feb-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, in that sense you do need to trust the minting process doesnt reveal the privkey


[12-Feb-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
and there is a zksnark like way to prove it has a privkey


[12-Feb-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
and the only way to reveal the privkey is to destroy the coin


[12-Feb-19 10:12 AM] rainbro7#4735
I understand, so there is no optimal ways yet . Darn, I feel like this would help spread crypto.


[12-Feb-19 10:12 AM] rainbro7#4735
Cheers, thanks for the info guys.


[12-Feb-19 10:23 AM] rainbro7#4735
Yeah, it would be easy for a central party :/

Just learned about this.


[12-Feb-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
does it prevent the retention of a copy? if not, it seems not having much value


[12-Feb-19 11:33 AM] rainbro7#4735
But the person that sends the private key would know the private key. In this situation you cannot know the private key until the hardware is damaged in an irreversible way. It acts as true cash until destroyed. It is only one time use though.


[12-Feb-19 11:33 AM] rainbro7#4735
Yes, no one can create a copy since the private key cannot be found until the device is destroyed.


[12-Feb-19 11:34 AM] rainbro7#4735
The one time use (after redemption) and the cost make it not too viable.


[12-Feb-19 11:34 AM] rainbro7#4735
I think it's around 40 dollars for 3.

coding doesnt use that many calories, so its not like physical labor where you have to stop after some hours.

@jl777c Hi, I was just thinking so for atomic swaps, where will the prices exchanges of the 2 parties like 1 BTC = ?? ETH? Is there a service in BarterDEX that is having that exchange rates?


[12-Feb-19 10:30 PM] jl777c#5810
each party puts in the price they want


[12-Feb-19 10:30 PM] jl777c#5810
its called a market


[12-Feb-19 10:33 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay, so everything on that side is implemented in SuperNET right?


[12-Feb-19 10:33 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a p2p


[12-Feb-19 10:33 PM] jl777c#5810
each person would put in the price they want and it is used to determine if a swap should happen or not


[12-Feb-19 10:33 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So is it connecting to different blockchain's like Eth, Btc, and others?


[12-Feb-19 10:34 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, to hundreds


[12-Feb-19 10:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but only if you specify that


[12-Feb-19 10:36 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
SuperNET is implements that right? BarterDex backend is SuperNET?
Just curious though, since my prof told me that BarterDex has same concept as Bisq? but Bisq is not doing atomic swaps right?


[12-Feb-19 10:41 PM] jl777c#5810
SuperNET repo is where mm1 is. I think Bisq is doing human arbitrated swaps, maybe same high level concept, but totally different implementation


[12-Feb-19 11:02 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
mm1 -> marketmaker right?


[12-Feb-19 11:02 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
mm1 is connecting to the different blockchain nodes right?


[12-Feb-19 11:05 PM] jl777c#5810
yes


[12-Feb-19 11:05 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a new iteration mm2, that does the same stuff, just better


[12-Feb-19 11:07 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay thanks for this information.


[12-Feb-19 11:10 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Sorry I am kinda lost on the CC part, so I notice in the Komodo repo, there is a CC source, so if I add a new CC like CC_VOTE, will this mean it will create a OP_VOTE opcode and add on the UTXO?


[12-Feb-19 11:11 PM] jl777c#5810
no


[12-Feb-19 11:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if you make a CC_VOTE, there will be a new CC evalcode of CC_VOTE


[12-Feb-19 11:12 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So CC_VOTE is the contract itself?


[12-Feb-19 11:12 PM] jl777c#5810
you can put it in the libcc.so and make a user defined evalcode. look at ~/komodo/src/cc/cclib.cpp


[12-Feb-19 11:13 PM] jl777c#5810
the code that validates VOTE evalcode is the "contract"


[12-Feb-19 11:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so whenever a VOTE utxo is spent, the code associated with the CC_VOTE is invoked and it can do whatever (literally) it needs to in order to say true or false

Is `createFunding` a function if we want to make a Dice contract?


[12-Feb-19 11:20 PM] jl777c#5810
the way dice CC was designed, there needs to be "house" funds to bet against. without any such funds, you really cant bet against the house


[12-Feb-19 11:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so the first step is to fund the dice plan


[12-Feb-19 11:21 PM] jl777c#5810
by doing various transactions you advance the state and achieve the desired effects


[12-Feb-19 11:22 PM] jl777c#5810
CC are quite a bit different than anything else, so you do need to study the existing examples to see how they achieve their goals


[12-Feb-19 11:22 PM] jl777c#5810
faucet CC is one of the simpler ones


[12-Feb-19 11:25 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay thanks @jl777c , I was comparing it to Solidity for my paper, since in Solidity you just create a smart contract(based on the language syntax) and run it, in CC I am confused on why it has a implementation in core code and how would a finished contract look like


[12-Feb-19 11:27 PM] jl777c#5810
CC run natively at full speed with total access to all daemon data


[12-Feb-19 11:27 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess it is like the difference between CPU mining and ASIC


[12-Feb-19 11:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it is more work to make an ASIC, but the result is orders of magnitude more efficient


[12-Feb-19 11:27 PM] jl777c#5810
CC is NOT equivalent to solidity


[12-Feb-19 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
in fact, theoretically it is possible to make a single solidity CC that would interpret solidity contracts


[12-Feb-19 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
CC are able to change consensus rules for the blockchain


[12-Feb-19 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
solidity runs an interpreted language under existing consensus rules


[12-Feb-19 11:29 PM] jl777c#5810
once a CC exists, you interact with it by sending CC transactions


[12-Feb-19 11:29 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
> in fact, theoretically it is possible to make a single solidity CC that would interpret solidity contracts
So basically, if this would be possible we can apply use solidity in creating contracts for KMD?


[12-Feb-19 11:31 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
so `faucet.cpp` is the contract at this point?


[12-Feb-19 11:32 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, once such a CC exists, that would be possible. but considering that we can get things like rogue CC working in a couple weeks there isnt  much need for solidity. also it would be 10x to 100x slower and possibly not viable for any compute intensive things


[12-Feb-19 11:32 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we shouldnt use the word "contract", smart or otherwise


[12-Feb-19 11:32 PM] jl777c#5810
CC is a TOTALLY different way of solving the same problem


[12-Feb-19 11:32 PM] jl777c#5810
it implements constrained transactions with a specific vout type


[12-Feb-19 11:33 PM] jl777c#5810
and using this, one of the nearly infinite things you can do, is implement what are commonly known as "smart contracts", you could create a smart contract interpreter, you could make a blockchain enforced sudoku too


[12-Feb-19 11:35 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Wow that's really great! There is a current doc on running CCs right? I just wan to try it maybe on testnet or something. I can't really understand completely without trying it.


[12-Feb-19 11:37 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So every addition/modification of the CC you have to rebuild `komodod` and publish daemon updates with new CCs right?


[12-Feb-19 11:37 PM] jl777c#5810
there is the libcc.so, which is a dynamic library to make user defined CC


[12-Feb-19 11:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it isnt quite building right, but when it is you can just update libcc.so and komodod would use it


[12-Feb-19 11:39 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Wow! got so excited to use this, this might be boosting my paper.


[12-Feb-19 11:39 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
This needs testnet funds to run the conditions right?


[12-Feb-19 11:40 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
I mean CC


[12-Feb-19 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
just normal txfee of 0.0001


[12-Feb-19 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
its just normal tx as far as the rest of the blockchain is concerned


[12-Feb-19 11:43 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So the CC are executed with an RPC call?


[12-Feb-19 11:54 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
```Each Crypto-Conditions contract has its own special address that is known to all, including its private key.```


[12-Feb-19 11:55 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
This is a different privkey right?

[13-Feb-19 03:21 AM] jl777c#5810

NXT broke backward compatibility in 2014 and I was not happy about it and complained. they promised not to do it again. Of course they did it again in 2015 and then to justify breaking one of the few running services, they used the fact that they posted the breaking changes in some obscure dev channel. And then used the fact that since they posted it someone might be using it so they couldnt change it as it would break backward compatibility!

So they prioritized some theoretical possibility of violating backward compatibility for some mythical project that couldnt have been completed yet (if it even existed) over the running MGW service.

clearly they were mocking me. I had 100% of my tech built on NXT and NXT was betraying me... I said that they needed to honor their commitment for backward compatibility or I would be forced to leave NXT.

For this I am enemy #1 inside of NXT and outside of NXT I am some sort of NXT insider doing evil things

That was my perception of what happened too.  I followed all that drama closely. Looking back though, it's so great that that happened. It forced you into a fundamental redesign of how to achieve your crypto ambitions. The iterations of that redesign have turned out to be the leading blockchain infrastructure ... by far. And your dedication and daily perseverance, over many years, has attracted and inspired a deep and talented development team.  I figure that anyone who can't see all that is just doing a drive-by "analysis", which is all too common in crypto and the world at large.

@jl777c Is it possible to apply dPOW on the CryptoNight POW Algo?


[13-Feb-19 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is possible, dPoW makes no assumptions about the underlying consensus mechansm


[13-Feb-19 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
however, i dont think any cryptonight has implemented dPoW yet


[13-Feb-19 10:54 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Wow, great, would it be the same integration as what Hush did? Yes, it would be nice if dPoW would be integrated on CryptoNight based PoW.
How about CC, since CC is like a paper on how to create UTXO based Smart Contracts, do you think it is just solely for BTC based forks, or it can be applied on for example Bytecoin and others?


[14-Feb-19 01:30 AM] jl777c#5810
in principle it would work with any utxo based coin


[14-Feb-19 01:39 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Ok, but Asset Chains "runtime forks" (man! I am amazed by this) should have an infrastructure that is the same with KMD right? Like SuperNET and komodo?


[14-Feb-19 01:40 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
or Asset Chain is `komodo` codebase native


[14-Feb-19 01:40 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
not interaction with SuperNET


[14-Feb-19 01:42 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
oh wow! I was wrong in my paper then, crap, my profs gonna kill me. But anyway thanks, @Deleted User


[14-Feb-19 01:46 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Yes, dPoW is handled in SuperNET right, since SuperNET handles `Notary Nodes`-->(Wrong again?)


[14-Feb-19 01:47 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Notary nodes should have a cnxn of the BTC network right so that it can send the KMD hash snapshot


[14-Feb-19 02:07 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay, so KMD chain is already handling dPoW. SuperNet is just the market


[14-Feb-19 02:11 AM] jl777c#5810
SuperNET codebase has the notarizer that notaries run, but the validation of dPoW is necessarily in the KMD code


[14-Feb-19 02:11 AM] jl777c#5810
also a lot of code is shared between the notarizer and the mm1


[14-Feb-19 02:32 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
okay, so for Asset Chain, I see that in chainparams it is a dynamic creation of some block specific data, so am I correct if the genesis Hash should be the current Komodo Hash at the time the asset chain is created?


[14-Feb-19 02:38 AM] jl777c#5810
actually there isnt a practicalway to do runtime forks without sharing genesis block. the first mined block is really the assetchains genesis block


[14-Feb-19 02:42 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Okay so all asset chains hash KMD genesis block? Also the all the blocks are shared right? So there is an `is-a` relationship between the `Asset Chain` and `KMD` chain?


[14-Feb-19 02:42 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Or it is  much more complicated than that? it doesn't split blocks right?


[14-Feb-19 02:46 AM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
@Deleted User Thanks, I am trying to look for that implementation in code


[14-Feb-19 02:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
The params for the chain, are added to a random generation, that changes the AC's "magic" value and network ports.

They share genesis block but cannot sync from each other.

?


[14-Feb-19 05:49 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So is it like when a 51% attack happens on Komodo, they must compute for the hash from BTC(Which came from KMD NN) then compute again for the hash that in KMD(Original KMD hash)?


[14-Feb-19 06:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
@josephnicholas GMT+8 KMD sends blockhashes to BTC inside OP_RETURN data. Then all KMD nodes have consensus rules that prevent the re-organization of those blocks, hence, you would need to perform a 51% attack on BTC to accomplish the same on KMD.


[14-Feb-19 06:16 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So the dPOW implementation is not merely pointed on `KMD sends hashes to BTC` but because  of the consensus rules?


[14-Feb-19 06:16 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
nodes = NN right?

Yeah I already that document @dukeleto Thanks for that also. So just a prelim question, so SuperNET is still handling the NN, until now


[14-Feb-19 06:22 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
?


[14-Feb-19 06:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
SuperNET repo has the code which compiles to a binary called `iguana`, this code has the Notary Node management code.


[14-Feb-19 06:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The Notary Nodes need `iguana` to do Notarisation operations for all the blockchains being notarisied.


[14-Feb-19 06:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
I like to think of iguana as the glue between various coins/blockchains that notaries use to send blockhash data from coins with smaller hashrates to coins with larger hashrates


[14-Feb-19 06:25 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So its like without iguana, KMD can't achieve dPOW


[14-Feb-19 06:28 PM] dukeleto#7326
DPoW is an abstract protocol. It could be coded in any language and any program. The name of the program that implements the current dpow implementation is iguana. Full nodes also need to know/do various things to interact with iguana, but usually not much


[14-Feb-19 06:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It is like the code for dPoW is not in 1 single place, It's like modulating I guess....
Better management of code and daemons being separate etc.


[14-Feb-19 06:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Notarisation code = `iguana`

@josephnicholas GMT+8 the code that enforces dpow is in each full node of each coin. The code that *creates* notarization data, which takes 13 notaries to come together and agree, is called iguana

@grewalsatinder so the notarization process has the defense for 51% attack? Since once notarization ends the block height is already irreversible and the blocks already is not possible for reorg right?


[14-Feb-19 07:23 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
I just don't understand the statement people say about "dPoW enables KMD or 3rd party chains to share same Hash rate with BTC"


[14-Feb-19 07:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
Once a checkpoint is created by a notarization then the chain cannot reorg back past that block height on all nodes that validated it. You can run the other chains daemon (in KMD case BTC) when the chain loads on start or syncs from scratch it will check the txids on BTC to verify that they match. 
This proves that the notarized checkpoint was valid at that time, and as BTC cannot be reorged to remove these transactions that contain KMD's blockhashes it gains the secuirty of BTC by default.

I hope that makes sense.


[14-Feb-19 07:38 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Totally makes sense, wow thanks @Deleted User !!!
>`it will check the txids on BTC to verify that they match. ` so how does the KMD daemon find the txid in BTC if there is no running BTC daemon or like `iguana`?


[14-Feb-19 07:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
It will only check them on nodes where BTC is running ie./.. notary nodes.... So because all notary nodes are runmning BTC they know 100% they are notarizing the correct chain. 
All other nodes trust that the checkpoint created is valid and true. They also have the option to run a full BTC node and validate them self if they choose to do so.


[14-Feb-19 07:43 PM] Deleted User#0000
Iguana is seperate again, all we use that for is the communication between notary nodes. It decides randomly which nodes create the notarization.  and builds the transaction that is sent to KMD and BTC.


[14-Feb-19 07:44 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Oh, so KMD nodes, connects to Notary nodes  for verification, then  Notary nodes are running BTC nodes.


[14-Feb-19 07:44 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Notary nodes are nun in `komodod` right?


[14-Feb-19 07:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
yes. Notary node runs a full node of komodo and BTC. They check and verify every notarization.


[14-Feb-19 07:46 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
So there is switch in `komodod` to run full node and not.. Okay that makes sense. That's why I notice when I run `komodod` it doesn't download the whole chain


[14-Feb-19 07:46 PM] Deleted User#0000
Each komodod node checks the notarization  is valid in its own chain, but if BTC is running it will automatically contact the BTC daemon to verify the notarisations on BTC.


[14-Feb-19 07:48 PM] Deleted User#0000
komodod will be running a full komodo chain, but it canot verify the data on BTC unless its got access to a BTC node... All notary nodes do this, so if you are syncing from them, then you can be sure the chain is valid with BTC notarizations as well as notarization on komodo side only.


[14-Feb-19 07:51 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Thanks for this great information, so to sum it all up, KMD is 51% attack proof since snapshots of KMD hash are stored in the BTC blockchain, KMD is reorg proof since once the attacker executes the 51% attack the created block hashes should correspond on the notarized block hash in the BTC blockchain.


[14-Feb-19 07:52 PM] josephnicholas GMT+8#5904
Correct me if I'm wrong


[14-Feb-19 08:01 PM] Deleted User#0000

@josephnicholas GMT+8 I see you got confused and it's sorted out in later comments.... 
I think you still haven't completed your read on that article, it all covers these steps, you are asking...

>Oh, so KMD nodes, connects to Notary nodes for verification, then Notary nodes are running BTC nodes.

No. No `komodod` client node need to connect to the Notary Nodes. They only need to connect with the peers, like any other bitcoin based blockchain does.
Each node verifies the validity of the transaction in a satoshi consens way that it's not a double spend with the base Proof of Work or Proof of Stake or any Proof of X algo that blockchain is using.

There are 2 transactions which are related to 1 notarisation, in a quick short exaplantion:
1. The tx which holds the latest block hash of the blockchain. Example: KMD block hash, added to the OP RETURN data in the BTC transaction.
2. As soon as this BTC transaction is created and broadcasted, and iti's availble in the mempool, this BTC tx is taken and added to the OP_RETURN data of a KMD transaction.

Once this notarisation KMD tx is validated by the miners, it is ireversible by the dPoW consens rules coded in the KMD daemon.
All network client KMD nodes follows these rules.

Since this KMD Tx is mined and validated by all the client peers that it is not a double spent, it is valid.
And since this KMD tx holds the notarisation data in it's OP_RETURN, it is valid notarization tx.


[14-Feb-19 08:11 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It is all covered in that dPoW explained article.

There can be a notarization that exists on a node that is running, but when you freshly sync it that notarization can no longer be there.

The notarisation is valid... but its not even in the blockchain... I understand this is nessary for it to function... But it was totally unexpected to find this.


[14-Feb-19 08:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
Because a checkpoint is created in a tx that itself has not been checkpointed by a future notarization It is possible that some nodes can have notarizations that other nodes do not have. its is very rare for this to occur, but it indeed can happen.


[14-Feb-19 08:25 PM] Deleted User#0000
Not sure concequences of this... or if it could cause a fork or not. Until i tried to use notarization checkpoints as consensus rules... you cannot do this... It will fork the chain. üòÇ

using a gateways method for securing deposits in a federated multisig, it is something that would reasonably secure. certainly not for any long term storage, but for some active usage it seems adequate

I undersand that a good, secure and efficient application code should have as much less reliance on 3rd party libraries as possible.
And in case it is too much of work to do what those 3rd party libraries are providing, only the needed bits of those 3rd party libraries must be used with own source code for efficient code writing.
Please correct me on this understanding if it needs correction.

**What I want to ask is what happens if the 3rd party code we enherit has some bugs or vulnerabilities, how you choose the libraries for such situations?**

I observed you coding `iguana` and know from those days how many things you scrapped because those were not as efficient and bulky if just used 3rd party libraries. You had those 3rd party libraries kinda disassmbled and only used the bits which were useful to your code.

exactly. Learned by watching your way of coding and did the exact same with my kmdgo package.
I just copied the `btcec`, `chaincfg`, `base58`, `bech32` and `wire` (btc protocol messages) from BTCSuite Go code to mine, instead of setting/calling it as `import` from github.
At this moment my Go code doesn't rely on other packages, and I intend to even trim these copied packages down further as I keep studying and understanding the blockchain side of go code.

```The problem with having many condition types is that all intermediaries in a certain path would need to support the same algorithms in order for them to be usable. That meant that the only algorithms you could rely upon having support for would be the least common denominator. Most likely, this would come down to simple SHA256 hash-locks. Less than 20% of the functionality could serve more than 80% of the use cases, and so the Interledger standard parted ways with Crypto Conditions.```

I have a question. I'm wondering if the dPOW mechanism could be threaded around a crypto such as digibyte? Would it not be a lot cheaper for the blockchain security notarizations? I've heard that the Bitcoin notorization fees are as high as 2-10 btc per year or more and this might be an issue when btc surpasses $100k in price?


[14-Mar-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
we did an ICO exactly so we can be immune to BTC prices. also what point is notarizing to DGB if its hashrate is 0.000001% of BTC?

@quantumfinance 
I'd like to add. If you are going to start learning programming, try avoiding JavaScript if you can.


[16-Mar-19 03:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The substitute to that can be other languages, including Dart, QT, WASM etc


[16-Mar-19 03:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
learn core languages like C to clear programming fundamentals.
you may or may not like it, depending on how you like the level of programs you want to code.
explore what type of programs you want to code.
But learn C to make your programming fundamentals strong.
Then C++ if you want to extend to Object Oriented Programming
As you will learn C/C++ and practice it will make clear to you how they fit in the ecosystem of different levels for different purposes.
for web fundamentals HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript fundamentals.
When you understand these, you'll have clarity what kind of programming you want to do. Backend code or frontend Web.
Emphasis more on native code than web, because as the native programming languages now evolving, web is going to be more flexible to adopt the same native languages to web, examples like WebAssembly. Different frameworks will emerge in your fav native language to make web apps or native desktop/mobile apps to make them with ease so you don't have to learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript to much extend.


[16-Mar-19 03:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
But having fundamental knowledge of HTML/CSS/Js is essential to make sense of those expected good future WASM frameworks for different native languages.


[16-Mar-19 03:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

[16-Mar-19 04:45 AM] mrlynch#5735

[16-Mar-19 04:46 AM] mrlynch#5735
i'm starting my journey with CC's and was looking at the WASM wrapper as well and I was wondering if i can use these 2 to write my own projects


[16-Mar-19 04:48 AM] mrlynch#5735
while i'm aware that C + WASM might be harder to learn to build a web app rather than just doing it in python if it's better in the long run i'm willing to invest my time & efforts into them


[16-Mar-19 04:51 AM] jl777c#5810
CC is linked inside komodod, it isnt a webapp


[16-Mar-19 04:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the webapp side would be calling rpc calls that the CC provide


[16-Mar-19 04:55 AM] mrlynch#5735
sorry, let me rephrase.
if i know C++ and learn WASM is it enough to build somewhat complex web apps?


[16-Mar-19 04:58 AM] mrlynch#5735
basis for that is:
1. starting journey with CC's <- need C
2. interested in building the WASM wrapper <- need to learn WASM

therefore if i take the time to learn and become proficient in these 2 it would be wise on my part to use them in my projects, rather than doing things in python


[16-Mar-19 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a way to compile C -> WASM, so C seems to be all you need

first paragraph from readme: Emscripten is an LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler. It takes LLVM bitcode - which can be generated from C/C++, using llvm-gcc (DragonEgg) or clang, or any other language that can be converted into LLVM - and compiles that into JavaScript, which can be run on the web (or anywhere else JavaScript can run).


[16-Mar-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810

[16-Mar-19 10:00 PM] Mylo#8306
C is about resource management imo, managing CPU memory bytes.  No gui.  If you go from C to gui you'll appreciate the things those gui languages offer, like garbage collection (automatic memory mgmt) but you might not appreciate data structures and programming techniques that make you a better programmer - because the gui language/framework makes those decisions for you

it might take you two weeks, or a year or 10 years

C is one of the smallest languages to learn, which means you can master it faster than most any other language


[17-Mar-19 12:51 AM] jl777c#5810
once you master a language, you can actually look at the code and know what it does. removing this as a variable will make you a 100x better coder


[17-Mar-19 12:53 AM] jl777c#5810
from what I can tell, most coders dont really understand what the code they wrote is doing (let alone code someone else wrote), not really sure what they need to write, and unusure of how to solve the problem. 2 out of three aint bad, and pretty required to make progress

Then passed Harvard CS50 course - have C as programming language for basic things explanation and examples as well. So I wonder it's really good for head wrapping.
I'm not a programmer, but actually CS50 course I'm personally highly recommend for journey start. (it will give you not only basic knowledge in C and Python but also you'll understand how computer works, how data representing in binary, basic algorythms and etc.)

[18-Mar-19 02:56 AM] TonyL#3577
CS50 course is great point to start, really. It covers both C and python and also wrapping the head over needed to know stuff. Just programming language syntax knowledge without basic understanding of how computers work and basic algos will not allow you to solve the problems in most of the cases imo

In 1976, Knuth prepared a second edition of Volume 2, requiring it to be typeset again, but the style of type used in the first edition (called hot type) was no longer available. In 1977, he decided to spend some time creating something more suitable. Eight years later, he returned with TEX, which is currently used for all volumes.

Goodbye, Object Oriented Programming
I‚Äôve been programming in Object Oriented languages for decades. The first OO language I used was C++ and then Smalltalk and finally .NET‚Ä¶

Another fundamental question in my mind is, what is considered object oriented programming. In my opinion, C++/JAVA has not much to do with how Alan Kay/Smalltalk imagined  "object oriented".  To reinforce the obvious, for a man holding only a hammer, every problem looks like a nail üòÉ Choose the right abstraction for the job. OO get complex very quicly and hard to reason about, that is for sure üòÉ


[23-Mar-19 02:53 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
In my honest opinion, things we make today are composite. Object oriented programming just resides on three thingies: inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism. C++/Java/C# are pretty much as object oriented as you can get, and not even close to the Alan Kay school of abjekts evvawheewhaa. The languages that belong in that mindset are Python and Ruby. OO doesn't get complex if you apply it as it should be done; any codebase gets complex. Period. That's the result of an organic process and new features.

[23-Mar-19 06:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
Question: Will the Komodo DEX add value to the KMD token? Will the KMD token be used for the transaction fees?


[23-Mar-19 06:37 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Tx fess will be paid in the native coin traded. Making people use komodo to use the dex isnt how it works. That model is reatrictive and only exists to enrich the host token holders. People will find an alternative. Komodo vision is not to be restrictive but enable all to use the tech without needing komodo. Komodo usage on the dex could take preference due to its security and fast tx times.


[23-Mar-19 06:38 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
side note: there is no "KMD token" or "DEX token"


[23-Mar-19 06:38 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Dex token will get some of the fees paid using the dex.


[23-Mar-19 06:39 AM] Cryptoon#3362
DEX dividends are paid out in kmd iirc, so when a dividend is paid, fees in other crypto will need to be converted into kmd


[23-Mar-19 06:40 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
That could increase the value i suspose


[23-Mar-19 06:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yep, more buying to support price I guess


[23-Mar-19 06:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Also, a lot of coins will be offered with a kmd base pair because this is what the kmd community prefers, also increasing kmd awareness


[23-Mar-19 06:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
I still cant grasp what is making KMD valuable now and in the future (although i hold KMD now b/c its a cool project). I want to understand why and how the KMD project and the KMD token can be valuable now and in the future. Why does the world need that token (why not use a other token for all purposes like with the DEX project?)


[23-Mar-19 06:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
Like i can buy 1 KMD now for about a dollar. What can i do with it now besides holding or selling it? And why would i need 1 KMD in 10 years, what can i do with that then?


[23-Mar-19 06:49 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
1) KMD is a currency, not a "token" there's a distinct difference
2) the value is just like the value of anything, demand


[23-Mar-19 06:49 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

Many of the assetchains have KMD as their base pair for trading. All coins dpowing to KMD need KMD to notarize to it. Later this year KMD itself will have a myriad of cryptoconditions


[23-Mar-19 06:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
@CryptoNinjaa  i know that, but KMD is my main holding so i ask it here :). Of course i invested money into it to make profit (in dollars or in services in the future).  So if KMD is a currency, me investing in it would mean i think that KMD will be adopted in the future (which means high demand and with the fixed supply of 200M a higher price?)

If you invest in any crypto without anticipating adoption, then your goal of that investment is to be atop the pyramid when it collapses (because that's your only hope: that you can sell it so someone you think is a sucker for more than you paid for it).

I claim that the bigger the komodo ecosystem, the better for KMD. Not 1:1, but even 1% to 10% spillover and it will be quite significant. Think about thousands of blockchain projects and the size of the ecosystem, with 1% to 10% spilling over into KMD. Especially as it will be the path of least resistance (most liquidity) for many projects. Also if mm2 does as well as some people say, the KMD buying pressure will be quite big. $1 mil of revshares means 1 million KMD needs to be purchased, that is starting to get into "moving the market" territory

@Deleted User another "off balance sheet" benefit for KMD as new projects (sectors) start adopting it, is that the ones creating the solutions to get this adoption will likely have KMD that they are incentivized to have increase in value. So, maybe in subtle ways KMD is made part of the solution. No contracts to require this, no obligation, but the natural tendency when you are vested in something is to help out where you can.

I found that one. In general it is pretty amazing that almost no financials are published while people are investing billions in this market. 2019 will be the year ICO-money is going to run out for some project (if that didn't happen already without the market knowing it). Like EOS, they collected 3.2 billion USD. Yet nobody seems to care what they do with it and how much is left (and in what form, EOS-tokens, ETH, BTC or fiat).

[23-Mar-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
I am on the open source project side of things and as such it is not any corporation, so not sure that financials makes any sense when there are no products being sold. the various revshares are all visible on the blockchain.
as far as the "corporate" side of things, maybe they will decide to publish financials after all the corp structure is in place, but as I said I am not directly involved in that side of things. I guess if to use the linux model, I am the linus on the open source side and there are companies like redhat for the commerial operations.

it uses random selection to not notarize... it just provides a way for nodes to select between forks, nothing about it enforces the already existing chain and if a chain adopts this, the attacker could make his chain be the one that is preferred


[29-Mar-19 10:50 PM] jl777c#5810
veriblock is just so inefficient to try to do the same thing as dPoW and since it is decentralized there are no controls on it, other than mining profits. Not exactly the best way to secure a chain

I just received an email from bittrex with this "We are excited to that Bittrex International will host an Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) of VeriBlock's VBK coin beginning at 9:00am PDT (4:00pm UTC) on April 2. VeriBlock and its novel Proof-of-Proof ("PoP") consensus protocol is the first and only technology in the world to allow any blockchain to inherit Bitcoin's unprecedented thermodynamic Proof-of-Work security in an entirely Decentralized, Trustless, Transparent and Permissionless ("DTTP") manner." Isn't "PoP" a clone of "dPow"?

[30-Mar-19 01:35 AM] jl777c#5810
on a typical day dPoW does 100 to 120 BTC transactions
veriblock 100,000+ ??? so it seems it is 1000x more transactions (even accounting for lighter weight per tx), it is just a poor design.


[30-Mar-19 01:38 AM] jl777c#5810
I guess the fact that even after 2.5 years, the first real alternative to dPoW is much less efficient (without any debate) and its security level is still remaining to be seen. I would have thought that after all this time, something that was at least equivalent to dPoW might be made, but so far it seems not. And when the BTC txfee kicks in the cost per veriblock tx will go up which will need to be paid by the chains using it, so from an estimated 1% of mining rewards, it goes up with the fee market.

I read somewhere that veriblock "protected" chains dont have to make any code changes and "just" need to allocate some percentage of blockreward to the PoP miners. Is this really true? If so, then it seems there is no protection at all to the altcoin as it wont even be looking at the external reference hashes. I guess it would allow a postmortem analysis of how the 51% attack violated the VBK hashes. Is there any definite answer to whether VBK provides 51% protection and if the altcoin needs to make code changes?


[31-Mar-19 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
It cant be that altcoin miners are subsidizing the VBK bitcoin spam in order to not get any 51% protection, as that is what their main claim. Which would mean that the altcoin must make codechanges. So one of those two things must be wrong

'''To determine which blockchain to accept, the score for each block at each index is calculated 
relative to the other block at the same index, and the scores for all blocks on each chain are 
added together: The first PoP publication for either competing block at fork index 0 was at 
index 1 of the illustrated SP blockchain. The red block at fork index 0, R0, is endorsed by three 
PoP publications which occur at index 1 of the SP blockchain, so its score is 3*(1/((1-1+1)*(1-
1+1))) = 300; R0 = 300. The orange block at fork index 0, O0, is endorsed by two PoP
publications which occur at index 1 of the SP blockchain, and one PoP publication at index 2 
in the SP blockchain, so its score is 2*(1/((1-1+1)*(1-1+1))) + 1*(1/((2-1+1)*(2-1+1))) = 225; O0
= 225. Similarly, R1 = 1*(1/((2-2+1)*(2-2+1))) = 100 and O1 = 2*(1/((3-2+1)*(3-2+1))) = 50. The 
last block in any chain never has any proof weight, because no block has come after it to 
contain PoP endorsements for it; R2 = 0 and O2 = 0. Summing these up, the weight of the red 
chain is 300 + 100 = 400, and the weight of the orange chain is 225 + 50 = 275. Since 400 > 
275, the red chain is the more-endorsed blockchain.''' üò≥

no sybil protection


[31-Mar-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
no protection against a miner that basically buys the longest chains with PoP


[31-Mar-19 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, without any altcoin changes, it does no harm as it has no 51% protection without the altcoin daemon actually using the PoP info


[31-Mar-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as all the voting for a blockchain goes, it is a bit like having a totally separate PoW system battling over which altcoin fork is the real one. So whether this is harmful or helpful would depend on the honesty of the PoP miners and the relative hashrates


[31-Mar-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so it could be that VBK offers little to no protection (best case if no altcoin code changes), it allowing external PoP miners control the altcoin chain (if they make altcoin code changes), none of these outcomes has it doing anything like dPoW protection of 51% attacks and being true to the real mainchain. but doing 1000x the BTC tx seems to be an established fact


[31-Mar-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
I wonder if they are open to a 51% attack test for a VBK protected chain


[31-Mar-19 07:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[31-Mar-19 03:51 PM] Regnar#6164
From the Veriblock white paper. "SI" is the protected chain, "SP" would be the chain being notarized to (Bitcoin)
```In order for PoP mining transactions to later be used for consensus, they must be stored in the SI blockchain. Additionally, the block headers of the SP blockchain need to be stored in such a way that consensus of the SP blockchain can be tracked without requiring peers to interface with the SP blockchain network. As such, the blocks on a blockchain implementing PoP contain a  special  segment to  hold  the  new SP blockchain  block  headers  since  the  last SI blockchain block‚Äôs included SP headers.```

@jl777c how is it possible to create a system that recycles BTC's energy and hashing at a negligible electricity cost ?


[31-Mar-19 04:50 PM] quantumfinance#9369
id think that using all that energy has a pretty significant /resource intensive cost


[31-Mar-19 09:55 PM] Mylo#8306
sending a transaction into bitcoin is not high energy cost to re-use it's high public network security.


[31-Mar-19 09:56 PM] Mylo#8306
re-using bitcoin's "store of value" as a utility for security, for another chain, another ecosystem, other ecosystems tha tuse that ecosystem.


[31-Mar-19 09:57 PM] Mylo#8306
this is what is negligible energy use, the utility / by-product of a secure network being re-used.


[31-Mar-19 10:01 PM] Mylo#8306
maybe if you bought a plane ticket to new zealand it is expensive, but taking a local magazine for a friend and putting it in your bag - doesn't cost the plane ticket or the flight.   the hand-delivery of the magazine to a friend, piggy backed off the plane ticket.
the commitment to mining bitcoin or taking the flight is a "sunk cost" - equipment wise, environmental wise etc. getting more out of the already incurred expense

@Regnar ok, so the altcoin needs to have changes made, but there is a third chain in the picture or is SP the VBK chain? So the altcoin has to allocate a percentage of blockreward to help finance the BTC spam


[01-Apr-19 05:28 AM] Regnar#6164
Yes, changes to the altcoin. I'm definitely not the expert, just reading the white paper trying to get a grasp on it. SP, I believe is any high hash chain, I think basically Bitcoin. I don't think I saw anything for VBK chain, but it's possible I missed it in the parts i read. Looks like the smaller chains are allocating blockspace for the BTC block headers. Didn't see how the fees were paid for, but I didn't read the whole thing yet.

[05-Apr-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
actually BTC devs are VERY active in doing their best to make life hard for all the other coins. first they made the segwit abomination, which made me abandon iguana from being a BTC node as there was no way I was supporting that and if it didnt do BTC, then it really wasnt worth maintaining its full node functionality (though my guess is that it still works find with stable codebase coins)


[05-Apr-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
then they start randomly changing existing rpc calls, BREAKING existing apps


[05-Apr-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a big giant no-no. just ask linus what he things about kernel changes that break userspace

but legacy devs were not satisfied...


[05-Apr-19 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
they decided to go after all the most commonly used rpc calls to ensure that not just some bitcoin apps broke but all of them did


[05-Apr-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
they were nice enough to totally change the behavior of an existing rpc call and then make a new rpc with the old functionality


[05-Apr-19 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. you read that correctly. instead of keeping the old rpc the same and making the new functionality have a new name (sane and backward compatible) the broke all programs that used getinfo, validateaddress, signrawtransaction, etc.


[05-Apr-19 11:38 AM] jl777c#5810
you would think that is enough

If maintenance of BTC 0.14 and 0.15 stops, can it be a risk for komodo ? About bitcoin recent (and future) changes, I can't agree more: bitcoin devs doesn't know retro-compatibility. Segwit and "removal of getinfo" were developed into yiimp (stratum and payments) but I didn't know for validateaddress and signrawtransaction. I Is it worth to try to adapt iguana to BTC 0.17 ?

I played a little bit with c-lightning (I tried to add it yiimp on testnet) but I prefer LND (more features compared to Blockstream's c-lightning and some features of LND such as PR 2455 should be added into LN specificiations then should be implementated into other LN implementations).

I hope that LND new features (out of LN specs) will be added into LN specs then into clightning and other implementations (PR 2455 of LND allows to pay without receiving an invoice first) as they said. Thank you for your hard work

I was not surprised that Liquid (product of blockstream) already contains the future features of LN (some are already implementated into LND but not into clightning). Good thing here is that the implementations of LN competes with each other

but they have to interoperate, so the least common denominator is what matters


[07-Apr-19 08:16 AM] phm87#7395
yes of course, they contains interroperability tests to be sure to work with each other. But it is not forbidden to go beyond the specs. As example, clightning allows to make 1 channel between 2 nodes and make one funding of it while LND allows to have several channels between 2 nodes (and they want to be able to make several fundings of the same channel)


[07-Apr-19 08:17 AM] phm87#7395
but big enhancements (such as PR 2455 of LND) should be added into LN specs (if everyone agrees on it) then all implementations should offer the feature (I hope)

@Deleted User  about opensource hardware, I heard about IBM POWER and discussed it with a friend. I will ask him a link but he told me that it is not cheap (3.5k for a small dev station) and specs are limited (but it may be enough for some AC). Opensource hardware is an interesting subject. Whatever I also like AMD, their chips are not opensource


[10-Apr-19 03:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah I have looked into that also, looks promising but cost is ridiculous at this time.

For notary node, I just went with the largest server I could get my hands on that dont have any "management engine" things ... Athlon64s dont include any hardware back door that I know of.. BUt they also lack modern instuctions so are extremly slow at some tasks... Hoever 4x12 cores, is still decent, even if power sots a bit mroe hardware cost upfront offset this for a few years at least.


[10-Apr-19 04:19 AM] phm87#7395
I heard about some ARM chips that are opensource but I don't think that a coin/AC can run on one of these. I have the same idea about AMD (no known backdoor included) but as AMD chips are closed source and as backdoors are not known before being revealed, I cannot thrust AMD at 100%

What is realistic maximum amount of blockchains that one notarynode can handle and run?


[10-Apr-19 10:52 AM] Mark81#4505
I believe that running multiple blockhains in parallel is quite resource intensive.


[10-Apr-19 10:53 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it currently takes ~28GB of RAM to run the list of assetchains


[10-Apr-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
with the latest improvements, the limit is simply how many fit on a single node. so the question becomes what is that number (about 100?) and how many systems can a single operator handle


[10-Apr-19 11:00 AM] Mark81#4505
Btc is biggest by blockchain size if ethereum is not counted (who nuthead is even downloading full?). How much blockcain size affects to resources or does it these days?


[10-Apr-19 11:01 AM] CHMEX#0686
ripple ( if that counts as a blockchain) is like 50 times of BTC


[10-Apr-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no genesis block to early blocks for XRP


[10-Apr-19 11:02 AM] Mark81#4505
It crossed to my mind too but its ripple üòÇ


[10-Apr-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
by definition not a blockchain


[10-Apr-19 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
I think RAM usage will be the bottleneck


[10-Apr-19 11:03 AM] Mark81#4505
What part clients keep in memory from blochains? Full blockchain or part of it?


[10-Apr-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
only part, but usually 500MB to 1GB


[10-Apr-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
so it adds up with 100 chains


[10-Apr-19 11:46 AM] Mark81#4505
Hmmm... What if there would be tier1 and tier2 level notarizations? Current notarynode network would hold tier 1 level. Tier2 level would be free for public and would have its own chain for notarizations. And it is of course notarized by tier 1. This way market and coin communities would have chance to choose between both options. Run their own notary service or outsource this to tier 1. I dont know if this makes any sense or not.

@jl777c when creating a decentralized exchange would you do order book based trades where miners can front run the orders that are streamed on the order book..or do you fundamnetally like p2p swaps without an order book like say air swap is doing?


[16-Apr-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i did minerless orderbooks 4 years ago and that is the same basic design mm2 has


[16-Apr-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
if there are no miners mining the bid/asks they cant front run


[16-Apr-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
also it wont cost a txfee for every change in bid or ask or cancel that you do. that alone almost makes mined onchain orderbooks DOA


[16-Apr-19 09:10 AM] Mark81#4505
What is komodo on-demand-block assetchain blocktimes?


[16-Apr-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
is this a trick question?


[16-Apr-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
you just asked how much time between tx in the mempool


[16-Apr-19 09:13 AM] Mark81#4505
No. I am just wondering what is minimum time between blocks.


[16-Apr-19 09:14 AM] Mark81#4505
Does assetchains wait before posting new block if last one was second ago.


[16-Apr-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
it uses the diff adjustment and for a chain that is long dormant it would have faster blocks at first, but if there is a period of regular blocks, the diff will slow things down


[16-Apr-19 09:18 AM] Mark81#4505
So there is way to set maxinum period for blocktimes?


[16-Apr-19 09:19 AM] CHMEX#0686
an example is KOIN koin.explorer.dexstats.info  no block for about 3130 minutes


[16-Apr-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the max is very hard to set as if there is a lot of hashrate and it disappears, then what is the biggest differnce in hashrate before and after


[16-Apr-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so if 100% of all equihash miners are on a chain and then disappear and then we end up with just a single z9 mini...


[16-Apr-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
that seems a pretty extreme case, but it goes from 3000 Msols to 0.01 Msols or 300000x normal so it seems worst case is about 300000 minutes between blocks


[16-Apr-19 09:21 AM] Mark81#4505
I understand on demand feature but where i am getting is that period where transactions are constantly flowing in --> time then between blocks.


[16-Apr-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it will end up at one minute blocks


[16-Apr-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming constant hashrate


[16-Apr-19 09:23 AM] Mark81#4505
How hard would it be create variable blocktime for case when blockchain is needed ie. for games doing their things what ever it mught be?


[16-Apr-19 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not easy to just set a blocktime, but it could be approximated


[16-Apr-19 09:26 AM] Mark81#4505
In this case it would make blockchain more useful since transactions would propagate more faster when needed.


[16-Apr-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe an on demand chain with a faster blocktime


[16-Apr-19 09:28 AM] Mark81#4505
It could based into transaction amounts for certain period with blocktimes.


[16-Apr-19 09:28 AM] Mark81#4505
Faster blocktime would help.


[16-Apr-19 09:29 AM] Mark81#4505
Since it won't be problem with on demand blocks.


[17-Apr-19 05:38 AM] quantumfinance#9369
@jl777c are minerless orderbooks less secure cause of the lack of mining incentive ?


[17-Apr-19 05:39 AM] quantumfinance#9369
which AWS skills do you think are going to be the most 'on demand" in the financial/blockchain space?


[17-Apr-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
well the mining incentive doesnt make them secure, the opposite, it allows frontrunning, etc.


[17-Apr-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so not sure the question makes sense without more specific details


[17-Apr-19 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the prices are broadcast via multiple relay nodes to all the nodes in the network


[17-Apr-19 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
each node verifies all price quotes via the signature and utxo


[17-Apr-19 05:49 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not as if a node can be confused into swapping at a bad price


[17-Apr-19 05:49 AM] jl777c#5810
like any network, a ddos attack would flood the network, but that is an annoyance/disruption, not a direct loss of funds


[17-Apr-19 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
also the relay nodes would be run by holders of the DEX coin, which incentivizes them to make sure the orders are relayed


[17-Apr-19 06:58 AM] allbits#5898
Does the CRYPTO asset also benefit (in KMD) from chains that notarize to KMD?


[17-Apr-19 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but the economic value us much smaller than the BTC value, ie 50 BTC vs 50 KMD


[17-Apr-19 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it is 50 KMD * number of chains though...


[17-Apr-19 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it might add up


[17-Apr-19 07:25 AM] allbits#5898
It might ;)


[17-Apr-19 09:13 AM] costa2439#3771
"also the relay nodes would be run by holders of the DEX coin, which incentivizes them to make sure the orders are relayed"

What are your thoughts of market that might come around for yearly airdropped vote coins?


[18-Apr-19 10:13 AM] Mark81#4505
Can you see future where large holders can have secondary market for their voting powers like in income portion of notary node mined coins?


[18-Apr-19 10:18 AM] PTYX#6840
@Mark81 in order for people to trade votes?


[18-Apr-19 10:19 AM] Mark81#4505
Yes, that what tried to say.


[18-Apr-19 10:21 AM] Mark81#4505
But i believe that could be probably prevented with crypto conditions at least on chain by allowing transactions only to certain addresses. Of course people can do otc and go around that with it.


[18-Apr-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
with the vote bribery for the most part squelched at the source (NN doing revshare is very limited now) there is not much cash value to the VOTE


[18-Apr-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so how much would people pay for it?


[18-Apr-19 10:29 AM] Mark81#4505
if you can get elected every year from votes like in way that you can run more than one notary node i think there  it depends of revenue that notary mining generates in kmd.


[18-Apr-19 10:30 AM] Mark81#4505
In point where kmd price goes higher and gets stable i think there is your market that you are looking for.


[18-Apr-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
at most it would be worth 0.01 KMD


[18-Apr-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
20% of the 5%


[18-Apr-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
hopefully the whales will take into account the potential harm (or non-improvement) by this practice


[18-Apr-19 10:36 AM] Mark81#4505
i think this is market that will come once people get more familiar with kmd ecosystem.


[18-Apr-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
what would it do.. i guess the buyers would be investing to become a NN


[18-Apr-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
not quite the dynamic that is best, but not the end of the world either


[18-Apr-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the solution is to pay people to vote


[18-Apr-19 10:49 AM] Mark81#4505
Or they might promise certain % of revenue from mining. If i understand its quite predictable income from notary mining if theres not any hardware or software issues to deal with.


[18-Apr-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
i know!


[18-Apr-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we make it so you cant collect rewards without proof of voting in last year election


[18-Apr-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you sell the VOTE, then you forfeit your 5%


[18-Apr-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
which means it needs to be sold for more than 5%, but it is worth at most 1% and more like 0.5%


[18-Apr-19 10:52 AM] Mark81#4505
So newly buyed coins would have to wait year before getting apr?


[18-Apr-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it would seem so


[18-Apr-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810

[18-Apr-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the CC would only check that a VOTE was cast


[18-Apr-19 10:54 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350

I think I could make it so that when you vote, you get credits that allow to collect rewards


[18-Apr-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
and these credits you control and can use on whatever address


[18-Apr-19 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is becoming more complex... let us hope such drastic measures are not needed

so far there is no problem detected


[18-Apr-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
if this ever becomes a real issue and not just theoretical we can iterate solutions that lessen the issue


[18-Apr-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
this year we went to an ac_public chain to prevent any zvoting


[18-Apr-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810

[18-Apr-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
of course offchain agreements could be made for future revshares, but in some sense that is a business arrangement and not so sure that is against things anyway. if a whale wants to manage a tech to do the NN, then is that really so wrong?


[18-Apr-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
since it seems we cant stop this, maybe the answer is to facilitate it


[18-Apr-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
have a set of qualified tech NN operators and they can match up with some whale

i think the sensitivities about election manipulation is exaggerated, its not like an elected notary can "push the red button" or change policy, pass laws

and ultimately it is what the stake wants to do that decides and if the stake decides to hire out a tech, then so be it

if a whale moves the kmd after the votes airdrop then sells the private key controlling the votes, how is it possible to detect that votes were sold ?

[18-Apr-19 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
beyond that, it's not


[18-Apr-19 12:20 PM] phm87#7395
we can detect that kmd were moved after the votes airdrop but it can be a normal tx to move the coins (sth about interests to earn if doing some tx but I'm not sure if I understand correctly)


[18-Apr-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
ultimately it is not possible to detect this, that is why i am saying to just allow it


[18-Apr-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
be open about it


[18-Apr-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
its like making drugs illegal, it just increases the price of the drugs


[18-Apr-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
make it legal and its just normal business


[18-Apr-19 12:21 PM] phm87#7395
I agree about drugs


[18-Apr-19 12:24 PM] phm87#7395
we were thinking together with CG and other ppl about your idea to promote AC on explorers and do you want to list all public AC or only dpow AC or another list of AC ?


[18-Apr-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it should just be AC that need/want more people, so they should have a website


[18-Apr-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
if not, then nothing to send people to


[18-Apr-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810

id like to build a smart contract on KMD that pays users for locking up their KMD on the platform.  the smart contract would take say a 20% fee for every lock up and then pay a high interest like 4% daily for the locked up tokens


[19-Apr-19 10:26 AM] quantumfinance#9369
has that been done already ?


[19-Apr-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
rewards CC


[19-Apr-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
already done


[19-Apr-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
but it charges nothing more than txfee


[19-Apr-19 10:30 AM] quantumfinance#9369
that is pretty darn convenient


[19-Apr-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD itself wont have it but it can be done on KMDCC sidechain


[19-Apr-19 10:49 AM] quantumfinance#9369
thats a very interesting project i wish i do it


[19-Apr-19 10:49 AM] quantumfinance#9369
but not very good with code


[19-Apr-19 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is where do the coins come from


[19-Apr-19 10:49 AM] quantumfinance#9369
why wont komodo have it , is it beccause KMD is more like a metta layer ?


[19-Apr-19 10:50 AM] quantumfinance#9369
coins would have to be paid to the contract assigning a percentage of that payment to devs


[19-Apr-19 10:51 AM] quantumfinance#9369
coins cannot be unlocked one they are paid to contract so its non refundable


[19-Apr-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
but who would fund this? usually the creator of chain can allocate coins for rewards plan


[19-Apr-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
but existing coins have a fixed emission rate


[19-Apr-19 10:52 AM] quantumfinance#9369
ohh i see, so it would be paid in KMD?


[19-Apr-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810

Is there an easy way to find the largest ( by coin amount ) transaction sent to an address before a certain blockheight.   The only thing I can come up with is to listunspent , pull the json to a sheet and use a function to sort.  I‚Äôm just wondering if I‚Äôm missing something obvious to get this done more simply


[19-Apr-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
not listunspent as it could be spent already


[19-Apr-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
you would want getaddresstxids


[19-Apr-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
filter out all after a blockheight


[19-Apr-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
find the biggest


[19-Apr-19 11:12 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Will getaddresstxids work with watch-only addresses? they will be burn addresses so not worried about them being spent

How difficult to make: DPow bounty security testchain that is running CC with locked funds to  be released for  first who succesfully will reorg chain?


[20-Apr-19 12:21 AM] jl777c#5810
on the same chain?


[20-Apr-19 12:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems quite difficult


[20-Apr-19 12:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that it wont have consensus


[20-Apr-19 12:27 AM] jl777c#5810
so you would need to prove all the blocks in the reorged chain


[20-Apr-19 12:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it could be possible if all the nodes were making commitments every block


[20-Apr-19 12:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the thing is that the code is not very complex. it has specific code that says that if a block has been notarized, return error if it is trying to be reorged


[20-Apr-19 12:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so it literally cant happen. I guess some sort of memory wiping where it makes it forget about existing notarization would be needed.


[20-Apr-19 12:29 AM] jl777c#5810
not impossible, but to find a remote buffer overflow that will work on all nodes and precisely take out the notarization data without affecting anything else... like i say, not impossible, but until I see it, i wont believe it


[20-Apr-19 12:47 AM] Mark81#4505
Wouldn't point be exactly that bounty for that who can get new consensus over notarization data?


[20-Apr-19 12:49 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but if there is code that says if ( block reorgs notarized ) reject it
is there, then what you are asking for is what? something that can overwrite code inside all daemons across the network at the same time?


[20-Apr-19 12:49 AM] jl777c#5810
once its notarized, its notarized


[20-Apr-19 12:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and the node will simply refuse to reorg it


[20-Apr-19 12:50 AM] jl777c#5810
now maybe you can disrupt notarizations, but in that case the dpowconfs stays at 1, so everybody knows notarization is not happening


[20-Apr-19 12:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so even if you can disrupt notarizations, it doesnt help double spending


[20-Apr-19 12:51 AM] Mark81#4505
Would it be attracting PR?


[20-Apr-19 12:51 AM] jl777c#5810
there has been an ongoing bounty with the KMD chain for anybody that can reorg


[20-Apr-19 12:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the hashrate for KMD is very low compared to its marketcap


[20-Apr-19 12:51 AM] jl777c#5810
very low


[20-Apr-19 12:52 AM] jl777c#5810
many attempts have been made


[20-Apr-19 12:52 AM] jl777c#5810
and we have seen chains in the midst of constant attacks deploy dPoW and the attacks stop, or rather the negative effects of deep reorgs from the attacks stopped

Hi James, This was an amazing read! Also started reading your blog posts on medium.
 I'm wondering how is Komodo planning on protecting every solution the you or the team finds/designs/develops. Stuff like oracle solutions... Do you just plan on being way ahead of others in terms of dev that they won't have time to catch up ?
At the moment there is a ton of innovation being produced in Komodo but it is completely unheard of. How do you plan on finding clients since the majority ignores how smart contract work and the inherent fundamental problems they carry with them ?
So if the platform does not get any traction in terms of projects onboarding, what will prevent other platforms to shamelessly copy and adapt komodo developed solutions since the project is open source ?

@Deleted User my new HUSH whitepaper is pretty good advertising for why a project would want to migrate/upgrade to a KMD asset chain. To "prevent other platforms to shamelessly copy and adapt komodo developed solutions" is very easy. KMD has exponentially more dev resources than most projects, there is drastically more to gain by building upon KMD than trying to compete with it: https://github.com/MyHush/hush-v3-whitepaper/blob/master/hush-v3.pdf

A question regarding how the Komodo 'correct chain' is determined:    
Generally in most blockchains, the chain with the most cumulative work is considered the correct one.  (Many people think of this as 'longest chain', but this is wrong, a chain that was longer but at lower difficulty could have less cumulative work).  
In Komodo, notary nodes are allowed the chance to periodically produce one block at a low difficulty, to gain their rewards.  This results in notary nodes collectively getting a large portion of the total blocks.   
My question is:  does the best chain in komodo consider these notary node produces blocks as counting as low difficulty for purposes of determining the correct chain?  Or do they count at the same weight as normally mined (high difficulty) blocks?
This is important because if they count at the same weight, then Notary Nodes have a much greater impact on determining the correct chain than they 'should', which one could say was more centralized because notary nodes would have far more ability to determine the best chain than their proof of work would indicate.


[24-Apr-19 10:58 PM] jl777c#5810
it counts as the difficulty mined, easy diff, so it is not any advantage


[24-Apr-19 10:59 PM] jl777c#5810
this issue is only for KMD itself, other chains have no advantages at all for notaries

ok, so because notary node blocks are low difficulty, they dont give a group of notaries the ability to 51% attack, or determine which chain or fork to follow.  Thats good.


[24-Apr-19 11:37 PM] jl777c#5810
the notaries are designed to be as passive as possible


[24-Apr-19 11:37 PM] jl777c#5810
they wait for the chain to come to a normal consensus


[24-Apr-19 11:37 PM] jl777c#5810
then when the notaries agree on a recent height+hash, they submit this proposed notarization to the network


[24-Apr-19 11:38 PM] jl777c#5810
EVERY node then checks to see if that height+hash matches what they ALREADY had locally, then and only then do they change state in any way at all due to the proposed notarization. It adds a dynamic checkpoint to the already existing checkpoint code and also if it detects an attempted reorg of a notarized height, it rejects it


[24-Apr-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is a very small surgical change designed to only protect notarized heights that were already on the local node


[24-Apr-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
the power of evil notaries would be to NOT notarize, thus smoothly degrading to a non-notarized chain


[24-Apr-19 11:47 PM] Alexfrog#1338
Komodo always seems very well designed against attacks, whenever I try to come up with some way its vulnerable, its like you already thought about it. üòâ


[25-Apr-19 12:15 AM] jl777c#5810
I foresaw the many chains world and the lack of hashpower to secure them all, so I needed a very efficient way to secure the dozen ecosystem chains. I guess when making something you will depend on yourself, you go the extra mile, but really I just made the fewest changes to an already working system. That seems the best way, especially with consensus systems, where seemingly easy things to do like DAA is full of pitfalls. So if it aint broke, I dont fix it. Which mean just adding to the already existing checkpointing and later when we found some 90%+ hashrate attack needed to specifically prevent reorging notarized chain, we added that. The final aspect that made it as close to 100% protection as I can imagine was the dpowconfs. That simply sets the "confirmations" field to 1, until it is notarized. With that trivial change, exchanges that rely on "confirmations" > N automatically wait for notarizations. We found that exchanges just wont make any changes to their payment processing code, so this was the way to get them to support notarizations without doing anything. And since the main risk of evil notaries is that notarizations can be stopped, the dpowconfs is an automatic detector for that condition


[25-Apr-19 12:16 AM] jl777c#5810
we also find that when there are blockchain events, ie. chain split, larger forks, the notaries dont reach consensus themselves and this also triggers dpowconfs to stay at 1. This is a good thing as the last thing you want to do when there is an active chain split is processing any large amounts!

probably during connect block, it found that the previous logical timestamp is newer than the current one.

it is harmless as long as you dont assume timestamps are monotonically increasing

World's best 51% security is only with spawning own chain and dPoW it with. No other blockchain gives that level of assurance...


[29-Apr-19 07:17 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
1) proof of concepts,  application may not need all the functionality and cost of a forked chain. 2)   Multiple functionalities that would have be added in or adapted into the forked chain that can be added in very easily with assetchain generation( cryptoconditions ) , also lower overhead for getting a secure blockchain up,  DPoW gives the 51% protection , notaries have run nodes which increase decentralization.  Also many products essential to getting a coin off the ground are already built around rapid assetchain addition  like the multicoin wallet or atomic swaps.   Starting a assetchain would put you months ahead in work completed compared to a freshly forked chain


[29-Apr-19 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea about tezos, but yes this is open source and why indeed would anybody build on an expensive blockchain and subject to paying that coin as fees forever? with komodo chains they get the best of both worlds, instant jump start to development, unique ability to create a custom consensus baked into the blockchain, and have total control over their coin/project. There is no KMD tax. Asking how KMD benefits without any direct taxation, is like asking how countries with low to no tax end up with a disproportionate amount of business


[29-Apr-19 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
and an existing project can be cloned, sure, but what is the value in that? if you are making a new custom consensus level change, it makes a new blockchain never existed before and has a unique value add


[30-Apr-19 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
really?


[30-Apr-19 04:26 AM] jl777c#5810
if you say so. but in general a pure clone have very little value


[30-Apr-19 04:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so yes, you can make a pure clone as anybody else can and have something without much value


[30-Apr-19 04:28 AM] jl777c#5810
in that case it wont matter what his starting point is


[30-Apr-19 04:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the key is how much work is it to make such a killer app


[30-Apr-19 04:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i claim that by making a new CC, you can create a killer app and have it embedded in a dedicated chain


[30-Apr-19 04:29 AM] jl777c#5810
which issues native coins that are unique


[30-Apr-19 04:29 AM] jl777c#5810
a lotter smart contract on top of a cloned infrastructure will have large value?


[30-Apr-19 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, if you want to make up fantasy scenarios, you are welcome to


[30-Apr-19 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
a dapp running on a cloned infrastructure you claim will have more value that a dedicated chain with the dapp logic as part of the chain consensus

[30-Apr-19 04:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and if you think that replicating the entire infrastructure for an existing coin is just as easy as making a runtime fork with a dynamic CC, then go for it


[30-Apr-19 04:37 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you have the frame of mind that with one magic want you can replicate the entire infrastructure of an ecosystem and solve any and all issues that will inevetably happen, it seems we disagree. it is a lot of work, but if you also believe that users wont care about centralization, then all this is moot


[30-Apr-19 04:38 AM] jl777c#5810
how can 0 be lower than 0?


[30-Apr-19 04:39 AM] jl777c#5810
with a komodo chain, all the margins are for the magical dapp creator as there is no KMD tax


[30-Apr-19 04:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so the question is if it really is 0 cost to clone some platform


[30-Apr-19 04:39 AM] jl777c#5810
chainlizard allows to spawn a customized new chain in minutes and is part of how komodo is designed


[30-Apr-19 04:40 AM] jl777c#5810
likely other chains are not designed to be so easily forked and maybe it ends up being a bit more difficult than copy/paste. then what do you do?


[30-Apr-19 04:43 AM] jl777c#5810
cost will be the same using komodo or a cloned system (assuming there is zero cost to clone it)


[30-Apr-19 04:43 AM] jl777c#5810
since it is 0 cost to clone tezos, can you make one for 1 KMD?

there is a quantum resistant chain QRL that has in its roadmap to get dilithium added to it, maybe in a year, not sure the details but it is most definitely not easy to change blockchain consensus

Anyway, u can try assetchains params to create a PoS blockchain. 
Then check existing crypto-conditions documentation and many reference code,
Then make a CC for your own PoS assetchain. 

All with a cost of 0 KMD.
If desired can go with dPoW with your choice or not.

If ur blockchain project goes big, can scale it too, with MoMoM tech. Already tested last year.

I guess you need to first define that "Guy". I just assume that, that guy is a developer, a developer who can code in languages which are complied to  native code, instead of bytecode, for now. If so, the finest route is the same I expressed in steps earlier in my comments. 

If a Javascript dev, better wait for @Deleted User to finish his work, then that too will be possible soon enough.


[30-Apr-19 07:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also read. Without reading the written material you are missing a lot of knowledge and wisdom about komodo.


[30-Apr-19 07:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Komodo is NOT a smart contracts platform. 
It is in my opinion Smart Custom Consensus Platform

I think the WP comparison works really well for the fork vs. assetchain discussion. A developer with a great website idea can code the php from scratch but won‚Äôt be able to take advantage of the tons of plugins already built for the WP framework, similar situation with Komodo and its CC,  you *could* custom code functionality into your chain, or take advantage of the dozens of already coded and tested modules.  Since time= money ,  just like with WordPress you save a lot of both.  This is especially important for people don‚Äôt have lots of money or dev experience  to be able to work on a project.

@artik123   Governance can be done with consensus level changes,  cc payments is a good example of governance functionality  through consensus.


[30-Apr-19 08:12 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes I am sure that could be done as well,  though currently we don‚Äôt have a voting CC.   CC is very powerful in that you can pretty much make anything abide by consensus

Governance is something that people I assume want enforced so  there needs to be a mechanism to enforce it

Komodo (4) 

[30-Apr-19 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
look at miketout, he was CTO of parallels and also did .net at MSFT. He could have spent time making a blockchain from scratch, but realized building on top of komodo would save a lot of time. within one year, he delivered on the whitepaper and now has extended komodo tech to some pretty amazing level


[30-Apr-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
projects are switching to komodo if they dont have a large dev team also, as they can get a lot of  dev automatically done, like HUSH, hempcoin and likely more to follow


[30-Apr-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is a wide spectrum

telling redhat about this "Guy" probably makes a lot of sense

in any case, companies that use komodo tech are free to devise their own business models, as komodo doesnt constrain them

it seems this is the lowest barrier to entry and would maximize adoption

Last years website had freedom to .... freedom to .... freedom to .... with a video.

Komodo offers anyone to create their platform of multi chain and notary nodes.  It is a platform to create platforms.


[30-Apr-19 07:01 PM] Mylo#8306
Blockchain is not very approachable to regular ppl.  Currency was the first application of this tech - now it is more advanced currency applications.

if it isnt a tech issue, there is no deterministic solution and it can be debated, literally forever and usually end up with two or more sides, totally convinced they are correct.


[01-May-19 01:02 AM] jl777c#5810
there are not obvious compiler or linker errors to fix


[01-May-19 01:02 AM] jl777c#5810
no algorithms to deal with


[01-May-19 01:03 AM] jl777c#5810
non-deterministic


[01-May-19 01:03 AM] jl777c#5810
others are tasked to deal with such issues, I do tech, that can be shown to work without debates

just one question about end users and linux. how many android phones are there? none of those phones are used by any end users, is your position?


[01-May-19 01:07 AM] jl777c#5810
osx is also arguably a close relative to linux, so apple products are not used by any end users either?


[01-May-19 01:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i think you are totally underestimating the pervasiveness of linux


[01-May-19 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and yes, I know there are many forks of linux that are not linux anymore, but my point is that without linux in the first place, they wouldnt exist


[01-May-19 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, and a large number of websites running linux, i guess those are all just hobbyists


[01-May-19 01:12 AM] jl777c#5810
so we have a total disagreement about some fundamental things and if your position is that linux is just for hobbyists or embedded software companies, then it seems for you komodo can only be for a very small number of people, but to me I know komodo will allow crypto to be used by the masses. But the gap is too big when your position is that linux is just for hobbyists

that is why I want things to be less centralized around me and have avoided anything non-technical as much as possible. If I left, there wouldnt be any changes at all outside the open source side of things. and for that we know have devs that are familiar with pretty much the entire codebase

[01-May-19 03:40 AM] jl777c#5810
i can just come up with some crazy ideas now and again and others can make it real, so even if i reduce my hours to only 40hrs per week, i think the overall tech output will increase and its not like the marketing side has been able to keep up with the old level of production

In your chicken and egg post [1] are you saying that at chain setup within the 100blocks to create the early tx. Then restart setting -ac_earlytxid when completed (within the 100 blocks)?

@Deleted User  https://explorer.myhush.org/address/RFZxRtLkHxTfpoa6EYaeUYNewCvr7MYU7c  I'm not sure if this is what your asking for.   I'm trying to open up BarterDEX version 1.1.3-rc1  and after a rather long time of sitting on the clock after entering the pass phrase, it eventually opened up just now.  But, I've been successfully sending HUSH3 (aka mining to it) for several days. I'm wondering if that explains anything. In the last hour, I've  changed wallett addresses and  now send  mining to the Agama wallet address.

Spv server probably just was down.  BarterDEX GUI is being deprecated in the not too distant future .  Use agama for now

Core fans think that people will willingly pay BTC fees in order of 1000 Usd to use the base layer for settlement (in fact they're looking forward to it in their plans, the so called fee-market), while most common users will only ever use the Ligthing Network or other 2nd layers. So miners will have a lot of fee income even with blocksize capped. I think that's utter nonsense tbh

https://blocknet.co/the-evolution-of-the-decentralized-exchange-a-brief-history/ mentioned KMD "The aforementioned Komodo platform offered many great innovations such as private transactions, side chains and more, but was still a ‚Äúmiddleman‚Äù solution and not built on a protocol. Billing themselves as the ‚Äúplatform of platforms‚Äù, developers were restricted to using the Komodo platform only. This could be very limiting as it is an enforcement of a ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù approach, which is a barrier to potential innovation. By this time, Komodo had also begun utilizing an (unrecognized) atomic swap process on its own DEX, Barterdex, but they use a partially centralized order matching system for buy and sell orders that is similar to Waves and also feature centralized Electrum servers in the trading process itself which ultimately increases risk and reduces decentralization. Since Bartedex was not built on a protocol geared specifically towards decentralized exchange and the Komodo system requires nodes to back up the Komodo Blockchain every 10 minutes into the KMD chain and then into the BTC chain, this ‚Äúpiggyback‚Äù system may cause scaling issues in the future as this process may cause blockchain bloat due to the limitations of the BTC block, which is also about 10 minutes or 1MB per block."

I'd like to change something in Komodo but I don't know how to do it properly. Can you help me ?
Few months ago, a virus was injected in few yiimp pools. The BTC wallet was emptied by hacker.
Entry points were identified and fixed into yiimp but we wanted to add a kind of "condom" within bitcoin wallet code.
With existing options, some pools disabled broadcasting of tx and broadcast manually.
I performed few changes into bitcoin code (forbid to withdraw more than 1% of total balance with sendmany and sendtoaddress, forbid dumpprivkey and so on). Changes were tested successfully but with hardcoded values into sendmany and sendmoney
I tried to make it more clean (either use arguments at compilation OR use the coin.conf file) but my code doesn't work. I asked help to some bitcoin devs that I'm in contact with but they didn't help so much. They suggest to use a proxy in front of the coin node but it will reduce perfs and I'm not fan to use additional software
As my pool doesn't have bitcoin and only altcoins, I'm interested to have such a feature into komodo and other altcoins
I discussed it briefly with @metaphilibert he suggested to me to talk about it in public

@phm87 check `src/komodo_utils.h` for the `GetArg()`s that are used to set some globals.   maybe you could make a command line arg `-max1pcsend` for maximum 1% send out.   and add your code from patches above within a check for this global being set in the functions you want to have this 1% send out restriction - `sendtoaddress, sendmany etc.`.

That would be my first attempt.    best asking in #üíª‚îÉdev-general , recently @Deleted User james and a few others have added stuff.   the jl777 repo jl777 branch has some new stuff.   do a `grep -ril earlytxid` for some hints.

Hi could Verus auto-notarization be used for auto payout for revenue share of the asset coins?


[19-May-19 12:30 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[19-May-19 12:30 AM] jl777c#5810
notarization is not payout


[19-May-19 12:30 AM] jl777c#5810
better to use is payments CC snapshot option that does airdrops


[19-May-19 12:31 AM] jl777c#5810
but that doesnt work crosschain and most revshares get crosschain revenues

Very ETH specific. We are thinking about making some standards (pretty much an extension/usage of cc-assets).

No

[28-May-19 08:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Notary nodes need both KMD and BTC full nodes


[28-May-19 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the notaries do


[28-May-19 08:43 AM] gcharang#6833
if you understand how lite wallets/spv work, you can see how komodo nodes will be able verify the pow that is backing up the notarised transactions without running btc nodes


[28-May-19 08:56 AM] Alexfrog#1338
hypothetically, if you didnt trust the notaries, would you need to have a synced btc blockchain?


[28-May-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, anybody can independently validate


[28-May-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
or you could use SPV servers


[28-May-19 10:26 AM] gcharang#6833

the other KMD nodes already don't trust the notaries, they verify(validate) every notarization done by notaries, if a notarization is found to validate consensus rules, it is rejected by the regular KMD nodes

@jl777c    THIS WAS POSTED IN A CHAT BY THIS KID WHO IS A BTC MAXIMALIST, hates BCH AND ARGUES that big blocks are cryptographically unfeasible  because modern hardware is compromised/ backdoored since 2011, he was trying to convince people to ban any settlement that wasnt done in BTC , basically censoring people from being able to settle trades in anything but BTC because anything else is a "lie"   mind you this groups has a lot of whales ans many people seem to believe him .

"imo, honesty is the best policy. is it really the case that technology has progressed ? from my perch the hardware (backdoors) and software (unnecessary complexity, e.g. systemd) environments have regressed."

"imo Bitcoin people have the most incentive and will power to effect the change that ripples out. potentially the most leverage due to sound money and decentralization. but if the leaders, who should know better, ignore the problems in the field, tail risks are increased. to conclude, the best marketing is to be aligned with the truth and selling to those who it resonates with. that means setting expectations properly and battling those who oversell and underdeliver for a quick buck."

@quantumfinance so somehow the BTC maximalist uses different CPU for the legacy coin?


[02-Jun-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
the backdoor security issue has nothing to do with blocksize


[02-Jun-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
its not like a bigger block chain uses a different mode of the CPU vs the small block, and legacy coin has big blocks, just as long as it is segwit


[02-Jun-19 10:52 AM] quantumfinance#9369
so can you definitely say that bigger blocks are not less secure than smaller blocks ?    i guess what i want to undertand is why blocksize doesnt matter if the blockz=size determines the amount of data stored...  if you would have a link to where i can read more about this topic id be amazing, ive been looking online but i havent found a resource


[02-Jun-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
at some extremes too big of a block is not good


[02-Jun-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly you cant have gigabyte blocks with todays internet


[02-Jun-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
but 4MB blocks are the same 4MB, whether they are in normal protocol or segwit


[02-Jun-19 11:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
just in segwit, you hide 3MB under one shell and only show the other shell containing 1MB and pretend that you didn't put 4MB on the table

thoughts on this? https://bisq.community/t/dirty-btc-coins-on-the-xmr-market/7798  in the context of DEXs and things such as Lightning Network (that might need KYC in the future because, tainted bitcoins) ? I know the SEC recently said something about DEXs from a money transmitter standpoint, but I am still _amazed_ the US government has not [tried to] outlaw DEXs (along with privacy coins) or how they really aren't under mainstream attention yet.... Typically the implications of DEX/Privacy Coins would traditionally be a cause for concern for governments and it has not garnered too much attention, at least in the US.

[04-Jun-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so rather than fight a losing battle, they made it very clear that a non-custodial DEX (which they believe wont be practical) is exempted


[04-Jun-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
and even a centrally controlled website that just displays things, is ok


[04-Jun-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so, given that atomicDEX is in the clear, it is easy to use, and it will be the only non-KYC mandated way to swap, people will use it


[04-Jun-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
and so whatever taintedness they want to enforce, wont matter


[04-Jun-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, it is best to use something like PIRATE where there is no history at all


[04-Jun-19 08:52 AM] dan.#2473
do you think any coins in any analysis that are viewed as tainted, will have to stay in a DEX (and secondary) ecosystem in the future? Assuming a weird dystopian future KYC crypto world


[04-Jun-19 08:53 AM] dan.#2473
it makes sense to me there are going to be separate values placed on the same coin


[04-Jun-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810

What is your take on the pay to anyone segwit attack. 1. Is it possible?

```The Satoshi v0.5.3 protocol views those P2SH addresses as scripts without any public key (i.e. no signature required to spend them), so they can be spent by anyone. Essentially SegWit transactions as interpreted by the Satoshi protocol, before Core unilaterally decided to softfork the protocol, to be transactions sent to some script that has no protection against anyone spending them....

Thus when the Satoshi v0.5.3 miners decide to force Core to fork-off, they will start spending those to themselves when they win a block and the Core miners will fork-off and the Satoshi miners will not fork off.....

Everyone who has their BTC stored in addresses that begin with¬†1¬†will receive a free airdrop of Core tokens when Core is forced to fuck-off (ahem I mean fork-off, lol), in addition to their Satoshi BTC tokens. So then they can sell those Core shitcoins to buy moar real Satoshi BTC. Those who ignorantly hodl their ‚ÄúBTC‚Äù in addresses that begin with¬†3will have their Satoshi protocol BTC taken by the miners and they will only keep their soon-to-be-worthless Core shitcoins.```

with our fast action, we rescued about 8 million KMD and over 100 BTC, but as of now it seems about a million KMD has been stolen. I am working on a plan that I hope will be an acceptable outcome to most. Please be aware that even if your funds got swept, there are others that have nothing left and i would like to come up with a plan where nobody is wiped out. in order to do this, we need as accurate of a damage assessment as possible. So please make sure to file a claim with your details as soon as possible so we can get a handle on what actually happened.

once we quantify the actual problem at hand, then we can make a specific plan. I would like to make all the smaller accounts 100% whole, but there isnt enough funds for all accounts to be 100%. I think if the big amounts ends up around 80% to 90%. As long as the damage is less than a million KMD, then I will be able to find the funds to cover it, but if it is more than a million, well we will cross that path if it turns out that way.

So for now, we need to be able to assess the scope of the damage, it could be that we wont have 100% of people claiming and the 5% rewards (400,000 per year) can end up covering most of the claims if they are coming in over time. What does it mean to be a small account? A big account? I dont know yet. I am without sleep for over 30+ hours and I dont want to make any decisions in this state.

Please be patient and file your claims, that is what will help the most. The general plan is to protect the smaller accounts fully, make sure nobody is wiped out, use 5% rewards to cover some of the costs and I will also personally put in half a million KMD. Until we have the accurate numbers, we can only guess as to the specific plan.

@ronyi I actually had a talk with our CTO just moments ago, that a collaboration on a wallet "framework" would be good for security reasons. However, the issue is related to a NPM package, that should've been version locked - or maybe even fuzzed. I also agree with @Mylo - everyone has their own plans and own strategies.


[06-Jun-19 12:20 AM] ronyi#5719
I understand, but just was "lucky" coincidence, example Verus Enchanted used another NPM package('s). There will never be 0 security risk. Yes everyone has own plans and own strategies, but using same "framework" at once good and bad (more eyes see more). So far, luckily I haven't lost KMD or other coins and fortunately not even now.

[07-Jun-19 12:50 AM] jl777c#5810
we can start to discuss such things 10 years from now, i am not against this sort of idea, all depends on what the overall conditions of crypto is at that time


[07-Jun-19 07:37 AM] lion#5837
All this will be relevant when we have an easy dex wallet with an atomic swap function to buy confidentiality coins! Then there will be no need for special privacy of kmd! As well as the principle of interchangeability of coins - also suitable! But the question is whether this will prevent the adoption of a coin? We need a whole ecosystem with a variety of functions and private transactions are not the only thing needed from the coin - any separate integrated mixing protocol and the like can provide this!

@lion you could have been testing the dex right now if not for the Agama business
already a lot of the community tried it
it is in beta now


[07-Jun-19 07:53 AM] lion#5837
@gcharang  Yes - but I'm talking about a stable and already tested version!

Something similar in interface and convenience to a chainzilla wallet - only with a built-in exchange and with iron protection against vulnerabilities!)

for example, Zooko from ZEC wants to ban unshielded transactions - I wonder how this will affect KOMODO


[07-Jun-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
not at all


[07-Jun-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
privacy is moved to sidechains and mostly to PIRATE, which has a larger anon set than ZEC


[07-Jun-19 08:04 AM] lion#5837
And it is also noteworthy that pirate Z-addresses are supported by third-party exchanges! And this is good news!


[07-Jun-19 08:08 AM] lion#5837
the pirate project needs only sufficient liquidity - which will work as a massive marketing tool and technology will be noticed by large masses of users and companies that need privacy!

I received the small kmd to my old address.  I have completely uninstalled the Agama wallet, and have now installed the Verus Agama wallet.  I've set up my new address, and completed the refund form. So my question is do I use the Verus Agama wallet to login to my old address to send the small KMD to my new address?  Thanks for the help.

when all this happened the other day, I was able to login to the old agama wallet, but got the white screen, so I am not sure how I would send kmd from the old address.  Thats why I was thinking I could do this from the Verus Agama wallet.  As my name indicates, I'm fairly clueless, is there a better way to do this?  And if I should be asking this in a different area on discord, let me know.

[09-Jun-19 09:48 PM] alexoh#0560
Hi
I have a frustration, and I will ask again.

Since December 10, 2017, Agama has been loaded and has been dead.
At that time, I did not even know there was a wallet.dat file and just formatted it.

After installing new Acama purse, the KMD coin in my Agama purse is missing.
After that, the transaction history file after December 6, 2017 disappears. The transaction history for about 5 days should not appear at all.
At about 97.3%, it disappears from the last step.

The agama version used at that time is 23a. In previous versions, to get the interest, you had to do it manually (that is, when you send it from my agama to my wallet bitlex and then send it back to the agama)
However, the 23a version did not send it out, but the button was automatically pressed to add interest.

I've had a lot of chats here (https://komodo-platform.slack.com/), but all the chats are gone.

And while he was chatting, he told me:
"There are over 126,000 missing coins at any address."
I asked them if they could find out which address they were in, and they said they could not do it because they were a private company.

At the time, the only thing they said was that there was no way to recover wallet.dat.
I tried to recover the SSD from then, but I still can not recover it.

here ,
One of @Nabob, @PTY or me @ tarun.gulati admitted that version 23a had a lot of problems.

Hmmm. What if this AI softaware would change peoples thinking in long term that videos are not trustless unless their hashes had been uploaded to universal ledger to internet or done by with standard video codec that  do hash timestamps in way bitcoin does its checkpoints to blockchain? So preparing to future creating new standard around this thinking might needed.  Every video recording device vould jump to this standard or supoort this once this comes issue in next decade.

@Steff   That‚Äôs strange coinpayments won‚Äôt work in your location.  You can use Veruspay to add KMD payments to Shopify.  https://link.medium.com/eatInJgutX

[15-Jun-19 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
currently not 100% have been claimed, so it came from sweep address, but we are not far from where all the sweep funds are used up. at that point i will need to contribute to keep the refunds going. which i will do

jl777 are you considering buying ARRR for SuperNET when viewkeys become available? my current understanding is, that lack of transparency was the reason you were hesitant to buy ARRR for SuperNET


[15-Jun-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe i should buy 100 BTC of PIRATE...


[15-Jun-19 12:58 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
with viewkeys soon(ish) available, it would make a lot of sense :D
probably there are miners willing to sell big amounts OTC, so shouldn't be any problems

[17-Jun-19 09:02 AM] Optimus#6435
@Deleted User  these measures of banks and governments will not keep pace with the achievements of free anonymous developers - they were good in the 20th century - in that paradigm their control system worked well! And now - even taking for example TOR - they can‚Äôt overcome how they don‚Äôt try! After all, they have to hire specialists to confront from among all the same cryptopanks! supporters of decentralization and privacy among developers are much more than those developers in the service of the government! Yes - we will face difficulties - but they will ALWAYS be in the role of catch-up until they understand that it is necessary not to prohibit but to use technology! The world of cars of the future will not communicate in dollar transactions! Most people do not need cryptocurrency - they will have enough steblecoins - but robots and machines with AI - they only need butt for interaction and cryptocurrency and networks built on the principle of decentralization! Maybe not a blockchain but a DAG or something else not invented! And Bitcoin will be just a convenient means of saving value and not a fee for coffee! Although the network lightning will solve this problem like other sidechains! Otherwise, only the invasion of aliens!))

Is this correct?: When the mobile dex makes use (and is dependent on) of dht, then it won't work over tor.


[17-Jun-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure but it seems unlikely to work over tor

Hi 
again:) is there a script how to  accept kmd on shopify without coinpayments.
?


[17-Jun-19 01:23 PM] Optimus#6435
@Deleted User  their Fiat during the next financial crisis (and it will be - believe me) nobody will need it! Perhaps the new gold-bitcoin trading pair will become popular! - then there will be an interesting sight! You've heard about how Gongkong rich people en masse against the background of protests and extradition laws begin to withdraw capital in offshores! And what is the main offshore of the future. - correctly - anonymous credit currencies! What is more anonymous - the more money will flow into it! Previously, this role was not predicted by ZEC - but time does not stand still and we already have ARRR - this basic protocol with zero knowledge still makes noise that will also be reflected for the KOMODO ecosystem!


[17-Jun-19 01:30 PM] Optimus#6435
and you still do not forget about Venezuela where anonymous cryptocurrencies are even more popular than Bitcoin - it remains for them only to get acquainted with ARRR:pirate:


[17-Jun-19 01:33 PM] Optimus#6435
straining the strange correlation of KMD and BTC - intersection of graphs - it means people are pouring in dollars - real money is not going to be sold to the project - they accumulate! And speculators are paired with bitcoin now!


[17-Jun-19 02:21 PM] actionslacks#4072
my perhaps naive hope is that the usurping of govt control is already underway


[18-Jun-19 02:15 AM] Optimus#6435
@Deleted User  Of course, there is a solution - this is a positive experience of introducing the blockchain into the state system! And countries such as Switzerland, Malta, Georgia, Belarus - an excellent example of how to legalize cryptocurrencies at the national government level in a short time - increase both the investment attractiveness of these countries and the efficiency of the blockchain in the current economic trend to become autonomous without the human factor from which millions of dollars are lost every year from the budget! Code is law! Here is the creed of the new digital age! the rest of the states conducting strict regulation will be noncompetitive in the new economy of the Internet of things of the artificial Internet and the blockchain! And no China and others will stop it! People soon realize the advantages of these technologies over the outdated Fintechs of the 20th century! And most of all, countries with cheap renewable energy will win! Iceland is a good example of the introduction of mining built on geothermal energy - and a positive shift is already visible! Central banks will not be needed! An artificial intelligence machine will not trust the intermediary represented by the bank to interact with another machine - this is not effective!
The only thing with which there will be some time to fight is anonymous cryptocurrency! But this will end when the millenial generation takes over the world!


[18-Jun-19 02:24 AM] Optimus#6435
Komodo technology is perfectly integrated into the economic structure of the future economy of robots and artificial intelligence! In the gaming industry alone, you can make a revolution using technologies like ‚Äúgameplay proof‚Äù or something like that ‚Äî along with the development of VR and cloud computing ‚Äî it will revolutionize very soon! It‚Äôs just that everyone is busy ONLY with the price on the markets - paying little attention to the technology itself that is developing exponentially! The KOMODO project in this regard is unique - the very correct development vectors are set and the correct accents not only on Fintech - but also other areas like gaming, oracles, artificial intelligence and distributed file storage!:Komodo:


[18-Jun-19 02:27 AM] Optimus#6435
The world of the future is not the power of governments but the power of supranational corporations! This will replace citizenship - people will be differentiated by belonging to the community of a certain corporation centralized and decentralized - if individual countries make an even more friendly environment for the development of a decentralized economy!

@jl777c  I have a few questions about how fees earned for mm2 will be converted .    1. Which exchanges will be used for conversion , CEX or DEX( mm2)       2. Will this be done on bulk all at once a buy wall  ? or periodically .                                              3.  Or will it be an active buy  action in which all sell orders are filled , which will spike the price up ?     4. Will there be news on the time in which orders will be  are placed to prevent front running by insiders including you and close team.  (Buying KMD before hand and then placing the  optimum highest sell order in which initially bought KMD will be filled when all the fees is converted all at once potentially making easy money with insider knowledge among the team or group , also members within the  insider group can all front run each other) .  Your thought thanks

[21-Jun-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
i would want to buy the KMD at the best price possible, so i would only announce after the conversion is done


[21-Jun-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
at scale, the conversions would need to be an ongoing process


[21-Jun-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it will be public knowledge how much funds are accumulated


[21-Jun-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it is public knowledge it will be converted to KMD


[21-Jun-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
i wont be chasing prices and likely would just put reasonable offers on the books and wait


[21-Jun-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
there is no strict deadline to convert and payout, so there wont be any special event for people to front run


[21-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Coin2stable#1872
Ok, however  you did not say if you will announce the buy order place , e.g . list of buy orders by initiated by the fee conversion processes


[21-Jun-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
above: "i would want to buy the KMD at the best price possible, so i would only announce after the conversion is done"


[21-Jun-19 12:42 PM] Coin2stable#1872
and front runners can only be you or insiders in the team


[21-Jun-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
my duty is to the hodlers of DEX


[21-Jun-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
what front runners?


[21-Jun-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i place order at X and wait


[21-Jun-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
if you put an order above X, it fills before, ok, so?


[21-Jun-19 12:43 PM] Coin2stable#1872
yes you duty is also to for them to be informed how there fees will be converted and when


[21-Jun-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
no


[21-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Coin2stable#1872
so know how their revs is used


[21-Jun-19 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
i do not have a duty to disclose details that would make it more expensive to convert


[21-Jun-19 12:44 PM] Coin2stable#1872
other wise it can be missed used , traded with , speculated with


[21-Jun-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it is on the blockchain, how to misuse or speculate without being detected??


[21-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Coin2stable#1872
you can essentially play with investors earnings


[21-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Coin2stable#1872
send it to a CEX exchange leverage it


[21-Jun-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
dexfees would be aggregated and then converted, it is all on the blockchain, nothing hidden


[21-Jun-19 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont use CEX


[21-Jun-19 12:45 PM] Coin2stable#1872
and have fun trading and if money is lost you can always clam hack


[21-Jun-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
why would i do such silly things?


[21-Jun-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont trust me, then dont buy any DEX


[21-Jun-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
thats ok


[21-Jun-19 12:46 PM] Coin2stable#1872
just saying investor will need transparency on which order


[21-Jun-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
blockchain provides the transparency


[21-Jun-19 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
historically, even when there is a hack, i have madegood to the people who lost funds

only when investors know which address is placing the order


[21-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Coin2stable#1872
will the be possible


[21-Jun-19 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
the address is public


[21-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Coin2stable#1872
this


[21-Jun-19 12:47 PM] Coin2stable#1872
so I will know what each  DEX earning fee address is doing


[21-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Coin2stable#1872
so I can track it KMD buy order on mm2


[21-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Coin2stable#1872
and make an account , that is balanced not just me


[21-Jun-19 12:48 PM] Coin2stable#1872

i have proven i am a good manager of funds


[21-Jun-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if you dont have confidence in me, best to sell it, a lot of people looking to buy now


[21-Jun-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
DEX never did an ICO


[21-Jun-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
people just started trading it


[21-Jun-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not a company


[21-Jun-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i am responsible to people to get the tech working and when there are enough revenues to distribute it


[21-Jun-19 12:51 PM] applecider#7505
Nice words I am a pragmatic here,


[21-Jun-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not obligated to disclose every step of everything along the way, especially if that would make a worse result for the revshare


[21-Jun-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
broadcasting a big buy ahead of time? just so others can make some quick pump money??


[21-Jun-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
if you think that is me, you dont know me


[21-Jun-19 12:52 PM] applecider#7505
but it is true that investor want to know they are getting something for what they pay .


[21-Jun-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
i have paid out for SUPERNET and CRYPTO and REVS, all transparent, all on the blockchain, recorded


[21-Jun-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont gamble with peoples money


[21-Jun-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
though you might consider the specific timing i convert as a bit of a gamble due to market fluctuations, but i dont see a way to avoid that


[21-Jun-19 12:54 PM] Coin2stable#1872
, However DEX value is based on it the earning potential


[21-Jun-19 12:54 PM] jl777c#5810
i managed to get a nice 50% boost with the CRYPTO payout with good timing, so it does help


[21-Jun-19 12:55 PM] Coin2stable#1872
if you did what you liked the investors will lose fate and sell all their holdings


[21-Jun-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
what does disclosing details that harms the revshare have to do with earning potential, other than to lower it?


[21-Jun-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, then sell


[21-Jun-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
if after all i have done, you dont have faith, then i strongly suggest to sell


[21-Jun-19 12:55 PM] Coin2stable#1872
in fact you can say f*** You I am not paying Sh

i have handled hundreds of millions of dollars worth

and guess what nobody can do anything, investors are the vulnerable ones not you and dont forget investors made you .


[21-Jun-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
i never forget the investors, i manage the funds for them


[21-Jun-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont disclose silly details that harms the results


[21-Jun-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
all is transparent on the blockchain


[21-Jun-19 12:57 PM] Coin2stable#1872
yes but what if you where forced to not honor  them


[21-Jun-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
how?


[21-Jun-19 12:58 PM] Coin2stable#1872
I am sure there are many ways , you are a single point of attack


[21-Jun-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
how many DEX do you own?


[21-Jun-19 12:59 PM] Coin2stable#1872
which is another problem


[21-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Coin2stable#1872
so you need to be safe


[21-Jun-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, DEX has many problems, but notice we are not promoting it at all. it just exists. we didnt do an ICO. it is just a legacy revshare


[21-Jun-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
how many DEX do you have?


[21-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Coin2stable#1872
why , not alot


[21-Jun-19 01:00 PM] Coin2stable#1872
hoping to get more in the future


[21-Jun-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
well you sure are giving me the third degree


[21-Jun-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
even if something happened to me, the worst is that whatever revshares pending are lost


[21-Jun-19 01:01 PM] Coin2stable#1872

however that sounds, I'm telling you my experience.

my point are valid and JL has been on point with his reply not getting  feelings but addressing my indignation


[21-Jun-19 01:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@phm87  you can place an order on Barterlly


[21-Jun-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
that was $20 mil that i had in my control, i think $19 million is returned now

the other $1 mil, is coming from my pocket


[21-Jun-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure how you can be indignant


[21-Jun-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
i didnt sell you the DEX, did i?


[21-Jun-19 01:08 PM] phm87#7395

I was OK reading til there was no insult

but regardless of how you obtained DEX, i will do my best to get the best revshares out


[21-Jun-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
likely only the BTC and KMD dexfees will be significant enough at first


[21-Jun-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i am sure chmex will setup the automated reporting

DEX is unlike any company in that it has no expenses, no overhead, doesnt exist other than as the coin and its revshare rights


[21-Jun-19 01:13 PM] Coin2stable#1872
that will help in transparency and trust

Jl is probably one of the biggest holder of DEX anyway, more revshare increases the underlying dex price.

@phm87   I am holding them to see what happens if it works , great if it doesn't I lose a little, I have no qualm in doing what I do , it gives me insight, I have a-lot more than 20 DEX but that is besides the point the amount it should not matter all investors have right they place  their hard earned money big or small , I will always respect all my investors large or small so I expect this


[21-Jun-19 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be nice if you gave me some respect


[21-Jun-19 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i do honor my commitments, and for DEX that is the revshare


[21-Jun-19 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
1 DEX or 100000 DEX, it is the same


[21-Jun-19 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
but even if you had 100000 DEX, i wont be changing my policy of not disclosing trades that are in the process. telegraphing your trades is not wise


[21-Jun-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
there wont be annual reports, fancy meetings, quaterly reports, tradeshows, offices, etc.


[21-Jun-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810

now really, my only task left is to just process the revshares for DEX


[21-Jun-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i am not even on the mm2 team, my mm1 provided the "spec" for them to perfect it with atomicDEX


[21-Jun-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so i feel i met my obligations and will just process whatever revshares accumulate

anything else will need to be done by others


[21-Jun-19 01:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
true, and since mm2 is total redesign and being built with different prorgramming stack, like Rust, and not C, James can actually give guidance and not code, since he's Simple C coder


[21-Jun-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810

[21-Jun-19 01:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
to me it's more exciting that the new mm2 team solved some good amount of core issues making it much more solid learning from the past experience from James


[21-Jun-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it will take time to ramp up usage, especially as it is all actual volumes and no fake volumes at all, the exchange volumes are very misleading

When I think about this from my non technical POV, I think an interesting part is "and no-one else can control the address". To me, this brings up the issue of where does the DAO run code. The only conceivable answer, is an account on a decentralized computer or something like that. So we're still a long way away.

How safe do you think the ledger is? Especially with regard to privacy? Do you think Ledger logs the addresses and can assign them to a user? Do you think, they save the IP addresses? 
I'm currently wondering how anonymous is Ledger? After all, the Hardware Wallet is ordered and paid for with KYC!


[23-Jun-19 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure if the hardware id is sent with the requests to their servers


[23-Jun-19 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
but all tx by ledger needs their servers to provide the rawtx to sign


[23-Jun-19 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
which means ip addresses can be logged and if they are keeping logs, and USSA demands they divulge it, likely to avoid being waterboarded, they will divulge what info they have


[23-Jun-19 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
thinking about this, it would not be surprising if ledger wasnt forced to log the hardware id, if they werent


[23-Jun-19 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
but i have no actual knowledge about this, just guessing that they can easily be forced to log all this and divulge all the details, in fact with the recent FATF they are likely forced to divulge all such data to chainanalysis


[23-Jun-19 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it is best to use a dedicated full node!

@jl777c would it ever be possible to think that High Frequency Trading will be possible over Decentralised Exchanges?


[23-Jun-19 10:07 AM] cipi#4502
i think it depends mainly on the blocktime of the involved coins... so BTC is out

not the millisecond trading, one minute would be the fastest possible and that is nowhere near fast enough to count as HFT

what are you thoughts on this 
miketout Yesterday at 5:18 PM
at first, we will be able to support Verus as the reserve currency. Eventually, I want to see it go hierarchical in Verus (reserve currencies launching reserves in their ecosystem) and to support external blockchains as well, which would mean Komodo's would be first, since they are our extended ecosystem and closest daemon to us. It will require non-trivial work to be able to do the same for Komodo currencies, but I believe that is possible sooner than any other blockchain system besides Verus. Most of the core concepts are there and the reserve system uses enhaned CCs, which would need to be ported,. The other thing is that all the pieces kind of fit together, and make the whole better with each part. For example, 50% PoS stake and non-equihash proof of power fits right into the model with merge mining support and staking of currency reserves being used to automatically purchase currencies and replenish notarization rewards without external payment. The new merge mining support and PoS security will require either VerusHash 2.0 or similar, or a double-sized block header, since the equihash space is re-purposed. It would be easiest if Komodo also had support for VerusHash 2.0, VerusPoP, but another approach could be just porting the enhanced CCs, adding the consensus changes, then integrating the merkle mountain range to improve/simplify Komodo's notarization and leverage Komodo notarization to create a reserve connector. Basically, there would be a fair bit of work and some consensus rule changes, but it can be done.

If I'm not wrong, we're trying to get more users in the network with new projects and this is working every time better. I imagine that there are more people developing i eth rn that looking to develop in kmd or another tech, so the best way to get traffic could be taking projects from eth as we tried some months ago

@jl777c here is some more info about the project :i would like to build on Komodo.I really think it can be of value for Komodo as it will show that projects can be build in a better way than,lets say eth. For my project i need a governance  platform.In order to govern members have to integrate their smart contract into the platform.The DAO will act in the physical world .The coin is the asset or represents a part of an asset in the physical world.Tangibles like land,water,food,rare earth minerals a.s.o.The smart contract should be the certificate of ownership the coin the representation of the asset.Through the platform the DAO members make proposals and vote on using the ownership mass to create wealth.Benefits from using the ownership mass in the physical world would be paid out 100% to the participants .The platform should include also a DEX where members can swap their benefits ,if they want to ,into other cryptocurrencies. The platform should also include the possibility of staking the coins at a yearly rate.Also it has to be able to offer lending at best rates for the members.To include some fun members should be able to play games.Komodo's documentation shows that all this can be done on a Komodo asset chain.We already have assets in place but in order to implement a first proposal we have to partially crowd fund.I would like to use the Komodo white label crowdfunding  dApp for this purpose.To be able to implement this we need the participation of dev's knowing their way around the Komodo Blockchain.For benefits of course.

it wont be hard to do the daemon side supporting rpc/p2p calls, the most of the work is the nSPV client software


[30-Jun-19 03:28 AM] jl777c#5810
it will only work with notarized chains

yes 100x to 10000x more efficient than normal SPV, after struggling to read https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/226.pdf


[30-Jun-19 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
i just came up with nSPV to solve the problem in a 100x simpler way

thanks for the warning...i just scrolled.

flyclient i am sure is a fantastic thing, but the deep math, and complex logic... i prefer something so simple a 2 minute blog post can explain it clearly


[30-Jun-19 04:03 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
@jl777c can you explain the implications this new solution offers? Both for kmd and for other coins? For a non tech person üòõ


[30-Jun-19 04:04 AM] jl777c#5810
SPV wallets allow lite wallets to only download header data (and a little bit more per utxo)


[30-Jun-19 04:04 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Lite clients are lighter now üòõ


[30-Jun-19 04:04 AM] jl777c#5810
but for a blockchain with a million blocks, that is a million headers (2GB)


[30-Jun-19 04:05 AM] jl777c#5810
which isnt so lite... non-equihash coins have 80 byte headers so the problem is really bad for equihash coins


[30-Jun-19 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
that means for a normal SPV wallet, you would need to sync 2GB+ of headers before you can validate the utxo, and each utxo needs merkleproofs on top


[30-Jun-19 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
with nSPV, on average each utxo needs 20kb of headers and the usual merkleproofs


[30-Jun-19 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
so a wallet with 10 utxo would need 200kb vs 2GB of headers


[30-Jun-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
10000x difference in bandwidth and it is so small, it doesnt even need to be stored locally


[30-Jun-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
also, the issue of attacks is dramatically mitigated as only a single honest node is needed and all dishonest nodes are immediately found out as the notarizations cant be forged


[30-Jun-19 04:09 AM] jl777c#5810
this is called superlight clients


[30-Jun-19 04:09 AM] jl777c#5810
it will basically achieve the same performance level of electrum servers, without any servers


[30-Jun-19 04:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so it solves the scalability issue quite completely

@jl777c How can this nSPV be made available on mobile clients? Right now there are 2 types of mobile lite clients:
- Electrum SPV based, which uses a user specified Electrum Servers
- Native SPV clients, like Mycelium or BreadWallet or Bitcoin Core wallets which directly connects to the p2p network of blockchain, as I understand,

So, what would be the way for making these nSPV clients available on mobiles? What kind of development needs there are in implementation?


[30-Jun-19 05:21 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also, do you think you can do something with this BreadWallet SPV C code to enhance it to adopt nSPV?

yes adding nSPV to breadwallet framework is a good way


[30-Jun-19 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810

it does solve the millions of users scaling problem


[30-Jun-19 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
just 1000 fullnodes would be needed to easily support 1 million nSPV clients


[30-Jun-19 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
and PIRATE already has more than that, KMD is almost there

@jl777c another question. Right now AtomicDEX uses Electrum based SPV clients in backend. I guess we can also upgrade it to use nSPV when it's available after enough testing and stabilisation? What you think how much of work that will be?


[30-Jun-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
my understanding is that the wallet functions are cleanly separated in atomicDEX, so once there is an SPV wallet, it is a matter to use it

not that specific hack, which was essentially a keylogger


[30-Jun-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
but having nearly native level security and api wallet performance that is fully decentralized and scalable...


[30-Jun-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
it is quite a nice improvement across the board


[30-Jun-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it also allows mm2 to scale to millions of users


[30-Jun-19 09:59 AM] actionslacks#4072
how many nodes would be necessary for mm2 to scale to that level?


[30-Jun-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it uses the p2p network of the coin


[30-Jun-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
at the 1000 node level, i estimate a million users can be supported


[30-Jun-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
roughly speaking


[30-Jun-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
and currently KMD has about that and PIRATE has more than that


[30-Jun-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
it would still work with less nodes, just slower

@jl777c nSPV... Following most of what was said so far... All dPoW notarized coins are thus far supposed to have 100% confidence in spends after a single notarization... So would the same not hold true for lite wallet transactions... Would the change to make nSPV real just be trimming the lite wallet to load only the last notarized blocking and be fully confident in spends?


[03-Jul-19 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810

Hi JL, what do you think about the coordicide solution from IOTA. If they manage to make that work, wouldnt that be the ideal decentralized and scalable DLT? Is KMD locked in on dPow or is KMD able to change the mechanism if a better solution comes around (can be coordicide or something else)?


[03-Jul-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
coordicide is a mechanism to remove the centralization of the tangle coordinator


[03-Jul-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD doesnt have a tangle, nor a centralized coordinator to remove

Is it possible to do an atomic swap between a coin like Doge and a Komodo smartchain based token ?


[05-Jul-19 06:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
No, tokens contain extra data that most coins s can't use. Or have not got


[05-Jul-19 06:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Deleted User   I remember you working on a feeless transaction mechanism, is that working?


[05-Jul-19 06:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
Don't recall that lol, so I guess not. U can just make zero fee txns ifnu like already... Or maybe use paymentscc so u can pay massive amounts of address but I think just making a huge tx would do much the same thing


[05-Jul-19 06:37 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Basically I want to use a coin as a receipt ,  receipts being indivisible is why I‚Äôm looking at feeless.  Original idea was to use a Komodo based token, but then lose interoperability .  using an Eth token  can maintain interoperability via atomic swaps and maintain indivisibility but run into problem of 3rd party fee . Using a Komodo assetchain coin itself has the issue with divisibility


[05-Jul-19 06:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sounds like tokens are what u want but I hate our implementation of them as they stand tbh, there already exists a poc in started that refactors it to work much better but dimxy wrote it and I'm hesitant to change it the amount it requires for fear of breaking it. 


Even with the new way, the tokens information is stored in a place that basically no chains apart from kmd forks possess. So sending it to another chain would be quite a mission.


[05-Jul-19 07:37 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Deleted User  don‚Äôt need to send the token to another chain just need it to be able to swappable with atomicdex.  A regular assetchain could work  with fees and decimals removed but not sure how that would work with atomicdex because of the dexfee.  I guess if the coin was ‚Äúmaker only‚Äù.  It could work , Not sure if that is possible though.


[05-Jul-19 07:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
not sure what you mean, you cant atomic swap a token if it cant get to the other chain üòï


[05-Jul-19 08:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I‚Äôm probably not explaining it right,  trying to say we need something like how we do atomic swaps with Eth Erc20 tokens but with Komodo tokens instead


[05-Jul-19 08:04 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I can swap between digibyte and augur currently but can‚Äôt swap between digibyte and a TokenCC created token.


[05-Jul-19 08:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Which is a bit ironic


[05-Jul-19 08:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I mean tokenCC was t around when erc20 swaps started so it makes sense but it‚Äôs odd nonetheless ,  as Eth is typically seen as our number 1 competitor by outsiders


[05-Jul-19 08:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
hmm I think I get it now, so you just want to transafer the token to another pubkey but in exchange for another coin? 
This should be possible without much effort, but I really think we should re do tokens before adding amy more complexity to them.


[05-Jul-19 08:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
I have been working on a new CC that uses all the new stuff, that allows tokens to work without spagetti code and bruteforceing things, and sent this to dimxy. Hopefully he can understand my example and we can work on the new token format in comming months.


[05-Jul-19 08:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
The problem with them is that most of the existing tokens cannot use the new format because simply they are too big and will not fit. So we need to design it in a way that still allows all that to work. I got pretty close a while ago, but abbandoned my work about 40H in because it was just changing too much stuff before the hard fork.


[05-Jul-19 08:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm looking to do.   I have in mind using these tokens to represent warehouse receipts used to claim stored goods, specifically standardized commodities but it can and will be expanded to other goods as well.  If these tokens can be atomic swapped with coins like I described above ,  this can effectively solve liquidity issue with Atomicdex, as well as other benefits , in the form many additional chains added to the ecosystem to accommodate other interests ( a different chain with its own tokens for each country or city or warehouse location for instance ) .  Beyond stablecoins(warehouse receipts ),  many chains ( fees to Komodo ),  liquidity ( more things for KMD to trade against )  it provides the ecosystem with a form of ‚Äúgood‚Äù money ( Gresham law reference )  which can siphon from even other coins and their liquidity

I‚Äôd rather have our own bitcoin token and other proxies


[05-Jul-19 08:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
Sounds like it would be useful. 
Basically what I came up with for tokens was to create the token, this can use a normal OP_RETURN which will stay as an unspent output that can be referanced by all tokens with this tokenid, so the tokens themself dont need to carry the data, obviously you cant send this data to another chain easily, MoMoM has some functionality for this, but not 100% sure its perfect to actualyl be used, I simply disabled the entire thing on LABS at least for now.


[05-Jul-19 08:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
However, for a token on a chain beifn able to be sold and brought by people, you can send only a token ccvout with the needed data to referance the OP_RETURN containing the relevent data.. This makes the tokens very small and also very easy to validate.


[05-Jul-19 08:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Being able to atmic sway these tokens seems trivial becuase they are just a vout, although being a ccvout liekty komodod will need some new RPC calls or something to allow marketmaker to transfer them, as marketmaker cannot construct cc txns.


[05-Jul-19 08:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
This sounds like what I need, and the ecosystem at large as well,  ex. Atomic swaps of tokens will be used quite heavily in our blockchain gaming sector.  Rogue player data for coins for instance .


[05-Jul-19 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
They kind of work like this already, but its convoluted and a bit inefficant because we didnt know how to properly use CCs for the longest time. 
I hope I have figured that out and created an example that is simple enough to follow here:
`https://github.com/KMDLabs/komodo/blob/lotto/src/cc/customcc.cpp`


[05-Jul-19 08:50 PM] TonyL#3577
but CC tokens have native dex via RPC calls only


[05-Jul-19 08:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
only now they do.


[05-Jul-19 08:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
Once we have token format standardised so that they are only 1 vout per token and not an entire tx with an op_return. Thing will be very easy.


[05-Jul-19 08:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
if you look at that cuistomcc.cpp/h you will see the entire validation does not even lookup any tx from disk. Everything runs out of addressindex, so its basically isntant reponse even with hundreds of thousands of utxos, at least that is the plan. I hope we can do some ridiulous testing of this, on LABS soon. Like sending 2 million bets to a single lotto game and seeing what happens

Hey @jl777c I am reading your article <https://komodoplatform.com/dpow-demystified/> ... what this second time means here? 

```Each blockchain‚Äôs network still comes to agreement on which transactions and blocks are valid. The whole network then comes to agreement a second time to determine which blocks will be notarized onto the KMD and BTC blockchains. Unless the blockchain is in sync across the network, the protocol that the NN run won‚Äôt reach consensus.```


[08-Jul-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
the blockchain has its normal consensus rules to agree on which blocks are the mainchain, right?


[08-Jul-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the first time


[08-Jul-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
the second time is when the notary network nodes come to consensus on what they are seeing as the mainchain (time delayed)


[08-Jul-19 09:13 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
This happens for each chain using dPoW.. like if there are 10 asset chains and 6 out side chains are using dPoW.. then NN have to come into consensus for each and everyone?


[08-Jul-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[08-Jul-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
for every notarization


[08-Jul-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it is crucial that the normal consensus is allowed to happen and that the notaries get consensus among themselves, if not, it indicates there is some sort of chain split happening, and so the lack of notarizations indicates a possible problem


[08-Jul-19 09:17 AM] Malti#3948

if 10 blockchains are using dPoW .. will there be 10 different notarization transaction or only a single


[08-Jul-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
each chain is notarized independently


[08-Jul-19 09:21 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
ok.. so If there are 1000 chains using komodo,.,,, Komodo will be taking almost all the bitcoin transaction space?


[08-Jul-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[08-Jul-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
only one KMD -> BTC notarization per cycle


[08-Jul-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless of how many AC -> KMD notarizations there are


[08-Jul-19 09:23 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
so AC notarization  data is on KMD and KMD notarization on BTC....correct?


[08-Jul-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[08-Jul-19 09:27 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
AC get notarized on Komodo chain in every 10 minutes and KMD also get notarized in every 10 minutes on Bitcoin blockchain?


[08-Jul-19 09:27 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
or there is time difference


[08-Jul-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not synchronized at blocktimes are not


[08-Jul-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
that is an estimate of how often they happen


[08-Jul-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
just look at https://komodod.com/dpow/chart


[08-Jul-19 09:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
KMD > BTC is always going to be as it has always been. the same standard time notarisations every 10 minutes. no matter how many asset chains or 3rd party blockchains notarise to KMD.
any asset chain or 3rd party coin only notarise to KMD only, and not directly to BTC.


[08-Jul-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
there are other dPoW stats sites too


[08-Jul-19 09:29 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
also,  for each AC notarization, there are 2 multisig transactions, 1 on the AC itself, example <https://rfox.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/d515e8e61dafc88a08131f122c343140dd8cd35c363f63f014f09a59c092bf0f> & 1 on Komodo <https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/4c7a13e29484cc3ead95c5de8b6611a0d2d9cfda6c5ea0b7d0c95147576a4240>


[08-Jul-19 09:30 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess @coinmonks || CoinCodeCap confusion is if somehow adding more Assetchains and 3rd party chains to notarisation process increases the transactions or the size of notarisation data going from KMD to BTC. That's not the case.


[08-Jul-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
single blockhash validates all tx in that block (and all prior blocks)


[08-Jul-19 09:32 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
ok...


[08-Jul-19 09:40 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
```Notarization process works in two-fold, in every 10 minutes (based on block interval, not temporal), notarized nodes take a snapshot of every smartchains and other 3rd party chains using komodo's dPoW and notarize it on Komodo blockchain. And then these notarized nodes take a snapshot of Komodo blockchain and notarize it on Bitcoin blockchain.```


[08-Jul-19 09:40 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
is this correct?


[08-Jul-19 09:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it is close enough


[08-Jul-19 09:40 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
whast missing or wrong


[08-Jul-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the notarization process is free running


[08-Jul-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
there isnt any overall 2 two-fold process


[08-Jul-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
it just ends up that way due to the way the blockchains work


[08-Jul-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
all tx in a block, encode in its blockhash


[08-Jul-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
notarization tx are tx, so they are too


[08-Jul-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so there are notarization process for all the notarized chains


[08-Jul-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
including KMD->BTC


[08-Jul-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
each notarization happens about every 10 minutes, but there is no strict guarantee, also blocktimes for blockchains can vary a lot


[08-Jul-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not a clockwork synchronized process between all the notarizations


[08-Jul-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
each notarization is INDEPENDENT


[08-Jul-19 09:43 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
ok cool


[08-Jul-19 09:53 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Komodo has Nakamoto consensus correct?


[08-Jul-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
as its primary consensus, yes


[08-Jul-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
however it is modified two ways


[08-Jul-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
notary nodes get to mine at easy diff (CPU) once per 65 blocks


[08-Jul-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
and it uses longest notarized chain logic, instead of just the longest chain logic


[08-Jul-19 10:01 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
cool


[08-Jul-19 10:03 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
so for un-notarised blocks (part of chain which still needs to be notarized ) it still uses longest chain rule?


[08-Jul-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that allows the normal consensus to determine the blocks


[08-Jul-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
the notarization is not making changes to the normal consensus process. it just wants to observe and notarize


[08-Jul-19 10:50 AM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
BTW this itself is an awesome value proposition, which should to market as different product itself ..may building more offering in future around 3rd party blockchain security

Ok..let me paint a different picture of Komodo vision 

Komodo is now focusing on attracting users to build blockchain on top of Komodo blockchain.. This value proposition needs lot of resource and community development..
Ethereum is already way ahead in Dapp market and Cosmos and polkadot's offering is better in terms of "build your own blockchain" in comparison to Komodo (Don't want to offend anyone,  this is my research) 

So let's forget about Dapp market.. and think of "Build your own blockchain" usecase.. Both cosmos and Polkadot are building frameworks so others can build a blockchain using their framework but real business model is "security as a service" even for Polkadot and cosmos.. Cosmos hub plans to provide security as a service in the future and for polkadot you need to deposit dots to secure a parachain (blockchain build on polkadot).. Both these protocols deploy some version of PoS.

Now Let's talk about Komodo.. Komodo can champion "Security as a service" for PoW blockchains ...or even further this development and become a general purpose  with decentralise  "security-as-a-service" usecase. Now comes the cream,. Go with this same value position to enterprise which are using hyperledger or any other consortium blockchain (may be extra privacy feature)..   

I think this is a better and niche usecase, and also good for KMD token economics.


[09-Jul-19 01:51 PM] allbits#5898
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap have you ever built your own blockchain?


[09-Jul-19 01:55 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Yes I tried on komodo as well as cosmos


[09-Jul-19 02:21 PM] kostak11#7773
hey @jl777c . Does the exchange need any type of licenses to operate?


[09-Jul-19 02:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap you have not tried chainlizard üòõ


[09-Jul-19 02:33 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Just wait for that


[09-Jul-19 02:37 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
this is similar to "create your own token" GUI


[09-Jul-19 02:40 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I think in the case of blockchain .."less to good" principal works.. People need to do real work in terms of building tech on blockchain.. what will 'X' do after launching the blockchain?  There were tons of ICO raised funds and did nothing.. with your own blockchain you need to do lot of work.. + I believe there are not many use cases out there..


[09-Jul-19 02:41 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Simple question - Does is make sense "Everyone building a blockchain"?


[09-Jul-19 02:42 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
It never made sense when everyone wanted a .com ... it never made sense when everyone wanted a mobile app... it never made sense when every one wanted a coin ...and it will not make sense when every will want to build a blockchain


[09-Jul-19 02:48 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The first step is to draw them in, do you think any of the ERC20 tokens would run their own infrastructure? This is a way to get them to migrate over. This will also drum up marketing and hopefully showcase our tech to the industry.


[09-Jul-19 02:49 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Once they are on, who will not pay a few hundred a year for dPoW? This goes to your security as a service


[09-Jul-19 02:51 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Rather going this way and building komodo's own infra..why not direct build on "security as a service" infra.. why you need people to build blockchain on top of komodo..to provide security as a service?


[09-Jul-19 02:51 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Then once they are on board with dPoW, they will use the DEX and many other services within the Komodo ecosystem


[09-Jul-19 02:52 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I am a "security-as-a-service" minimalist in this argument


[09-Jul-19 02:52 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I do not understand, when people launch a chain, they launch nodes all via a GUI. If they want dPoW they pay for it. The chain is a asset chain not on top of Komodo


[09-Jul-19 02:53 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Why they do this? when Ethereum ICO can be done without paying anything


[09-Jul-19 02:54 PM] hyperDEX#6586
ERC20s are a token beholden to its master and the taxes (gas fees) they charge. They also do not have bitcoin level security


[09-Jul-19 02:55 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I think you need to look into the value proposition that Komodo asset chains offer first.


[09-Jul-19 02:55 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I think Ethereum has enough security on main chain


[09-Jul-19 02:55 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Then we can have this discussion


[09-Jul-19 02:56 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Believe me, I went through all over komodo's doc


[09-Jul-19 02:56 PM] hyperDEX#6586
How do you get around the tax they charge for being on top of ETH? Tomorrow they can make each tx cost $10, who would use it at that point


[09-Jul-19 02:56 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
We are missing a point here.. EOS has better transaction rate... what about that?


[09-Jul-19 02:56 PM] hyperDEX#6586
What if ETH shuts down tomorrow


[09-Jul-19 02:57 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
üòÑ


[09-Jul-19 02:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
EOS has better transaction rate because everything you do is a tx


[09-Jul-19 02:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Same tax applies there too, but add on top computational ram BS too


[09-Jul-19 02:57 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
wait ..lets not divert from the discussion


[09-Jul-19 02:57 PM] hyperDEX#6586
These are the things you are missing which is critical to the value Komodo adds


[09-Jul-19 02:59 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
My point is rather going through -> build blockchain on komodo -> use dPoW (security as a service) ...why not directly focus on security as a service


[09-Jul-19 02:59 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We have a few 3rd party chains that use dPoW.


[09-Jul-19 02:59 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So launch chain then dpow is a option, not the only option


[09-Jul-19 02:59 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Yes.. lets grow them and focus on that


[09-Jul-19 03:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
It is a chicken and egg problem


[09-Jul-19 03:00 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
get 3rd party chain on Komodo to use dPoW


[09-Jul-19 03:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
You need people to know about what KMD offers before they would want dpow


[09-Jul-19 03:00 PM] hyperDEX#6586
For that to happen, you need users that tell their coin communities about dpow and komodo


[09-Jul-19 03:01 PM] hyperDEX#6586
For that to happen we need  this mythical thing called marketing


[09-Jul-19 03:01 PM] hyperDEX#6586
For that to happen you need something to market


[09-Jul-19 03:01 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
no.. i don't think so.. this way your target  get niche and you just need to reach project..who already understand  blockchain tech and might face the security problem


[09-Jul-19 03:01 PM] hyperDEX#6586
For that to happen, we need to build things that will get reported on and is useful and showcases our tech


[09-Jul-19 03:02 PM] hyperDEX#6586
I think we need to agree to disagree.


[09-Jul-19 03:02 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The more you refine what you do, the more you dig yourself into a hole. It is better to offer many different things to many people than to offer a single thing to a small amount of people.


[09-Jul-19 03:03 PM] hyperDEX#6586
We need to capture users, who will then capture more and more who will then bring in leads to partnerships and other things.

You can launch your own blockchain (independant of KMD blockchain) easily and using komodo binary (then you use the consensus algo and all features developed by jl777 and KMD community). You can decide POW, POS or both, txfee and which special rules (cc). Any dev can easily launch his blockchain to test features.
dPoW is a paid service to have bitcoin security level using a network of 64 Notary Nodes
Among the many features, there is a DEX (MM2) that is open under beta testing.
Komodo coin itself is the central currency of the ecosystem


[09-Jul-19 03:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes i agree, but the market for dpow is very small now, why focus on something that has a tiny market vs something with a big and wide market?


[09-Jul-19 03:05 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
"market for dpow is very small now" let's rethink this


[09-Jul-19 03:05 PM] phm87#7395
the "do one thing and do it better" is the huge experience of jl777 and his team allowing them to develop and test rapidly. Opensource mindset helps


[09-Jul-19 03:05 PM] hyperDEX#6586
Now is the key word, dpow is not going away


[09-Jul-19 03:06 PM] hyperDEX#6586
So whilst the focus is to get users and people using Komodo tech, who says we cannot cater to the crowd that wants security as a service


[09-Jul-19 03:07 PM] phm87#7395
many coins were 51% (ETC also for 400 blocks) ... here is a website with potential victims : https://www.crypto51.app/ (ARRR should not be on this website because it is dpowed)


[09-Jul-19 03:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
One other thing to remember, is that when coins are in trouble, they will approach the team. This is not something you plan ahead for most of the times....


[09-Jul-19 03:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But for them to approach the team they need to know about them


[09-Jul-19 03:07 PM] hyperDEX#6586
and the best way to do that is via the users telling them


[09-Jul-19 03:08 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
let's assume dPoW support all type of blockchain.. doesn't matter what consensus mechanism ... if it's public or private... 

Now tell me how big is the market?


[09-Jul-19 03:09 PM] actionslacks#4072
how big was the market 3 years ago? this is a marathon


[09-Jul-19 03:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586
How many coins are willing to say they cannot prevent 51% attacks? It is a pride issue as well.


[09-Jul-19 03:09 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
"How many coins are willing to say they cannot prevent 51% attacks? It is a pride issue as well." ,,, this is assumption


[09-Jul-19 03:09 PM] hyperDEX#6586

[09-Jul-19 03:12 PM] hyperDEX#6586
There is the fee for service prived by chainmakers etc, but there is also a dPoW fee


[09-Jul-19 03:12 PM] phm87#7395
if a coin community runs their own Notary Nodes network, they can secure themselves and do not pay anything for notarization (outside of their own servers costs and nota costs)

How would they dPoW?


[09-Jul-19 03:12 PM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
there is a 10000 sat / vin / notarization , so it will never be free ...


[09-Jul-19 03:13 PM] SHossain#0007
it is not easy to run dPoW servers, let alone decentralized


[09-Jul-19 03:13 PM] phm87#7395
@PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator that's why I wrote ``nota costs`` at the end


[09-Jul-19 03:14 PM] SHossain#0007

if Ethereum (of Vitalik) wants dpow, I think that they can elect 64 NN for ETH NN network


[09-Jul-19 03:14 PM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
so it's not free right lol ?


[09-Jul-19 03:14 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
Simple question -- I am IBM, I need to secure my hyperledger blockchain..also need KMD support ..how much it will cost (average)?  and how break down will looks like


[09-Jul-19 03:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
300-500


[09-Jul-19 03:14 PM] hyperDEX#6586
kmd


[09-Jul-19 03:15 PM] SHossain#0007
it will be 365 KMD + 365 HyperLedger and service fee which would be few thousand USD


[09-Jul-19 03:15 PM] SHossain#0007
and any integration cost
and, maybe a codebase security audit if the sourcecode is completely new and not based on bitcoin or zcash


[09-Jul-19 03:15 PM] hyperDEX#6586
The support would be free because it is a win win to onboard them


[09-Jul-19 03:16 PM] phm87#7395
@PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator  if the coin community wants one nota per 1000 blocks or one nota per block, the cost can change (actual cost spent in tx fees). Notary Nodes won't be happy to handle 300 chains (I asked ^^)


[09-Jul-19 03:17 PM] phm87#7395
so solution is other notarization networks


[09-Jul-19 03:17 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
ok so support fee is goes to Komodo team..cool..it will help in development or in future .. independent businesses can provide that.. But In terms of tokenomics it sucks... How KMD will acquire value with such a low fee


[09-Jul-19 03:17 PM] SHossain#0007
if there are over 300 chains, Notary Node ops has to rent another server


[09-Jul-19 03:19 PM] hyperDEX#6586
@coinmonks this is a long term plan. The ecosystem is being built up for people to use our tech, not to tax them.

Overtime a tiny % on huge flow is better than a big fee on small flow.

[09-Jul-19 03:22 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
We can play some sort of game theory here...less chain --- higher fee (may be token burning) .... more chains --> fee go less.... I am not fully sure here ,,,but we can think how we can capture value in KMD token...not in tech


[09-Jul-19 03:22 PM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
@phm87  `if the coin community wants one nota per 1000 blocks or one nota per block, the cost can change` the closer to "free" you are, the less secure it is, I think 1 nota per 1000 blocks is as good as not having dpow at all ..

I wii dig more info about dPoW ,,, will see I can propose something in terms of capturing value on KMD


[09-Jul-19 03:24 PM] SHossain#0007
the approach we have taken is incremental service fee. whoever comes first will have to pay less service fee than the next. this will increase adoption. starting with higher price doesn't make this appealing to projects. and, there are lot of projects that can't pay higher fee


[09-Jul-19 03:24 PM] SHossain#0007
so, get in first pay less. the price per year would be grandfathered


[09-Jul-19 03:24 PM] phm87#7395
KMDLabs launch another notarization network that notarize other assetchains on KMD. I think that this kind of experiment is the future of dPoW


[09-Jul-19 03:25 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
service fee doesn't capture value in KMD token.. I am concern about it ..the whole purpose of this ecosystem/tech  is to capture value in KMD token


[09-Jul-19 03:26 PM] SHossain#0007
projects have to pay 365 KMD per year. they have to buy it from market


[09-Jul-19 03:26 PM] phm87#7395
@PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator  several assetchains and coins notarized have a lower blocktime than KMD so if you replace 1000 in my sentence that you quoted with the number of blocks between 2 notas. Anyway, that's another discussion


[09-Jul-19 03:26 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
what happens to these 365 KMDs ?


[09-Jul-19 03:26 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
they goes to notary nodes?


[09-Jul-19 03:27 PM] SHossain#0007
notary nodes mine KMD at easy diff


[09-Jul-19 03:27 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
those 365 KMDs ...can we burn them?


[09-Jul-19 03:27 PM] SHossain#0007
they mine 1500 to 2000 KMD a month


[09-Jul-19 03:28 PM] SHossain#0007
why would you burn those 365 KMD? they will be used for development.
SuperNET pays for BTC notarizations. they dont' have infinite supply of BTC but enough to cover at least next 10 years worth of notarization. those KMD will help buy more BTC in the future


[09-Jul-19 03:29 PM] SHossain#0007
up until now, BTC notarization is covered for next 10 years. those BTC were raised from the ICO


[09-Jul-19 03:31 PM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
@phm87 my point was to prove that notarization can't be free ...


[09-Jul-19 03:31 PM] phm87#7395
if you do the calculation, I think that SuperNET pays a lot from its BTC fund when BTC mempool is full and BTC tx fee is high. I don't think that the 365 KMDs covers this : SuperNET is using its fund to cover its experiment.


[09-Jul-19 03:32 PM] phm87#7395
@PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator I agree  about the cost that is not nul but it is not necessary to pay sth to KMD team if you do everything yourself (KMDLabs copypaste)


[09-Jul-19 03:32 PM] phm87#7395
but you need skills that only few have (and all I know are within KMD team)


[09-Jul-19 03:33 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
I will read more and come back .. Then this discussion will be more informative.. But everyone should always think in terms of how KMD token will capture value ....nothing else

[09-Jul-19 03:34 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
capturing value in token is the whole purpose ..look at BTC


[09-Jul-19 03:35 PM] allbits#5898

[09-Jul-19 03:35 PM] SHossain#0007

[09-Jul-19 03:37 PM] allbits#5898
We don't care about taxing users to capture value


[09-Jul-19 03:37 PM] SHossain#0007

[09-Jul-19 03:42 PM] coinmonks || CoinCodeCap#8469
See .. don't think it's tax .. think how we can design a system which can sustain for hundreds of years.. In the start BTC can be mined on the a normal computer.. if you look back you will think that was the free money... but it wasn't ..early adopters didn't even know this will worth in the future on not?

My point was dPoW is spot on usecase ..and komodo already validated it by providing it to more than 3 projects.. we should focus on this value proposition.,,,
and design komodo's tokenomics in a way that protocol capture value in KMD

@coinmonks || CoinCodeCap Regarding burning coins: 1) Komodo is not a company, no obligation for user gains,  in fact that‚Äôs more of a liability because that is an expectation of profit from the issuer and others which is one of the ways we have avoided being classified as a security .  There is a mechanism in play that accomplishes the same goals, lack of reward claiming , with only about 50% claiming their rewards about 12k coins per day never come into existence. Re: 3rd party chains as a focus.    Having experience with soliciting coins for the service,  most aren‚Äôt financially or technically in the position to receive it .  Especially if it requires a code audit.  Then there is the chains it would require extensive work to DPoW such as ethereum forks.  Which due to limited number of them it‚Äôs not worth devoting efforts to this time.  Most DPoW demand will come from Kmd created chains as it doesn‚Äôt require a code audit which costs tens of thousands and takes away from manpower.   I‚Äôm not worried about amount of chains joining the ecosystem.  It‚Äôs not hard to specialize a purpose into a chain.


[09-Jul-19 07:12 PM] Mylo#8306
We haven‚Äôt started 3rd party notarizing tools, documents, transactions.  Think about 1000 companies notarizing their own docs in dealings with others.  Even if they have a notary network of their own of 6 nodes requiring 2 signatures.  That is 6000 nodes requiring kmd to notarize to kmd.

7000 kmd will get 20 years of notarizations.
7000 x 1000 x 6 = 13 million.

That is 10% of current supply, 6.5% of total supply only for notarizing 3rd party documents.

This is ONE application of antara modules that enables logic and data to work in the transactional system.

[11-Jul-19 01:05 PM] Regnar#6164
Hey @jl777c,  multi part question: can channels be used for atomic swaps, instead of waiting for confirmations the swap is completed as soon as it enters mempool?
And follow up if that's possible, any thoughts on using a mix of Gateway and Channels CC to make instant, cross chain atomic swaps for a DEX feature? Lock coins with Gateway and atomic swap the tokens?


[11-Jul-19 01:19 PM] phm87#7395
@Regnar when a tx enters mempool, before it is mined, it can be invalidated by another tx with higher fee that spends the same inputs. I don't know for your other questions, let's wait for jl777 reply


[11-Jul-19 02:38 PM] Regnar#6164
@phm87  Thanks for the reply, I understand that but assuming it's a risk you're willing to take in this circumstance (though I think double spend attempts would be frequent for atomic swaps) going off of these docs <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/customconsensus/channels.html> there is a method for these 'instant' before mined transactions. Just didn't know if they could be used as a method of giving AtomicDEX instant swaps of any cryptocurrency. Maybe eventually like the 0conf of BarterDEX in some way


[11-Jul-19 02:47 PM] phm87#7395
@Regnar they talk about replace-by-fee transaction here : http://diyhpl.us/wiki/transcripts/breaking-bitcoin/2019/mempool-analysis-simulation/ and the fun fact about antpool can also be inverted : you can mine your own block as I suggest to double spend it (and avoid to broadcast the unconfirmed tx before mining it). Whatever it is malicious behavior, I prefer to avoid any thrust in crypto


[11-Jul-19 04:19 PM] Regnar#6164
@phm87  Yea that was my initial thought but I found the chapter I was originally thinking of <https://docs.komodoplatform.com/cc-jl/chapter10.html> This goes much more into detail about the channels CC and preventing double spending meme pool transactions.


[11-Jul-19 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
channels would work for this, but the problem is that you need to establish channels between the two pubkeys that want to do a swap, unless we have an LN type of routing, but that is a mess


[11-Jul-19 06:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i think with completion rates of atomicDEX being high enough, most swaps can be though of as "done" when it gets started, so a GUI displaying it with a clock as it completes its steps should work

Notarizations on kmd (kmdlabs) are pretty cheap, I don't have any stats but based on my tests, I guess it should be few kmd per year.
Did you take into account risk ? Risk for a pow NN is low while pos needs to use huge amounts involving risk


[12-Jul-19 09:49 AM] phm87#7395
If price is dumped, a risk exists: if too many pos NN dumps their coins, your nota network will be down


[12-Jul-19 09:52 AM] phm87#7395
BUT if you hardcode pubkey of elected pos NN and you cap the staked amount per NN, risk can be low


[12-Jul-19 09:52 AM] phm87#7395
But it would require developement

notarizing to KMD is open to anyone to create any notarization scheme that fits their project/use-case./ecosystem/consortium/etc.   some schemes will be centralized, some decentralized.

Well that's my opinion, I'll ask him discord.

 How he imagines the growth of KMD when it works completely independently.

 What advantage does it bring for KMD to create a sidechain for a project.  Do not understand the approach.

 Always thought that there are more sidechains in a project that has a positive effect on the main chain in volume and transactions.  But apparently it does not seem so what I read, which if a sidechain completely independent of KMD does not work KMD synonymous.  Unless I now do not understand the approach as it is intended


[12-Jul-19 02:33 PM] Helly88#3715
Hope someone can explain how this will positively impact KMD when sidechains emerge that are completely independent of KMD.

The example at the eth is not bad more projects are more volume and transaction found in the mainchain


[12-Jul-19 02:34 PM] Helly88#3715
I want to know what the added value is for me as an investor when I hold KMD and make the technology available free of charge to a sidechain. 

It is only because of the staking that it is not worth keeping KMD in my eyes.

hi Helly88, James wrote an article on this question <https://medium.com/@jameslee777/tokenomics-are-for-tokens-not-for-coins-3f262d0aa4b3>


[12-Jul-19 03:16 PM] Helly88#3715
This is a completely new view. 
Normally it should attract many new projects. Another problem will be that many shitcoins will automatically be interested in it. I hope the plan works. It would take another year like the end of 2017 where new projects come every day. 

The view that many projects are worth creating for the main chain I haven't heard yet but it makes sense somewhere. 

I can only hope that you the marketing really strongly boosts after the 15.07. 
People and big companies need to know how easy it is to create something on KMD. If big companies should be interested in it it will surely be good for KMD to be switched on.

[12-Jul-19 03:16 PM] allbits#5898
@Helly88 you may be in the wrong coin then.  KMD is designed to work for developers and users, not short term speculators. The ETH approach that you mention creates a situation that is impractical for actual use in my experience.  I much prefer the independent chains approach that KMD uses.


[12-Jul-19 03:19 PM] Helly88#3715
@allbits That's a matter of opinion. 
I think the ETH view is good. You make a technology available and that gives you a little volume and transactions. 
I think the system as ETH has it is ideal, everyone is willing to pay something when the technology fits.

ETH is not in 2nd place for nothing!


[12-Jul-19 03:19 PM] Helly88#3715
I'm not just invested in KMD.


[12-Jul-19 03:23 PM] allbits#5898
ETH ideal? You're not gong to get much agreement on that around here. I've just come off two days straight of testing out the app universe in ETH. Transaction costs and delays render almost everything impractical. It is a system that does not currently work for actual use. Maybe they'll fix it. But KMD is using another design - and it's independent chains. You won't be able to convince anyone to change that design no matter how hard you try.


[12-Jul-19 03:25 PM] Helly88#3715
ETH doesn't sleep. The updates ETH will bring will change a lot. Blockages on the main chain will no longer happen. 

Don't forget that ETH is not in 2nd place for nothing.


[12-Jul-19 03:26 PM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
because it has the "2nd mover" advantage ?


[12-Jul-19 03:27 PM] Helly88#3715
I don't want to convince anyone to change anything I just wanted to understand how KMD rises in value when sidechains come in.


[12-Jul-19 03:28 PM] Helly88#3715
The approach the more projects come the more the price will rise doesn't sound bad. Hope that this plan works out


[12-Jul-19 03:28 PM] allbits#5898
Maybe it doesn't rise in value, but we'll have a platform that developers and users love, like Linux. That's what this community is about.

[12-Jul-19 03:30 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Sidechains in the proper sense,  add value through additional functionality,  independent chains add value through DPoW , MoMoM, and Dex liquidity


[12-Jul-19 03:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Example : DiceCC sidechain ,  statistically provided it is used it will pull coins out of circulation


[12-Jul-19 03:35 PM] Helly88#3715
We'll see about ETH. I am of the opinion that everyone who is in crypto should keep BTC and ETH is my opinion. 
ETH has very smart people on board who will be able to do that, I think.


[12-Jul-19 03:35 PM] yorklab#7270
@Helly88 
1.  Build a superior platform
2. Make the cost really cheap to launch a project
3. Make the cost really cheap to use
4. Now you have a thousand companies that need dPOW. Someone earlier had already explained that  a thousand companies using just one aspect of Antara will need to buy well over 1,000,000 KMD.
5. The larger companies will need lots of chains which mean they will need more KMD than the  smaller ones. REDFOX LABS is building unicorn (Large)  companies using Komodo and all those companies will be using dPOW.
6. Many of these companies will incentivize Komodo/KMD in some way. For instance: REDFOX Labs is giving Komodo 10% of their profit for development. Zaddex exchange has KMD as one of the main base trading pairs.
7. All DEX fees will be used to buy KMD.
8. 10% discount when using KMD on AtomicDEX
9. Some of these projects may monotonize KMD; like using KMD to purchase things from a store.

Any corrections/additions are welcome.

Question about the DEX, two nodes negotiate locktime of a trade, and the length of timelocks. This can be adjusted  based on chains, can this be further extended to provide greater 51% attack protection on trades? For example, set time to have specific number of confirmations for particularly large trades so that you can ensure the lower hash chain has less likelihood of being reversed?


[16-Jul-19 08:29 AM] Regnar#6164
Given the value of the trade vs the 51% attack cost of a chain, could it be possible to make a large swap, move funds again and attack the original deposit? And would extending this time window be an effective defense for that?


[16-Jul-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810

[16-Jul-19 01:44 PM] Regnar#6164
Yea I was thinking if a GUI maker/company wanted to build their DEX on this engine and wanted to include a way to protect from 51% attacks on bigger trades they could theoretically increase the locktime amount.


[16-Jul-19 01:45 PM] Regnar#6164
Assuming both chains didn't have dpow. The swaps would have to wait for longer, deeper blocks, before being completed

In the US, you can claim capital losses on crypto. You're just limited to offsetting your capital gains or if you have done that/have no gains, then $3000 with a carry-forward into future tax years. It got real messy for filers when they booked profits in the December 2017 run up just to roll  back into btc or alts and then subsequently booked losses in 2018/2019.

[19-Jul-19 04:25 AM] criptobear#6402
I was reading the dilithium page but isn't it about new assets? Can be implemented in KMD wallet?@jl777c


[19-Jul-19 04:26 AM] jl777c#5810
to implement it into KMD would require non-consensus changing wallet usage similar to dilithium, so possible certainly


[20-Jul-19 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
seems possible

@jl777c what is your take on quantum computers? Specially what kind of cryptography do you think can protect DLT from this threat?                    The day where true quantum computer are in the wild seem closer and closer.


[20-Jul-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
dilithium is a QC resistant signature method and we already have an antara module for it


[20-Jul-19 04:15 AM] Small Fish#5687
I didn‚Äôt know dilithium that‚Äôs interesting. but in case of quantum computers Komodo‚Äôs notarization on bitcoin chain would be then useless ?


[20-Jul-19 04:16 AM] hyperDEX#6586
so would world banks lol


[20-Jul-19 04:18 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
I recommend you to read this article first, to understand what kind of threats QC could cause to Bitcoin <https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Quantum_computing_and_Bitcoin>


[20-Jul-19 04:21 AM] jl777c#5810
actually the notarization would be fine as its existence is its proof. granted the QC could be spending the fees, but likely they would go after much bigger addresses first


[20-Jul-19 04:29 AM] Small Fish#5687
Ok i see so we are pretty safe üòÉ


[20-Jul-19 04:29 AM] Small Fish#5687
Thank!


[20-Jul-19 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
by the time the big BTC addresses are being QC attacked, we need to be in the process of converting to dilithium or equivalent


[20-Jul-19 08:48 AM] Small Fish#5687
And an other question how will you deal with atomicDEX if it becomes too big and attract US regulatory administrations? I know it‚Äôs decentralized and all but that can impede company adoption that would be reluctant to use a tech that don‚Äôt have the US administration favors. And also kmd could be forbidden to be traded on centralized exchange


[20-Jul-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
why would they single out KMD? using that logic, since atomicDEX is coin agnostice, all coins would need to be forbidden to be traded


[20-Jul-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
also, the USSA is actually not the entire world


[20-Jul-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
if we can get a few percent of the non-USSA trading volume, that isnt such a bad scenario


[20-Jul-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case, how will they stop it?


[20-Jul-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810

Because the dex come from kmd ecosystem.  USA is still a power that we can‚Äôt disregard specially for industrial adoption. Anyway dex will comes in many shapes and they need will to adapt. I was just wondering


[20-Jul-19 09:00 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Small Fish  according to their Fincen‚Äôs latest guidance on CVC it seems Atomicdex will be in the clear for now. https://www.fincen.gov/sites/default/files/2019-05/FinCEN%20Guidance%20CVC%20FINAL%20508.pdf


[20-Jul-19 09:02 AM] Small Fish#5687
I will take a look thank!


[20-Jul-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a special exemption for non-custodial atomicDEX


[20-Jul-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so they would need backtrack on that and prosecute their own voters


[20-Jul-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
in anycase, atomicDEX is the most resistant to regulations of all the systems out there and if atomicDEX is stopped that means crypto is dead

For most that have been following James for years now, he has proven that he is not just a regular C programmer.

@Tylor zkFS plz stop polluting my channel with nonsense. there are far more innocent people trapped in KYC nonsense than the few bad guys doing bad things. if the logic is to prevent all bad things regardless of the cost to others, it seems putting everybody in prison is the only solution. i believe in freedom, not police states and imprisoning people. if you want to be able to control what everybody does, you are in the wrong place

Hi James, initially i thought that antara is free of charge but when i tried to launch a chain i ended up on the cart page where i had various options with the total cost of almost 9000 usd a year. Who is getting the money and how are they used?


[21-Jul-19 02:40 AM] acidbird#7266
There is even a yearly price for atomicdex listing..

[21-Jul-19 02:44 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought it was a onetime charge, maybe mislabeled. if there isnt any fee at all, then it seems atomicDEX gets flooded with a bunch of spam coins. and tell me how the listing fee compares to listing fees for other exchanges? it seems for the typicaly listing fee at most exchanges you can pay for years of server costs

if a project cant pay $1500 do we really want people trading it? this is for brand new projects without any existing chain

not sure if it is annual or onetime, i am not directly involved with pricing things


[21-Jul-19 03:00 AM] acidbird#7266
Well, it depends, there are exchanges which do charge, others have rules for listing (for ex. liquidity pools, tokens for trading competitions, etc.). and don‚Äôt charge. The same goes to dividends. With all these new approaches i still can‚Äôt get the benefit of holding KMD and it is possible future value, it is more like a brand cost which depends on overall visibility of the ecosystem. 5,1% is a good thing but it doesn‚Äôt help if the token has no value or its value depends on some indirect things. Hopefully we will see more kmd trading activity with dex launch but really i don‚Äôt see key or main value proposition here for KMD or still missing smth.

[21-Jul-19 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
by your logic only coins that charge taxes have any value


[21-Jul-19 03:01 AM] acidbird#7266
Yeah, i read all your posts, checked it already


[21-Jul-19 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
people in the KMD ecosystem use KMD, therefore as the ecosystem grows, so does the usage of KMD


[21-Jul-19 03:01 AM] acidbird#7266
Nah, it is a mixture of different things in my opinion not only taxes


[21-Jul-19 03:02 AM] jl777c#5810
DOGE, LTC, they have no value according to your logic


[21-Jul-19 03:02 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the benefit of holding them?


[21-Jul-19 03:03 AM] acidbird#7266
So you see KMD more like a LTC or DOGE tokens?


[21-Jul-19 03:03 AM] jl777c#5810
let us imagine an atomicDEX that is doing significant amounts of trading, with every coin having a KMD pair


[21-Jul-19 03:03 AM] jl777c#5810
with the best spreads


[21-Jul-19 03:03 AM] acidbird#7266
No benefit really, i don‚Äôt hold them and never will üòä


[21-Jul-19 03:03 AM] jl777c#5810
then having KMD is equivalent to having the best price for all the coins it trades against


[21-Jul-19 03:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought a long time about why LTC has such value


[21-Jul-19 03:04 AM] jl777c#5810
my conclusion was that it was due to it having liquidity and not much else


[21-Jul-19 03:04 AM] acidbird#7266
This is true hopefully we will get good market share and liquidity


[21-Jul-19 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
by making KMD the default currency in atomicDEX, it will become the currency people park funds in, waiting for good prices on other coins


[21-Jul-19 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
while they do this, they get 5% APR


[21-Jul-19 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it has never happened before where a high liquidity coin that you can have orders pending, is also paying 5%


[21-Jul-19 03:05 AM] acidbird#7266
So you see it more like a stable coin then


[21-Jul-19 03:06 AM] acidbird#7266
With apr


[21-Jul-19 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
is BTC a stablecoin?


[21-Jul-19 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
people have BTC on exchanges to trade it for other things


[21-Jul-19 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
this gives BTC a lot of value, as almost everything can be traded for BTC at the best spreads


[21-Jul-19 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
and in crypto, trading is the only proven high volume activity


[21-Jul-19 03:07 AM] acidbird#7266
Hmm, well, this sounds reasonable


[21-Jul-19 03:07 AM] acidbird#7266
But still a way for us to go üòä


[21-Jul-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, atomicDEX needs to get traction


[21-Jul-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
we need the KMD liquidity


[21-Jul-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
but with all the mandatory KYC, it could be that atomicDEX is the only place without the KYC...


[21-Jul-19 03:08 AM] jl777c#5810
so KMD would only be for people who like to trade without KYC and get 5% while waiting for good prices on the orderbooks


[21-Jul-19 03:08 AM] jl777c#5810
and the ecosystem currency


[21-Jul-19 03:08 AM] acidbird#7266
But can‚Äôt they block the app if they decide to change the rules? Regulators


[21-Jul-19 03:08 AM] jl777c#5810
and for whatever other benefits ecosystem projects give to KMD, we see a lot of projects give preference to KMD, even though it isnt required


[21-Jul-19 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810
they can block atomicDEX as well as they can block torrents


[21-Jul-19 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810
how is that working out for them?


[21-Jul-19 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810
will they start prosecuting grandma and their voters?


[21-Jul-19 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810
for bartering


[21-Jul-19 03:10 AM] jl777c#5810
its not even copyright infringement, which they couldnt stop


[21-Jul-19 03:10 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a common law right to barter what you own


[21-Jul-19 03:10 AM] acidbird#7266
Noone knows but it is easier to block an app  or website then a torrent


[21-Jul-19 03:11 AM] jl777c#5810
at worst we need to host the download, maybe via torrent


[21-Jul-19 03:11 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case, atomicDEX is in the regulation safe harbor according to the latest guidance


[21-Jul-19 03:11 AM] jl777c#5810
they realized they cant make grandma have to get a money transmitter license for bartering


[21-Jul-19 03:12 AM] acidbird#7266
Yeah, i saw the guidelines, we are good so far, hopefully will get out of beta soon


[21-Jul-19 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
also if the only problem is that atomicDEX gets too big that regulators are paying attention,then it is like bitmex


[21-Jul-19 03:12 AM] acidbird#7266
And shake the market üòé


[21-Jul-19 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
by then it is way too late


[21-Jul-19 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
as atomicDEX grows, the first thing people will realize is that all the markets are in KMD


[21-Jul-19 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
what will they do?


[21-Jul-19 03:13 AM] jl777c#5810
ERC20 all require ETH, so they are DOA as the base trading pair


[21-Jul-19 03:13 AM] jl777c#5810
what other coin will have the liquidity on atomicDEX AND pay 5%?


[21-Jul-19 03:14 AM] acidbird#7266
This logic is good, i like it, when we get there KMD will be doing great


[21-Jul-19 03:14 AM] acidbird#7266
I love 5,1%, it is a great idea.


[21-Jul-19 03:14 AM] jl777c#5810
also, for non-ecosystem coins, nSPV wont work


[21-Jul-19 03:14 AM] jl777c#5810
which means they need to rely on the electrum servers or normal headers only SPV


[21-Jul-19 03:15 AM] acidbird#7266
Hmm, i didn‚Äôt know that, good point


[21-Jul-19 03:15 AM] jl777c#5810
the reality is that there will be occasional maintenance issues with electrum servers and headers only SPV is actually quite slow, compared to nSPV


[21-Jul-19 03:15 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD will be the only top coin with nSPV


[21-Jul-19 03:16 AM] jl777c#5810
at least until other ecosystem coins become a top coin


[21-Jul-19 03:16 AM] acidbird#7266
How far away are we from this?


[21-Jul-19 03:16 AM] jl777c#5810

[21-Jul-19 03:17 AM] jl777c#5810
i already have a proof of concept working, the fullnode support is in jl777 branch already


[21-Jul-19 03:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a non-hardfork update


[21-Jul-19 03:18 AM] jl777c#5810
realistically, by end of year to get the atomicDEX with nSPV support, but by then it is iterated many times from all the feedback


[21-Jul-19 03:18 AM] jl777c#5810
trading within the ecosystem will then be able to scale basically without limits (other than blockchain capacity)

"atomicDEX listing $700 per year, atomicDEX Mobile Wallet Listing $1500 per year" what is the difference between atomicdex listings and atomicdex mobile , I mean if your listed on atomic dex api then you should be on mobile no? and I guess some project dont need to pay any fee  like coins in the top 30 e.g as they  can bring in volume you just added them already


[21-Jul-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
desktop vs desktop+mobile, i believe is the difference


[21-Jul-19 09:59 AM] applecider#7505
does the gui set the price ?


[21-Jul-19 10:00 AM] applecider#7505
or this is at an api level  meaning only payed project as allowed to list on the gui ?


[21-Jul-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
you are confusing general atomicDEX listings with composer


[21-Jul-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
not all coins will be via composer


[21-Jul-19 10:01 AM] applecider#7505
oh I see this only applies to composer project using antara to make their blockchain


[21-Jul-19 10:02 AM] applecider#7505
hence launching on DEX will incur a fee


[21-Jul-19 10:03 AM] applecider#7505
makes sense if it a one time fee, I can not imagine delistings of a very good project that brings in volume

Hi, I tried to run Agama on an raspi 3b.

Hi do you need manually change all the fee from atomicdex to komodo? Right now there is like 20 coins in the DEX add but when there is more coins add that could be a very tedious job if it's done manually.

i tried that, but it isnt very efficient


[25-Jul-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
i implemented subatomic swaps, where you exchange a little bit at a time via a payment channel


[25-Jul-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
but you end up doing so many tx, it is slow and LN isnt exactly trustless for small payments


[25-Jul-19 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
building on top of LN, it seems a very risky plan


[25-Jul-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
people can barely get LN working for its intended usecase of micropayments


[25-Jul-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
how they will make it work seamlessly for swaps, seems a mystery


[25-Jul-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
also what about coins without LN?


[25-Jul-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
who holds the keys during the swap?


[25-Jul-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe they use LN just for the broadcast network, which is quite an inefficient usage


[25-Jul-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr wait until they get something into beta release before believing they can get it to actually work


[25-Jul-19 12:02 PM] peddycb#5889
I just watch the project and want to learn what is good and evil


[25-Jul-19 12:02 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I was reading about Stakenet today, hard to understand what it's based on. My understanding so far is that XSN masternodes act as full wallet for different coins, users have a light wallet. Masternodes are connected via LN, they do the order matching thing and trade between them. Users withdraw real coins when done. Seems an highly efficient proxy-token dex. I could be wrong though, details are scarce


[25-Jul-19 12:03 PM] Acura#2748
I had a chat with one guy from xsn. 
Asked him how i need xsn ?
 For which reason ?
This he answered to me:

Primary:

Payment of all fees (onchain tx, offchain tx, lightning swap fee).
Burn verification of dApps.
Payment of DB and CPU renting.

But you don't have to own xsn to do this. For example, if you want to pay a merchant with LTC who only accepts BTC LN payments, you can do this with LTC thanks to LN swaps and the swap fees are calculated in the backend with XSN and deducted over a separate LN swap without you noticing.

We migrate all LN features into our MN layer (channel funding, facotry channels, watchtowers, swap resolver, ...). Consequently, the MN operators are also those who benefit from most of the fees. On the other hand they have to run potent hardware to host the fullnodes with multiple blockchains or dapps.

Translated with www.DeepL.com/Translator


[25-Jul-19 12:03 PM] Acura#2748
MN = Masternode


[25-Jul-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is a custodial process where all MN become money transmittors


[25-Jul-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810

"Masternodes are connected via LN, they do the order matching thing and trade between them"


[25-Jul-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
seems they just use LN as a network. strange as it makes more sense to use the p2p network as a network


[25-Jul-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
so they have LN there for the buzzword value, not technical


[25-Jul-19 12:07 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
found an article w more details: https://medium.com/stakenet/xsn-2018-roadmap-ccpos-part-2-548d27958ebb  yes the MN are connected via LN and act as watchtowers. No much details on how users funds are secured, my best guess it's in fact a proxy token system


[25-Jul-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but maybe they need LN for all these fees going back and forth


[25-Jul-19 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
sounds very complex


[25-Jul-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810

"Looking for confirmation on the 98% figure. And is that 98% of KMD swept was returned or 98% of KMD reclaim forms were processed?" @jl777c   asking for a friend


[07-Aug-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont have exact figures, but it can be tallied from the blockchain. I have put in about 750,000 KMD and all but 30k have been refunded.


[07-Aug-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
approx numbers are 7M swept, 7.75 million refunded, total stolen is 7.8? mil but not 100% knowable


[07-Aug-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
total claims left are about 30,000 but from 261 addresses, so an average of 115KMD

@jl777c i read something recently about some devs adding a vault, whereby the BTC is sent to a special address. Then once a tx is created to use that utxo, the owner has x amount of time to VETO a tx basically. Dont know how it is supposed to work but would something like that work with KMD?


[08-Aug-19 01:35 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

The 'Vault' Is Back: Coder Revives Plan to Shield Bitcoin Wallets ...
Bitcoin Core developer Bryan Bishop has proposed a feature to delay transfers from cold storage so users can stop thieves from draining their wallets.
https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/vMQctyu2s_bnxHk4b5fRDDd_g3n1HDAtWgXI_Hfv8pc/https/static.coindesk.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bryan-bishop-by-jeanbaptisteparis.jpg


[08-Aug-19 01:35 AM] jl777c#5810
requires constant monitoring, special GUI


[08-Aug-19 01:36 AM] jl777c#5810
seems not a big project


[08-Aug-19 01:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Do you know how they can stop someone with your private keys from spending it with a higher fee?


[08-Aug-19 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it is a bit like atomic swap, some clever scripting to allow vaulting


[08-Aug-19 01:42 AM] KomodoWorld#8282
months ago I talked with @mrlynch about developing a CC for a bounty from me, based on the original Vault paper by prof. Sirer, but it's still far from completed


[08-Aug-19 01:43 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Will be interesting to learn how this is done


[08-Aug-19 01:45 AM] jl777c#5810
Under Bishop‚Äôs proposal, if an ‚Äúunlock period‚Äù were initiated, an owner could choose to react or not react.


[08-Aug-19 01:46 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is like atomic swap timeout, with yourself


[08-Aug-19 01:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But if someone has your private key, how does the blockchain know who is the owner? üòõ


[08-Aug-19 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
you send funds to a p2sh address that requires an unlock utxo that is matured


[08-Aug-19 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is another special utxo that needs to be spent first, the spending of this starts the unlock period


[08-Aug-19 01:47 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So maybe they are thinking about it the wrong way, the default should be not to send and if you are sending a valid tx then you send that through


[08-Aug-19 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i think ALL spends need to go through this, so if a one day delay, then all access to these funds will take a day


[08-Aug-19 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
in the event you see the unlocking txid activated, you have one day to spend (with a different privkey?) the original funds, which are still in the conditional p2sh


[08-Aug-19 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
something like that


[08-Aug-19 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can find the design document that he posted wherever, i can look at it and see how hard it is to do


[08-Aug-19 01:49 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Great will have a hunt around üòÉ

probably the bitcoin mailing list


[08-Aug-19 01:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
there are 2 keys involved from my understanding


[08-Aug-19 01:50 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But now thinking about what you wrote, i wonder if it is much easier just to get say 3 yubikeys and setup a multisig address somehow


[08-Aug-19 01:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
i have the doc


[08-Aug-19 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
can you post it here?


[08-Aug-19 01:51 AM] mrlynch#5735
yes, 2 min


[08-Aug-19 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so if both keys are compromised, it doesnt help


[08-Aug-19 01:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
üòÑ


[08-Aug-19 01:51 AM] mrlynch#5735
that's how i understood from the doc


[08-Aug-19 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
then just multisig with physical keys does seem better


[08-Aug-19 01:52 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I have the yubikey 2fa for my laptop, so convenient. Maybe we just need a good GUI for a way to setup multisig with that


[08-Aug-19 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
yes

[08-Aug-19 02:19 AM] mrlynch#5735
that's the new proposal


[08-Aug-19 02:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the trick is to pregenerate signed transactions with a onetime use privkey that you never save. since you never save it, it cant be compromised and the only thing that can happen is that you either broadcast this transaction,  or you dont


[08-Aug-19 02:31 AM] mrlynch#5735
and store the presigned transactions should one ever need it i guess, no?!


[08-Aug-19 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
the rest is just standard if/else scripting, but checksequenceverify is needed, which our codebase doesnt have as that came in 0.12


[08-Aug-19 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, you hang onto the presigned tx as if it was a privkey


[08-Aug-19 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the only way you can bypass the normal spend using the hot-wallet privkey


[08-Aug-19 02:33 AM] jl777c#5810
with this, i dont think there is need for multisig or the doomsday scenarios, just create the simple vault logic. a bit tricky as the vault reclaim needs to spend back to a new vault


[08-Aug-19 02:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems like a couple weeks of fiddling with bitcoin script


[08-Aug-19 02:35 AM] mrlynch#5735
can the presigned tx be stored on-chain or even in wallet.dat? even if the attacker has access to that it would be detrimental to use it therefore one can use a compromised private key to retrieve the presigned tx


[08-Aug-19 02:35 AM] mrlynch#5735
no?!


[08-Aug-19 02:36 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, store it in wallet.dat, or maybe encrypted on the blockchain


[08-Aug-19 02:37 AM] jl777c#5810
if using the hot-wallet privkey as the encryption key, then yes it wont do the attacker any good to broadcast it


[08-Aug-19 02:37 AM] mrlynch#5735
yes that is what i was refering to - the hot wallet key


[08-Aug-19 02:37 AM] mrlynch#5735
thank you!


[08-Aug-19 02:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the recursive part is basically iterating from the last one all the way back to the first one, so there would be N different revocation presigned tx, one for each iteration


[08-Aug-19 02:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the hope i guess is that the thief will stop trying to steal it if it keeps going back into the vault


[08-Aug-19 02:41 AM] jl777c#5810
a MUCH simpler way is just to make the presigned transaction go directly to a very cold wallet address


[08-Aug-19 02:43 AM] jl777c#5810
then just need to generate one set, none of this recursion complexity, no need for multisig. just generate the temp keypair, create a tx that spends to that address (as one of the possible spend conditions in an if/elif/else p2sh script), sign the tx, throw away the key


[08-Aug-19 02:43 AM] jl777c#5810
something like that. not 100% right but close enough i think to be able to debug once its put together


[08-Aug-19 02:45 AM] mrlynch#5735
i'll start fiddling once i put my gear back together unless this is urgent and someone else can do it


[08-Aug-19 02:45 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont think the bitcoin guys will get it done this year


[08-Aug-19 02:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a dapp that creates tx


[08-Aug-19 02:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I dont understand, why would it not do the attacker any goodto have the presigned tx info?


[08-Aug-19 02:52 AM] jl777c#5810
because the presigned info just spends to the new vault (or separate cold storage address)


[08-Aug-19 02:52 AM] mrlynch#5735
because the presigned tx reverses whatever they do


[08-Aug-19 02:54 AM] jl777c#5810
constructing the if/else p2sh script is the critical aspect of this. i think if all the paths it can go to are known, it can be done. one detail is how to make sure the hotwallet pubkey cant spend for X number of blocks after the release tx is spent. just too tired to think clear about this, but i am sure there must be a way


[08-Aug-19 02:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Oh so you mean the presigned tx goes back to the vault and it will veto any spend directly from the privatekey?


[08-Aug-19 02:56 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[08-Aug-19 02:56 AM] jl777c#5810
to the vault or to a extremely secure cold address to simplify the never ending chain and avoid the attacker having multiple chances


[08-Aug-19 02:56 AM] jl777c#5810
but this means the hotwallet is not very hot at all


[08-Aug-19 02:56 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Ah ok makes sense


[08-Aug-19 02:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But it also requires the user to act


[08-Aug-19 02:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Would it not be better to act to approve it?


[08-Aug-19 02:57 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure how practical it is to wait a day before you can spend from your hotwallet


[08-Aug-19 02:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But then it is just multisig üòÑ


[08-Aug-19 02:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems a simple multisig is a better way


[08-Aug-19 02:57 AM] hyperDEX#6586
yeah LOL


[08-Aug-19 02:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
i believe the use case is to store large amounts with an added layer of security/peace of mind


[08-Aug-19 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
this is more for lukewarm "cold wallets"


[08-Aug-19 03:00 AM] mrlynch#5735
but yes, multisig using 3 or 4 physical keys does sound more secure


[08-Aug-19 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
and without a day delay per each spend

[10-Aug-19 11:09 AM] Slyris#2880
My idea is to create an easily configurable game framework in modern C++ around `CC`. The idea would be to make modules of various difficulties such as graphic modules, scripting modules but also more advanced modules as an economic model for a game. I would really like to create a small mmorpg in 2d where the economy would be through mining that would bring money into the wallet of players. Assuming I do not want a maximum amount of tokens at the start. But rather an ecological cycle where each month we can mine up to a maximum amount of token. (Knowing that the mining in game would be literally stoned for a given time) the game could renew its resources every month. I think it could make a game rather interesting and fun. @jl777c


[10-Aug-19 11:09 AM] Slyris#2880
It's just a few ideas, but it could be funny.


[10-Aug-19 11:10 AM] Slyris#2880
But on the assumption that these tokens are real and have addresses it could also have a real value in the cryptos market.


[10-Aug-19 11:11 AM] Slyris#2880
I have always found the economic model of video games today not very interesting, I would really like to propose an innovative solution and especially for the players


[10-Aug-19 11:13 AM] Slyris#2880
With the traceability of the currency, can even imagine a model where the bots would be easily detectable


[10-Aug-19 11:13 AM] Slyris#2880
Sometimes people are discouraged when they come on a video game and the economic model is to take out their credit card and buy on third party sites


[10-Aug-19 11:14 AM] Slyris#2880
In this model, players create the game economy themselves at the work of their clicks


[10-Aug-19 11:15 AM] Slyris#2880
In the same idea I think the possibility of the blockchain to have unique transactions, the very possibility of having items via transactions, all that gives me a lot of ideas


[10-Aug-19 11:16 AM] Slyris#2880
I think sometimes when I have an hour or two I would look at a project like this, proposed a very customizable module of a real economy (fair) for a video game.


[10-Aug-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the rogue CC locked all the premine into a CC address


[10-Aug-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
then as players found in game gold, when they came out of the game they would get the corresponding coins


[10-Aug-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
all this is not only possible, it was already done


[10-Aug-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
we also now have the possibility of making it a DAO


[10-Aug-19 11:22 AM] Slyris#2880
you mean kind of database


[10-Aug-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810

all verified, so no creation of fake data files


[10-Aug-19 11:23 AM] Slyris#2880
But imagine we are an external video game


[10-Aug-19 11:23 AM] Slyris#2880
We want to integrate easyli an economy for our game


[10-Aug-19 11:23 AM] Slyris#2880
we will look around CC


[10-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Slyris#2880
to totally place the whole economy on the blockchain


[10-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Slyris#2880
with a fair system


[10-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Slyris#2880
It's need to be easy to integrate


[10-Aug-19 11:24 AM] Slyris#2880
like literally few clicks to define what they want


[10-Aug-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont have the context to know how to easily integrate,but can help with the onchain side


[10-Aug-19 11:25 AM] Slyris#2880
Because i know we have everything to achieve this kind of project, but this is not so obvious right now


[10-Aug-19 11:27 AM] Slyris#2880
What i want is something that we can directly ping `mmorpg company` and say look we have a battle ready module that can interest you


[10-Aug-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i like the plan


[10-Aug-19 11:29 AM] Slyris#2880
Today the big problem of the companies that make mmorpg is that their economy (of the game) is infested with bots and resellers third, they do not have the security of the blockchain sometimes they have duplication of items , they are forced to rollbacks, it's hell.


[10-Aug-19 11:30 AM] Slyris#2880
Here we come, and literally have a configurable solution that solves all these problems. I even think that many companies would pay for this kind of solution.


[10-Aug-19 11:31 AM] Slyris#2880
We just have to offer something that integrates as well on mobile, as on pc, on consoles, something very simple and not intruisive


[10-Aug-19 11:33 AM] Slyris#2880
It's really disruptive, on the one hand a company can very well say why we would go on an economic model that would prevent us from having fiat money, but on the other hand it can seduce a lot of players for the security that it offers and nothing would prevent a company from getting money with fees on every block mined in game.


[10-Aug-19 11:33 AM] Slyris#2880
On the one hand the security of not having all the problems mentioned above (so finally a more solid game), on the other hand we lose all the security, but we have an economic model based on fiat money.


[10-Aug-19 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
the other aspect is that the game company can keep 10% of the premine for themselves and just lock 90%


[10-Aug-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
or whatever percentage is the optimal balance


[10-Aug-19 11:34 AM] Slyris#2880
Of course, that's why some open mind company can love this concept


[10-Aug-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so the more the ingame coin is worth, the more this 10% to 30% becomes worth


[10-Aug-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and it is automatic, as the atomicDEX support is there for all smartchains


[10-Aug-19 11:34 AM] Slyris#2880
What I want is that we are ahead of it, because I'm sure and some that it's the future.


[10-Aug-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
with nSPV we can do CC over mobile


[10-Aug-19 11:35 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah totally but we will need to communicate to do high level layers then


[10-Aug-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
though not yet as the full CC support in nSPV is only in the komodod nSPV=1 mode so far


[10-Aug-19 11:35 AM] Slyris#2880
To support all platform through an easy way


[10-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Slyris#2880
But it's will be really cool to do like a proof of concept and try to do a little 2d game using this economy model as example


[10-Aug-19 11:36 AM] Slyris#2880
Like a realy basic one (zelda-like)


[10-Aug-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
also if it is setup as a DAO, the game company would get a built in 10% of the profits (whatever that is determined to be), with 90% to the players


[10-Aug-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so fiat can be avoided totally


[10-Aug-19 11:37 AM] Slyris#2880
If we do it well, we could make a module that even the existing game engine could integrate or offer (Unreal C++, Defold Lua) etc ...


[10-Aug-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, done right this will be a very significant things


[10-Aug-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
there is also built in support for NFT


[10-Aug-19 11:39 AM] Slyris#2880
If it can be disruptive and really compete against pay2win it would be a big win for the industry.


[10-Aug-19 11:39 AM] Slyris#2880
Many players give up when he sees a pay2win game


[10-Aug-19 11:41 AM] Slyris#2880
CC Rewards can be used too for achievement in game


[10-Aug-19 11:41 AM] Slyris#2880
I believe.


[10-Aug-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
rewards just pays simple interest for timelocked coins


[10-Aug-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
if internal game events are put onchain, then you can convert any ingame item to real coins or NFT


[10-Aug-19 11:46 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah like game event that appear once a week for example or once a year


[10-Aug-19 11:46 AM] Slyris#2880
Should be easy to configure a new event "prize"


[10-Aug-19 11:47 AM] Slyris#2880
If a game wants to do an event for Christmas but change every year for example it must be really easy to interact with the module that we provide


[10-Aug-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
you can use oracles for that


[10-Aug-19 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
define a "game event" oracle


[10-Aug-19 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
only the publisher can define such an event


[10-Aug-19 11:48 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah, but again we will need to do it in a really high level layer


[10-Aug-19 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the CC can then verify that the claim for an event is valid


[10-Aug-19 11:48 AM] Slyris#2880
so it's really easy to configure


[10-Aug-19 11:48 AM] Slyris#2880
And behind we will deal with CC the right way


[10-Aug-19 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i think as long as all desired actions are defined, then it is implemented at the low level via CC and it spawns an rpc call. the "high level" would just be to issue the rpc call


[10-Aug-19 11:49 AM] Slyris#2880
We must put together the pieces of the puzzle now


[10-Aug-19 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
sooner is usually better than later

[10-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Slyris#2880
So basically a game company would like to create a side chain with the name of their currency


[10-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Slyris#2880
and do some configuration about CC module they want to use on this side chain


[10-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Slyris#2880
alright ?


[10-Aug-19 11:53 AM] Slyris#2880
http://komodo.zogs.org this help me a lot to understand


[10-Aug-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
once there is a generic game CC that has all the standard functionality, it is a matter to start the chain with the correct parameters


[10-Aug-19 12:03 PM] Slyris#2880
There is a CC generic game file @jl777c  ?


[10-Aug-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
not yet


[10-Aug-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
needs to be defined first


[10-Aug-19 12:04 PM] Slyris#2880
ok, i'm reding the CCDice.h and dice.cpp now


[10-Aug-19 12:04 PM] Slyris#2880
to understand the low level layer


[10-Aug-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
rogue is the most complex, but closest to what you are asking for, look at rogue_rpc.cpp in the src/cc dir


[10-Aug-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe tetris is a better example as it is much simpler and still gets ingame points to coins


[10-Aug-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
the cclib.cpp has some built in game oriented things


[10-Aug-19 12:11 PM] Slyris#2880
for example the dice is more than 850 lines of codes for roll a dice alright @jl777c ?


[10-Aug-19 12:11 PM] Slyris#2880
I think it's not so easy


[10-Aug-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
writing the CC is not easy, using it is a matter of issuing rpc calls


[10-Aug-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
also dice is doing mempool things that make it a lot more complex


[10-Aug-19 12:16 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah i see


[10-Aug-19 12:16 PM] Slyris#2880
but from the developer side we have only CC Library, so i need to adapt to it


[10-Aug-19 12:17 PM] Slyris#2880
But it's really low level c so i need to focus a lot to understand what is going inside


[10-Aug-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i think better is to define all the functionality you need


[10-Aug-19 12:18 PM] Slyris#2880
i will ofc


[10-Aug-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
we then make a CC that has this functionality, along with rpc interface


[10-Aug-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
then all the C++ code has to do is issue rpc calls


[10-Aug-19 12:18 PM] Slyris#2880
Ok i will do !


[10-Aug-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
look at the TUI code, they interface to the CC via rpc


[10-Aug-19 12:18 PM] Slyris#2880
ok thank's a lot james for your time and your patience


[10-Aug-19 12:18 PM] Slyris#2880

@jl777c Hello


[15-Aug-19 01:33 AM] Slyris#2880
it would be nice to have a unique configuration file for the electrums it would avoid parser as many different files no ? (for the coins repository)


[15-Aug-19 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
you could just create a single electrums file out of all the separate files if you want


[15-Aug-19 01:42 AM] Slyris#2880
yeah but i need to be synced i think, for the moment i will open and parse file


[15-Aug-19 01:42 AM] Slyris#2880
this is not a problem


[15-Aug-19 01:53 AM] smkhound#7640

üôè 

[15-Aug-19 02:06 AM] Slyris#2880
do we have a garantee that the "coin" field from `coins.json` is the filename in the electrum folders @jl777c ?


[15-Aug-19 02:07 AM] Slyris#2880
so i can simply do:

```cpp
if (additional_infos.is_mm2_compatible &&
                std::filesystem::exists(std::filesystem::current_path() / "electrums" / current_element["coin"])) {
                additional_infos.is_electrum_compatible = true;
            }
```


[15-Aug-19 02:09 AM] jl777c#5810
other than transient errors, it should be that way


[15-Aug-19 02:10 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok great. Thank's


[15-Aug-19 03:17 AM] Slyris#2880
@jl777c How we know if the electrum server is using TCP or SSL using the configuration electrum files ?


[15-Aug-19 03:17 AM] Slyris#2880
According to mm2 api documentation i need to precise if i'm using TCP or SSL


[15-Aug-19 03:17 AM] Slyris#2880
and if i want to disable certifications


[15-Aug-19 03:17 AM] Slyris#2880
cc @artem.pikulin


[15-Aug-19 03:21 AM] Slyris#2880
for example:

```json
{
    "url": "electrum1.smartcash.cc:50001",
    "contact": [
      {
        "github": "https://github.com/SmartCash/electrum-smart/issues"
      }
    ]
  }
```

I dont know how i can detect if it's SSL or Regular TCP that i should use here


[15-Aug-19 03:24 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure either. mm1 only did tcp, but i think mm2 supports both


[15-Aug-19 03:24 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe you can try ssl and if that doesnt work try tcp?


[15-Aug-19 03:24 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah i can confirm mm2 support both


[15-Aug-19 03:24 AM] Slyris#2880
yeah i would do that probably


[15-Aug-19 03:25 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is a process that parses all the files, determines ssl or tcp and puts it all into a single json array in a file with "coin" and "type" fields added


[15-Aug-19 03:26 AM] Slyris#2880
i would like


[15-Aug-19 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
then this can be run whenever there are important updates to the main coins file/electrums


[15-Aug-19 03:26 AM] Slyris#2880
Thank's, for the moment i will do a simple try and if i find this process i will use it !


[15-Aug-19 03:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the coins and electrums are not changing very often, just a weekly update by running the electrums file creator should be enough


[15-Aug-19 03:28 AM] jl777c#5810
also it can start with parsing the old electrums file to remember the ssl vs tcp type and only do it for new electrum entries


[15-Aug-19 04:31 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Slyris Hi! TCP is default protocol used, if specific electrum address requires SSL it will be shown in coins repo: https://github.com/jl777/coins/tree/master/electrums since commit: https://github.com/jl777/coins/commit/21597cef15d95d1835fb9ee47255f3ef930bfab8 As I can see there're no servers that use SSL as of now.

@jl777c Are there any plans to put the Komodo project into a company structure? Right now we have the KMD token which doenst give hodlers any equity, just a token to use on the platform. With all the new techniques you guys are coding (which are also interesting for other projects) do you guys considering changing the structure so hodlers could choose to invest in a company instead of a usage token?

I noticed today that on the low volume CCL chain a tx can take long before being dpow secured as we have on demand mining turned on. Is there a way to address this?


[21-Aug-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
it should actually go pretty fast. how long is "take long"


[21-Aug-19 07:50 AM] barv#0867
It went fast to 5 confirmations. Then 1 hour for number 6. Now I sent antother tx and it proceeds to 8

[21-Aug-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
but how long did it take to get notarized?


[21-Aug-19 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
5 confirmations, if "confirmations" field means it was notarized. how many confirmations are you waiting for


[21-Aug-19 07:52 AM] barv#0867
Ah, I didn't think it was at 5. I figured 10 which it reaches now, after 4 to 5 hours


[21-Aug-19 07:53 AM] barv#0867
thx @Deleted User that is a solution indeed


[21-Aug-19 07:53 AM] SHossain#0007
CCL doesn't have many regular txs. There was 1 notarization a min ago. Follow what Emmanuel said and use cronjob to send tx to self every few mins


[21-Aug-19 07:54 AM] SHossain#0007
You can send 0.0001 to self which would be very low cost


[21-Aug-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
but why do you want to get more confirmations?


[21-Aug-19 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
once its notarized, its notarized


[21-Aug-19 07:54 AM] barv#0867
@jl777c I don't. I just don't want it to 'stop' before it is dpowed


[21-Aug-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
did it stop before it was notarized?


[21-Aug-19 07:55 AM] barv#0867
>> once its notarized, its notarized


[21-Aug-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
if it reported "confirmations" as more than 1, it was notarized

exactly. after that I don't care


[21-Aug-19 07:56 AM] barv#0867
Okay. That is good. So on demand mining makes sure a single tx gets notirised, and then it sleeps again?


[21-Aug-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
on demand mining doesnt guarantee it will get noarized right away, but most of the time it should


[21-Aug-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
if it reported "confirmations" as more than 1, it was notarized


[21-Aug-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
so you can see if it was notarized or not


[21-Aug-19 08:02 AM] barv#0867
Okay. I suspect we will have days with just 1 transaction. And I want to prevent them to be not dpowed within say 15 minutes. Should we then make this cronjob or is that unnecessary?


[21-Aug-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
if it reported "confirmations" as more than 1, it was notarized


[21-Aug-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
is it reporting it as notarized or not? how often is it stuck at 1?


[21-Aug-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
why do you think there is a problem?


[21-Aug-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
if it reported "confirmations" as more than 1, it was notarized


[21-Aug-19 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
5 is more than 1

Just call a script on blocknotify that sends dust to yourself until the original transaction is notarized.


[21-Aug-19 08:05 AM] barv#0867
I am just trying to find out how this on demand mining works. I now know there wasn't a problem (but I just thought there was)


[21-Aug-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
if there are no transactions in the mempool, no blocks are mined


[21-Aug-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
that is ondemand blocks


[21-Aug-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can find cases where a transaction is not notarized, then let us know


[21-Aug-19 08:07 AM] barv#0867
Yes. So with only 1 tx a day you have a problem?


[21-Aug-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
why?


[21-Aug-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
does it get notarized?


[21-Aug-19 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
if it gets notarized, 1 tx per year is still notarized


[21-Aug-19 08:08 AM] barv#0867
Because it will be out of the mempool once processed and then you have to wait for the next right?


[21-Aug-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
are you just making up problems based on guessing?


[21-Aug-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
once there is a transaction that isnt notarized, then it should most of the time trigger a notarization


[21-Aug-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
which puts another tx in the mempool


[21-Aug-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
which gets mined


[21-Aug-19 08:09 AM] barv#0867
I try to understand the 'most of the time'


[21-Aug-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
notarizations are not 100% guaranteed


[21-Aug-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
it might not happen


[21-Aug-19 08:10 AM] barv#0867
and the only way to avoid that is more tx?

Would it  be technically possible to dPow KMD (only KMD, not SC or 3p) to 2 chains at once?

yes but its pointless IMO.

You would only be making an extra external referance... it cannot be 2 serperate notarizations all thogether.

because they would conflict at times and cause each other to be invalid.

Chance consideration and prize make a lottery .  While you ‚Äúwin‚Äù your money back, you had to front up the DAI ( in the pooltogether example ) first.  That would be consideration.

Not against games just warning against potential missteps that may occur,  it is a good idea though just needs to be thought of how to be done legally ,  if you were unaware decred is facing some issue because of their staking system because it is somewhat like a lottery.

> Or a dev needs to make Beam work with mm2
> Also it has to have (something like) BIP65 implemented

You can maybe check this with a Beam developer.

Just found (slowpoke!) that btc has a backdoor for actually destroying coins. By not spending fees of mined block. Is it reproducible in kmd coins?


[17-Sep-19 04:23 PM] kolo#0539
Not in the form of sending to fake address, those are unspendable, but not burnt. Above actually remove btc from existence.

@jl777c im talking about solutions when coins actually removed from system. Not sent to unspendable address where they account for circulating supply. See link above - unclaimed miners fee cease to exist. Can we get same function as a function?


[18-Sep-19 11:12 AM] CHMEX#0686
note sure if this helps.
on KMD and any assetchain if you send the coins the the official null priv key burn address the coins are removed from the circ. supply. 
Which for any coin is always a calculation of premine + blockreward


[18-Sep-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
since unspent utxo become txfee and txfee goes to miners, something about that would need to be changed


[18-Sep-19 05:33 PM] kolo#0539
In btc miners when constructing coinbase tx are allowed to not account txfees at all, so this satoshis (10+ btc according article) disappear. It‚Äôs interesting, first of all and also can break some system relaying in fact supply never decreases.


[18-Sep-19 05:35 PM] kolo#0539
I have huge theoretical interest, because supply never decreases, and unspendable address is just one more existing input, which will never be spent, not that interesting üôÇ

Tl;dr definitive way to destroy vs unspendable inputs as useful, but non definitive


[18-Sep-19 05:45 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
There are examples of KMD miners that have both burnt fees by not collecting them as well as "burning" some of the block reward (not really burning but not creating the full expected supply)

One of the defining features of centralized vs decentralized virtual currency is the ability to remove from circulation  ( according to fincen at least )

Doesn't trading into or out of ARRR reduce privacy as well?  Can't you send to or from your own zaddrs without anything but the transparent outcome being visible?  I guess I don't understand the superiority of this trade off.

When atomicdex is at full capacity do you think it can cause a swelling of the non-scalable blockchain until it is inoperative?

¬† Taking into account that in atmicdex all transactions are in the blockchain and in centralized exchanges they are out


[20-Sep-19 03:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
@peritonlogon Pirate transactions can have no transparent outputs, unless it's to send data for dpow protection. Only notaries can send taddr xtns, and only miners receive coinbase taddr. Mined finds must immediately be sent to zaddr and can never be sent back to a taddr by normal addresses

@dukeleto   I get that.  But if I'm trading into ARRR, the account I'm trading from IS transparent.  And if I'm trading out of ARRR the account I'm trading to IS transparent.  afaik most uses of crypto require transparency.  So, explaining to me how dividing zk-transparent into two chains is better than one requires more than just telling me how ARRR works, it requires explaining to me why it is better than being on 1 chain.


[20-Sep-19 09:59 PM] Regnar#6164
@peritonlogon because of Z pool size and the fungiblility differences. When it's on one chain, someone can see 10 coins go into Z address, and 10 coins go out. If the pool is small enough (and it almost always is with t and Z chains) then this analysis is very effective at beating privacy.

Z pool size is a good way to protect against this, but still is only really effective if people send into the Z pool uniform amounts and leave them in the Z pool for random amounts of time. Jumblr was designed to do this actually, break balance into specific amounts (100, 10, etc) and send into z pool, and send out at random times, this way everyone's "in" and "outs" were the same sizes... but even still, the pool was too small to effectively mask transactions.


[20-Sep-19 10:01 PM] Regnar#6164
Having it on a different chain means that not only is the Z pool nearly 99.9%, coins going "in" ie. Buying ARRR, don't have to come out as the same coin. 

So instead of KMD going to Z and the same amount of KMD coming out. Now you have N amount of BTC going into ARRR Z, and coming out as ETH, or KMD, or any other coin.

[21-Sep-19 04:25 PM] Regnar#6164
@Sunshine in my ass nSPV - is a wallet type that is exclusive to the Komodo ecosystem. Traditional SPV wallets (lite wallets, like mobile, or websites) don't download the whole blockchain, but download the headers from the whole blockchain, if the headers all line up, it can be pretty sure that it's address/transactions are correct. This however downloads ALL the block headers, which can actually become quite a bit of data, especially as blockchains grow longer, and a wallet might handle dozens of coins.

nSPV does the same thing as SPV, except instead of downloading ALL of the headers, it pays particular attention to Notarizations (exclusive to Komodo) The wallet treats the notarization basically as the beginning of the chain, as it is infeasible for anyone to change the info before a notarization. This means nSPV wallets are hundreds, if not thousands of times more efficient than SPV wallets. It uses a tiny amount of RAM to verify transactions and makes it ideal for IoT and low computing power devices like watches.

adding to @Regnar 's explanation, one other major benefit of nSPV is that, a normal komodo full node can serve the data required by a nSPV wallet
this is in contrast to normal SPV wallets which need dedicated Electrum servers which can only take so much load (as the number of concurrent users increase, more Electrum servers are needed)
so nSPV tech helps in scalability(not in tps but in number of lite clients supported) too

p.s: Testing the capacity of the various Electrum servers used by AtomicDEX is one of the objectives of the upcoming stress test

@gcharang there are 2 types of SPV clients
- Electrum based SPV clients as you explained. this doesn't need to download data, and only send queries to the Electrum SPV servers on the IP:PORT list they have.
- SPV clients which directly connect to the blockchain's p2p network and download required data.


[22-Sep-19 07:40 AM] gcharang#6833
@grewalsatinder got it
but no one seems to use the second kind because of the current sizes of the major blockchains?
any wallet that says lite/spv seems to be using the electrum version

the libbtc repo james forked for libnspv seems to have the second type of SPV but I don't think many people use that flavour of SPV for BTC 
it became a good tech for KMD solely because of Notarizations


[22-Sep-19 07:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
breadwallet uses that, and the bitcoin mobile wallet, and I guess Mycelyum too uses the SPV client method connecting to p2p network.

@ERIC there is the `-ac_algo` parameter that supports Verus hash at the moment
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-setup/antara-customizations.html#ac-algo>
for other algos, they need to be added to the Source code

the two ore only loosely connected
in a "short answer", LABS can be used to pay for the usage of KMDLabs as a sandbox testing ground for creating chains and development with the "simulated" (for lack of a better word) dPoW
You know "in real time" if the things you dev and test are production ready

hey @jl777c , would you be interested in speaking with people who submitted the dilithium NIST project ? I had lunch with one of them yesterday and, even if he was not aware of Komodo work - was interested in the use of their stuff. Or perhaps you already have contact with them and my friend was not aware of this.

@jl777c here is a crypto unrelated tech question-
what IDE do you use?
I know there is a spectrum from vim/gcc up to stuff like clion and this is an interesting fundamental question..
I used pycharm for some stuff in python and I sort of really hated it (bloated container ship that could hog your whole computer just to tell you that your code style was not according to pep1217 or whatever), but it had some features I did not want to miss-
what about c programming?
sublime is a cool text editor with syntax highlighting, but these bare bones things usually only work for 'helloworld'
Do you use some make or automake?
I was exposed to makefiles 15 years ago and it is rather an art, not an exact science...


[27-Sep-19 04:13 AM] jl777c#5810
i usually just put #include "sourcefiles" to avoid linker issues


[27-Sep-19 04:13 AM] jl777c#5810
IDE... if vi is considered IDE.


[27-Sep-19 04:16 AM] LocoMB#8593
thanks!


[27-Sep-19 04:16 AM] LocoMB#8593
I would sympathize with vi myself- I hate emacs :troll:


[27-Sep-19 04:17 AM] LocoMB#8593
but you don't use a makefile?


[27-Sep-19 04:17 AM] LocoMB#8593
I remember form once compiling an x server and having to do stuff in the makefile.. fells like in a Stephen King novel


[27-Sep-19 04:19 AM] LocoMB#8593
Also, these low level tools need constant practice- I was sort of semi-proficient in vi, but that had totally decayed after like- a year or two..


[27-Sep-19 04:20 AM] jl777c#5810
there is usually a makefile that already exists. add the new source files to the makefile and run make


[27-Sep-19 04:20 AM] jl777c#5810
usually i make a simple script file to issue all the commands to test a new iteration


[27-Sep-19 04:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so edit, save, run script, test, repeat


[27-Sep-19 04:22 AM] LocoMB#8593
sounds good- 
I guess those really evil makefiles are the ones that are made for multi-platform distributions
back in the day when Solaris BSD and all kind of competing unixoids were still a thing


[29-Sep-19 10:51 AM] Slyris#2880
@LocoMB The current architecture of the Komodod make CLion really hard to use with it.

I myself am a big fan of writing its makefiles is even I did it a lot, only sometimes it is also necessary to adapt with his time, there are certain platforms that are in C++ much more easily targetable with CMake.

From my experience, I think that today when we think of a project from the beginning it is not a bad thing to think about those who use IDE's, you will not prevent those who want to use VI to do it.

On the other hand make a small local Makefile and supported only Linux, and think that everyone will use VI or create a script to compile, you lose the possible support of IDE's, one of my goals is to create a CMake for the Komodod project without breaking the backward compatibility with ZCash.

I can not for my part conceive of making a C++ project today without CLion, others it will be QTCreator, others it will be Visual Studio, other XCode, other emacs or VI. But the interest of CMake is that all its developers will enjoy their favorite editors/ide's.


[29-Sep-19 10:58 AM] Slyris#2880
I can understand seeing some CMake dating from several years ago that we may be afraid to do, however as a modern CMake expert I think to provide a clean, easy to maintain and that will please to everyone.

1. accept only notarizations that matches what your local node already has as its mainchain

@jl777c Any news on bringing atomic swap tech to other fields than crypto soon? For instance: swapping tickets for events or a 1-on-1 marketplace for placing sportsbets and sorts (1 taking action, 1 buying action at a certain price which are held by the atomic escrow tech and settled after the event took place). The last one is a multi billion (maybe trillion) business. I think in general adoption of the DEX will be much faster if you start bringing out usecase outside of crypto.

[21-Oct-19 09:11 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
another insane idea I was thinking if it is possible to have default preloaded addresses with small amounts for testing - to more easy allow users for "trying/testing" apps / crypto


[21-Oct-19 09:12 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so for example  I would make some dust like 0.001 coin per address, at least in some early stage to increas adoption of the app


[21-Oct-19 09:13 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
tha would also be usefull for test like beer pizza in the past - no need to ask anyone for change or search - you just create a wallet and in some misterious way same time "mine" some initial reaload available during first

N blocks

@Oszy so basically I should create my own chain to have required specs ? where can I learn how to do so and what is required for me to support it later on the go? I think those new invetions of nSPV and aPOW doulb be nice to, so that lite app is usable through nSPV and aPOW makes me not ti think about mining problems and overall blockchain problems


[21-Oct-19 09:16 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
maybe for regular transparent chain nSPV is not so crucial

maybe I missed it but are there any plans to make some easy api for marketmaker so that it could be backbone for shapshift-like services, meaning such service would only make the ui and plug to marketmaker? end user doing payment from blockchain would see different blockchains and fees dependent on spread based on marketmaker values ? or it is what is acually is already and just needs more marketing towards payment processing services ?


[27-Oct-19 12:02 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
it would be great to attract all those services doing btc payments - they would provide liquidity and get liquidity; what could attract them would be easy quick implementation/connection to mm


[27-Oct-19 12:05 AM] Audo#5667
I'll answer what I know: yes ‚Äì it's called AtomicAPI. The full release is still coming but there is documentation already online

would be great to see MM based payment service, where you could specify outgoing addr, amount, currency, and send your preferred currency in relevant amount; that would need to include some buy/sell walls fluctuations to make it mostly instant; probably would need few steps: **1. user fills in outgoing parameters 2. user gets back the amounts (included spread and spread fluctuations) needed from different currencies he owns in the wallet  3. user selects and query selected options 4. if tx is not instantly taken - the form gives back updated values doubleing the spread fluctuations - this way after 2-3 interations there tx should pass through** (user friendly during bigger fluctuations)


[27-Oct-19 12:40 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
additionally if the tx will cost less due to fluctuations - the remaining change could stay on user side not to overpay


[27-Oct-19 12:42 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
actually this could be built in into  atomic dex, and since in there (form + request functions) could maybe be easily ported to external services


[27-Oct-19 12:45 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
now imagine you see as payment BCH QR code - you just click it using Atomic DEX app - already got step 1 done - outgoing params and instantly get the options from your wallet (and the taking the qr code shot could fire step 1 and 2 instantly), then you click selected option (pay if succesful) and see the feedback (paid or updated form in case of bigger fluctuation just happened)


[27-Oct-19 12:45 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622

This brings me back to a question from #cc-oracles.
I've been going to conferences, presentations and talks over the last couple of months and Oracles are mentioned often, as something new.  One project made their full presentation on them at the start of blockchain week explaining how they were making theirs. Pretty much all Ethereum-based projects.  The audience was impressed.
Your post is from April and we tested Oracles in Labs over a year ago (Smk762 created DragonHound).
Are they really that far behind, or am I missing something?


[02-Nov-19 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
why is it surprising komodo is years ahead?


[02-Nov-19 01:23 AM] jl777c#5810
having the core code is just the start though, you need the docs and then GUI and end user services, all those require a lot of time and effort, but without the core functionality, no amount of docs and GUI can make an end user service


[02-Nov-19 01:24 AM] jl777c#5810
if only komodo had hundred million to spend, then we could make a dozen projects worth of end user services, all decentralized.


[02-Nov-19 01:25 AM] jl777c#5810
if you look at my jl777.com in detail, you will see that i have written about a large spectrum of blockchain tech and a lot of this has been in komodo for years, i just didnt bother to blog it till about six months ago


[02-Nov-19 01:26 AM] Sarahz#0662

[02-Nov-19 01:26 AM] jl777c#5810
from a blog post detailing a design, to working code to user friendly GUI and working end user service, that might take a year or two, but fundamentally, all the blockchain level issues are solved


[02-Nov-19 01:26 AM] jl777c#5810
all smartchains can have oracles enabled, DTO is a separate mechanism that requires a custom chain for specific oracle feeds


[02-Nov-19 01:27 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo uses a multichain architecture so we can scale without having any single dapp bogging down the entire ecosystem


[02-Nov-19 01:27 AM] jl777c#5810
and yes, many oracles have already been implemented


[02-Nov-19 01:27 AM] Sarahz#0662
Good üëå


[02-Nov-19 01:31 AM] jl777c#5810
DTO is the most reliable oracles resistant to fake data and it forms the basis of several other solutions, like the decentralized stablecoins, whose conversion price is based on DTO, all blockchain based


[02-Nov-19 01:39 AM] jl777c#5810
we are working on an improvement that will allow any publicly avaiable api endpoint to be used as the source of the data. this then goes through a process to minimize the impact of biasing attacks and creates a consensus 24 hour price that is used for settlements


[02-Nov-19 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
still a bit of custom code will be needed to parse the data from an arbitrary feed, but that is all that would need to be done, so once that release is out, i expect we can see a lot more DTO chains. built in support for 32 fiats, binance cryptos and stockmarket prices, so for most prices the support is already there. maybe we need to document it better. @gcharang

@Cryptoon most ACs are "on demand" which means that absent a transaction in the mempool Agama will not mine the chains no matter what you tell it


[02-Nov-19 06:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But once a block enters the mempool agama can mine it, right?


[02-Nov-19 06:13 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
transaction, not block


[02-Nov-19 06:13 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
on-demand chains, by default, do not have empty blocks


[02-Nov-19 06:14 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
blocks are only created when there's a demand for a block (when a transaction needs to be processed)


[02-Nov-19 06:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362

@Cryptoon in Agama you could mine with any native wallet simultaneously. I can't say it'll be efficient though


[02-Nov-19 06:15 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`but the cpu running agama wont run at however % if there are no tx presenting themselves?`
correct, no tx = no mining


[02-Nov-19 06:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362

I was thinking if the faucet could be conditioned? like it seems goo idea to give away some coins per address but to me it only mae sense if one will use it for "testing purpose" to check if some functionality in an app will work or how easy it is to get some service and so ...


[06-Nov-19 08:31 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
however if these are money per addr then abusers might create an addr every second and comulate it

small amount per address


[06-Nov-19 08:32 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
so for example it can be conditioned to only be spendable to 1 addr ?

[06-Nov-19 08:34 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
if a service got dedicated addr and you could only spend fauce cash there  abusing makes little sense


[06-Nov-19 08:35 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622

[06-Nov-19 08:36 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
actually having kind of "cupon service" where can get money but spend it only to 1 addr would be what many shops are doing with prepaid cards to promote themselves


[06-Nov-19 08:37 AM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622

[06-Nov-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
only fresh address that "mine" get the 0.1 coins. the protection is that the 0.1 coins is not worth spending a minute mining

There is a post about BIP39 seed phrase entropy that was once shared with me.   The explanation in it was showing how leaking the position of word reduces the entropy greatly.

Are you able to reshare the link if you are familiar with my request, jl or community?
Cheers


[13-Nov-19 03:16 AM] jl777c#5810
just leaking the word, discloses the exact bits that must be in the privkey


[13-Nov-19 03:17 AM] jl777c#5810
our method hashes the entire seed, so even if a word is leaked, it wont give much advantage in decoding privkey


[13-Nov-19 03:17 AM] jl777c#5810
if the word and position is known, that is even worse with bip39 as that directly reduces the entropy bits

Honest question that perhaps might make some people angry. How is it possible to justify the current value of the top 100 coins. Coins with 10-50k in transactions per a day are valued at over 100 mill. Seem like an illusion. Take komodo for example, what can justify the price? Technology? It's all open, can't someone take it? The team? You guys are amazing but 20 mill can prob make a great team. Utilization? There is not much use that would require coins to be purchased. Speculation? Of what exactly? There are 1000 coins competing to do nearly the same things. Anyone have an answer? I feel crypto will go to 80% under current prices in 1 year.

[17-Nov-19 07:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
sunk mining cost factors in that too (somewhere), but that's more of an "excuse" than a "real" value


[17-Nov-19 07:24 AM] jspook16#3059
Yeah there's that too. As far as coins competing for the same thing, true. Basically, do your research. If you believe crypto has a future, pick a few horses and see who hits the finish line first. If you don't believe crypto has a future, there's nothing wrong with that either.


[17-Nov-19 07:39 AM] jspook16#3059
I think your on to something though regarding price drop. I think alot of the coins whose development has fallen behind will essentially tank. And that value will start moving into the more established coins. We're past the phase where any coin with a roadmap can establish funding. They'll need something tangible. Just my thoughts

i think for crypto valuations, it would be similar to real estate. why would  a house that costs $20,000 to build be worth $2 mil? if the neighbor houses are all $2 mil and about the same type of house.


[17-Nov-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no way there would be rents to justify the $2 mil valuation, so it isnt the cashflow


[17-Nov-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
there are only so many coins, a finite supply. which is a very new concept for money, so when valuing crypto against something that will forever devalue (fiat), it is just a matter of time before the price of crypto goes up significantly


[17-Nov-19 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC is sort of the hardmoney standard of crypto, with miners spending $5000 to $8000 per coin. if BTC wasnt worth more than that, they wouldnt be doing this. now is BTC worth 10000x what KMD is? is it worth "only" 1000x or 100000x? in real estate you compare to comparables. currently KMD is far away from BTC, so you need to compare it to the others near #50, and each coin in the top 100 is being valued against its neighbors


[17-Nov-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
should BTC be worth more than all the other coins combined? i would say that over time, this cant be sustained, but network effect will keep it there a lot longer than the tech would warrant


[17-Nov-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
approximating to half, then the question is asked about each coin below and what percentage of overall marketcap makes sense, starting with the remaining half. it is only small fractions by the time you get to where KMD is now. using a comparables valuation, it seems KMD is headed higher in the rankings. especially now that china has discovered it


[17-Nov-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
ultimately, the crypto valuation question is answered by whether BTC belongs at #35 on https://fiatmarketcap.com/


[17-Nov-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
when it comes to valuing currencies, its all relative

The chips/atomicdex flow for a game is an interesting point @jspook16 
James has said in the past that it is possible btc won‚Äôt be the king of crypto valuations.  Stablecoins likely.

Where are stablecoins going to be utilized?  In my opinion it is in multichain ecosystems.  The komodo‚Äôs cosmos‚Äôs polkadots verus.

Why in those ecosystems?  Because they will provide developers (and organizations) an arguable order of magnitude more sovereignty and security than eth v1.0 provided in 2016-2018 which.

If there are stablecoins in those ecosystems why bother with crypto like kmd atom or dots?  Because of bridges between services, dev costs, tech debt, new opportunities and functions not supported by stablecoin provider.  The devs of stablecoin have different goals to ecosystem providers and different weaknesses/pain points.

Edit:  verus chain ecosystem

Here's a question regarding the classification of the KMD currency, please correct me if my assumptions are wrong: Since there has been an ICO for the KMD coins and they have not been mined from zero supply like Bitcoin (thus pre-mined), isn't there the danger of the SEC coming after Komodo as they did with many other ICO projects, and classifying the KMD currency as an unregistered security and a fraudulent fund raise? Or is the creation and development of KMD so decentralized that there is no company or organization that can be held accountable and penalized?

[19-Nov-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
also, all the aspects that usually make something a security is in other coins, like DEX, SUPERNET


[19-Nov-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is strictly a currency


[19-Nov-19 11:13 AM] t_dan#3334
ok, thanks!


[19-Nov-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
if you notice the SEC actions, they are going after the very biggest and the most extreme of ICO that was basically a fraud. I saw some list of top crypto projects by american govt, KMD was in the top 40


[19-Nov-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
the ICO that spend on marketing without a product, those are the ones that need to worry


[19-Nov-19 11:17 AM] t_dan#3334
Generally it's one thing what oneself believes is so, or is true, and another thing what the SEC simply claims. Veritaseum comes to mind, which was really not a big ICO first of all, and they released a long public statement why the SEC's allegations were actually wrong, but still the SEC could claim whatever they wanted and pretend that's true.


[19-Nov-19 11:17 AM] t_dan#3334
And successfully charged them.


[19-Nov-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
what tech did veritaseum release?


[19-Nov-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
last i saw it was just a QT wallet


[19-Nov-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
centralized service


[19-Nov-19 11:18 AM] t_dan#3334
peer to peer capital markets


[19-Nov-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
but did it actually work?


[19-Nov-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
i didnt see any decentralized tech come out of that project


[19-Nov-19 11:19 AM] t_dan#3334
Yes, they are quite far already with their development, working beta.


[19-Nov-19 11:19 AM] t_dan#3334
https://dapp.veritaseum.com/


[19-Nov-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
how is a website decentralized?


[19-Nov-19 11:22 AM] t_dan#3334
Haha, good question. No, they are a company of course, having sold the ERC20 VERI token as "pre-paid fees for their peer-to-peer services".


[19-Nov-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
you can say "peer to peer capital markets", but what does that mean in terms of tech


[19-Nov-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
so they have a centralized service and the token sale was prepaid fees, for this centralized service


[19-Nov-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
and they dont have any tech at the protocol level, it is just an ERC20 token


[19-Nov-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
and you are thinking this is in anyway comparable to komodo?


[19-Nov-19 11:24 AM] t_dan#3334
proprietary tech, in that sense, yes. A business model. No whitepaper. Reggie Middleton always compared this to: has Microsoft released a whitepaper? No, they have a business model, and created a lot of licenses for the services (here: the VERI token), that they can sell as they like (here: ICO)


[19-Nov-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
didnt they raise $20 mil or so?


[19-Nov-19 11:25 AM] t_dan#3334
I think so.


[19-Nov-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so a closed source, centrally controlled service, sold as prepaid tokens. you do realize this is about as far away from komodo as you can get


[19-Nov-19 11:25 AM] t_dan#3334
yes.


[19-Nov-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo isnt a business


[19-Nov-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no business model for KMD


[19-Nov-19 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a coin and the ICO was done to raise BTC needed for dPoW txfees, and we finished that and started notarized within months after the ICO was finished


[19-Nov-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
my understanding is that as soon as we completed our ICO promises, and KMD started trading freely on the markets, it is not any security


[19-Nov-19 11:28 AM] t_dan#3334
I see.


[19-Nov-19 11:30 AM] t_dan#3334
I only raised it because these days it feels they're trying to come after any project they might want, potentially anything that could be a (in their view threatening) alternative to the established fiat monetary system, whether the claim is valid or not. It's simply good to be prepared for anything.


[19-Nov-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly, if they go after every project in crypto, they would have come after us too


[19-Nov-19 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i would imagine that we would be toward the last ones they go after, and i guess they would have to come after me as there is nobody else responsible for the ICO.


[19-Nov-19 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure what ranking we are as far as funds raised, but likely beyond the top 200


[19-Nov-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
or even top 500 as 2017 was pretty crazy


[19-Nov-19 11:34 AM] t_dan#3334
As long as you keep being able to stay anonymous, they might no be able to come after you. üòÑ

Gabelli v. Securities and Exchange Commission, No. 11-1274, the United States Supreme Court clarified that the 5-year statute of limitations applicable to SEC enforcement actions that seek financial penalties begins to accrue when the alleged violation occurs, not when the SEC discovers the violation.  This decision may have implications not only for SEC enforcement actions, but for other government proceedings seeking a civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture.

it was an exciting month in 2014. hard to buy BTC to buy SuperNET. localbitcoin was the easiest option apart from mining


[19-Nov-19 04:27 PM] richardt#2807
On the topic of SuperNET, are there any plans to liquidate SuperNET and distribute everything to holders in the event that SuperNET does not produce any significant dividends in the next 2-3 years? Or possibly 5 years?


[19-Nov-19 04:30 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Supernet has already paid over 1 million


[19-Nov-19 04:45 PM] Dave123#3592
Are there any plans to provide liquidity for people who want to sell there Supernet or liquidate the whole thing?


[19-Nov-19 04:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
No .  Eventually the rest of the assets will be on Atomicdex you can offload there when they are enabled


[19-Nov-19 05:03 PM] Dave123#3592
Only problem beeing that there never was a market for Supernet asset with liquidity and there probably wont be one on Atomicdex either.


[19-Nov-19 06:45 PM] richardt#2807
Agreed. There should be some kind of end goal.

SuperNET is a vehicle for people who take a long term view, that the whole Komodo ecosystem will provide useful tech and because of that will become (very) valuable


[20-Nov-19 03:42 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
talking about demolishing or liquidating the SuperNET asset is nonsense


[20-Nov-19 03:44 AM] CHMEX#0686

I'm very confident the 100'000 buy offer satisfies the buying power for any shortterm seller....


[20-Nov-19 04:40 AM] richardt#2807
Please don't misunderstand. I'm not talking about liquidating anytime soon.  I'm just saying in the event that things don't pan out (which, let's face it, is a real possibility), there should be a some kind of plan to give back to holders if they wanted out.


[20-Nov-19 04:40 AM] richardt#2807
Also, I wouldn't consider holding SN 5-6 years as short-term.


[20-Nov-19 04:41 AM] richardt#2807
I think the majority of holders are long-term at this point

```https://cointelegraph.com/news/why-namecoin-didnt-take-off-a-cautionary-tale```

```The problem is three-fold:

1.¬†Namecoin wasn't easy enough to use. The wallet still sucks, and there were no resolvers or good tutorials until I got involved. And that was three years after Namecoin existed. If they'd had a great wallet, a good resolver, and good tutorials from day one, Dot-Bit domains could likely be universal by now.

2.¬†Some of the Namecoin developers kind of lost track of the plot at some point. Once they were all broke (and isn't that maybe the market sending signals?) some of the team tried to partner Namecoin with Google and even ICANN. That makes no sense. That's making a technology to circumvent governments and then handing it over to governments.

3.¬†Most people don't care. Despite censorship of the Web around the world, and the threat of more impending Web censorship in the US, most people would rather spend hours forwarding and discussing horror stories of censorship and impending doom than actually spending an hour making their own domain censorship-proof by setting up a Dot-Bit mirror URL and then promoting it.

The biggest flaw is the clunky wallet that takes ten minutes to open. The other biggest flaw is that the near-zero expense of registering domains encouraged domain squatting

Also, Dot-Bit is actually vulnerable to a hostile takeover from ICANN.¬†```

```https://www.freedomfeens.com/blog/?p=6343```
```Basically [my idea is] customizable HOSTS.txt files, with a resolver built off the code of MeowBit, and a way for people with no computer skills to easily customize lists and share them via BitTorrent (without even needing to know what a HOSTS.txt file or BitTorrent is). Making it easy to compete to make and share the best lists would drive adoption.```

Namecoin been my favourite project from it's technical point of view. It actually was doing and offering what it was claiming to do and even more in later years.
Only if the developers of it's project were friendly enough to SuperNET when I approached them and were a collaborative sensible, I would have helped their tech be much easier to use for end users. They didn't listen and just responded and treated me like a troll, so I didn't took any much efforts for that project.
Today, if the same or similar tech is made on Komodo Platform, I'd very much like to be part of that even just being a volunteer.
I can express and probably add some dev work where possible to make a blockchain based domain name system work to help such tech develop and be eased for end users.


[27-Nov-19 02:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And since we have now nSPV, that'd mean we can also have such tech absolutely accessible on every type of platform with such ease and efficiency that any end user expects to have.


[27-Nov-19 02:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm busy with other projects outside blockchain tech for some time now, and aware that Veruscoin is working on decentralised identity. I haven't explored it much, but I hope the same can also be adopted to act for domain resolving with modified or custom resolver if required. Any decentralised naming service can be moulded to behave like a domain name system.


[27-Nov-19 02:50 PM] Mylo#8306
nspv in a browser extension (or phone app) would be able to do similar perhaps.  For Web devs using a js (or wasm) bridge.
A customCC can add many other things.
nspv is P2P super lightweight client.

not just web browser mate, making nSPV based DNS resolved installed as a system service along with the DNS resolver daemon.


[27-Nov-19 02:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
that would be mean a system wide decentralized DNS resolver always accessible just like any ICANN based TLD everywhere.


[27-Nov-19 02:54 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, agree. even OracleCC can be used to make decentralised DNS üòâ


[27-Nov-19 02:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but I guess before using OracleCC there must be specifications set by experts and devs so all things are made in standard way and not with some conflicting ideas.


[27-Nov-19 02:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess even multiple types of specifications be used by individual devs to make different versions of DNS over OracleCC


[27-Nov-19 02:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I still haven't gave up trying to make nSPV as a library to use with Golang project. Have made a bit progress over how can I make it a library and call it's functions in Golang. I really hope I could get it implemented as I expect it to work. Will post my failure or success soon.

I have looked into this idea a lot ,  BOINC computations seem a match made in heaven.  The main hurdle of a BOINC crypto is the economic structure , Gridcoin and similar coins have gone the route of rewarding users with a coin,  the issue comes with a lack of utility of the coin.  Other than trading it for BTC / ETH there is nothing you can do with it.  The problem is made harder in that pretty much all BOINC projects are volunteer based .    A coin based on BOINC  needs to have a utility , some reason a person will keep on to and use the coin.  I have found a project out of the university of Brno in CZ that is a BOiNC based hashcat distribution ,  this could be an example of a public utility BOINC project.  People use the coin for work prioritization .  Other BOiNC projects can be rewarded as well but one has to be cognizant of the issues ( some people try and game the system to get more credits and in doing so sabotage the research being done )

it is based on the USD price of the collateral?  (i would guess, yes for USDK)

when paying back the stablecoin, there is no fee? (hence the 0%)

in the case that KMD is used as collateral, the rewards would still be accruing?

if so, will the rewards go to the depositer upon release, or would they go to some "fund", or do they just not exist?  or is there automated blockclaim re-deposit to claim the reward monthly?

in the current design, the rewards are for the maintainance costs of the multisig signers' servers

> it is based on the USD price of the collateral?  (i would guess, yes for USDK)
yes
if the stable coin is pegged to BTC and collateral is KMD, KMD/BTC price is used

if the price did not go below a certain amount and the debt ratio was always below 80%, afaik, there is no fee

[05-Dec-19 09:29 PM] jl777c#5810
we are planning a KMD backed EUR stablecoin. so you would purchase 1BTC of KMD and deposit it, that allows to issue up to 80% worth of EURK, let us approx to 5000 EURK. these EURK are freely tradeable. you can use it on atomicDEX and once we get on a fiat exchange, can then deposit the EURK and then withdraw the EUR via SEPA.


[05-Dec-19 09:30 PM] jl777c#5810
at anytime, you can payoff the 5000 EURK you issued and recover the KMD that was locked

there will be only be fees (tx, gateway, etc) but no interest rate you need to pay back

nobody is lending you the EURK, you are actually creating them yourself

even without the fiat integration, using atomicdex to trade EURK to a stablecoin that is available in your jurisdiction/fiat-on-ramp opens up whatever is around.   just need the stablecoin/stablecoin liquidity also.

Wow great thanks for thinking about ‚Ç¨ too


[05-Dec-19 10:54 PM] criptobear#6402
So maybe there will be some lending solution like makerdao and others are doing, so I collateralize and lend the ‚Ç¨ sum to get some interest?


[05-Dec-19 11:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the pegs CC implements a blockchain enforced decentralized stablecoin issuing. there will be ways for people to "mine" accounts in default and make 5%. to do this you will need to have EURK already, so it wouldnt be interest but rather liquidation fees that you can earn. personally i am not so fond of charging interests, the big problem is where do the funds for the interest come from. if we are dealing with a pegged value, we cant just issue more coins. which means people will need to pay it


[05-Dec-19 11:05 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, there are plenty of such systems out there, EURK probably will be the only interest free loan system. this way, if you really need some EUR and dont want to sell any KMD, you can lock the KMD and borrow against it. as soon as you repay it, your KMD is released


[05-Dec-19 11:11 PM] Lennart#9331
does it have any effect when the locked-in KMD fluctuate in fiat-value?


[05-Dec-19 11:11 PM] Lennart#9331
could someone else release my KMD ?

If your collateralization  falls below the threshold


[05-Dec-19 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if you have less than 10% equity left, it is allowed for anybody to liquidate it and gain a 5%+ arbitrage profit


[05-Dec-19 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
but you can add EURK or KMD to your address to avoid this


[05-Dec-19 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
at scale, this effect creates demand for KMD as the price of KMD falls


[05-Dec-19 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
and of course having KMD locked, removes it from circulation for the time being


[05-Dec-19 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
KMD would allow people to either get 5% rewards, or an interest free loan against collateral for a EURK coin (that hopefully can be used for SEPA transfers when going through a gateway). it has been pointed out that losing the 5% rewards is an opportunity cost, but at worst it is a 5% and for a short term loan it is not a major issue

The biggest differentiator is when it comes to txfees,  other stablecoins require parent chain currency to move around the stablecoin.

@jl777c as kraken being biggest euro exchange wouldn't it be natural choise for EURK exchange?


[06-Dec-19 05:05 AM] Mark81#4505
Am i understanding correctly that one that hold EURK coins can redeem them back for kmd from smartcontract? This is quite new consept but very intresting. Who will receive newly isuued EURK coins after original peg creation if kmd price rises later on?


[06-Dec-19 05:07 AM] Markus#5464
It might be a natural choice but considering they have not listed KMD yet i would not get too big hopes on that to happen


[06-Dec-19 05:11 AM] Mark81#4505
How about ECB? Are they intrested? They would might want their currency to be pegged to something.

Not sure how it works I turn my kmd in usdk but why?


[06-Dec-19 07:40 AM] mobipoi#5774
As if the value of kmd drops that my usdk will have more value

A clear video explaining this will be helpful


[06-Dec-19 08:35 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@mobipoi   Why turn kmd to usdk : 1) hedging 2) fiat access without liquidating your kmd 3)  further pegging ( for derivatives ) .    When the value of KMD drops,  you will have to deposit more KMD and/or pay back usdk or else risk account being liquidated.  When accounts get liquidated 5% goes into a reserve for amelioration of debts and the liquidator makes 5%.   Debt holder loses 10% . In @artik123   Situation where price of collateral goes up the user either needs to acquire usdk from other users to redeem their collateral  or extract more usdk from account to cause liquidation to ‚Äúunstick‚Äù collateral and consequently sell the stablecoin on the open market for kmd

?


[06-Dec-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
if the value goes up, you can issue more stablecoins


[06-Dec-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
of course if you borrowed 80% to begin with, there isnt much equity left to gain in value


[06-Dec-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
true, if you go all in, you could get stuck


[06-Dec-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
how is it different


[06-Dec-19 08:56 AM] gcharang#6833
@artik123 your loan is 50 usdk
regardless of the price movements of KMD, (within limits)
you always need to repay 50 usdk

in your example if KMD value goes 10x up,
you can withdraw even more usdk


[06-Dec-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
you are still able to extract value out of it, in the form of stablecoins, just not in KMD


[06-Dec-19 09:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
In the real world you pay interest on loans and the amount of the loan is fixed. Assuming that someone else out there also had a usdk debt to pay, the additional usdk generated will be bought up


[06-Dec-19 09:07 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
The system is more like a line of credit than a loan


[06-Dec-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i believe the implementation will allow a third party to pay off the pending debt for a redeem (withdraw) of unrelated stablecoins. there is no penalty to the account holder in this case


[06-Dec-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the selection of non-defaulting account will be in reverse order, so the least leveraged would be selected first and this seems like a good way to unwind people that are stuck due to an all in situation


[06-Dec-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
the issue is that the account has an unpaid debt and external funds are needed to clear it and you are saying this user went all in and has no other funds. i cant see how to unwind this without a third party


[06-Dec-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is more than 50% equity, it seems this is possible


[06-Dec-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is less than 50% equity, it seems not


[06-Dec-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
in this case, we should be able to make a "close account" rpc call to free up the equity (KMD)


[06-Dec-19 09:26 AM] jspook16#3059
Would it be optional to have the account closed?


[06-Dec-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you invoke the close account, it wouldnt be closed


[06-Dec-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a chance your account is randomly chosen to support a withdraw


[06-Dec-19 11:52 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Is there plans to do other major currencies like USD/AUD/GBP etc?


[06-Dec-19 01:35 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That is the hope .  Euro should be a good test run though for fiat gateway acceptance.  I think how it is structured as an interest-free mechanism also greatly sets it a part from other platforms which are loan-like in nature. This may help in acceptance in other more stringent jurisdictions.


[06-Dec-19 01:52 PM] Mylo#8306
Great to see ppl ask about this collateralized lending system.  It is a phenomenal (re)development.  Plz read #talk-entrepreneurship


[06-Dec-19 02:38 PM] Mylo#8306
There seems to be a ‚Äúgateway‚Äù option to lock up other coins besides KMD to generate USDK, which can be used to close account of a previous loan.


[06-Dec-19 02:41 PM] Mylo#8306
Eg
10000KMD for initial loan of 5500USDK
You only have 5200 USDK to pay back, but have 4000 DGB.
Lock up the DGB, extract the value in USDK of say 300USDK.
Pay back the 5500 initial loan, unlock KMD.

Is this a suitable scenario for the close account with other assets?


[06-Dec-19 02:54 PM] Mylo#8306
What if....
This is the risk of putting up collateral.  It is secured credit, not a credit card.
CDPs are used for loans to get liquidity for other opportunities with the hope of making the effort worthwhile.

If you have a mortgage to 90% of the value of your house, and the market goes down by 20%, the lending policy of your mortgagors (lenders) may be to foreclose on your loan.  It is the way secured credit works for lower interest.

In this case it is 0% loan.

In the event of DGB falling in value, it is unfortunate market conditions and whatever the initial 5500USDK loan was used for hopefully was used for good opportunities to outweigh the liquidation of the smaller asset.  If the market is screwed, what else is there to do?  Ask for a bailout?


[06-Dec-19 02:57 PM] Mylo#8306
I re read your question.  It is a market condition scenario.  The idea is to get a loan and pay it back quickly imo.  It is not designed as a multi year investment.....unless there is a huge bull market.


[06-Dec-19 03:18 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
volatility is volatility. no ways around that. you cannot have "risk free" loans, there are always risks involved. 

of course it makes sense to have as many options available when having loan crypto products. to cover as many scenarios as possible

but risk **always** exists


[06-Dec-19 03:23 PM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
still unexpected things can happen. like i said earlier, it is good to plan (programmatic) ways into the loan solution, to close the loan and keep some of the original collateral that had huge upswing in price


[06-Dec-19 03:51 PM] phm87#7395
@artik123 the mechanism of how it works is similar to DAI. And about having a loan in fiat baked on cryptos, I know few companies that make that. It have some risks (in case of market dump). Usually, ppl make that to buy real estate and pay way less taxes.


[06-Dec-19 03:56 PM] phm87#7395
``What you're actually suggesting that if he spent his usdk or just made failed investments with them, he should also get screwed with his kmd redeem. Even if they appreciated in value. It's nonsense.``
in real life, if you make a loan with some collateral (real estate, company shares, cryptos, ...) for anything and you burn/loose the money, whatever any collateral gained value, bank will sell everything at a stupid price to get their money. In the case of KEUR, some math can't be worth than bank rules for selling your stuff. I know ppl who were seized for thousands of ‚Ç¨ for small unpaid bills of few hundreds because it is sold at very low price (but unpaid bills is a little bit different)


[06-Dec-19 04:06 PM] phm87#7395
I don't think that there is interest here, just a kind of fee at liquidation as I read.


[06-Dec-19 04:09 PM] phm87#7395
but if KMDEUR is increasing, I think that you can have more keur, jl said it somewhere, I'm searching for the message


[06-Dec-19 04:10 PM] phm87#7395
you can redeem the loan if you find another way to have some value (euro or KEUR) to do it


[06-Dec-19 04:11 PM] phm87#7395
I also read that partial redeem will be possible (not sure if it is possible in this release)


[06-Dec-19 04:12 PM] phm87#7395
I'm reading but similar subjects were also discussed elsewhere


[06-Dec-19 04:19 PM] phm87#7395

But when you say ``They liquidate it (for the sum of the loan plus interest plus fines whatever) and send you the rest... it's very simple`` I think that jl777 said it is possible here
https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/455851625915875338/652561082023542813


[06-Dec-19 04:26 PM] phm87#7395
about ``Without a "closing account" option, it could possibly lead to a systemic problem where, over time, more and more loans would never be redeemed and an ever-increasing amount of usdk will be floating around. I'm not sure what the consequences of it will be`` I don't know how to print more KEUR than total existing existing cryptos. We have loads of USDT floating, it still works. In worst case, 100% of KMD (and other cryptos) will be locked in loans. I don't think that we will reach this point


[06-Dec-19 04:28 PM] phm87#7395
yeah i know but we can change that in the code


[06-Dec-19 04:28 PM] phm87#7395
that's why I wrote in worst case


[06-Dec-19 04:33 PM] phm87#7395
about the 80% and liquidation, there was something about 5% or 2 times 5% ... and there is slipping when you dump too much coins ... so maybe I am wrong and it can get more bad


[06-Dec-19 04:45 PM] phm87#7395
there is no incentive to do this, maybe he wants to loose/stuck money


[06-Dec-19 04:47 PM] phm87#7395
no because you diminue the sum you have


[06-Dec-19 04:47 PM] phm87#7395
as you said, you can lock 3 times the initial kmd sum ... then ... you are stuck, you won nothing, you lost/stuck money


[06-Dec-19 04:48 PM] phm87#7395
Have a nice sleep


[06-Dec-19 04:52 PM] phm87#7395
Let's do the math !
if 1 KMD = 1 KEUR
I have 100 KMD, I do a loan then I have 80 KEUR
I convert 80 KEUR to KMD then do another loan, I have 64  ... then 51.2 then 40.96 and so on
Using excel, I did the calculation, it tends to have 0 as output so that's why I think you'll end up with 0
Total sum is around 500 and not 3 times 100


[06-Dec-19 04:52 PM] phm87#7395
it is 1:52 AM here, good night buddy


[06-Dec-19 05:05 PM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
quick math: it's a geometric series with ratio = 0.8 so the sum will be = 100 x 1/(1-0.8) = 500


[06-Dec-19 05:12 PM] phm87#7395
the sum of all KMD locked is 500 but the amount you actually have is 0 at the end of all the small loans


[06-Dec-19 05:24 PM] hyperDEX#6586
But then a 4% move and your loan would be called in.....no risk of it not closing.

Would the stablecoin be abuseable? I‚Äôm not the smartest so please don‚Äôt roast me if I‚Äôm completely off the mark here üòÖ

No fees, and 80% creation of coin. I presume 20% is the safety net / in case coin drops in value the cc will liquidate the holdings? If not then my whole theory is wrong. 

If that is how it works though, say I have $10,000 I want to invest into kmd. Kmd is currently at $1

Option 1: I buy 10,000kmd like normal 

Option 2: I buy 10,000kmd, issue myself $8000 in stablecoins. If komodo rises, ie goes to say $5, I still only repay $10,000 to claim back 10,000kmd so no loss (minus tx fees)

However if komodo drops to say 80c, then my coins will be liquidated and I have $8000 in a stablecoin (holding 10,000kmd would have resulted in $8000 net position)
; but if komodo drops further say to 50c, either the liquidation will have stopped me from losing the funds, or if it doesn‚Äôt work that way, I could choose to keep the $8000 instead of paying it back to claim 10,000kmd as 10k kmd = $5000, and not paying back the deposit is the better option financially

> No fees, and 80% creation of coin. I presume 20% is the safety net / in case coin drops in value the cc will liquidate the holdings?
true. but, it is another user who will liquidate your holdings for a 5%(if instantly sold at market price) profit

> I buy 10,000kmd, issue myself $8000 in stablecoins. If komodo rises, ie goes to say $5, I still only repay $10,000 to claim back 10,000kmd so no loss (minus tx fees)
you only have to repay $8000 to get back your 10,000 KMD if price goes up

> However if komodo drops to say 80c, then my coins will be liquidated and I have $8000 in a stablecoin (holding 10,000kmd would have resulted in $8000 net position)
this is what happens

> if komodo drops further say to 50c
it doesn't affect you as your KMD have already been liquidated

> Would the stablecoin be abuseable?
it isn't abuse if someone uses something as it is intended. What you described is the intended behavior

by borrowing against the KMD collateral, you are giving up the right for its future gain, in exchange for not having to absorb future loss. also, to participate in the system, you give control of the collateral to the blockchain. unlike all the other stablecoin systems i know of, there is no interest to pay for the loan against the collateral. you do give up the right to claim the KMD rewards for the duration. also, not aware of any other system that uses a purely decentralized process to issue new stablecoins. anybody at anytime is able to deposit KMD and issue pegged coins

Wouldn't the forgone rewards be considered one of the "costs" of the loan? In a loan situation, where do the rewards go? Never accrue? Back to the network?


[13-Dec-19 04:39 AM] bishop#9773
or do they accrue to 30 days and then once the loan is repaid, you get your capped rewards?


[13-Dec-19 04:39 AM] gcharang#6833
in the current implementation, rewards are used to fund the servers for the multisig signers

the rewards are 5% for a year
if you want to hold KMD and still get some fiat for a temperory emergency, you can use the peg
after the emergency is over, and you have the fiat, you get back the KMD

this way, you will escape from the volatility cost that will affect you if you sold and bought

How many versions of stable coin concepts did you ponder before settling on this current concept? Has this concept been reviewed by any third party math and economics wizards? (Note: Am not questioning Jl777s intuitiveness and ingeniousness)

i cant count how many different concepts my subconscious ponders...


[13-Dec-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the math is pretty straightforward. and in the event of a catastrophic and immediate crash in KMD price, the peg will stretch. and the shortfall will be socialized across all issuers equally. meaning the market price of EURK will likely drop to a proportionate value of the overall equity levels.


[13-Dec-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
under normal bear market conditions, there is time for the liquidators to rebalance the overall exposure. its just if the price crashes so fast and we end up with negative equity situation for accounts. as to the probability of such a fast crash without recovery is... i doubt anybody can predict as it is an unpredictable event that is needed


[13-Dec-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the design can handle a 90% loss of value over a 6 month period, followed by another


[13-Dec-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
but if the price drops 60%+ in a day... that would be hard to prevent going negative equity for accounts that only had 20% equity

so the fact that you need a separate transaction and that it is linearly dependent, automatically limits the resources needed for each FSM transaction

1. Why the choice of 20% safety net? 
2. Why not variable as in makr? 
3. Does the pegged stable coin borrowed get destroyed when the debt is repaid? 
4. Why should people choose to borrow against  kmd and get no interest when with DAI they can get 4% yearly
5. Is it going to borrow only against KMD?


[14-Dec-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
1. it uses a 24 hr price average
2. what is the point to make it variable. when the market moves it will move before you can adjust it. and isnt the makr changing the interest rate and not the safety margin?
3. yes
4. if somebody has KMD and not DAI, what does it matter what DAI does? also i think you have it backwards. people are not loaning their KMD to others. you are using KMD as collateral to create stablecoins. nobody is charging anybody any interest
5. the reference chain we will make will use KMD


[14-Dec-19 12:13 PM] criptobear#6402
1. You mean it varies automatically based on the price?
2. I talk about makr because I am using it although im not a great expert but I like the fact that when you collateralize ETH you can choose how strong is you safety net is so you can have a deeper margin or if you like risk a shallower one.

The term annual percentage rate of charge (APR), corresponding sometimes to a nominal APR and sometimes to an effective APR (EAPR), is the interest rate for a whole year (annualized), rather than just a monthly fee/rate, as applied on a loan, mortgage loan, credit card, etc. ...

if you feel that KMD will decrease 7% in the next year, it even makes sense to lock it and withdraw stablecoin

nobody is getting paid interest and nobody has to pay interest

KMD system is NOT a deposit and get interest so someone can loan it out to get paid a higher rate of interest


[14-Dec-19 10:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not that at all


[14-Dec-19 10:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a system that allows people to have KMD and at anytime, borrow against it using the blockchain without paying any interest. in KMD case the monthly rewards are lost, but that wont really matter to someone who is outside the KMD now as they are not used to it. very few coins pay rewards


[14-Dec-19 10:44 PM] jl777c#5810
by the time someone is complaining that they dont get the 5% rewards by using this system, they at least understand a lot more about KMD than they did before


[14-Dec-19 10:46 PM] jl777c#5810
the KMD is kept in a federated multisig that requires long term commitment and availability, it is not exactly the notary nodes, but rather composed of 13 msig operators, most of which used to be notaries. but all are long term community members


[14-Dec-19 10:47 PM] jl777c#5810

In regards to the stable coin


[15-Dec-19 12:19 AM] J-Dog#9487
What don't you understand about the stable coin?


[15-Dec-19 12:46 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is someone that can make a video from the existing info?


[15-Dec-19 12:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the main idea is that it decentralizes the money supply creation, so each person can choose to create new stablecoins. based on overall demand, which is expected to go up as the price goes up, more stablecoins are issued. once issued they exist independently. of course the issuing accounts are owing the amount of stablecoins issued, so in addition to stablecoin usage, the stablecoin also enables one to gain the arbitrage from liquidation.


[15-Dec-19 12:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if to add that to the percentage gained by having stablecoins, it could become much more than double digit percentage as the target is 5% arbitrage gain. and there is not need to wait a year for it, just need to find an over leveraged account that can be liquidated


[15-Dec-19 12:50 AM] jl777c#5810
this income production method i dont believe is availble for the other stablecoins. so the issuers do get something more than just the stablecoins in exchange for locking their KMD


[15-Dec-19 12:52 AM] jl777c#5810
deposit KMD, then issue stablecoins up to max of 80%.
these coins can then be used for anything and are not restricted in any way, and anybody can issue them
the special function of the stablecoins in addition to being pegged to EUR is that they are needed to liquidate delinquent accounts. this is a 5% per instance revenue source.


[15-Dec-19 12:53 AM] jl777c#5810
ultimately, any system that pays interest, needs to get the coins from somewhere. All the komodo pegged coins are 100%+ backed, so we cant just create it out of thin air. the 5% liquidation gains come from the accounts that have less than 10% equity left


[15-Dec-19 12:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so the risk takers are subsidizing the ones that didnt take as much risk. in exchange they had proportionally more stablecoins they could use in turn to liquidate other accounts, or spend, or trade


[15-Dec-19 12:55 AM] jl777c#5810
many have complained that KMD lacked liquidity. once we have EURK, there is a much much larger amount of liquidity that can be tapped into. and it doesnt require selling on the open market


[15-Dec-19 12:56 AM] jl777c#5810
does a coin having the ability to convert itself into stable form on demand, have extra value?


[15-Dec-19 12:57 AM] jl777c#5810
in my mind it does, especially as the friction of charging interest is eliminated. i think in some cultures, anything that is charging interest is not allowed. and generally speaking having to pay interest is not a good thing and leads to all sorts of bad outcomes


[15-Dec-19 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
so in the spirit of increasing freedom and interest, the komodo pegged and backed stablecoins are not charging interest


[15-Dec-19 02:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Maybe another way to think about it, is that it is a way to margin trade KMD. When you do that typically you need to borrow coins and pay interest. I have not been able to find any coins that you can borrow at 5% a year.


[15-Dec-19 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810
since it is a useful feature and unique to my knowledge, i am sure effective marketing can be done for it.


[15-Dec-19 02:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont compete against the other crypto deposits that pay interest so it can be loaned out at higher rates


[15-Dec-19 02:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and it might be much more useful to existing community members, but the way i see it, that just makes it easier to get new people into the community

So if hypothetically speaking I put 1000‚Ç¨ in KMD (let's say = 2000KMD) then I borrow EURK 700 and I use them, in the meantime KMD goes up 5x I put back 700 EURK and i get back 2000kmd valued at 5000‚Ç¨ but if it goes down I will get liquidated when a threshold gets reached and I get liquidated by another user who buys my locked KMD for a price determined how? Where is the documentation?

I think I understand the mechanism of the kmd-stable coin. Are there any special steps when initially creating a stable coin chain in order to get the market moving? Let's say I create k-pickle. It tracks the price of pickles. I lock $1000 kmd and receive $800 k-pickle. I'm the only person with K-pickle. Kmd looses value and the account is at less then 80% backed. At this point, are my kmd indefinitely locked as there is no market and I got k-pickled?


[15-Dec-19 08:02 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª  somebody could liquidate the kmd backing the kpickle at that point


[15-Dec-19 08:05 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
If no one else had kpickle it would be stuck


[15-Dec-19 08:06 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
So in a thin market, it will just be locked until someone liquidates it. Also maybe this situation won't happen as there is a cost associated with chain creation, as why would anyone want to spend money for a stable coin they really can't use.


[15-Dec-19 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
probably not a good idea to run a stablechain on a whim, it takes commitment and also need a federated set of signers that can be collectively trusted not to collude. in case one goes rogue, or more likely unresponsive, then the funds can be moved to a new msig address based on a new set of signers, but this process is not implemented yet


[15-Dec-19 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
the nightmare scenario is if the backing drops so fast in a day, that the liquidation cant keep up and it never rises above that price. in that case, the stablecoin value should be prorated to whatever the amount backing it is. though with tether, it doesnt seem to matter so much the amount that is backing it


[15-Dec-19 08:23 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
In regards to artik123 comments about the 5% kmd rewards going to the signers, to me it doesn't seem to far a stretch that eventually we will see competing stable coin chains. EURK+ pays 1% back and signers keep 4% type of thing.


[15-Dec-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing prevents this. our reference version wont be doing that, but any coin can be used for backing (bitcoin protocol) and if using KMD, the msig signers are free to use it however they want, including rebates


[15-Dec-19 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a full matrix of possible stablecoins as the backing coin is independent from what is being pegged


[15-Dec-19 10:17 AM] hastrup#8742
in case one goes rogue, or more likely unresponsive, then the funds can be moved to a new msig address based on a new set of signers.......thx for the answer.

This might be of interest xdaichain.com ,  some crucial differences but is a close analogue .  Pretty good idea they have ,  stablecoin based version of Eth .  Their format may be a good candidate for the dual daemon approach that jl777 wrote about a little while back.


[15-Dec-19 01:08 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Where the one coin is a stablecoin and the other chain which gets burned on to is the dual daemon ( could be Eth , cosmos , NEO whatever clone ).  This makes any crypto tech stack  priced in fiat .


[15-Dec-19 04:14 PM] J-Dog#9487
Here is a good image, of a similar type of system, to what JL is talking about. Maybe seeing an image of the overall process, will help some people process it. Alchemint is a NEO project that issues SDUSD stablecoin, as collateral for NEO. You can be liquidated, or be the one that liquidates someone else. Like I said, I'm not trying to compare the specifics. Just posting so some can use this to visualize the process.

I was encouraged to come here by @Slyris. Sorry if this has already been asked, but why pick DPoW over a token when a token on Ethereum represents a much more decentralized, and arguably more secure, solution? You can already pay gas fees in tokens via work on gas stations. My only other thought is the speed offered by a native chain, but of course you can always pick an Ethereum altchain/sidechain, although I admit that reduces security.


[19-Dec-19 02:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`a token on Ethereum represents a much more decentralized...solution`
By what metric is it true that being tied to the codebase of a parent chain is more decentralized than creating your own chain that does whatever you want it to do and follows whatever rules you want?


[19-Dec-19 02:52 AM] jl777c#5810
if you like paying $5 per transaction and can ignore being 100% at the mercy of the underlying chain, then certainly, just use ERC20


[19-Dec-19 02:52 AM] Kayaba#5184
@ComputerGenie I was referring to Ethereum nodes compared to Komodo... what's the term?


[19-Dec-19 02:53 AM] Kayaba#5184
Notary


[19-Dec-19 02:53 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there are tricks that automatically convert your ERC20 token into ETH to pay for gas, but still you are paying 100x to 10000x the cost per transaction.


[19-Dec-19 02:53 AM] Kayaba#5184
So transaction fees and the fact you have your own codebase.


[19-Dec-19 02:53 AM] jl777c#5810
also, this is not dPoS it is dPoW on top of PoW


[19-Dec-19 02:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the consensus is fully decentralized, dPoW submits proposed notarizations and each node verifies if it is valid or not.


[19-Dec-19 02:55 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`I was referring to Ethereum nodes compared to Komodo... what's the term? Notary`
Notary nodes validate your chain by your rules and create the equivalent of a live checkpoints
They don't control your chain in any way that you don't agree with


[19-Dec-19 02:55 AM] Kayaba#5184
I'm not calling dPoW centralized. I'm saying Ethereum has more nodes participating (unless Komodo nodes have increased by a massive count).


[19-Dec-19 02:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i heard ETH was proposing using decentralized checkpoints


[19-Dec-19 02:55 AM] Kayaba#5184
@ComputerGenie I understand how checkpoints work.


[19-Dec-19 02:55 AM] jl777c#5810
how many full nodes does ETH have now?


[19-Dec-19 02:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i would imagine KMD has more


[19-Dec-19 02:56 AM] Kayaba#5184
7106


[19-Dec-19 02:56 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it is comparable


[19-Dec-19 02:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
more nodes participating does not always mean more people

Closer than I thought


[19-Dec-19 02:57 AM] Kayaba#5184
And then just to double check, dPoW costs money as it's a service, right?


[19-Dec-19 02:58 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[19-Dec-19 02:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you are not cost sensitive, then just use ERC20, how much can $5 per tx add up to anyway


[19-Dec-19 02:58 AM] Kayaba#5184
So an independent chain saves the 70 cent ERC20 transfer, plus an extra dollar or so for a gas station, yet charges the developers more.


[19-Dec-19 02:59 AM] Kayaba#5184
$5 is really out of touch with the current state of Ethereum.


[19-Dec-19 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
until the costs do go up again, unpredictably


[19-Dec-19 02:59 AM] Kayaba#5184
That is fair, so my question becomes how are DPoW costs calculated?


[19-Dec-19 02:59 AM] Kayaba#5184
If it's in BTC, there's the exact same issue.


[19-Dec-19 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
why?


[19-Dec-19 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the BTC costs are not passed through


[19-Dec-19 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD absorbs the BTC costs, regardless of BTC price


[19-Dec-19 03:00 AM] Kayaba#5184
I didn't meant the cost to run DPoW; I meant the cost to use it


[19-Dec-19 03:00 AM] Kayaba#5184
That's good to hear. So what is the pricing model?


[19-Dec-19 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont have the exact pricing, you need to contact the service provider for that, but it is a fixed cost model


[19-Dec-19 03:01 AM] Kayaba#5184
Eh. I can probably google it. No need to ask üôÇ


[19-Dec-19 03:01 AM] Kayaba#5184
Thanks for the info on that


[19-Dec-19 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
i think if you expect to do more than 10 transactions per day, that is around the breakeven point. if less than 10 tx per day, then just use ERC20


[19-Dec-19 03:01 AM] SHossain#0007
i don't think you will get the price by googling it


[19-Dec-19 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
dPoW only makes sense for projects that create coins that will be used


[19-Dec-19 03:02 AM] Kayaba#5184
Of course if the coin achieves great usage, it's possible they won't need the additional security, although more security is better


[19-Dec-19 03:03 AM] jl777c#5810
100 tx per day is less than 1 tx every 10 blocks, not exactly great amount of usage


[19-Dec-19 03:03 AM] jl777c#5810
yet, already the cost is approx 10x higher for the ERC20


[19-Dec-19 03:05 AM] Kayaba#5184
Alrighty. Then if you have some time, I'm also curious your stance on PoS for speed, for security, and for distribution.


[19-Dec-19 03:05 AM] Kayaba#5184
But I did already ask a question


[19-Dec-19 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
PoS is not as good as PoW


[19-Dec-19 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is more energy efficient


[19-Dec-19 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
speed wise, you can get basically the same speed with PoW or PoS


[19-Dec-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
distribution is much better with PoW as with PoS, distribution basically stops


[19-Dec-19 03:07 AM] Kayaba#5184
My main interest with speed is a vote system, not a mining system. I agree PoW mining is as fast as PoS staking to generate blocks.


[19-Dec-19 03:08 AM] Kayaba#5184
Happy to hear you say that about security/distribution though.


[19-Dec-19 03:08 AM] jl777c#5810
security... well that will start an endless debate. lets just say that there are much fewer attack vectors against PoW and with dPoW i feel there is not much exposure, just some miners can get higher ROI with on/off mining


[19-Dec-19 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810
with PoW a chain that isnt the highest hashrate for that algo, or sometimes even if it is, can be nicehashed


[19-Dec-19 03:09 AM] Kayaba#5184
I think most people argue PoS stops massive accumulation in an instant, but it does amplify existing whales.


[19-Dec-19 03:09 AM] Kayaba#5184
I will concede I see much fewer PoS chains reorged


[19-Dec-19 03:10 AM] jl777c#5810
so the 51% becomes very real. with dPoW and using dpowconfs, we dont know of any way to conduct a 51% attack, and after the notarization, it becomes immutable


[19-Dec-19 03:11 AM] jl777c#5810
a big buy wall on an exchange allows for massive accumulation independent of PoW or PoS, also a lot of PoS devolves to PoW


[19-Dec-19 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
PoW is just a much simpler way and i wouldnt be surprised to read about some news that a major PoS chain is successfully attacked someday. i also wouldnt be surprised if i dont see that news, so it is not a certain thing, just a possibility


[19-Dec-19 03:12 AM] Kayaba#5184
Yeah. It's a lot harder to track especially when the whales/services who would notice generally have a noticeable stake to protect.


[19-Dec-19 03:13 AM] jl777c#5810
just understanding how stake grinding is possible with some PoS algos, it is quite complex


[19-Dec-19 03:13 AM] Kayaba#5184
My personal work is on hybridization of the two so I was curious your overall thoughts.


[19-Dec-19 03:13 AM] Kayaba#5184
It's always possible :/ Every single PoS algo has had a stake grinding vuln


[19-Dec-19 03:14 AM] Kayaba#5184
As soon as they say it's fixed, another one pops up. PIVX said they've known about the most recent one for months and will fix it in half an year :/


[19-Dec-19 03:14 AM] jl777c#5810
and impossible to prove a negative, so we just need to hope that there is no exploit


[19-Dec-19 03:14 AM] Kayaba#5184
It's almost like whales don't care to fix bugs benefitting whales


[19-Dec-19 03:14 AM] Kayaba#5184
Though I think they said that about half an year agoso it may be fixed soon


[19-Dec-19 03:14 AM] jl777c#5810
with PoW, there is none of that, just the 51%, which dPoW solves


[19-Dec-19 03:15 AM] Kayaba#5184
What about PoS voting though?


[19-Dec-19 03:15 AM] jl777c#5810
original peercoin staking algo was just very prone to stake grinding, so the evolution of it... carries on the tradition


[19-Dec-19 03:15 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD uses PoS voting to elect notary nodes


[19-Dec-19 03:15 AM] Kayaba#5184
That's generally the system looked at for speed since it doesn't require batching into blocks and there's no difficulty algorithm delaying the block artifically


[19-Dec-19 03:15 AM] Kayaba#5184

Hi @artik123 yes you are correct.  The FSM module may fulfill a bunch of those experimental 20-something devs. I‚Äôve been following the cosmos/tendermint stuff for 6 months and more recently polkadot/substrate.

I have found a few projects that not only issue erc20 for initial distribution, but then use the eth networks (test & main) as the building blocks for their own customizations before moving onto the cosmos & substrate.

There was a community developer that was integrating the embeddable javascript runtime *duktape* but he has since disappeared.  A similarly built python module would be possible, same with go.  These both can call C/C++ from within their environments.

I‚Äôd hazard a guess a rust / substrate CC bridge would also be possible or go/cosmos-sdk.  These would not be kmd core dev projects but some collaboration of solution builders no doubt within the next few years.

@artik123  I think a good assumption is that many solidity programmers have a background in other languages.  The idea being that if they start with what they know to be ‚Äúprogramming smart contracts‚Äù  from their prior experience with Eth eventually they will dig deeper and wish to expand functionality via CC in their primary languages.  In the meanwhile we have access to Eth based functionality in our ecosystem directly .  The hard part is getting them(developers)  here and learning a new way of doing things.  I do agree other stuff needs done  like transition tools (wrappers and libraries and stuff ) as well.


[21-Dec-19 10:08 PM] TonyL#3577
CC modules don‚Äôt have much common with solidity smart contracts (CCs aren‚Äôt smartcontracts)


[21-Dec-19 10:11 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I understand that.  It‚Äôs more about just getting them exposed to how we do things than recruit them at this stage.


[21-Dec-19 10:15 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
What I‚Äôm getting at is that even if we had the perfect set of tools ready for developers to develop , we need get them here first.   Eth chain as ‚Äúbait‚Äù is one idea I‚Äôm open to all others

the entire komodod is in C++ and whatever CC module will need to interface to its internals


[21-Dec-19 10:18 PM] jl777c#5810
a CC in C++ automatically does this, just call the function directly


[21-Dec-19 10:20 PM] jl777c#5810
for languages that can call C++ functions, nothing prevents a glue layer that allows this to happen, but it seems like an extra layer with no functional advantage, just allows a different language to be used. maybe it is possible to do in a secure way, and certainly we are open for this to happen. nothing prevents this


[21-Dec-19 10:22 PM] jl777c#5810
every single internal function that is wanted to be used will need a glue function, but i dont see why it wouldnt work for a compiled language that is able to call C++ function, like rust, go


[21-Dec-19 10:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i fully support such an effort, though i wont be able to directly help as i am mostly a C coder with a bit of C++

is it possible on KMD to have related chains (special tx between those hains, e.g. easy atomic swap)


[26-Dec-19 10:40 PM] passcombo.com üè¥‚ò†üçã#0622
for example there could be 1 normal chain, and the other one that depends on it in a way that initially coins are created by sending coins to special addr from the Chain1 (C1). Thereafter C2 could also create its coins by minting only. This way C1 and C2 would be separate blockchain with quit diff specifics but also interesting relation when C2 is createn auto when C1 is "destroyed" and also C1 is created auto when C2 is destroyed.

Hi jl777

How can a kmd smart chain be made so that any services on the network, be paid to the miners?  Like how Verus Id payments work?

Inputs go to coinbase vout?

Is this possible now, or will some kind of ‚Äúpayment routing‚Äù be possible?


[27-Dec-19 04:43 PM] Alright#0419
@Mylo THC chain does it via payments CC


[27-Dec-19 04:44 PM] Alright#0419
pays rewards CC in cb


[27-Dec-19 04:44 PM] Alright#0419
payments CC can be adapted to pay basically anything


[27-Dec-19 04:44 PM] Alright#0419
oh sorry, have that the wrong way around, never mind


[27-Dec-19 04:45 PM] Alright#0419
if you want to make a tx fee go to miners for a CC tx, can force a tx fee via consensus rules


[27-Dec-19 04:57 PM] Mylo#8306
Ok thanks, that‚Äôs a good enough example for me for the moment cheers @Alright


[27-Dec-19 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
I don't think that's what you were asking for, misunderstood when I read it initially


[27-Dec-19 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
don't know details on verus id stuff, but if it's paying miners a static fee, it's pretty simple to code that into consensus rules of a CC


[27-Dec-19 04:58 PM] Mylo#8306
But if CC can be called from another CC, it‚Äôs doable with some mods


[27-Dec-19 04:58 PM] Mylo#8306
Yep


[27-Dec-19 04:58 PM] Alright#0419

Seems like I've been missing a big conversation.

The above summary of your though has some good ideas worth implementing, imo, @artik123 .

With the goal of having your ideas provide true benefit I have a question.

I'm curious, what are you going to contribute (**do**) to start putting these ideas into practice?

---
Here is an example of what I mean:

I also would like to see more people build on the modules.  I recognize that for many devs this can may take more resources and skills they have at the moment.

As steps towards having more people start building on the platform I have been actively approaching both projects that have the resources and devs that have the motivation to start working on this.  There have been enough minor successes to continue down this path.

Also, I have found that actively participating in testing and using the various tools has given me the chance to see some of my (small) suggestions implemented.

My technical skills are very low, but even so I have found many areas where I am able to **do** things that contribute towards seeing my ideas becoming reality.
---

I'm not suggesting that this is the path you should take.  Just giving an example of **do**ing what my current skills and situation allow to see my ideas bring concrete results.

With your technical skills I imagine that your contributions would bring everyone great benefit, as your ideas are realized.


[28-Dec-19 06:48 PM] CrisF#3405

[28-Dec-19 07:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Understand, and remember seeing you as a NN.
Would like to see `how, who, what, etc`. Not expecting big ideas like that to be done by one person.
Yes, business dev is not just ideas and thoughts though.  It's also putting them into action by making a concrete plan, implementing those plans, etc.
I'm very curious on your ideas on implementation and am willing to put some time into  this.

[28-Dec-19 09:54 PM] jl777c#5810
you put words into my mouth, as we do not want to have 100s of CC core devs, we want to make the reference implementations and show what is possible.


[28-Dec-19 09:55 PM] jl777c#5810
also there is nothing that prevents a solidity CC, other than the relatively large amount of work it would take


[28-Dec-19 09:55 PM] jl777c#5810
and i have nothing against such middleware


[28-Dec-19 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
also, i will repeat that the marketing guys are working on getting consulting companies up to speed along with our training docs so that projects can hire a CC dev when they need one. realistically a funded project will need a spectrum of resources, including a CC dev (relatively small amount of work), GUI dev (more work), systems, etc. so i dont think the problem is the funded projects


[28-Dec-19 10:01 PM] Mylo#8306
this is the key, _a funded company_ that is producing a new service.   they'll be looking to implement some customization.  this funded company / start up will have maybe one or two coders that know what they are doing, will need to get up to speed or get assistance.

it's the same model parity uses with substrate.  it's all a timing (when ICO was) & budget (bear market) related thing.  all the pieces are in place, are still being built etc.

another 6-12 months, plenty more tech to build on & a flagship GUI trading network (atomicdex api) with the flagship security application (dpow) which offers an IoT solution with nSPV.


[28-Dec-19 10:01 PM] CrisF#3405
Yes, it is clear that steps are being taken to this end.  
The amount of docs and resources for developers and users have exploded over the last year!
Been doing what I can and am glad to find other things that I can do to maximize my usefulness.

what exactly is the DEX nSPV stuff in jl777/komodo DEX tree?
it looks like it's fetching quotes - is it peg related or  atomicdex related or both?

realtime decentralized orderbook


[30-Dec-19 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
actually the quotes are datablobs, so it is low level. another layer can interpret the datablobs however it wants, eg. for orderbooks, for anything else that needs a realtime RAM synced set of datablobs across nodes


[30-Dec-19 09:42 PM] Mylo#8306
size limits on data blobs?


[30-Dec-19 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
for now 1kb, but i will be making it arbitrary length soon.


[30-Dec-19 09:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it will be RAM limited and expire data after about an hour, though this can be changed with a #define change


[30-Dec-19 09:44 PM] jl777c#5810
not 100% guaranteed consensus, but most of the time most of the nodes will get most of the datablobs within a couple seconds

as to how long it will take to integrate, that is not for me to say. it also depends on how the next scaling test performs. we need to do some internal scaling tests first, so it is more a step by step thing than a calendar precise process

The ‚Äúseveral hundred node scaling test‚Äù in recent commit log, is this automated already from previous tests?

I was reading up on scaling containers, patchkez NN did a lot of the container stuff in the 2018 transaction scaletest.  I reckon 10s of thousands could be orchestrated seeing as mm2 & nspv are much more resource friendly than komodod & a miner.


[31-Dec-19 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, thousands of nodes could be spun up, virtually no resources are used by the DEX p2p code


[31-Dec-19 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
for now, i just create random bytes as the "quotes"


[31-Dec-19 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and do it in an infinite while true bash script


[31-Dec-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810

[31-Dec-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
run that on all nodes and see if anything blows up, or if they get out of sync or use too much bandwidth


[31-Dec-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
latest version seems to be pretty stable, but i dont have any fancy algos internally, so it will bog down a bit when there are 50,000 new orders in an hour


[31-Dec-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
though it seems 50+ cores will be needed to generate that much traffic


[31-Dec-19 05:43 AM] Mylo#8306
Yep, containers horizontally scaled across node clusters can simulate a country‚Äôs worth of traders if need be I think.  I like this data blob layer you‚Äôve come up with btw & txpow.

I was also thinking, would a dictionary of numerical values or ticker symbols save on bandwidth in the long run?

If low rez orderbook resolution used a dictionary and encoding scheme (byte arrays or even bitwise) then for higher rez detail or liveliness used the short sign messages.

Or should I stick to scaling container reading rather than protocol ideas ?


[31-Dec-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the datablobs will be able to be of any size, so it would be up to a higher level layer to decide what info to propagate


[31-Dec-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
cant get much better than 1% extra bandwidth


[31-Dec-19 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so if it is data that all the fullnodes need to know, then it seems any higher level layers would create condensed views, summaries, etc. as a service on top of the raw datablobs


[31-Dec-19 05:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so the maker mm2 nodes would run a DEX p2p node and then all these nodes are 99% in sync 99% of the time, which is sufficient for orderbook purpose. actual ordermatch and swap would use the normal libtorrent and other tunneling type of mechanisms


[31-Dec-19 05:49 AM] jl777c#5810
phones would become a client to the next layer up from the raw datablobs


[31-Dec-19 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
in a highly connected network, the extra bandwidth is a lot higher


[31-Dec-19 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
for example if all nodes in an 11 node network have 8 or 9 connections, the efficiency is pretty bad... about 2x excess banwidth. but this is really only an issue for such small networks. for any normal sized network, having 8 peers is just fine and the extra bandwidth will come way down.


[31-Dec-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
the starting point is N times the bandwidth used, where N is the average number of peers, so 3x is actually not bad. i think i can tweak it a bit and get it below 2x, but really it seems ok as there is no overall bandwidth issue with so few nodes and speed of propagation is also desired

Ok re caretaker nodes thanks.

Now, I‚Äôve read more of the ticket but not all, I have a question about the p2p orderbook and the order matching as separate items.

1) from my understanding that the orderbook data structure is an array that can be used by front ends, is the orderbook data structure (essentially a look up directory) re-usable in other real-time P2P data applications that are not orderbooks.  Can this be put on the roadmap?

2) the ordermatching is two parties agreeing to execute ‚Äúsomething‚Äù.  In the Dex app, a trade.  However in another P2P app it could execute another something, eg signal to open a comms channel with other software like VoIP - is the execution some data structure/protocol  instruction, eg json ?

3) going back to orderbook network, can a node connect to specific caretaker nodes like with -addnode or -connect?  This question is more related to (2) for uses in other apps rather than trading, but maybe it‚Äôs already doable with nSPV in the coins.json file?


[31-Dec-19 10:02 PM] CrisF#3405
Would this have  have any use for a lightweight block explorer?
Something to ```circumvent the issue of having a single point of view (a single full node) to view the chain``` as mentioned in this article `https://medium.com/the-arcadia-media-group/building-lightweight-block-explorers-using-pokt-46baf668625e`?


[31-Dec-19 10:41 PM] jl777c#5810
1) there is no orderbook data structure. it is arbitrary data that is propagated to all nodes quickly, but with minimum wasted bandwidth. you can make it a general chat "room", where each datablob is a message. by adding qualifiers to it, you can create "channels". really, it can do whatever you can make arbitrary data do.

2) the datablob is a blob of data, its purpose can be anything. think of it as a global broadcast into RAM, for temporary things. of course, you can add logging to a node and make it permanent, but that is not its focus. the goal is a realtime feed that is 99.9% the same to 99.9% of the nodes 99.9% of the time, created by a fully decentralized p2p network


[31-Dec-19 10:44 PM] jl777c#5810
3) you can, but each DEX network will sync globally to all the data (for the past hour). i imagine there can be hundreds of different DEX networks, each with a different purpose


[31-Dec-19 10:47 PM] jl777c#5810
@CrisF if there is a node that has the data and is submitting it to the DEX network, then yes, but explorers are more for long term and this is designed for realtime. a realtime streaming would be more suited. at first i didnt worry about throughput so much, so it is limited to 20 tx/second sustained, but after i finished the optimizations, it should be able to handle 1000 tx/second or more

yes, some specific addnodes to get connections going is a good idea

in addition to addnode= in conf file, there is one `-addnode=` param in the chain start command

[01-Jan-20 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
once all the peers are connected to the network, the DEX_broadcast should cause a print in all nodes


[01-Jan-20 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
so each node has 60 peers?


[01-Jan-20 11:57 AM] SHossain#0007

so 32 nodes total?


[01-Jan-20 11:58 AM] SHossain#0007
in a single server, yes. on the other server, i didn't yet launch all chains


[01-Jan-20 11:58 AM] SHossain#0007
now, i'll have max 60

ok


[01-Jan-20 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
one idea is that after the network is up and running, restarting a single node with -maxconnections=8


[01-Jan-20 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
then make sure it starts up with 8 peers


[01-Jan-20 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
if that works, then iterate through the other peers. at some point it wont be able to get a full 8 peers, but maybe it can work to reduce the connectivity in this way


[01-Jan-20 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
but before doing that, lets make sure the DEX_broadcast works

DEXpurge.145 for t.xxx -> n.0


[01-Jan-20 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
that means for timeslot 145 at the unixtimestamp, it purged 0 packets


[01-Jan-20 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
this makes sense as you need to run 59 minutes before anything will be purged.


[01-Jan-20 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the rightmost part of L.8 A.1 coll.0 is the performance stats of the internal hashtable for recent requests. L is the number of lookups, A.1 is the number of additions to the hashtable and coll is the number of collisions


[01-Jan-20 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
each collision will likely create a bit of redundant data transmission, that is why this is being tracked. my results show about a 0.1% collision rate, which is small enough to not matter as the goal is less than 20% redundant packets


[01-Jan-20 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
now the middle part is what has the most important data


[01-Jan-20 12:05 PM] SHossain#0007
i guess the `total.x` is the  number of request


[01-Jan-20 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
total.1 is the total number of packets that are in the RAM (sum of all timeslots)


[01-Jan-20 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
the e59... is a combination of all the shorthashes (least 32 bits of actual hash XOR), given N packets, if it generates the same combination of shorthashes, odds are very good that the data is 100% in sync


[01-Jan-20 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
R.1 S.0 A.1 duplicates.0


[01-Jan-20 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
R.1 is the number of packets received


[01-Jan-20 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
S.0 is the number of packets sent


[01-Jan-20 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
A.1 is the number of packets added to the RAM. until purging starts, this should match the earlier total


[01-Jan-20 12:08 PM] SHossain#0007
yep. that's matching

and the duplicates.0 is the number of duplicate packets received. this is what needs to be below 20%. the higher the connectivity in a network, the higher the duplicates percentage will be

once we can verify that it can indeed handle 8192 tx/sec, then i can enable the txpow. for now a small number of nodes can simulate 100000x the nodes when txpow is active

well, maybe the leverage is only 10,000x

the difference in totals per second will show this, when purging starts the n.xxx will show how many that timeslot (second) had


[01-Jan-20 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
about 300 per second from one node


[01-Jan-20 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
hopefully it scales linearly. start running the blaster on more nodes


[01-Jan-20 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
make sure after each 5 or so, what the tx/sec is


[01-Jan-20 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
things go by so fast, until all the blasters are stopped you cant verify the checksum is the same on all nodes, but you can see the totals are increasing approx the same on all nodes

i've to manually copy the script and start blasting. will take some time. but will do it

with 5 blaster CPU usage at 25% on the 56 thread server and about 10GB RAM usage

25% of all CPU is already in use? or 25% of one of the 56 cores

oh, latest version is much less bandwidth usage too


[01-Jan-20 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
you should check the bandwidth usage

which app you used to check bandwidth usage?

bmon


[01-Jan-20 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
but there are many ways


[01-Jan-20 12:34 PM] SHossain#0007
i want to check with the 5 blaster now and can start the next 5 (scripts are ready for that)


[01-Jan-20 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe all bandwidth for all the nodes are combined, so need to divide by number of nodes


[01-Jan-20 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
depends on what the bmon is counting, actual hardware bandwidth


[01-Jan-20 12:36 PM] SHossain#0007
both hardware is not being used for anything else except for this test now

[02-Jan-20 01:56 AM] jl777c#5810
by finding the nodes with just one connection and addnode of a random other node, you can gradually get the network more decentralized


[02-Jan-20 01:57 AM] jl777c#5810
the DEX algo should work with any topology though, the performance details will change based on the specific topology


[02-Jan-20 01:57 AM] SHossain#0007
let me try that.

I'm doing 50 + 30 chains on 2 servers


[02-Jan-20 02:00 AM] SHossain#0007
it should use 1 chain per CPU and leave a bit of headroom


[02-Jan-20 02:00 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[02-Jan-20 02:05 AM] SHossain#0007
could `connections 1` mean that one server is just connecting to another server? because there are only 2 servers available


[02-Jan-20 02:05 AM] SHossain#0007
how do i connect daemons within same server?


[02-Jan-20 02:06 AM] jl777c#5810

[02-Jan-20 02:06 AM] jl777c#5810
need to find out which port a daemon bound to


[02-Jan-20 02:06 AM] jl777c#5810
the port will be different from default p2p port


[02-Jan-20 02:13 AM] SHossain#0007
tried a specific port `32165` where the daemon is connected to another peer with that port. but, connection was refused


[02-Jan-20 02:14 AM] jl777c#5810
try getting a single datadir node able to be connected to. maybe a bind with a specific port and then use that specific port for other nodes to addnode ip:port to?


[02-Jan-20 02:14 AM] jl777c#5810
once you can get it working with one node, then apply to rest


[02-Jan-20 02:15 AM] jl777c#5810
however, for now, might as well run the test and we can see how it works on a dual hub and spoke model

yes, overloading the hub nodes so lag is too high, but it is a good test


[02-Jan-20 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810
only one node doing that is a decent performance


[02-Jan-20 02:25 AM] SHossain#0007
on this overloaded node, terminal is flooded with this and i can't see normal prints


[02-Jan-20 02:26 AM] jl777c#5810
if a node cant keep up, it cant keep up


[02-Jan-20 02:26 AM] jl777c#5810
like UDP

stopped blasting and reject packets messages still being flooded, jfyi


[02-Jan-20 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i added lag stats, seeing average of 1 second lag on the highly connected node an 1.5 to 2 seconds lag on the other nodes


[02-Jan-20 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
the actual packets are sent by tcp, so they will eventually arrive, regardless of how delayed it is. i guess i should use UDP as underlying transmission, but i am just piggybacking on top of the bitcoin peer code


[02-Jan-20 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810

my guess is your avelag is much worse due to the hub bottleneck

but it is good to see how bad it is

i guess using single daemon instance on a single VPS/server/VM might yield better result


[02-Jan-20 03:18 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, you need to crossconnect


[02-Jan-20 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
try to do a bind to a specific port and then addnode to it


[02-Jan-20 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe google can find answer to how datadir node can work


[02-Jan-20 03:22 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. i'll look into that and try to find out


[02-Jan-20 03:23 AM] jl777c#5810
another useful info is how many blaster scripts can you run at the same time, before it doesnt add anymore tx/sec


[02-Jan-20 03:27 AM] SHossain#0007
i guess if we get the networking part fixed first, then we can get more accurate stats


[02-Jan-20 03:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but running on the hub node N different blasters will be good to know if we can get more than 1000 tx per node


[02-Jan-20 03:32 AM] SHossain#0007
ah...got it. you want multiple script on same hub node and not on the spoke one


[02-Jan-20 03:32 AM] SHossain#0007
let me try that now

now the limit is the codes #define


[02-Jan-20 03:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so now we know alien servers can generate these tx


[02-Jan-20 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
next step is to fiddle with the datadir nodes to get it cross connected

cant' see them anymore. so, recorded on phone and tried to extract data

hopefully it will stabilize


[02-Jan-20 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
probably dont want to do more than 7000/sec for now. we can boost the limit to 16k/sec, but there is no point until we can make a network that can keep up


[02-Jan-20 03:58 AM] SHossain#0007
dropping blasters one by one


[02-Jan-20 04:03 AM] SHossain#0007

73000+ tx in 10 seconds


[02-Jan-20 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
based on the design, if there is a reasonably connected p2p network with 3+ connections per node and where each node can handle the bandwidth, all nodes should be able to keep up with this as the processing of the packets is very optimized. average lag is about 2 seconds on my small network, even during the sustained blasting. but i am just getting 1500 tx/sec.


[02-Jan-20 04:17 AM] jl777c#5810
have the duplicate tx down to 0.1%

That  sounds good.  What is the next goal from here?


[02-Jan-20 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to test on a bigger more normal network to make sure it can indeed maintain the performance metrics i am seeing on my controlled testnet


[02-Jan-20 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i also need to add an api to this, so dapps can be written to use this decentralized transport layer


[02-Jan-20 04:55 AM] CrisF#3405
If there's anything I am able to help with just let me know.  Sending a txBlast in the early scaling test was one great memories I have of testing things, haha.

anybody can setup a p2p network with 2 or more nodes

@SHossain what about a small 2 node network? i wonder if it will be able to stay in sync with 7k tx/sec


[02-Jan-20 09:51 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, the last test with 8k txs/s was with a 2 node network only


[02-Jan-20 09:51 AM] SHossain#0007
but, the 2nd node went out of sync or gave up after a while


[02-Jan-20 09:53 AM] SHossain#0007
the 2nd node was only showing a last line similar to previous during the full test


[02-Jan-20 09:53 AM] SHossain#0007
meaning, it was just keep repeating old lines instead of showing new data


[02-Jan-20 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, then slowly ramp up the blasting on the 2 node network


[02-Jan-20 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
see how fast it is before it loses sync


[02-Jan-20 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
my 11 nodes are in sync at about 1400 to 1500 per second


[02-Jan-20 09:54 AM] kremer#0658
i can try to help w/ testing ifmore people are needed. my knowledge base is small but i've learned how to issue curl requests via cmd line to nspv the past day or so


[02-Jan-20 09:54 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. that sounds a good test. let me start


[02-Jan-20 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
for now there is just the DEX branch to build and run. and then get a network with all the nodes having decent connectivity. there is only one rpc call DEX_broadcast ffff


[02-Jan-20 09:56 AM] SHossain#0007
in the meantime i've compiled DEX branch in a 3rd node to use as seed node for future tests


[02-Jan-20 09:57 AM] SHossain#0007
this 3rd node is not an alien server. just a 4 core VPS with 16 GB RAM


[02-Jan-20 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
start with 2 node network, just 1 node blasting and see how fast it can go before sync is lost


[02-Jan-20 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
then add a 3rd node and see if it can handle the same speed


[02-Jan-20 09:58 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. on it. preparing the chain and blasters


[02-Jan-20 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
final test is having all three nodes blasting (to total about the same speed as single node blasting) to see if it can sync when 3 nodes blasting vs 1


[02-Jan-20 10:00 AM] SHossain#0007
how about if i start a blaster every minute? so, we get 1 minute to check for possible issues?


[02-Jan-20 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
ok


[02-Jan-20 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810

you can always restart if the prints bother you


[02-Jan-20 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
this data is just random bytes.


[02-Jan-20 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
and the system avoids the issue of what to do with the TB of data that thousands of tx/sec sustained will generate, by not storing it. for orderbook stats, it would be useful to log the data as it is being purged

[02-Jan-20 10:17 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[02-Jan-20 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the tcp pipe is filled with a lot of tx and once it falls behind, it is hard to catch up at these speeds and when you restart and reconnect, it will get flooded with older tx


[02-Jan-20 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess i can change it to just log the laggards and skip printing, the printing likely slows things down enough to lower its capacity


[02-Jan-20 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
i actually think the main issue is that it isnt coded yet to handle overlapped rpc calls, that is why i was surprised it worked. the core engine should be able to handle much more than 1k tx/sec

this data is from the node that you have dashboard access


[02-Jan-20 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, keep adding blasters in pairs, on both nodes and we can see if you can get past 10 blasters on each. it could be that it will handle 2x10 blasters better than just 10

one node has some lags, the other doesn't it seems

funny thing is, one node shows `R.0` and the other shows `S.0`


[02-Jan-20 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
both these nodes were restarted at the same time?


[02-Jan-20 10:38 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[02-Jan-20 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
something is not right


[02-Jan-20 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
only one node is blasting


[02-Jan-20 10:39 AM] SHossain#0007
let me reboot the servers


[02-Jan-20 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to start with a single manual DEX_broadcast ffff and make sure both nodes get it


[02-Jan-20 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
do it from each node


[02-Jan-20 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
once it is verified a single packet works, then start a blaster


[02-Jan-20 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
all the numbers need to make sense


[02-Jan-20 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be you have a firewall in one direction?


[02-Jan-20 10:54 AM] SHossain#0007
firewall is inactive on both nodes to allow uninterrupted connections


[02-Jan-20 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
some connectivity issue though, if you broadcast from one node it should have S.1 R.0 A.1


[02-Jan-20 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
the other node S.0 R.1 A.1


[02-Jan-20 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
hope that makes sense


[02-Jan-20 10:56 AM] SHossain#0007
started both daemon at the same time after fresh server reboot


[02-Jan-20 10:57 AM] SHossain#0007

also broadcast


[02-Jan-20 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, just run one blaster on each node and make sure that is stable


[02-Jan-20 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
i need to add support for parallel operations


[02-Jan-20 11:00 AM] SHossain#0007
i was wrong.


[02-Jan-20 11:00 AM] SHossain#0007
the first node still see total.1


[02-Jan-20 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, maybe try the total.2 node with the seed node


[02-Jan-20 11:02 AM] SHossain#0007
you mean to blast from total.2 node?


[02-Jan-20 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
you have three nodes?


[02-Jan-20 11:02 AM] SHossain#0007
2 running


[02-Jan-20 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
the two that you are using is having some problems


[02-Jan-20 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i suggest to swap out the one with problem with the third node


[02-Jan-20 11:03 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. doing that


[02-Jan-20 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
also it could be that a three node network will work better, as there are more connection routes


[02-Jan-20 11:08 AM] SHossain#0007
seems the 3rd node is working


[02-Jan-20 11:08 AM] SHossain#0007
the first node that had total.1, still has 1


[02-Jan-20 11:09 AM] SHossain#0007
while the 2nd node has total.4 and 3rd node has total.2


[02-Jan-20 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
seems that node has some problems then, better off with it offline


[02-Jan-20 11:09 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. turned off that node's daemon. yes, that was a problem node

ok, dont add any more blasters to that node. problem was the first node


[02-Jan-20 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so keep adding blasters to the second node and see how long it can keep in sync


[02-Jan-20 11:21 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, not exactly sure what was the issue. out of these 3 nodes, the first node is using Ubuntu 18.04 and other are at Ubuntu 16.04


[02-Jan-20 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be some system specific code issue, but i cant think of what would cause it, especially as you had no error prints. its like the packets in one direction just doesnt make it to the other side


[02-Jan-20 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be that we need to qualify specific nodes somehow, but i am running on some very old and slow nodes to achieve the 1400 tx/sec

ok, so you are up around 7k/sec and things are in sync?


[02-Jan-20 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the question is now if others can connect to this 2 node network and have it still be in sync, with their nodes as follower nodes


[02-Jan-20 11:26 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, both of them are in sync


[02-Jan-20 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
good. i had a feeling the core could handle the speed without any problems


[02-Jan-20 11:27 AM] SHossain#0007
if you look at the 2nd server's dashboard, you will see CPU usage is about 77%


[02-Jan-20 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
if others can add nodes to this 2 node network and stay in sync at this level, i can double the limit to 16k tx/sec


[02-Jan-20 11:27 AM] SHossain#0007

yes, i can keep it running. shall i continue blasting as well?


[02-Jan-20 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810

i dropped off few blaster scripts from 3rd node

@here anyone would like to join this blasting game of new tech, here ^^ are the steps. We will announce the next test date soon. If you are interested to join, please prepare your server or machine and wait for the announcement. This is a quite new tech from jl777 with a lot of possibilities including realtime decentralised orderbook. We already made some records on txs per second. With the next test we aim to do even better.

[02-Jan-20 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
can you stop the blasters for a bit


[02-Jan-20 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
and restart the daemons


[02-Jan-20 11:47 AM] SHossain#0007
ok.  on it


[02-Jan-20 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
let me know and when they are idle i will connect in and then we can see if my node can keep up if it joins the blast from the beginning


[02-Jan-20 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
7k tx/sec could just be too fast to catch up


[02-Jan-20 11:48 AM] SHossain#0007
sure. i just need to close all screen sessions and restart the chains

start them


[02-Jan-20 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i will connect and we can do a DEX_broadcast oneshot test to make sure all 3 nodes are happy


[02-Jan-20 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
they you can ramp up the blasters


[02-Jan-20 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
i see both nodes, send a DEX_broadcast


[02-Jan-20 11:59 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, saw your broadcast on both nodes


[02-Jan-20 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810

since we stopped it before it lagged over a minute, it was able to catch up, but 3k/sec seems too fast for my node

pkill screen?


[02-Jan-20 12:09 PM] SHossain#0007
ah....thanks. sorry, meant to ask detached sessions :abused:


[02-Jan-20 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe just launch the loop with & and can then pkill them all at once


[02-Jan-20 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
for now we will need to reduce to 5 blasters


[02-Jan-20 12:10 PM] SHossain#0007
i have `total.450207 d5a39eed` on blaster node and `total.100205 518c8a61` on 3rd node


[02-Jan-20 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, lets restart daemons to clear the stats

10 was a fail


[02-Jan-20 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810

now the difference between my nodes are less

yes, it appears to be that way. and, they stay in sync


[02-Jan-20 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe having the workload balanced allows things to stay in sync

probably there is some limit of handling incoming from a single peer. so if one node blasts too much, the other nodes start dropping packets


[02-Jan-20 12:24 PM] SHossain#0007
yes

surprisingly, both nodes has almost similar total number. not much difference


[02-Jan-20 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as sync wasnt lost, it should be very close to 100% the same packets on all nodes

[02-Jan-20 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
ok add another blaster

there is just no way to catch up when it is going at these rates


[02-Jan-20 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
but there is a way to start updating from when you join and after 59 minutes, it will be in sync


[02-Jan-20 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
this avoids having to sync up historical data so that keeps it simple and fast


[02-Jan-20 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess its like joining a broadcast in the middle, you dont bother to try to watch from the beginning while also watching the realtime. we assume the realtime is more important

[02-Jan-20 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
granted it is only three nodes, but more nodes should actually make it easier to sustain the high rates, as long as each node can handle the bandwidth


[02-Jan-20 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
so, next step is to do what we did with about 10 different nodes

[02-Jan-20 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
tomorrow i will add realtime joining, so hopefully a new node can jump in to a 5k/sec blast and get 100% of the packets


[02-Jan-20 01:07 PM] SHossain#0007
OVH also does that with faster speed i guess on some of their servers


[02-Jan-20 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, plz coordinate with server operators so we can verify performance across many different geolocations


[02-Jan-20 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
by this time tomorrow, i should have realtime joining working, that will make things much smoother as it wont be required to be coordinated when to join


[02-Jan-20 01:09 PM] jl777c#5810
a single "chain" could support many video broadcasts in parallel


[02-Jan-20 01:10 PM] SHossain#0007
cool. we can set a date for the next mass public test. i'll post in #üíéÔΩúnotarynode  #kmdlabs and maybe in #üì¢‚îÉannouncements channels for any interested participants with required knowledge to join


[02-Jan-20 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
and with realtime joining, basically you can have arbitrary number of such chains, each one being like a different channel you can tune into.


[02-Jan-20 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it really just needs a passive follower node


[02-Jan-20 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess being able to run a blaster would be good too, so that can be spread out across N nodes

every second


[02-Jan-20 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it purges from memory 59 minutes ago to make room for the next second


[02-Jan-20 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
this is what allows it to reuse the same memory in a circular buffer


[02-Jan-20 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
each second is actually an openhashtable, so there is a circular buffer of 3600 hashtables and in realtime it is switching from one to the next


[02-Jan-20 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
most all computations are in constant time


[02-Jan-20 01:16 PM] SHossain#0007
the numbers are matching on both nodes as they are being purged


[02-Jan-20 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
yes since 100% of the 9million are in sync, then each seconds data would also be in sync


[02-Jan-20 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
only searching the hashtables for packets is a linear search, but that is once per second to scan through 8192 spots. not a big amount of computing


[02-Jan-20 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
i estimate each 100 tx/sec will use up 1% of a core, though with this last test it was much better than that


[02-Jan-20 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, this is just the lowest level transport and it isnt doing anything with the data. any time needed for processing the data will be in addition, but do that in a different core and nothing slows down


[02-Jan-20 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
somehow it is stable doing overlapped rpc calls, and it has no locks internally

@SHossain check out portainer for a GUI to docker containers.  Very easy to manage.
I set up my dev web stuff moving away from easy engine in dev env for GUI mgmt (but keeping ee for prod)

Portainer doesn‚Äôt allow orchestration of so many nodes, so there is another foss product called rancher.  With rancher orchestration across node clusters holding containers will get the desired testing.

How to read `DEXRDO` prints:
```jl777cLast Wednesday at 8:02 PM
this print has 3 parts
DEXpurge.145 for t.xxx -> n.0
that means for timeslot 145 at the unixtimestamp, it purged 0 packets
this makes sense as you need to run 59 minutes before anything will be purged.the rightmost part of L.8 A.1 coll.0 is the performance stats of the internal hashtable for recent requests. L is the number of lookups, A.1 is the number of additions to the hashtable and coll is the number of collisions
each collision will likely create a bit of redundant data transmission, that is why this is being tracked. my results show about a 0.1% collision rate, which is small enough to not matter as the goal is less than 20% redundant packets
now the middle part is what has the most important data

total.1 is the total number of packets that are in the RAM (sum of all timeslots)
the e59... is a combination of all the shorthashes (least 32 bits of actual hash XOR), given N packets, if it generates the same combination of shorthashes, odds are very good that the data is 100% in sync
R.1 S.0 A.1 duplicates.0
R.1 is the number of packets received
S.0 is the number of packets sent
A.1 is the number of packets added to the RAM. until purging starts, this should match the earlier total```

i guess if shossain kills a blaster, another node can start one


[03-Jan-20 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
as you can see, sync is lost if things go too fast for a now, but the blasters keep going and the nodes that can keep up, stay in sync. graceful degradation is the aim


[03-Jan-20 03:19 AM] Paro#7842
oh ok


[03-Jan-20 03:19 AM] Paro#7842
Do you want me to open it under another assets-name and test it?


[03-Jan-20 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
realistically for an anybody can join network, 1k tx/sec is likely the limit to keep everybody 100% in sync, but there is no need to be 100% in sync


[03-Jan-20 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
@Paro you misunderstand. join this network and see if you can get the 8k tx.sec


[03-Jan-20 03:20 AM] Paro#7842
I'm getting it now.


[03-Jan-20 03:20 AM] CrisF#3405
yes, @Paro, you can join the network, but please don't blast until; jl777 tells you.


[03-Jan-20 03:21 AM] jl777c#5810
at about 10k tx/sec things will start to backlog and slow down


[03-Jan-20 03:21 AM] Paro#7842
ok


[03-Jan-20 03:21 AM] jl777c#5810

[03-Jan-20 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
you can calculate this just by subtracting the two most recent total.nnnn values as it is for 10 seconds worth

just a min. my internet dropped off


[03-Jan-20 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so no need to ask me about blast or not, if everyone is seeing the same amount of tx/sec, then add a blaster. if not, kill a blaster


[03-Jan-20 03:22 AM] SHossain#0007

[03-Jan-20 03:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i need to think about prioritizing packets, but that requires info about the data inside the datablobs


[03-Jan-20 03:34 AM] jl777c#5810
duplicate order is local hash collision, not any big deal

as long as you are seeing same numbers repeating on DEXpurge line, that means no more broadcast happening

@SHossain fyi,  just re-read the test above and see that the posts I made from my laptop node didn't go through.
Right at the end I sent a blast with my laptop through a vpn.
(Discord had some trouble at that time saying I was posting too fast :abusedsmily: )
The laptop was steady around 3k for a few minutes until I shut it down.
My connection here is really slow so figure that is very good.


[03-Jan-20 08:01 AM] SHossain#0007
don't worry. it was a helpful test today


[03-Jan-20 08:02 AM] SHossain#0007
but, i would go without VPN on the blasting node


[03-Jan-20 08:02 AM] CrisF#3405
Yeah, that was good.  Will be better at it now have some practice.


[03-Jan-20 08:02 AM] SHossain#0007

also a good idea to test with VPN üòõ

i added a handy tx/sec printout


[04-Jan-20 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
the epochs are every 5 minutes and it maps each peer it sees to a unique bit position


[04-Jan-20 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
max of 1024 peers per epoch


[04-Jan-20 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
this is to mitigate sybil attack, though still a determined attacker can fill up a lot of peer spots, so it isnt perfect, but it at least allows new peer sets every 5 minutes and allows for future attack mitigations


[04-Jan-20 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
most of what i added was actually parsing the hex string for the broadcast, but to make it more useful added tagA, tagB and destpubkey, which allows the future implementations of lookups instant


[04-Jan-20 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
still havent debugged that yet


[04-Jan-20 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
also added the concept of a priority for a tx, so the more important it is, the longer it takes to create


[04-Jan-20 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
with the priority, then nodes can prioritize which ones to route, which ones to ping about and combined with local "subscriptions" to tags, will allow for much better packet traffic control


[04-Jan-20 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
getting all this fully implemented and debugged will take more than 5 more days though. one step at a time, i need to fix a traffic congestion problem and then onto debugging the tags

these are not really transactions though


[04-Jan-20 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810

Ah, yes blob.


[04-Jan-20 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
probably not a good idea to send such large amounts, unless all nodes have very high speed connections, better to break it up into smaller amounts


[04-Jan-20 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
of course the packets/sec will be very different at 128 byte datablobs vs 4MB

[04-Jan-20 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
packets will be dropped in hopes that the node can stay caught up after dropping packets


[04-Jan-20 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is that there are types of data where it isnt a big deal (maybe annoying) and not going to lose funds even if all the data doesnt get to everyone all the time


[04-Jan-20 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
for such types of data, this is a good solution


[04-Jan-20 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if losing even a single packet is a disaster, them this is not the proper system to use, we have plenty of lossless blockchains

@jl777c could this new tech be used to make  CHIPS networking/communication more reliable?


[05-Jan-20 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it isnt a lossless protocol, but if a reliability layer is added on top of it, maybe it can. also there isnt a large amount of privacy with the dexp2p, so it would need to be carefully analyzed to see if point to point encryption will be sufficient


[05-Jan-20 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
i made a new release, it is hardforking


[05-Jan-20 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
now any chain with -dexp2p=2 (or 1) will activate the decentralized DEX p2p messages
txpow is active at a minimal level, tx/sec of blasters will likely be reduced by 10x to 50x
packet priority is supported. each priority level doubles the txpow needed, dont go much above 16 and for now priority is not affecting routing, so can just set it to 0
3 indices in parallel are maintained in realtime for all packets with tags (or destpubkey)
DEX_broadcast now will actually broadcast the hex specified and takes a lot more parameters
DEX_list is able to get a list of all the packets with matching tags
plz dont abuse the messaging side yet, it is not hardened and limited to just 64 different tags for now. also, it will likely crash after an hour if you are making DEX_list requests that needs to get a packet being purged


[05-Jan-20 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
destpubkey encryption and min/max amount filtering in DEX_list is not implemented yet, nor is minpriority filtering. DEX_stats and DEX_get is not implemented yet


[05-Jan-20 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
however, enough should be work to be able to broadcast a specific message with a specific tag and then see it in a list


[05-Jan-20 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810
for example if tagA is KMD and tagB is BTC, then the packet will be in the indices for "KMD", "BTC" and "KMD/BTC". that will allow future DEX_list for BTC to find this along with any other that had BTC as tagA or tagB. if you DEX_list with both KMD and BTC, only the ones that match the order will be returned. so to get an orderbook, you can do a DEX_list KMD BTC and a DEX_list BTC KMD and construct it. however, i plan to add convenient orderbook functions as each packet also has volumeA and volumeB fields that can be used to calculate a price


[05-Jan-20 03:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i was just able to get this to work in a few cases and havent had a chance to find and fix all bugs, but too tired now and will wait for bug reports based on the above functionality


[05-Jan-20 03:14 AM] looye29#2126
Can orrderbook be filled by multiple targets? E.g. Alice has 1000 KMD and Bob can only fill 500 KMD can Stanley  take the other 500 KMD?


[05-Jan-20 03:16 AM] looye29#2126
Now in explaining of Atomic DEX it talks only about Alice and Bob swap.


[05-Jan-20 03:25 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure that is already implemented


[05-Jan-20 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
dexp2p is for a decentralized and fast way to get orders to all nodes, it does not deal with using that data, that is up to the app


[05-Jan-20 03:27 AM] jl777c#5810
with the messaging layer it should make it quite easy to write dapps that want to deal with any sort of messaging that fits into the tagA/tagB, destpubkey, volumeA volumeB framework

what else could crash, the deamon is the only thing running


[05-Jan-20 07:09 AM] jl777c#5810
when i say "there are known problems after one hour" that means i know of things that can cause crashes after an hour, only crashes before one hour purges start are of interest until i fix the known bug


[05-Jan-20 07:13 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Well yeah but...didn't know if blaster caused daemon to overload or if it did it by itself....I understand


[05-Jan-20 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
daemon is designed to not overload


[05-Jan-20 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
well, if you start blasting 4MB packets, it would make nodes run out of memory


[05-Jan-20 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
but based on tx count, it will drop packets, to avoid overload


[05-Jan-20 07:51 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Yes it did do that without blaster running....which confused me....like its exchanging data without blaster...It did not "crash" but was running poorly at the suspected 1 hour mark "ish" was going to scientifically get correct data on my next tests.....computer only froze with blastee....70 MPH statements are not my forte

if you blast at a higher rate than the network can handle, PACKETS WILL BE DROPPED

Next test was/will be no blaster for 1 hour then backtrace


[05-Jan-20 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
and sync will be lost


[05-Jan-20 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are below the critical rate, then i am seeing very very few packets out of sync


[05-Jan-20 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
on the order of 1 in a millon


[05-Jan-20 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
you can check the summary hashes for the totals to see if it is in sync or not (when there are no new packets coming in)


[05-Jan-20 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
with the messaging level, it should be possible to packetize files, blast it and then reconstruct it and see if they are the same

@TonyL  @SHossain updated to a new hardforking version. this one is close to feature complete at the messaging layer. untagged packets (like from broadcast ffff) will get a general tag. i tested filtering by priority, and basic tracking based on tags, but there should be some bugs to find in complex cases. i didnt test the min/max amount filters, so that is a good one to test.

keep in mind that i expect things can crash after an hour, i need to add protection against that, so if it crashes after an hour, then just restart for now. i will work on that after i increase the 64 tags total limit.

please ask questions, the DEX_broadcast and DEX_list have quite a few parameters

my tests show that as long as you dont exceed the p2p network capacity (determined by the network topology and speed of nodes), then only about 1 in a million packets are out of sync


[06-Jan-20 12:21 AM] jl777c#5810
with low end nodes, we saw the limit at about 3000/sec


[06-Jan-20 12:22 AM] jl777c#5810
with higher end nodes, around 10000/sec


[06-Jan-20 12:22 AM] jl777c#5810
txpow is active now at a minimal level and it would take a lot of cores to reach 10,000/sec


[06-Jan-20 12:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont have priority based routing implemented yet, but the idea is that if the network is under spam attack, the nodes could detect this and increase the priority level they broadcast at. so without changing "consensus" limits, each client can increase the priority level until it sees all its packets arriving in the peer nodes


[06-Jan-20 12:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the one hour limit is a bit arbitrary and can be increased, but it doesnt seem like too much overhead for a GTC order to have to broadcast once per hour

you can use any chain now, but needs a -dexp2p=2 added to it, using my DEX branch

there is no blockchain, nothing to sync

though you can have normal blocks too, they dont affect the dexp2p and dexp2p doesnt affect blocks

[06-Jan-20 12:52 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe we should limit it to some specific `-ac_name`s only? Who knows what scary bugs might be inside of it and if all assetchains peers will accept it after code propagation means that everything can be stalled/crashed if bug is discovered

@TonyL yes, for ffff it is a special packet for blasters

seems they are in sync


[06-Jan-20 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it will send out 10 packets


[06-Jan-20 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the printout you see is the tag creation of "general"


[06-Jan-20 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it you send a normal packet with tagA of "general" before the ffff packet, it should be totally silent


[06-Jan-20 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
packets that are not ffff can be "an ascii string inside quotes" or a hexstring

i just updated (untested yet) using nServices bits to let other nodes know if dexp2p is supported, also made it so komodod -nSPV=1 nodes (superlite) will be able to do dexp2p messages. there are no nSPV remote access commands for dexp2p data (yet), but the plan is to add that and nodes with dexp2p=2 will be the fullnodes that respond to such requests, with dexp2p=1 nodes not responding

this is in effect a hardforking change from a few minutes ago


[06-Jan-20 01:24 AM] jl777c#5810
but now, we should be able to have dexp2p nodes on the same network as normal nodes and they wont interfere with each other

nice

also please try nSPV=1 nodes to make sure in superlite mode it works. i think that would be the preferable way as dexp2p nodes should be very lightweight

@TonyL @gcharang while dexp2p is designed specifically for DEX orderbooks it is done in a general way so that many other usecases are directly supported. tagA and tagB would be "base" and "rel" (or maker and taker) orders, which can also have a volA and volB field. this will allow the dexp2p to create an orderbook with volumes and price of tagA/tagB

the destpubkey is so you can send a DM to a specific address and even though it will be broadcast to all nodes, the data will be encrypted. with network analysis, the sender can be identified (the node who first broadcasts it) and the destpubkey is in plaintext, so the fact that a specific ip address is sending encrypted traffic to a specific pubkey can be determined. though, similar to GRIN it would take having a lot of monitoring nodes nearly fully connected to all the network to find the ip address, so it isnt anything that is easy to do, but then again not too difficult


[06-Jan-20 01:38 AM] jl777c#5810
if privacy of the sending ip is needed, do not use this for such comms


[06-Jan-20 01:38 AM] TonyL#3577
wow, so pubkey is for OTC inside the DEX network


[06-Jan-20 01:38 AM] jl777c#5810
in most cases other people knowing that an ip address (even if identified as you) is known to be sending messages to a brand new and never used anywhere else pubkey, it seems that is very little info leaked


[06-Jan-20 01:39 AM] jl777c#5810
you can implement a discord type of channel based public comms with DM using this, and by discord type, i mean tagA == name of discord, tagB == channel


[06-Jan-20 01:41 AM] jl777c#5810
so you can be connected to multiple dexp2p-discords, each with their own set of channels and send DM to specific pubkeys. you can publish your pubkey and even with monitoring of all traffic, it shouldnt leak that you send a DM, but of course if you link yourself to a pubkey, anything sent to you will be known you got messages, so to keep privacy, have 2 pubkeys. one that is public and linked to your handle, another (one for each other person) that is known only to you and the other person. this is exchanges in the public DM.


[06-Jan-20 01:42 AM] jl777c#5810
this way, you can get a persons secret pubkey and DM to that and nobody would know who the destination is. but as you can see, using this system for private comms will take a bit of extra work


[06-Jan-20 01:42 AM] jl777c#5810

why broadcasting node might set not max `priority` ?


[06-Jan-20 01:43 AM] jl777c#5810
each priority level increase, doubles the time to calculate the txPoW


[06-Jan-20 01:43 AM] jl777c#5810
priority of 10 is 1024 times harder to find that priority 0


[06-Jan-20 01:44 AM] TonyL#3577
so if I want more "prioritized" orders I need better server?


[06-Jan-20 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
and currently priority 0 is equivalent to an internal priority level of 12


[06-Jan-20 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
bigger is better


[06-Jan-20 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but unless the network is overloaded, all messages get through, other than the background loss of 1 in a million


[06-Jan-20 01:44 AM] TonyL#3577
is time for txPoW is const  and not depends of my CPU freq?


[06-Jan-20 01:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it is SHA256 hash with enough 0 bits


[06-Jan-20 01:45 AM] jl777c#5810
actually it starts with the lowest bits matching 0x777


[06-Jan-20 01:45 AM] jl777c#5810
then additional 0 bits on top


[06-Jan-20 01:45 AM] jl777c#5810
12 bits for 0x777 seems to take a few milliseconds


[06-Jan-20 01:46 AM] TonyL#3577
I see, so hardware matters just a little bit


[06-Jan-20 01:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont be noticeable even on a slow system


[06-Jan-20 01:46 AM] jl777c#5810
at a priority of 5, i think it will take about 1 second

[06-Jan-20 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is that if you dont see your orders appear in the orderbook (from a remote nSPV request) and there are indications that the network is lagging, then boost the priority. that will then give preference to your packets. [this routing preference is not implemented yet]

the idea is you do a DEX_list query with the id from the prior time

then it will return each packet just one time

so you can have a regular polling loop where you pass in the first id from the JSON from the last time (0 on the first time)


[06-Jan-20 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it should then return only the new packets (within the search parameters)

Ah, I see. For convenient caching


[06-Jan-20 02:17 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. this allows to make a layer on top of the messaging layer to apply whatever it needs to all incoming packets, and not have to fiddle with figuring out which packets are new


[06-Jan-20 02:18 AM] jl777c#5810
all coming at basically no overhead


[06-Jan-20 02:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if i disable the txpow, we should be able to get back to the 3000 to 10000/sec performance, even while doing all the messaging layer processing


[06-Jan-20 02:20 AM] jl777c#5810
once we get to feature complete, we will need to disable txpow to make sure we can still handle things at speed. this gives us the confidence that whatever number of nodes we had keeping up with the blasting, we can handle literally 4096 times the real world nodes. or even 128k times depending on where we set the min priority


[06-Jan-20 02:28 AM] jl777c#5810
basically whatever sustainable throughput we can get with a 1000 node p2p network without the txpow, we can get 4 million to 100 million nodes when txpow is active


[06-Jan-20 02:37 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL pushed a version that handles broadcast f, it will treat any odd length "hex" as an ascii
also put a limit to the packetsize at 1MB
and the priority level is automatically reduced by the size of the packet. anything less than 1kb is no change. after that, each time the packetsize doubles, the priority is reduced by 1. this will make generating valid packets for larger packets more and more expensive as not only is the diff increasing by the packetsize, the amount of data you need to hash is increasing too. for small sizes it wont matter, but for nodes trying to spam... they will bog down very fast

[06-Jan-20 05:46 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c can I call this data stored by a node in RAM as "data mempool" ?
is there a limit to the size of the "data mempool"?
when is a packet dropped from RAM of a node?
is it based on 1) time limit ? 2) size of total "data mempool"?


[06-Jan-20 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
after one hour data is deleted


[06-Jan-20 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
size is limited by memory of the nodes


[06-Jan-20 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i will need to add protection from data flooding that exceeds a nodes ram that is available, but with the txPoW being packet size dependent, it will take a fair amount of hashing to be able to conduct an attack. and i will make it so if memory is low, it just ignores new packets

@TonyL @gcharang automatic encryption and decryption is working. on startup if -pubkey=02.... is not set, it will create a temporary keypair. if it is set, it will derive it from the privkey for the -pubkey=
it will print the DEX_pubkey from the DEX_stats rpc call, it should start with 01 (which is an illegal secp256k1 pubkey) followed by a curve25519 pubkey. when sending a message to a destpub, use the 01.... pubkey (including the 01) and it will encrypt it automatically.

you will see that the data is all random hex. but if your node has the privkey for the destination pubkey, it will automatically decrypt it when you display it. it is not stored in decrypted form, this way all nodes have the same encrypted data and only the node that has the DEX_privkey for the matching DEX_pubkey can decrypt it. in case there is a match, there will be the decrypted value (the original hex/ascii)

when you do tagA and tagB, it creates tagA, tagB and tagA/tagB


[06-Jan-20 11:02 AM] jl777c#5810
this allows finding all orders with BTC involved, you will have to scan the list and filter out ones with BTC in tagB, that shouldnt be too much extra

5 in my command

it is the number of 0 bits above the baseline 0x777

when mining, you can get 20 0 bits, every million times


[06-Jan-20 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
so there will be a (binomial?) distribution of 0 bits more than the minimum required

above is a blaster loop. it seems you can launch more than one on a single node, but with current txpow it will saturate pretty fast. for max throughput change:
#define KOMODO_DEX_TXPOWBITS 12   -->
#define KOMODO_DEX_TXPOWBITS 1
at that setting, a single node can push out about 500 to 1000 per second

i added mutex to avoid the crashes after an hour, waiting for the one hour to pass to make sure it solves the issue. but an unexpected doubling in speed happened! usually when you add a mutex, the overhead slows things down. i was careful in where i put them to minimize the slowdown, but a doubling of speed was unexpected!  what that means is that without the mutex, there were a lot of hardware/system inefficiencies due to the overlapped access to the same memory by different threads. i still have txpow active, but it could be that we can achieve 20k/sec now without it

@jl777c for the command `DEX_broadcast hex priority` 
priority is 5
size of hex is 16.1KB

will the hash have 5 zero bits after 0x777 or 5 + 4 = 9 zero bits?

@gcharang it is missing params to launch  DEXP2P chain.


[07-Jan-20 04:50 AM] gcharang#6833
hmm, will add it
but the DEXP2P chain is only relevant to the current testing
the tech itself can be used on any smart chain


[07-Jan-20 04:51 AM] Mark81#4505
oh, you're right.


[07-Jan-20 04:51 AM] Mark81#4505

@jl777c Still wondering how it is prevented to not spam broadcasts? What prevents to create false data to network?


[07-Jan-20 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
what is one mans false data is another mans valuable data


[07-Jan-20 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
who is to say what is spam and what isnt


[07-Jan-20 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
you can create data at 0 priority and if the network has capacity, it will relay it. if not, it will drop it


[07-Jan-20 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if you want it to not be dropped you need to increase the priority and also the hashing cost


[07-Jan-20 05:39 AM] Mark81#4505
For DEX orderbooks it will be very valuable to have working messaging system and probably Atomic-API relies to that function.


[07-Jan-20 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
when the minimum txpow is a diff of 12, it will take 1 second per message


[07-Jan-20 05:40 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
ill  guess amountA and  B have  to  be an integer and what about  negative values?


[07-Jan-20 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
how exactly do you plan to spam the network then?


[07-Jan-20 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
amountA and B are floating point format. you can put in negative number, but it will be converted to unsigned (big number)


[07-Jan-20 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
it is meant to be the volume of what you are selling for what you want to buy. together it creates a price


[07-Jan-20 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
at one second per packet, it would take 10,000 cores to saturate the network


[07-Jan-20 05:43 AM] Mark81#4505
So messages are mined without actual blocks produced


[07-Jan-20 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
no blocks


[07-Jan-20 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
each message has txpow that is configurable


[07-Jan-20 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
so if the atomicDEX client notices the network is congested, it simply uses a higher priority


[07-Jan-20 05:44 AM] Mark81#4505
Clever!


[07-Jan-20 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
just going to priority 1 makes it now take 20,000 cores to saturate the network

got a -1 response


[07-Jan-20 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
lets make it priority of 4, that is the pain threshold of 16 seconds per message to send. but now it takes 160,000 cores to saturate

currently you can only sync to the realtime data stream


[07-Jan-20 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
with remote queries to fullnodes you can get the "historical" data (one hour)


[07-Jan-20 08:31 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
to  save  the  data  you would need  other  nodes  saving  data  from same  pubkey - eventually  seednodes will store history


[07-Jan-20 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
all the nodes that are online will have all the packets they processed


[07-Jan-20 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you restart your node... the data is gone

Hey jl777 (or poly or shossain or decker or CG or alright or others)

Id like to write an article for my upcoming kmd blog about the bitcore integration that is the final article in relation to btc tech.

1)Bitcore enables `addressindex`?

2) Does bitcore enable other features?

3) Is the insight explorer the only explorer that is usable on kmd to take advantage of these features directly from blockchain? (As opposed to explorers that read a mongodb)

4) When was bitcore stuff added to kmd codebase?

Bitcore & explorers is one of my lesser known technologies inside kmd, plz excuse any dumb assumptions


[08-Jan-20 01:02 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it has addressindex, spentindex and timestampindex


[08-Jan-20 01:02 AM] jl777c#5810
without addressindex, CC would not be performant, in fact many would not be feasible at all

insight is the only one i know, but with the addressindex and spentindex rpc it shouldnt be hard to create a GUI to display it. not sure if anybody has


[08-Jan-20 01:03 AM] jl777c#5810
it was added before CC, so a long time ago


[08-Jan-20 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL pesky bug is fixed. now it should maintain constant RAM usage (forever) with constant traffic levels and it shouldnt be crashing. however during the debugging it seemed that it is possible that not all packets for a tag would be in the list for the tag. careful submitting and counting of the DEX_list is needed to see if there is a problem. in the expected usage of just getting the latest packets, hopefully the counts will match.

Thanks!

Ok that‚Äôs interesting about RPC possibilities. I was looking at a python explorer codebase because kmd already uses py cryptocondition test cases.  Perhaps this is a way of making a CC enabled explorer? (With python)

Or is nSPV also an explorer making possibility?


[08-Jan-20 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
nSPV would likely be too slow for an explorer, more designed for single client wallets


[08-Jan-20 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case, the nSPV talks to nodes with addressindex to get the addressindex data, so having a local node with -addressindex=1 is the way to go


[08-Jan-20 01:11 AM] Mylo#8306
Sweet. Interesting way to achieve result. That‚Äôs further great news about nspv tech.  Cheers


[08-Jan-20 01:15 AM] jl777c#5810
i try not to follow the "expected" way to achieve results, rather to use deep understanding of the problem and the possible ways to solve it. then to choose the most "efficient". though defining what "efficient" means is not easy, other than "it feels the most efficient" and it takes into account the larger picture of complexity/security


[08-Jan-20 01:15 AM] jl777c#5810
also finding the most efficient is an iterative process, as you can see if you are following how -dexp2p is evolving


[08-Jan-20 01:16 AM] jl777c#5810
somehow without any mutex locks, it is processing and freeing memory in realtime, without crashes. likely some packets end up in limbo temporarily, but it is all within the design parameters of "as lossless as practical"


[08-Jan-20 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
i tried adding mutex locks, but it ended up deadlocking when i didnt expect it to and since it wasnt crashing without them, i pushed forward with the lossy approach


[08-Jan-20 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing prevents a lossless channel to be built on top of the existing messaging layer, so for now this seems the most efficient

make sure to reduce the TXPOWBITS from 12 if you are doing stress test, it can be as low as 1 (or even 0 maybe) and that will save a lot of CPU cycles

If mutex lock is not needed by this rotating buffer, brilliant. I did something similar with DECT cordless phone display (max characters) in hospitals for nurse call messages in the early 2000s. Obv not p2p complexity, but resource mgmt. it‚Äôs an awesome skill to have as a programmer.

Customizable purge time is useful for further applications.  Great!

getsnapshot  which is a unique rpc call in the kmd eco system also uses the -addressindex
There is also the getchaintxstats rpc call which I think comes from that bitcore integration

getutxoaddress   is also very powerfull it returns all utxos per address which makes the insight so fast without DB

Just set CMD to what you need and KOMODO_BRANCH


[08-Jan-20 07:42 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
BTW, at this stage I don't expect the AtomicDEX caretakers to use the coin tags. It is more likely that we'll pull the entire stream in, and sort it in an extensible fashion based on the component/system tags present *inside* the datablobs. For instance, if we have a gossip about peer X, this gossip might be relevant to order matching regardless of the coin (like when a KMD/BTC order matching takes into account the presence of a failed or successful DEX/LTC swap).
Maybe there will be uses for tags later, but having them is not our priority right now.
We might also want to share data with the komodod/dexp2p layer by adding datablobs that komodod would recognize and unpack.

It looks like tag filtering precision losing with amount increasing, for 1000 and 10000 it's precise but for 15000 of broadcasts it's a little bit less in list:
```  "tagA": "tag15000",
  "tagB": "",
  "destpub": "",
  "n": 14756
}```
for 100000:
```  "tagA": "tag100000",
  "tagB": "",
  "destpub": "",
  "n": 99355
}```


[08-Jan-20 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i thought as much


[08-Jan-20 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as it is 1% level it seems not so bad as i think it only happens on the node that is blasting


[08-Jan-20 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
on other nodes the effect is 10x less


[08-Jan-20 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577

[08-Jan-20 07:54 AM] jl777c#5810
now there is a way to quantify this, i will add some code to try to prevent the loss


[08-Jan-20 07:56 AM] TonyL#3577
yep, one more idea for test is above @Sir Seven
broadcast X times with tag_X and check if difference with `n` in `DEX_list` is not more than 1%

Given that caretaker is pulling the data in, and that the nodes join the "broadcast" from the current moment of time (without replay), there's likely no need to keep an entire hour of the data in RAM. I guess we'll be using a much smaller time window, in order not to store the data in memory twice. I'm curious if there are any pointers of what the minimal window could be?


[08-Jan-20 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
120 seconds should work


[08-Jan-20 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe even 60 seconds


[08-Jan-20 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
actually it could be set to 5 seconds


[08-Jan-20 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
but likely some bugs when it is so small


[08-Jan-20 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is important, i can get it to work at 5 seconds, but that is probably too small as in some cases there could be lag. so i wouldnt go below 120 seconds


[08-Jan-20 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i am testing at 300 seconds without any issues, dont see why 120 would have any problems


[08-Jan-20 08:09 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
120 sounds fine! ty. and we'll need some of it as a buffer for comfortable caretaker restarts


[08-Jan-20 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
there is MAXLAG #define that if you make it bigger, will extend the time a node will send pings to its peers with missing hashes, though on a disconnect/reconnect it might get confused and think a node will have the older messages

@TonyL can you test the missed packets again? i added a mutex in a few spots, hopefully it is a bit better. still seeing some issues on nodes at 100% CPU usage, but i think that is a different issue

i use shorthashes, lowest 32bits and it is possible to get collisions


[08-Jan-20 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
birthday paradox, with large number of shorthashes, odds go up of getting one, so when blasting a million it is a lot more common that would be expected


[08-Jan-20 08:19 AM] TonyL#3577

@Sir Sevenfor comparison you can try on DEXP2P chain or on chain with identical params to it (params can be found in pinned message)


[08-Jan-20 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL pushed fix. the issue was an index was overloaded, so i had to split things out into destpub33, tagA, tagB, tagA/tagB. that means you can search for just the tagB matching a search tag and it wont match it if it is in tagA


[08-Jan-20 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL just pushed a version with txpowbits of 1, which will allow blasting 500+ per second per blaster, maybe even 1000. this way you can create a simulated orderbook flow of orders, just use tagA/tagB for the base/rel as that will allow the orderbook rpc call to work. it can have volA and volB in floats, which implies a price by volA/volB division. so we can verify the max rate of orderflow that is possible to do and then also make sure that the orderbooks can be generated locally (and accurately)


[08-Jan-20 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
most interested in networks of 100+ nodes with about 4 peers each, to see how well it works. at 11 nodes it works quite well, but 100+ nodes could have a totally different performance in some cases. will need to see the every minute stats outputs


[08-Jan-20 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
after the 100 nodes test, we can go to 1000 nodes


[08-Jan-20 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
these 1000 nodes blasting orderbook entries at txpowbits of 1, is equivalent to 65 million nodes at txpow of 17, which seems quite sufficient. but that assumes that as the network grows that the added capacity of the extra nodes allows for linear performance on the key metrics. too complex to know ahead of time (for me) whether it will stay linear.


[08-Jan-20 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed change so the ffff blast makes packets of different priorities, 0 to 9


[08-Jan-20 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i want to make sure the highest priority gets the highest sync rate, but gracefully degrade the lower priorities. so will need to have a few more changes to the internals, but this wont really be visible at the rpc level


[08-Jan-20 10:22 AM] TonyL#3577
```  "tagA": "tag9000",
  "tagB": "",
  "destpub": "",
  "n": 9000
}``` yay, tag filtering works fine now


[08-Jan-20 10:22 AM] TonyL#3577
lets check if anything losing during tag filtering for 100,000 packages


[08-Jan-20 10:25 AM] TonyL#3577
```most interested in networks of 100+ nodes with about 4 peers each, to see how well it works. at 11 nodes it works quite well, but 100+ nodes could have a totally different performance in some cases. will need to see the every minute stats outputs
``` Yes, that should be very interesting to test - I'll prepare such network after tomorrow (tomorrow will be on road whole day)


[08-Jan-20 10:27 AM] TonyL#3577
```  "tagA": "tag100000",
  "tagB": "",
  "destpub": "",
  "n": 100000
}```

for 100,000 I'm getting 100,000 in list now so looks like losses 0% with such amount at the moment


[08-Jan-20 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
i like having no known bugs


[08-Jan-20 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
i added a stats display for the different priority levels displayed after tx/sec in descending order


[08-Jan-20 10:42 AM] TonyL#3577
are stats printing in stdout?


[08-Jan-20 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
i expected it to be even across the different priorities as i am not giving any preference to the higher priorities yet. however, already it is giving preference to the higher priorities


[08-Jan-20 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, stats are in stdout for now, i havent had a chance to move it to rpc call.


[08-Jan-20 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
hoping somebody else would step up to do such easy stuff while i am still dealing with the core functionality


[08-Jan-20 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, i think the preference is not real


[08-Jan-20 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the binomial distribution due to the 0 bits


[08-Jan-20 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
good thing i tested it first without any routing preference. i can get a baseline distribution


[08-Jan-20 10:49 AM] TonyL#3577
`i want to make sure the highest priority gets the highest sync rate, but gracefully degrade the lower priorities` looks like one more degradation auto-test idea üôÇ


[08-Jan-20 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i am targeting each higher priority level to have 2x higher chance of being in sync, but the scale would be 1/n, so if priority 0 is 1/20 out of sync, priority 1 would be 1/40 out of sync, priority 2 being 1/80 out of sync, etc. not sure i can hit this sort of theoretical gradient as it will necessarily need to be done via request prioritization. so really, as long as each priority has a higher sync rate than a lower priority, it is a valid performance


[08-Jan-20 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the difference in initial stats was indeed the 0 bits, now i see it at close to 10% for priority 3 to 9, then it drops in half for each one above 9, with  the last one being the same as the second to last as i put all the highest priorities in the last slot. 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 ... ends up adding up to 1


[08-Jan-20 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
the first 3 priorities are lower counts due to loss of the 0 bits, but 3 to 9 have balanced losses from the 0 bits as gained from the 0 bits of lower priorities.


[08-Jan-20 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
now i have an accurate baseline to measure priority delivery rates. just need to come up with a way to achieve it...

[09-Jan-20 09:00 PM] jl777c#5810
@artemciy_dice stopat and id use the shorthash. the odds of a collision are quite small, but i can add a stopat parameter that is the hash, which would likely never collide


[09-Jan-20 09:22 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
There's a good chance of the same datablob being submitted twice in a short while if the data isn't random, so I wonder if there would be a relation between the datablob content and the id that would influence the likelihood of collision.


[09-Jan-20 09:22 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
Also maybe it would make sense to use both the id and the timestamp together as the stopat?


[09-Jan-20 09:26 PM] jl777c#5810
using timestamp will make the chance of collision much less, but still possible.
each packets id includes the nonce, which is randomly selected, but still i see occasional duplicates. the id also includes the timestamp, so not sure it makes much sense to add it. if you want 99.99999999999% sure, use the hash. if one in a billion chance of collision is ok, use shorthash (id)


[09-Jan-20 09:35 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL i added a "hash" field to the DEX_list output, this field can be used as a stophash (when stopat is 0). i also bulletproofed the indexing, so there should be no more crashes even under heavy load. but i havent had a chance to test all the various functionalities with multiple tags yet. let me know if i broke anything


[09-Jan-20 09:39 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
bitwise I think the chance of matching against (random, time) and (random+time, time) are very close. especially if the addition wraps around


[09-Jan-20 09:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it might be, but to be at cryptographic probabilites, it needs to be the fullhash and there now is stophash parameter that is used if stopat is 0


[09-Jan-20 09:41 PM] jl777c#5810
an adversary can create a 32 bit collision (with or without timestamp)


[09-Jan-20 09:41 PM] jl777c#5810
it would even be possible to create a hash collision with enough hashrate, but likely not in the timeframe where it matters


[09-Jan-20 09:42 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, i think stophash solves this issue fully, dont you agree?


[09-Jan-20 09:43 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
stophash being a hash? of what?


[09-Jan-20 09:50 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
looking at the commit I guess it's the shorthash, but I don't know yet what exactly the shorthash is. if it is a hash of the data, then a duplicate datablob will lead to slippage


[09-Jan-20 09:56 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
let's say we start with a random id but then simply increment (in an atomic fashion) that id (wrapping around on overflow). that simple scheme might actually work better than both the random and the data-based ids


[09-Jan-20 09:57 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
for stopat, that is


[09-Jan-20 09:57 PM] jl777c#5810
but multiple nodes are generating packets, there cant be a coordinated incrementing number


[09-Jan-20 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
stophash is the hash of the entire message


[09-Jan-20 09:58 PM] jl777c#5810
so unless the entire payload is identical and the timestamp is the same and the nonce is the same, it will have a different hash


[09-Jan-20 09:58 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
we're not going to share stopat between nodes, it's used by a client to pull from a single node


[09-Jan-20 09:59 PM] jl777c#5810
what exactly is the type of usecase are you wanting to do?


[09-Jan-20 10:00 PM] jl777c#5810
exact duplicates will be treated as the same packet by the network


[09-Jan-20 10:00 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
use case is getting a stream of datablobs from a given local komodod


[09-Jan-20 10:00 PM] jl777c#5810
use DEX_list 0 ... the first time


[09-Jan-20 10:00 PM] jl777c#5810
it will return all datablobs in the matching index


[09-Jan-20 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the JSON object for each datablob will include both the id and the hash


[09-Jan-20 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
store these values from the first item in the DEX_list 0 ...


[09-Jan-20 10:01 PM] jl777c#5810
next time use the hash value in the DEX_list 0.... stophash


[09-Jan-20 10:01 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
duplicates aren't filtered out by a node currently, they are only filtered between them


[09-Jan-20 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
why do you say that?


[09-Jan-20 10:02 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
because I tested it


[09-Jan-20 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
do you have a specific case that violates the uniqueness? if so, that is a bug


[09-Jan-20 10:02 PM] jl777c#5810
seems better to fix the bug, but if you dont report it, i dont even know it is there


[09-Jan-20 10:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you are getting the same id in the DEX_list output?


[09-Jan-20 10:03 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
no bug can exists outside specification


[09-Jan-20 10:04 PM] jl777c#5810
identical message should appear only once


[09-Jan-20 10:04 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
I'm getting different ids but multiple instances of the same datablob so I assume the shorthash will be the same


[09-Jan-20 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
same payload will almost always lead to different shorthash (bottom 32 bits of full hash)


[09-Jan-20 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
this is due to timestamp and nonce added


[09-Jan-20 10:05 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
I see


[09-Jan-20 10:05 PM] jl777c#5810
so if submitted at different timestamps, it will be different


[09-Jan-20 10:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and even at the same timestamp, unless there is a nonce collision it will be different


[09-Jan-20 10:06 PM] jl777c#5810
at the transport layer, i cannot tell if identical payload is meant to be two different messages, or just a duplicate


[09-Jan-20 10:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems best to filter out identical payloads before calling DEX_broadcast


[09-Jan-20 10:08 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
good to know. thanks for unwrapping these parts


[09-Jan-20 10:09 PM] jl777c#5810
you just need to ask the questions to get the clarifications, this has been evolving rather quickly and without feedback, it will just be based on what i think is needed


[09-Jan-20 10:09 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
exactly what I did


[09-Jan-20 10:09 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is good


[09-Jan-20 10:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i havent added any hash based lookups of data, as it seems that might not be needed, but if needed, it wouldnt be hard to add


[09-Jan-20 10:11 PM] jl777c#5810
@Tylor zkFS currently there is a limit of 64 tags, so you cant use tags to track the different parts of a video. best to add a sequence id to the payload and reconstruct it based on that

[10-Jan-20 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL with the latest, there is some primitive prioritization. I have a BLASTER #define that is added to the priority created by the blaster loop. so it if it set to iter, you get 10% at each of 10 priorities. at (iter/9) it is 90% 0 and 10% priority of 1. at (iter/3) it would have 1 3 3 3 as the volume of priority 3, 2, 1, 0


[10-Jan-20 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, before this latest version the (iter/9) blast had close to 100 900 split betweeen priority 1 and 0. with the latest version it is around 50/50!


[10-Jan-20 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the 14 numbers before the tx/sec are the relative volumes for the first 14 priorities, with the leftmost being all priority 13+ combined. it is basically 10x the percentage, so 100 900 is 10% 90%, the expected for (iter/9)


[10-Jan-20 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
having it go to 500 500 means 5x increase in completed priority 1 packets.


[10-Jan-20 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, when the test starts with just one node blasting, the other nodes can keep up, so it is at 100 900, but when all 10 are blasting, the network cant keep up so it starts prioritizing


[10-Jan-20 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
this functionality once made smooth, will allow for the entire network to seamlessly adapt to ongoing spam attacks, exponentially raising the cost of the spam, while minimally slowing down the user experience


[10-Jan-20 07:51 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
is  3MB to much for  a packet? it would be the max size for P2P fileshare

[10-Jan-20 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810

[10-Jan-20 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810

[10-Jan-20 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
many usecases will need a reliable data transfer and the logic to do the error detection, retry, etc. it might as well be in the core. the primitive priority based routing appears to be working quite well. that was the last big issue to solve. still need to fine tune it as i have many ideas to make it better, but at least there is a way to maximize the chances your packet gets fully broadcast, even in a saturated network. currently about 2x network capacity of traffic


[10-Jan-20 08:00 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280

i  was going to suggest that buuuut


[10-Jan-20 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
would be really cool to be able to specify a file (which is growing as the recording keeps going) which is then broadcast to the network and once caught up, it will continue to send the latest updates


[10-Jan-20 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
on the receive side, you would specific a file that you want locally and it would update from the network. just call it every few seconds and you will recreate the file as it grows

there would be a tag for such streaming files and you would specify the shorthash of its directory of hashes of its initial set of data


[10-Jan-20 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
no idea about the labs stuff, i am talking about an automated publishing protocol


[10-Jan-20 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
would be all done in C


[10-Jan-20 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
but inside the komodod, so just need to specify what stream you want and the file will be created locally. i think that would be a very good demo of this tech


[10-Jan-20 08:07 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
yes  -  back  when we  tested  staked  we  talked  about this


[10-Jan-20 08:07 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
this  is why I  wanted to  get  "something" working


[10-Jan-20 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
the normal mempool is not going to be able to stream reliably

i  followed  the  crumbs  to kmdlabs  streamer


[10-Jan-20 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
dexp2p is designed for maximum performance and being able to add custom flow control based on txpow priority, this is what will make possible a reliable system that gracefully degrades


[10-Jan-20 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
the concept is simple enough to split a file into smaller pieces, send it and reconstruct it


[10-Jan-20 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
but dexp2p is like UDP and not 100% reliable, so the reliability needs to be added


[10-Jan-20 08:10 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
packet  IDs  and toatl packets was  what  my double  check  was  going  to be


[10-Jan-20 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
with the bandwidth levels we are seeing, hundreds of simultaneously broadcast audio channels can be handled by one dexp2p network


[10-Jan-20 08:11 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
nice


[10-Jan-20 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is a good start and if all the data gets there, there is no problem. the problem is what to do when not all the data gets there

request  missing  packet  from sending pubkey author?


[10-Jan-20 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
do you know if the video streaming software creates a single every growing file?


[10-Jan-20 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is possible that there is no known pubkey, as that is not required to send packets into dexp2p, it is permissionless network


[10-Jan-20 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
if audio and video streaming software creates a single file that just gets bigger the longer the stream goes, then it can fit into what i am thinking of directly


[10-Jan-20 08:13 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
the  streamer was bringing the file in and cutting it into 2mb  packets and sending it right out -- looked like as it comes in it goes out -  no  buffer  so  far


[10-Jan-20 08:14 AM] TonyL#3577

[10-Jan-20 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
not the labs stuff, i mean if you are making a video/audio stream for a webcast


[10-Jan-20 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
can you make it log to a single file?


[10-Jan-20 08:15 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
above  my paygrade --- looks like it


[10-Jan-20 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
that would be the simplest. no need to fiddle with making http requests, just specify the local file the stream is going in and it gets replicated in near realtime on all nodes that have subscribed


[10-Jan-20 08:16 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
missing  packets would  just be blank  screen


[10-Jan-20 08:16 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
for  video and  audio


[10-Jan-20 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
and for playback, i am assuming if you have the log that was made, you can just play it. hopefully if it is a growing file it will be able to play it as it grows in size


[10-Jan-20 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
i plan to make it no have any missing data


[10-Jan-20 08:17 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
yes  -- all  this  looks  possible for a person with  more  than  1  month of  python scripting


[10-Jan-20 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, if someone can verify these assumptions, we can get a video streamer demo made


[10-Jan-20 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
also if there are video feeds that are hierarchical, we can use the different priorities to send the lowest res, to highest res. not sure if the video formats are such that the data is low res + medium res + high res, where there can be the difference between the low, med, high res


[10-Jan-20 08:23 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
research and  development says yes ---- someone  should confirm -- 
  @Alright @Deleted User


[10-Jan-20 08:27 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I believe resolution starts when file is  created  -- I think streaming services can send out  multiple  resolution files using same packet numbers and the recievers  client can auto toggle depending on speed/bandwidth/dropped  packets  ect...


[10-Jan-20 08:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Multi-bitrate streaming implementation depends of streaming protocol you want to use for the demo


[10-Jan-20 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
i need some details on the most common streaming software that is being used


[10-Jan-20 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
no need to reinvent the wheel, easiest to just make the dexp2p work with existing stream broadcasting softare. but i dont know any details about it and guessing doesnt do any good


[10-Jan-20 08:31 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
let me see if VLC has  a server side

[10-Jan-20 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
for starters a simple single bitrate stream publishing software is needed, along with a compatible player


[10-Jan-20 08:31 AM] TonyL#3577
ffmpeg is a broadcaster


[10-Jan-20 08:31 AM] TonyL#3577
(broadcasting server)


[10-Jan-20 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
so does ffmpeg create a file(s) when you start a stream and this file just keeps getting bigger?


[10-Jan-20 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
and that file can be played by a player just be specifying the file and as the file grows the player keeps playing it.


[10-Jan-20 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
those are the two video gui pieces that are needed


[10-Jan-20 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
and pretty sure it must already exist


[10-Jan-20 08:32 AM] TonyL#3577
You can use HLS protocol - it's the best one for such video transmitting


[10-Jan-20 08:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Just split video on chunks, each chunks got his number and there is m3u8 playlist to play chunks in order


[10-Jan-20 08:33 AM] TonyL#3577
protocol determines chunks size and m3u8 structure

anyway there is  my 2 cents


[10-Jan-20 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
if a logfile cannot be created by the transmitting side, then it seems there needs to be something that talks the HLS protocol and appends to a file.


[10-Jan-20 08:36 AM] TonyL#3577
if there is a demand/interest for video streaming solution based on this p2p tech I can make some poc I think


[10-Jan-20 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so i will target the file/stream transmission to be file based


[10-Jan-20 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
making it file based, it can be used on any file


[10-Jan-20 08:36 AM] TonyL#3577
tasks sounds like a: split file on parts, upload, download it and play


[10-Jan-20 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so debug.log can be broadcast and it will sync to all subscribed nodes


[10-Jan-20 08:37 AM] TonyL#3577
just need to know in what order to play these parts and know that these parts are parts of the same video file


[10-Jan-20 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
this file transmisison protocol belongs in the core, it is not for the app level


[10-Jan-20 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
for the app level, if you can just convice video broadcasting to make a file that grows in realtime


[10-Jan-20 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
and for the player to stream using such a file, then the file/stream layer will take care of the rest


[10-Jan-20 08:38 AM] TonyL#3577
aha - so make it like a channel live stream


[10-Jan-20 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the low level will be give a filename and it will then do all the splitting, transmitting, sending out high priority directory info, retry for missing pieces. this is all universally needed for anything that needs reliable data


[10-Jan-20 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so the DEX_publishstream "filename" tagA would start the stream


[10-Jan-20 08:40 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
thats what  I started -- sorta


[10-Jan-20 08:40 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
DEX_broadcast = {
       "payload": dataout,  ### ASCII "hello"
       "priority": 5,
         "tagA": filename, #<----File_Name "BTC"
         "tagB": File_Type,   #<-------File_Type "KMD"
         "destpub": pubkey,
         "amountA": Sequence_ID,  #<<<-----Sequence_ID
         "amountB": 64,  #<<<-----Total_Packets TBD  if  we decide  to  send less  than 64 for small files
    }


[10-Jan-20 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
no offense, but what i talk about is a lot more than split a file and send it


[10-Jan-20 08:40 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
no problem


[10-Jan-20 08:40 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
i believe  you


[10-Jan-20 08:41 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
i knew  there  was  something  in  the  base  code  that  could  speed  it  up


[10-Jan-20 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
once a stream is active, then people could subscribe to it. but i think both streams and files are very similar.probably they use the same method for the data transfer, but the streaming would add extra functionality to extend the file


[10-Jan-20 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so the broadcasting side makes sure there is a file that is growing in time based on the video feed. and it calls the DEX_streampublish every second


[10-Jan-20 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
that updates everything and sends the data out to the dexp2p network


[10-Jan-20 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
any node can then subscribe by doing DEX_streamupdate, which would replicate the file locally.


[10-Jan-20 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
doing the video display is up to whatever software can do that with a file that is growing in size


[10-Jan-20 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
hope this all makes sense


[10-Jan-20 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
so if anybody can find/configure publishing side software to make a growing file, i think the client side can just stream from that


[10-Jan-20 08:48 AM] TonyL#3577
ffmpeg should suit the task as a open source streaming solutuion


[10-Jan-20 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but why to reinvent the wheel?


[10-Jan-20 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
there must be end user software already that publishes a stream


[10-Jan-20 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
VLC seems to say it can stream from a growing .mp4 file. we need to verify that


[10-Jan-20 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
making a GUI for publishing streams will take a very long time


[10-Jan-20 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
at least if we want it to look decent


[10-Jan-20 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and much better to work with existing tools that people are already using


[10-Jan-20 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
we could probably make our own filesystem too. but what value does that add? there are plenty of good file systems already


[10-Jan-20 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
so plz find existing end user apps that do the publishing and verify that VLC or something like it can play a file that is coming in incrementally

when I was in uni, we used to file share using something like <https://github.com/eiskaltdcpp/eiskaltdcpp>
I remember being able to play a partially downloaded video file and continue watching it as it is being downloaded


[10-Jan-20 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
we actually dont need the publishing side, just the front end to the publishing side


[10-Jan-20 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
as we are using dexp2p as the transport


[10-Jan-20 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
so a GUI that can make a .mp4 file incrementally from a webcam


[10-Jan-20 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
locally


[10-Jan-20 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810

@gcharang great! please confirm it can create a file locally and that VLC can stream and display that file as it is growing


[10-Jan-20 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
once we have that, it is a matter to insert the dexp2p broadcast and reconstruction to allow any node to be able to VLC stream the same file

oh, yes, an open source chat system, once i add file transfers then we have channels, DM and file uploads. all via totally decentralized -dexp2p. with the layer working as UDP, basically most all the internet services should be able to be replicated

and since this is all happening inside komodod, of course it can be easily integrated with the native coin for whatever aspect, even payment for priority, certainly payment for subscription, can even use nSPV to accept KMD payments to release paid for services

doesnt really look like the chat business needs this tech - a light chat add for  "certain websites" is  all it really needs--- Basic p2p chat function to talk with buyer or seller of coins or information-- will continue to find basic uses tomorrow - the pad has  some of the links  to p2p chat servers and other misc things----

sharing a persistant drive to increase priority level seems logical to me  - 10GB  or  more -  this also could help create an anesiac local system for swap data- now im  done

sharing / storing  files from one pubkey to  another with out any of the packets touching localhost persistant drive -- or maybe just  a few packets -- I  think wireshark might even have problems with that network broadcast.

```i added a "hash" field to the DEX_list output, this field can be used as a stophash (when stopat is 0). i also bulletproofed the indexing, so there should be no more crashes even under heavy load. but i havent had a chance to test all the various functionalities with multiple tags yet. let me know if i broke anything```

I'm broadcasting 3 messages:

1) ``` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_broadcast "TonyL1" 0 "BTC" "KMD" "" "0.1" "100"
{
  "timestamp": 1578737586,
  "id": 442833797,
  "hash": "851b651aab38e39fffd366ee90a955698d55e9252bad1bbfca7c68b6a3a393e7",```

2) ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_broadcast "TonyL2" 0 "BTC" "KMD" "" "0.1" "100"
{
  "timestamp": 1578737589,
  "id": 3111337450,
  "hash": "ea3d73b9fe91b7ab23cff4c12be38b403ee44ed022db0b7ef54d511df34cfe1a",```

3)  ```./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_broadcast "TonyL3" 0 "BTC" "KMD" "" "0.1" "100"

  "hash": "e423db15633f7042cffaee49c2b2ed8136b1133e33233adc46a1cdffd9081186",```

Then I'm using hash of the 3rd broadcast but getting empty output (expecting to see first two messages):
```
 ./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_list "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" e423db15633f7042cffaee49c2b2ed8136b1133e33233adc46a1cdffd9081186

am I understood this hash functionality wrong?


[11-Jan-20 02:23 AM] jl777c#5810
you are backwards.


[11-Jan-20 02:23 AM] jl777c#5810
stophash will stop right before the specified stopat


[11-Jan-20 02:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it should be called stopjustrightbefore


[11-Jan-20 02:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is you remember the first id/hash from each DEX_list return and use that as the parameter for the next one


[11-Jan-20 02:24 AM] jl777c#5810
this way you get each packet exactly once


[11-Jan-20 02:24 AM] TonyL#3577
`stopjustrightbefore` so before third there should be the second


[11-Jan-20 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810
the list is in reverse time order


[11-Jan-20 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810
from last to first


[11-Jan-20 02:25 AM] jl777c#5810

`after 5 minutes it will be purged`
ah, so I've just tested too long


[11-Jan-20 02:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe no actual issue. it has just been convenient to have things clear in 5 minutes

So just to summarize: I'm broadcasting three messages like a ` ./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_broadcast "TonyL1" 0 "BTC" "KMD" "" "0.1" "100"`
`DEX_list 0 0 "BTC"` - works
`DEX_list 0 <id of second or first message>` - returns empty list
`DEX_list 0 "" "" "" "" "" "" "" "" <hash of second or first message> ` - returns empty list


[11-Jan-20 02:39 AM] jl777c#5810
hash/id of first message should show all other than the first message


[11-Jan-20 02:40 AM] jl777c#5810
hash/id of the second message should show all that are after the second message, ie. the third

[11-Jan-20 02:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Encryption/decryption works correct for me. @Sir Seven was your able to reproduce/isolate the problem you got with it inside the testing framework? Are you sure that you used pubkey which displaying in output of `./komodo-cli -ac_name=<ac_name> DEX_stats` call on the recipient node?

No worries if you've not retested it - I know that you finishing another thing atm. I think that problem you faced related to test suite

like a if no tag filtering specified it should display everything, with correct tag it works correct

its not mandatory


[11-Jan-20 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
it defaults to "general" if not specified, and displays the output in DEX_list

with some examples - if you do not specify tags on broadcast it gets `default` tag by default, if you don't specify tag on filtering it filter by `default` tag by default


[11-Jan-20 03:43 AM] TonyL#3577
and that if you want to find package broadcasted with tag `BTC` it's mandatory to specify tag `BTC`


[11-Jan-20 03:43 AM] TonyL#3577
you even can explain it as a case in doc: `lets say we want to put order for KMD to BTC with price like that and volume like that` and from another side `lets say we want to find order for KMD to BTC with params like that`

will re-test it shortly, almost finished with network preparation script for the loading test


[11-Jan-20 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
i think i got the priority based flow control working. allocation of 20/40/40 for priority 2/1/0 went to 60/20/20. i changed the outputs to show actual totals so i can see how close the actuals are for the highest priority. that is at about 2x overall network capacity. nearly all the highest priority packets are arriving.


[11-Jan-20 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i made it so if LAG is not detected, it wont change the routing


[11-Jan-20 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
this is to prevent an attack by making a veryhigh priority packet, in LAG mode, only the highest few priorities are getting all the packets through

Hmm, if node got 0 connections (both `addnode` and `connect` not specified in startup params) I'm not able to add peers to it by `addnode` RPC call 
Maybe I need to interconnect everything at first and then ban nodes to make not everything interconnected


[11-Jan-20 07:11 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure, this part of code is very tricky and unpredictable

-addnode= on commandline tends to work pretty well


[11-Jan-20 07:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a start batch interconnected, then connect randomly by 4 addnode params next batch to previous and so on
If I remember correct there is define in code so I can limit overall amount of peers for each node to lets say 4 - could you please remind where it is?

[11-Jan-20 07:19 AM] TonyL#3577
but when you start assetchain and using lets say only one `addnode` params eventually you'll get more and more peers


[11-Jan-20 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, if you had an actual blockchain, probably it would do that


[11-Jan-20 07:27 AM] TonyL#3577

starting seednode without `addnode` at first, then 2 nodes connecting to the seednode by addnode


[11-Jan-20 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
i think you need to do it in layers


[11-Jan-20 07:29 AM] TonyL#3577
then randomly choosing 4 addnode for connection of each next


[11-Jan-20 07:29 AM] TonyL#3577
`i think you need to do it in layers` batch by batch?


[11-Jan-20 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
these random 4 nodes are already running?


[11-Jan-20 07:30 AM] TonyL#3577
nope, not guaranteed


[11-Jan-20 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe dont specify the port and guarantee all the specified nodes are running before being -addnode used


[11-Jan-20 07:33 AM] TonyL#3577
without port it'll not work because all nodes bound on localhost so it'll be confused, will try to addnode only running nodes with > 0 connections
I think that understood now how to connect it gentle (but not sure that it'll not be interconnected). thank you!


[11-Jan-20 07:54 AM] gcharang#6833
@TonyL are all these nodes on localhost?


[11-Jan-20 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
would be better to have real seperate ip for the different nodes, maybe in a VM


[11-Jan-20 07:56 AM] gcharang#6833
there was a bug with using `-datadir` for a second node
where it was disregarding the pubkey that is set and generating a session specific pubkey
maybe something similar is going wrong for connections too?


[11-Jan-20 07:59 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, it's on localhsot. Was just a mistake in my script code - now everything is fine.
```there was a bug with using -datadir for a second node

not sure how it'll change over the time - I wonder it'll grow


[11-Jan-20 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
each node should have at least 2, 1 peer nodes are going to have a hard time keeping up


[11-Jan-20 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
but i guess it is a good test. latest version appears to be enabling/disabling the priority based routing pretty well


[11-Jan-20 08:02 AM] TonyL#3577
hmm, I can stop and restart node until it'll have 2 connections


[11-Jan-20 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
but first lets see what sort of traffic 101 nodes can handle


[11-Jan-20 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
"handle" meaning all nodes getting 99.9%+ of packets


[11-Jan-20 08:04 AM] TonyL#3577
yeah, server is very juicy (corei9, 64GB ram), so spin 100 clients and 20 GB ram still free and loading on CPU around 5-10%


[11-Jan-20 08:05 AM] TonyL#3577
so I should just spam packets with specific tags and then compare if different nodes getting same amount in list by tag filtering?


[11-Jan-20 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
that would be most precise, yes

Use case "tails"/AmnesiaOS with persistant shared drive  for all  members of  "StormCast"  or  whatever  the name is .  Shared drives accross  the network  - simple data  like  swap history is saved to  the  network.  To  get  your  data  back just connect to the  "Storm Trooper" network  with  correct pubkey. The GUI or Daemon could  have  these  settings...


[11-Jan-20 08:41 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I  could broadcast my zkShops, zkEverything -- I need  to research torrent data storage of packets only and see how IPFS does this


[11-Jan-20 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
a persistence layer would be needed


[11-Jan-20 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
currently everything is ephemeral


[11-Jan-20 08:50 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
A  UI could handle the storage - and the logic not to store  ALL  --- but  if you  want to  add  a command  -persistance with conf   storage="drive location" in the  daemon that would be nice....drive location could be set to network location....  just trying to  get personal data stored away from local host for amnesiac reasons


[11-Jan-20 08:53 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Drive  location could be "StormCast"


[11-Jan-20 09:17 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
it  was the  reason I thought  offline atomic swaps could be  possible - probably with  a cc putting  the other key  in a  second p2sh address  and  having  the Storm Troopers do the  rest.....  I  dont know -  it just seeems possible

[11-Jan-20 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
the real proof though is if the packets you know you broadcast are actually getting broadcast


[11-Jan-20 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
i will add the performance stats to DEX_stats someday


[11-Jan-20 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
so dont try to parse it from command line


[11-Jan-20 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
for now you would need to extract all the packets in a DEX_list loop and make a DB of all the hashes/id


[11-Jan-20 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
then compare the DB overlap of each node


[11-Jan-20 09:33 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c for "DEX_list", tagA defaults to "general" if neither "tagA" or "tagB" are specified
correct?


[11-Jan-20 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
correct


[11-Jan-20 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
actually not correct


[11-Jan-20 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
destpub also needs to be "", basically if all three tags are null, it defaults to "general"


[11-Jan-20 09:34 AM] gcharang#6833
got it


[11-Jan-20 09:34 AM] gcharang#6833
it is the same for DEX_broadcast ?
if neither tagA nor tagB nor destpub are specified, tagA defaults to "general" ?


[11-Jan-20 09:36 AM] TonyL#3577
```for now you would need to extract all the packets in a DEX_list loop and make a DB of all the hashes/id

```
Aha, so I should record  hashes/id which spammer  `DEX_broadcast` return, in a 3-4 minutes stop spam (since in 5 minutes packages flush from RAM), collect `DEX_list` om each node for needed tags and compare with `DEX_broadcast` spammed data?


[11-Jan-20 09:37 AM] TonyL#3577
`if neither tagA nor tagB nor destpub are specified, tagA defaults to "general" ?` let me check

yes

let me summarise:
```
How to use DEX_list to filter the datablobs received by the node and get each datablob exactly once?
- call DEX_list with stopat == 0 and set the rest of the filters as needed
- the response will contain datablobs from latest to oldest
- note the id of the latest datablob(first one) call it id_1
- if we call DEX_list again with stopat == id_1 (rest of the filters are the same) --> this will give all the newer datablobs till the datablob that has id == id_1
- instead of doing that, if we call DEX_list again with stopat == "" and stophash == id_1 (rest of the filters are the same) --> this will give all the newer datablobs till the datablob that has id == id_1 (excluding the one with id == id_1)
- for both the id and hash can be used in the place of id_1
```
is that correct ?


[11-Jan-20 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[11-Jan-20 10:13 AM] gcharang#6833
is setting stopat to 0 or "" both valid? is there a preferance?
I guess "" should be prefered as it is a string?
@jl777c


[11-Jan-20 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
0 or "" both end up at 0


[11-Jan-20 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
if stopat is not 0, it takes precedence over stophash


[11-Jan-20 10:15 AM] gcharang#6833
got it


[11-Jan-20 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL pushed new version that is basically feature complete. just have more fields to add to the DEX_stats rpc call. it can now handle arbitrary (RAM limited) number of tags. this allows indexing by pubkeys, ie. destpub with conventions that tagA:inbox and tagB:outbox will allow messages to go to a specific pubkey and a broadcast from that pubkey to be easily findable


[11-Jan-20 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
i also hardened it from rare edge case crashes, which before could have happened in rare edge cases


[11-Jan-20 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
to fully test the full range, would need to tweak internal #defines. but the default config should allow a decent coverage. let me know when the basic data transmission is working solid. i will then boost txpowbits to 12 or more, which will get us in the expected normal network config and it will take a lot more than a single server to saturate the network


[11-Jan-20 11:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Sure, I'm almost finished with test scripts. Hope there will be some measurable results soon


[11-Jan-20 11:33 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, more than a single server is needed definitely - 100 blasters speed is like a  1100 packages per second but in total, not each so around 10 packages per second from each node


[11-Jan-20 11:34 AM] TonyL#3577
It will speedup if I'll start to broadcast `ffff` message instead of randomly generated one, right?


[11-Jan-20 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, 10x faster

In case of 10 nodes it's very close to 100% (data for 3 minutes, random text messages):

[11-Jan-20 11:51 PM] jl777c#5810
as soon as all CPU is used,things degrade rapidly. at 5x then best case is 20% of traffic gets through, but with CPU overloaded would be lucky to get 10%, and it seems that is what happened


[11-Jan-20 11:52 PM] jl777c#5810
plz do this test at 15 nodes, 20 nodes, 25 nodes and 30 nodes


[11-Jan-20 11:52 PM] jl777c#5810
we should see it gradually decline from 99%+ to 20%

maybe we can use AWS so the nodes have constant hardware available


[12-Jan-20 12:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it will stay at the 99+ range until the network gets saturated. then it will start degrading, but not sure how fast it will degrade. also, if you can have a mix of priorities then when the network is degraded we can measure the completion percentage of the different priorities. that is really what makes dexp2p unique (maybe this is in some other p2p network?), the graceful degradation built into p2p streaming.


[12-Jan-20 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if the network is not saturated, then it wouldnt matter the priority, similar to txfee not mattering if the blocks are not full. once the nodes start lagging, they will go into a lag mode where the top priority packets are given VIP treatment and try to maintain the 99%+ for them. and iterating down to the next priority as resources allow. so overall, we should see something close to a linear degradation overall, but the highest priority would stay at 99%+ until the network is so saturated, it cant even deliver all the VIP packets


[12-Jan-20 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
at least that is what i tried to implement


[12-Jan-20 12:20 AM] jl777c#5810
however, this is much much harder than it looks and it is very easy to end up with unintended feedback loops and having non-graceful degradation. we know the network will be saturated at some point as with exponentially growing base of usage, it will exceed any given network capacity, so the important thing is to gracefully degrade during the overload so that as little end user experience is affected (for DEX orderbooks as long as the local orderbook is close to the theoretically best, that is good enough)


[12-Jan-20 12:22 AM] jl777c#5810
then when we detect a specific dexp2p network is overloaded, we spawn another one, so nodes would be connected to multiple dexp2p networks and we can get it to scale almost on-demand. the issue of course is normal end user nodes wont be able to handle more than a single dexp2p network....


[12-Jan-20 12:23 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, the solution is a hierarchy of dexp2p networks, with the main one reserved for summary data and info about other dexp2p networks. low end network connection clients just connect to this one and it will have all the relevant info from all the lower level dexp2p networks.


[12-Jan-20 12:25 AM] jl777c#5810
bridge nodes would then connect to both and feed info from the lower level dexp2p to the higher level in summary form, ie. the top of orderbook, directory of files, etc. without the actual data. maybe enough data is needed so two clients on different lower level dexp2p networks can get enough info to do an alice/bob swap just from info in the main dexp2p


[12-Jan-20 12:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i didnt expect to have to solve realtime sharding... but it seems that is sort of what this is


[12-Jan-20 03:50 AM] TonyL#3577
Sure, will try to find point where things rekt on my server and then distribute nodes on multiple servers depends of this tests result. But adding to scripts multiple servers support might take a few days

Are/Will FSM ‚Äúcontract parameters‚Äù (be) transferable between smart chains in a cross-chain transaction (like burn protocol or nSPV messaging)?


[12-Jan-20 07:58 AM] Mylo#8306
Use case: some NFTs for show tickets being transferred to agents selling through their own systems.


[12-Jan-20 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
this is not up to the blockchain layer, is it? at the dapp level if such transferability is allowed, then it seems it can be allowed


[12-Jan-20 09:41 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
similar  question -- would it be easier to change chains inside the daemon / restart daemon to query other chains data or would multiple running  daemons  be the way to query and connnect all types of sources - use case decentralized web that is connected together with master nodes- blockstack/zeronet/beakerbrowser plus the many komodo chains that will spawn from this tech.  I can rephrase this later this evening if needed, I have to run. -- so yeah, cross chain interoperability, maybe an new bitcoin lib to bring these together


[12-Jan-20 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
many chains all on the same node, a dapp that queries them all


[12-Jan-20 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
but nSPV mode can be used to reduce system resources needed for actual blockchains

[12-Jan-20 05:19 PM] Mylo#8306
Ok - yes that was the question, but seems it is answered.  ‚ÄúWill there be an inter blockchain or txproof transaction to transfer FSM contract parameters, so that other chains and dapps can prove the transfer of a type of FSM contract in history‚Äù.

So it seems to be if I have an FSM contract {‚Äúname‚Äù: ‚Äúmylo tickets‚Äù, ‚Äúdate‚Äù: ‚Äú01/01/21‚Äù, ‚Äúterms‚Äù: [....]}, the dapp simply gets these parameters from originating chain, then anything/NFT created in the originating chain can be transferred to the target chain, as long as parameters match, and the anything/NFT asset origination is the point of txproof lookup?


[12-Jan-20 06:54 PM] Mylo#8306
A reason I can see it handy to have FSM instance parameters transferred is from a distribution point of view.

Eg
I have created an amount of product.
As the producer, I‚Äôd like to query the FSM instance param transfers to know which of my partners is distributing this product.
With the param transfer tx, I‚Äôm able to sync their chain and verify their sales of my product.

It can be done in a dapp, but why when it can be possible at the most verifiable level?

Cosmos has the IBC protocol about to test. It is a data blob style of protocol, they describe it as ‚Äúversatile‚Äù and they describe it in not so many words as, heterogeneous - doesn‚Äôt matter what consensus algo, blockchain apps or params.  I‚Äôm not sure how to describe the same thing by using the dex orderbook tech for FSM param transfer if that is a workable solution, with oracle?


[12-Jan-20 10:42 PM] jl777c#5810
if you think about what a transaction is, i think it will help you understand


[12-Jan-20 10:43 PM] jl777c#5810
a valid transaction (as opposed to an invalid one), has a txid that is in the merkleroot of a confirmed block. you must understand this. if any of those is missing, it is an invalid tx and not relevant. by "confirmed" we can make it mean notarized, or enough confirmations you dont worry about it being reorged


[12-Jan-20 10:44 PM] jl777c#5810
now, you are running a specific blockchain and you can verify that a transaction is valid (txid in merkleroot of block that is confirmed), so you cant be fooled by an invalid transaction


[12-Jan-20 10:44 PM] jl777c#5810
with me so far?

{Reactions}
üëç 

[12-Jan-20 10:45 PM] jl777c#5810
now the problem with many blockchains (and actually for even one) is that to be able to validate it, you need to have the entire blockchain locally in sync. otherwise you dont know if the txid was in a merkleroot or if the blockhash is in the mainchain.


[12-Jan-20 10:46 PM] jl777c#5810
but of course there is nSPV, which allows you to just store the short segment of blockheaders, the corresponding notarizations and with that info and the merkleproof, you can validate any txid


[12-Jan-20 10:47 PM] jl777c#5810
so now, we can view a valid transaction as something that has a txid in a merkleroot in a blockheader that is confirmed, along with a pair of notarizations and all the blockheaders in between (one of which is the blockheader with the merkleroot that proves the txid)


[12-Jan-20 10:47 PM] jl777c#5810
nSPV is basically the heterogeneous protocol, isnt it?


[12-Jan-20 10:48 PM] jl777c#5810

@TonyL changed the behavior of DEX_list to make it so that if a tag is specified then it must match the packet, this allows for a much more streamlined query sequence. leaving a tag as "" will make it match anything the packet has.

also made DEX_stats return most of the status line that prints every minute. if you need any specific field to have its own JSON field, let me know. easy enough to do, but it seems it would just clutter the return to do it to all of them


[13-Jan-20 12:31 AM] jl777c#5810

from what i can tell, the latest version is feature complete for the messaging layer and transport layer, just need to change txpowbits to 12 (or 16) to make it take about a second to calculate the txpow. of course, there are some bugs that still need to be found and fixed

Find a weird crash if you send from script (either using cli or curl) first help and DEX_stats rpc right after, daemon will crash.

the change to DEX_list is to make the search tags &&

so tagA && tagB instead of tagA || tagB

if you have tagA of KMD and BTC, and tagB of BTC and KMD

-dexp2p nodes can be for any chain, even KMD


[13-Jan-20 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL we need to make sure -dexp2p nodes will live in their own isolated universe and not be sending DEX messages to non -dexp2p nodes. they should be able to interoperate using normal protocol, but the DEX messages only sent to nodes with the proper nServices bit set


[13-Jan-20 04:51 AM] TonyL#3577
With 15 nodes on my server CPU is loaded on 95-100% and only 20% of packages are on other nodes
With 10 nodes CPU loading is around 70-75% and around 100% of packages propagation success, so looks like a 10-12 spam nodes - that's a limit for powerful core i9


[13-Jan-20 04:53 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, makes sense


[13-Jan-20 04:53 AM] TonyL#3577
So if use very usual AWS nodes maybe we'll need even 25-50 servers to handle 100 spammers


[13-Jan-20 04:56 AM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind this is with txpow off, when it is active the CPU for making packets goes up thousands of times, so would need thousands of spammers to be the equivalent of a single blast loop now

Feels like there is an infinite loop in case when you use non-existent tag and pubkey for DEX_list:
1st
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_broadcast "themeassage" 0 "real_tag" "" "01pubkey" "" ""`
2nd
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_list "" 0 "not_real_tag" "" ""`  << works as it should -- returns 0 matches
3rd
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_list "" 0 "not_real_tag" "" "01pubkey"`  << hangs indefinitely, console output:

```
skip 0x7fff78018750 due to no tagsmatch

@TonyL @Sir Seven i changed internals to more easily support orderbooks, would be good to do a regression test to make sure i didnt break any existing functionality.

i havent debugged the DEX_orderbook yet, but the general idea is that you can submit bids (or asks) using the tagA=base, tagB=rel convention, and then the volA and volB will determine a price. ie. tagA=KMD, tagB=BTC, volA=10000, volB=1 -> price of 0.0001

pretty sure the DEX_orderbook has many issues, so dont worry about testing that until it at least passes the spot tests.

you can filter the orderbook by minpriority, or volume min/max for either volA or volB

all orderbook entries needs to have your pubkey specified, along with tagA and tagB being base/rel

i get 4x output on stdout

let me check that message


[15-Jan-20 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it might be harmless


[15-Jan-20 05:53 AM] SHossain#0007
when i wanted to retrieve the orderbook with this command `./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_orderbook 3 7 KMD BTC` daemon crashed


[15-Jan-20 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
does DEX_list show that packet properly?


[15-Jan-20 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
first we need to make sure it is in the DEX_list properly


[15-Jan-20 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
also, you specified minpriority of 7, when the only one there is priority of 0


[15-Jan-20 05:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so it could be empty orderbooks crash


[15-Jan-20 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
so make both a single order for both directions before doing the DEX_orderbook and make sure DEX_list shows it


[15-Jan-20 05:55 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. shall i collect the backtrace data? or try again with DEX_list first?


[15-Jan-20 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
for now, just want to see it work at least once


[15-Jan-20 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
my test net is approaching 700 million sent, so i dont want to stop it yet


[15-Jan-20 05:56 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX_list 0 0 KMD BTC <- i think that should show all the valid orders (and some without pubkey)


[15-Jan-20 05:56 AM] jl777c#5810
and without volumes will appear in that output, but for orderbook, it should be filtered

yes duplicates exist, ok i will need to filter them

but keep testing, see if DEX_orderbook returns something sane


[15-Jan-20 06:11 AM] SHossain#0007
sure


[15-Jan-20 06:12 AM] SHossain#0007
i'm wondering why priority is being shown 2. `      "priority": 2`


[15-Jan-20 06:12 AM] SHossain#0007
i did with 0 priority


[15-Jan-20 06:14 AM] SHossain#0007
if i do with priority 1, i see 1 in output


[15-Jan-20 06:14 AM] SHossain#0007
this is with priority 2

the output shows 3


[15-Jan-20 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
half the time you hash 1 extra 0 bit, raising its priority


[15-Jan-20 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
quarter the time, 2 extra 0 bits

one eighth the time 3 extra 0 bits


[15-Jan-20 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
is it a minimum priority, to make it an exact match would require to throw away half the valid results


[15-Jan-20 06:16 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. understood. nothing critical

hopefully we will see orderbook now and can make sure the price calc is sane


[15-Jan-20 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is, then the next step is to test the sorting order for both bids and asks

in case the price is the same, it should sort in order of volume, so the bigger volume order appears before the smaller (of the same price)

[15-Jan-20 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
when going from KMD to BTC it is asking to sell KMD/BTC at the calculated price, so it is in the right order, just says "bids" when it should be "asks"


[15-Jan-20 06:57 AM] SHossain#0007
i see. didn't check that part tbh


[15-Jan-20 06:57 AM] SHossain#0007
i was concentrating on getting the list shows and price clac are sane


[15-Jan-20 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
for next test, make sure the asks are in increasing price order, and the bids are in decreasing price order


[15-Jan-20 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
in case of same price, the volume of what is being traded should determine the order


[15-Jan-20 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
also plz make sure the hash and id are matching the corresponding order

` it seems the DEX_orderbook rpc is almost ready for GUI to make orders, cancel orders, display orderbook. dont have cancel working yet, but there is a cancelled field for datablobs` that's great progress. Hope 100+ nodes test will be performed soon (as soon as I'll have enough cores to handle 100 nodes), also hope that soon there will be regression tests from SirSeven


[15-Jan-20 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
and the flipping the KMD/BTC to BTC/KMD is only for the DEX_broadcast


[15-Jan-20 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
the single DEX_orderbook will display both types of broadcasts

@TonyL other than DEX_cancel missing and some validations not being done, the DEX_orderbook should work well enough to handle a relatively large amount of orderflow. so you can combine packets/sec test with making sure it propagates orderbooks properly

{Reactions}
üëç 

[15-Jan-20 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain thanks, all seems to be spot tested now. i guess the only think left to verify is to make a real orderbook with 3 bids and 3 asks and make sure it displays properly


[15-Jan-20 07:29 AM] SHossain#0007
let me create some orderbook for the other side. that should display all asks and bids in 1 call


[15-Jan-20 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the rest of orderbook stuff will be mostly internals and wont affect basic operations, will post when it is ready to spot test (along with cancel), but might be next week as i need to implement DEX_get for making the orderbook actually useful, notice the orderbook doesnt show the payload. and DEX_get ties into the reliable file sending/streaming

oh, you still need to test identical price with different volumes


[15-Jan-20 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
to make sure it is sorting by the proper volA vs volB


[15-Jan-20 07:31 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[15-Jan-20 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i think for bid vs ask, it should use a different volA or volB for the secondary sort

what does `DEX_get` do?


[15-Jan-20 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
when i write it, it will get the specified id/hash


[15-Jan-20 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
the orderbook now doesnt return the payload and if it will be 1kb in size, that is a lot of data to include in the DEX_orderbook return (though i guess i can add that if needed)


[15-Jan-20 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is that the trading client will look at the orderbook and then for the order it is interested in, DEX_get the id/hash and then use that data to verify that the orderbook entry is valid, the peer is recent, has funds, etc


[15-Jan-20 08:46 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks for the explanation


[15-Jan-20 08:54 AM] SHossain#0007
seems the tech has evolved a lot in the last 2 weeks


[15-Jan-20 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the original layer is still there, just added a messaging layer on top with the tags


[15-Jan-20 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
and today the orderbook stuff just used the messaging layer


[15-Jan-20 09:00 AM] SHossain#0007
great


[15-Jan-20 09:00 AM] SHossain#0007
can't wait to see AtomicDEX using this realtime orderbook


[15-Jan-20 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
probably will need to add some sort of network request for missing id/hash, still not sure the best way to do that. i want to only add things at the core protocol level when it is absolutely needed, or gets us a lot of new functionality.


[15-Jan-20 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i think mm2 nodes could make a bridge to the dexp2p and a bridge from dexp2p and then pretty immediately use it, but with orderbook functionality now, it seems better to do a full integration with the atomicDEX payloads in the packets. i think the reputation system can also be built on top of the dexp2p as it allows all nodes to find out about misbehaving pubkeys very quickly, just need a way to cryptographically prove misbehavior and then broadcast that info tagA:badpubs


[15-Jan-20 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i designed the tagA/tagB/pubkey so you can use it for many different purposes, though for non-orderbook usage there will be fields that are unused and a bit of bloat but it is pretty efficient overall so probably wont matter so much


[15-Jan-20 09:05 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, better to get the tech ready first, then fully integrate


[15-Jan-20 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the volA being able to have min/max filters enables a variety of things for non-orderbook usage


[15-Jan-20 09:06 AM] Alright#0419
`it seems better to do a full integration with the atomicDEX payloads in the packets`
by this do you mean any mm2 client would just do the p2p messages directly?


[15-Jan-20 09:06 AM] Alright#0419
without running coin daemon


[15-Jan-20 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
with txpow enabled, it will take 10,000x the nodes to get the same level of network saturation as the 10 nodes do so that is equivalent of 100,000 node capacity, but we will likely be limited to 1000 quotes/sec per dexp2p network


[15-Jan-20 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
dexp2p only replaces the caretaker node comms, the thing that bogged down during the last stress test. the rest would stay the same


[15-Jan-20 09:08 AM] Alright#0419
how does the txpow implementation for this work? What must be hashed with leading/trailing 0s?


[15-Jan-20 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
the packet


[15-Jan-20 09:08 AM] Alright#0419
and how is it ignored if it doesn't have required amount of 0s


[15-Jan-20 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
if it doesnt have sufficient priority, it is ignored (after received)


[15-Jan-20 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
and so, not relayed, not using any RAM


[15-Jan-20 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly an evil peer can spam invalid packets, but a counter for such invalid packets and banning such a peer solves that


[15-Jan-20 09:09 AM] Alright#0419
I noticed recently that that komodo daemon doesn't care if it's getting spammed with p2p messages


[15-Jan-20 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't seem to have much effect even when it is being spammed


[15-Jan-20 09:10 AM] Alright#0419
was testing something that was sending messages every 10ms to every peer and none of them cared


[15-Jan-20 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
BTC protocol has no protections against protocol level spam


[15-Jan-20 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
dexp2p does


[15-Jan-20 09:12 AM] Alright#0419
so first use of this in real world conditions will still have caretaker nodes relaying this data to mm2 peers?


[15-Jan-20 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i think there will need to be mm2 fullnodes vs mm2 litenodes


[15-Jan-20 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
then mm2 fullnode could all have a dexp2p node running and just use that, but that probably takes longer to integrate, so i think the plan is to have all the caretaker nodes runing dexp2p nodes and using that to get in sync with each other. but not sure of the details, i am just making dexp2p as fast and useful as possible


[15-Jan-20 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
dexp2p is very bandwidth efficient, am seeing only about 0.1% redundant packet transmissions over the theoretical minimum


[15-Jan-20 09:17 AM] jl777c#5810
basically if dexp2p cant keep up, then nothing would seem to be able to, plus dexp2p has prioritized packets, so if the dapp is monitoring network saturation and just boosts the priority it uses for sending out packets, it will maximize the chances that its packets will propagate. this will allow the entire network to adapt to a spam attack, as each incrementing of priority doubles the PoW needed


[15-Jan-20 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
or users can choose to boost priority, similar to paying higher txfee to get confirmed faster, "pay" a higher PoW priority to get propagated at a much higher rate


[15-Jan-20 09:19 AM] Alright#0419
still need to dig into it, haven't had much time to devote to this. Are there any protections to prevent front running of orders? Would that have to be built on top of this?


[15-Jan-20 09:19 AM] Alright#0419
that is a great idea, more pow, more priority


[15-Jan-20 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it is broadcast to all nodes via fully decentralized p2p network


[15-Jan-20 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly neighbor nodes would have a 1 second time advantage, but in general you wont be the neighbor to an order


[15-Jan-20 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
even if you are highly connected, a node will only be sending it out to 3 random nodes


[15-Jan-20 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you have majority of the network, then odds are you can find out first (by a second) about any order


[15-Jan-20 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
but what exactly will you do in that one second?


[15-Jan-20 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if you fill one side of the order, then you filled one side of the order, since it takes minutes to complete the order you either need to wait for it to complete to fill the other half or just do it speculatively.


[15-Jan-20 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i just dont see any practical advantage to a 1 second earlier knowledge of a quote


[15-Jan-20 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
and, alice conducts a bob auction, it wont matter anyway


[15-Jan-20 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
alice can say, "i want to do this order" and wait for the best offer to come in. in this case a 1 second advantage is meaningless

[15-Jan-20 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i still need to get recursive DEX_get working before we can do file sync


[15-Jan-20 09:24 AM] Alright#0419
When I do start trying to break this, what is the most likely attack vector? Seems spam is handled, front running doesn't matter all that much, can't think of anything ü§£


[15-Jan-20 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
evil nodes that selectively propagate orders? üòà


[15-Jan-20 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it has 3 protocol messages


[15-Jan-20 09:25 AM] Alright#0419
what are they?


[15-Jan-20 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
ping (with list of shortids)


[15-Jan-20 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
packet (with the actual packet)


[15-Jan-20 09:25 AM] SHossain#0007
probably try changing the orderbook data? :abused:


[15-Jan-20 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
get (which requests shortid)


[15-Jan-20 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
at the low level, those are the only messages


[15-Jan-20 09:26 AM] Alright#0419
are the packets signed?


[15-Jan-20 09:26 AM] SHossain#0007
txpow would do that. no?


[15-Jan-20 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
not yet, i will add that soon


[15-Jan-20 09:26 AM] SHossain#0007
ah...ok


[15-Jan-20 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
there is also no tracking/banning of bad peers yet


[15-Jan-20 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
one attack is to send a crazy long list in the ping, and then never responding


[15-Jan-20 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
this needs to be detected and such a peer banned


[15-Jan-20 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the other messages, not sure what can be abused. small stuff like sending illegal packet, this needs to be detected and banscored


[15-Jan-20 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
but all that is for after it is all working, not worried about detecting and banscoring


[15-Jan-20 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
txpow makes it permissionless to broadcast packets, as you are paying a cost for all packets


[15-Jan-20 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
the larger the packet, the more PoW is needed, just to have priority of 0


[15-Jan-20 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
first 1k is free, then up to 2k has 1 extra priority, then up to 4kb needs 2 extra priorities, ... up to 1MB


[15-Jan-20 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
for all dexp2p does, it is still only 1700 lines of code, most of it not very complex

just noticed that the 2nd node's daemon crashed with segmentation fault. wasn't running with gdb there


[15-Jan-20 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
need backtraces, like the new code changed things a bit and crashes definitely possible


[15-Jan-20 09:42 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll keep both of them running with gdb


[15-Jan-20 09:43 AM] SHossain#0007
just updating the daemon there


[15-Jan-20 09:44 AM] SHossain#0007
the crashed node wasn't doing anything apart from running the chain


[15-Jan-20 09:44 AM] SHossain#0007
now, it's restarted with gdb


[15-Jan-20 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
get the chain in the identical state


[15-Jan-20 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it is about an hour after the tests, so maybe when it is purging, it crashes


[15-Jan-20 09:45 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. will keep broadcasting and calling the data on the other node


[15-Jan-20 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
just do what you did last time


[15-Jan-20 09:47 AM] SHossain#0007
yep. on it


[15-Jan-20 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
do the broadcasts and orderbooks and then stop


[15-Jan-20 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
wait an hour until all the packets go away


[15-Jan-20 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
if this can interact with consensus of the chain it's running on, could we require a "sign up" transaction before orders are propagated?


[15-Jan-20 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, any sort of logic can be added


[15-Jan-20 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
but it isnt yet


[15-Jan-20 09:48 AM] Alright#0419
not really priority, but allows for a few different things


[15-Jan-20 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
you can have payments to CC (or fee address) required, or the priority is downshifted by a lot


[15-Jan-20 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
you can have encrypted payloads sent out, only to pubkeys that prove they made KMD payments to the sellers address


[15-Jan-20 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it is built right into the daemon, so any sort of payment conditions can be added for transactional releases of data


[15-Jan-20 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
special CC can be made to blockchain enforce arbitrary logic


[15-Jan-20 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
even KMD komodod could run -dexp2p nodes so that KMD can be used for the realtime payments with a native node


[15-Jan-20 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
plans are for nSPV support for dexp2p to allow superlite clients the summary data, like orderbooks and individual payloads


[15-Jan-20 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
this is the missing piece for all the realtime performance usecases


[15-Jan-20 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
and while there is no consensus at the dexp2p level, it can tie into the blockchain consensus for things that require consensus


[15-Jan-20 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
its almost as if i identified the missing realtime processing module that could integrate right into the blockchain and CC, and made it

[15-Jan-20 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright if you can calculate a 32 bit collision on the id (lowest 32 bits of hash minus the minimum priority and size priority), then that could create a bit of a problem for packet transmission


[15-Jan-20 09:56 AM] Alright#0419
`minus the minimum priority and size priority` this is part of the hash itself?


[15-Jan-20 09:56 AM] Alright#0419
so after removing leading trailing 0s?


[15-Jan-20 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
txpowbits is the baseline bits needed for priority 0


[15-Jan-20 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
sizepriority adds to that for packets bigger than 1kb


[15-Jan-20 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it is all part of the hash, but shifted to not lose any entropy, so for a collision you would need a full 32 bit match , on top of the minimum txpowbits. when it is set to 1, not much of a difference, but for production it will be set to 12 to 16, to that is 4096 to 65536x the PoW needed


[15-Jan-20 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a single SHA256, so you would need an fpga to calculate fast hashes


[15-Jan-20 09:59 AM] Alright#0419
yea.... üòÖ


[15-Jan-20 09:59 AM] Alright#0419
that's a hefty order


[15-Jan-20 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
probably not worth the effort to confuse the network routing of a single packet


[15-Jan-20 09:59 AM] Alright#0419
let me try to understand this though


[15-Jan-20 09:59 AM] Alright#0419
` "id": 1731644715`


[15-Jan-20 09:59 AM] Alright#0419
this id?


[15-Jan-20 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[15-Jan-20 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
convert to hex


[15-Jan-20 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
shift by 1


[15-Jan-20 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
you will see a match to the hash low bits


[15-Jan-20 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
shift by txpowbits, currently it is 1


[15-Jan-20 10:00 AM] Alright#0419
gotcha, let me try this


[15-Jan-20 10:01 AM] Alright#0419
unlikely I can find a collision like that in a timely matter


[15-Jan-20 10:01 AM] Alright#0419
basically I would want to look at someone else's packet, create another with the same id while their packet is still propagating?


[15-Jan-20 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
you have until the fifo comes full circle, the purgetime


[15-Jan-20 10:01 AM] Alright#0419
how long is that?


[15-Jan-20 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
2 seconds


[15-Jan-20 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
but maybe if the network is lagging, you have 30 seconds


[15-Jan-20 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
the fifo size is between 5 minutes to one hour, but can be as small as 2 minutes and biggest can be whatever fits in RAM


[15-Jan-20 10:02 AM] SHossain#0007

the chain param if you need it @Alright


[15-Jan-20 10:03 AM] SHossain#0007
i need to remember to run all nodes with `gdb` while testing to catch any backtrace, not only one node


[15-Jan-20 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
And if I'm able to do this? Wouldn't signing packets negate this anyway?


[15-Jan-20 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
the way the ping works is that only the shortid is sent


[15-Jan-20 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
so unless a node knows of the full hash, it wont know to ask for it


[15-Jan-20 10:05 AM] Alright#0419
shortid is just used to cut down on bandwidth?


[15-Jan-20 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
and most of the internals uses the shortid to track things, so the assumption is that shortid collision is rare


[15-Jan-20 10:05 AM] Alright#0419
what am I missing here, why is full hash not used?


[15-Jan-20 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it reduces bandwidth a lot


[15-Jan-20 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
10,000 packets per second, savings of 28 bytes per packet, is 280kb/sec


[15-Jan-20 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
times N


[15-Jan-20 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
as it is sent out to neighbors and also in the requests


[15-Jan-20 10:07 AM] Alright#0419
double sha should make it impossibly harder


[15-Jan-20 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
could well be more than 1MB/sec


[15-Jan-20 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
double sha would allow antiminers to make the hash collisions


[15-Jan-20 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
and collision of single sha vs double isnt much different


[15-Jan-20 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
highest performance was the design objective, even if not 100% accurate


[15-Jan-20 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
99.999% accuracy seems to be achieved, and the once in a billion hash collision


[15-Jan-20 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, a true hash collision needs to be for the same second


[15-Jan-20 10:09 AM] Alright#0419
a collision is already very hard to do, but not impossible. Must be some way to make it even harder and not have to worry about it


[15-Jan-20 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
as the internal hashtables are a pipeline of one hashtable for each second and the timestamp is known


[15-Jan-20 10:10 AM] Alright#0419
need to think about double vs single, have a feeling there is some clever way to make it impossibly harder


[15-Jan-20 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
all honest nodes check to make sure there is no hash collision first


[15-Jan-20 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
only a dishonest node is bypassing this and it needs to make a hash collision for the same timestamp


[15-Jan-20 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
and this will allow it to confuse some of the nodes into not getting the original packet


[15-Jan-20 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems there is no exposure to worry about and no possible to totally eliminate shortid collision


[15-Jan-20 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
higher layers can and will use hashes for 100% accuracy required usecases


[15-Jan-20 10:12 AM] Alright#0419
sure you can't eliminate it, but based on you asking me to try it, I assume it's not *that* hard. I'm sure there is some way to make it magnitudes harder than it currently is, just need to think about it


[15-Jan-20 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
without an fpga, it is basically impossible to do.


[15-Jan-20 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
you would need a billion seconds or so


[15-Jan-20 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
but you only have 30


[15-Jan-20 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
and by then it has propagated to all the nodes anyway, so too late. each additional second means more and more nodes got the original packet


[15-Jan-20 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
i wasnt expecting you to be able to do this, but wanted to put to rest any issues about shortid collisions


[15-Jan-20 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
you were asking about vulnerable areas


[15-Jan-20 10:14 AM] Alright#0419
yea understood, was asking about practical attacks vectors though ü§£


[15-Jan-20 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
blowing up a node by exhausting all its RAM, probably is the only practical attack, which is only practical if txpowbits is set to 1


[15-Jan-20 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
1MB packets would take forever to hash, maybe cant even do it within the lag time limit anyway


[15-Jan-20 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
but i allow for very fast alien processors


[15-Jan-20 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
i think 900 byte packets will have the fastest rate of data consumption


[15-Jan-20 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
10,000 packets per second is 10MB/sec, so 36GB for an hour purgetime


[15-Jan-20 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
that could cause a problem for smaller nodes


[15-Jan-20 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
but at txpowbits of 16... it will take thousands of cores to blast that much data


[15-Jan-20 10:17 AM] Alright#0419
how does a node know not to continue to propagate a packet?


[15-Jan-20 10:17 AM] Alright#0419
thinking maybe it's possible to get a packet that will just keep looping through the network indefinitely?


[15-Jan-20 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a relay count that is set to a default value


[15-Jan-20 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
maximum of 10, i think


[15-Jan-20 10:17 AM] Alright#0419
is it set client side or within the packet?


[15-Jan-20 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the first byte of the packet


[15-Jan-20 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
set by the client


[15-Jan-20 10:18 AM] Alright#0419
so packet is changing with each new propagation of it?


[15-Jan-20 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
but remember the 0.1% duplicate packets? it achieves this by tracking all packets from all peers


[15-Jan-20 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the one byte is changing, the rest is the same


[15-Jan-20 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
each honest node will decrement it


[15-Jan-20 10:19 AM] Alright#0419
so I'll setup a few nodes that always change every packet to the max value? üòÖ


[15-Jan-20 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
also, it wont send to a peer that it knows already has it


[15-Jan-20 10:20 AM] Alright#0419
reminds me of onion routing without encryption


[15-Jan-20 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
all nodes could just set it to max, but other than boosting the duplicates counts, i dont think it will do much damage. granted tripling bandwidth used is damaging, but that required corrupting every single node


[15-Jan-20 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
there is also encryption to pubkey if tagA is "inbox"


[15-Jan-20 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
but indeed it is similar to onion routing if only due to the decrementing relay counter


[15-Jan-20 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
having a few peers set it to max will just increase the local duplicates by a bit


[15-Jan-20 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
we can assume a misbehaving peer will be banscored and dropped, so you are limited to things that wont get banscored


[15-Jan-20 10:22 AM] Alright#0419
re-propogating every packet with first byte changed to max is a good place to start


[15-Jan-20 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
would be interesting to see what sort of duplicates stats you will get with that


[15-Jan-20 10:23 AM] Alright#0419
can try this tomorrow, today working on getting my dev station back up and running


[15-Jan-20 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
dexp2p doesnt have a large surface, so just start using it and you will get ideas on how to attack it. just take into account txpowbits 1 is for testnet and production will be 32k times harder (maybe will need to tune the production value based on various real world timing from nodes)

Wasm only helps with integrating at app layer.

Eg, perlin has a wasm smart contract framework, however it doesn‚Äôt work on eth/kmd/cosmos/eos/tron/etc.
CosmWasm is a new smart contract framework for cosmos, again it‚Äôs not compatible with all of the above.

A wire protocol _format_ to represent the app level artifacts/components, like the ietf standard crypto conditions, is language and signature scheme agnostic.


[16-Jan-20 08:40 AM] Mylo#8306
This is the basis of Antara.

There‚Äôs gonna be a lot of wheel reinventing & abstraction for smart contract interoperability between differing blockchain projects.  Design choice of kmd is years ahead of industry.  Whether cryptoconditions is implemented in others remains to be seen, however because a standard format has already been implemented and works, if an alternative standard becomes dominant, the ‚Äúhowto‚Äù has already been done in kmd.  It will be a matter of swapping out the standard used.  Maybe a little over simplified, but it paints a picture.

command was "DEX_orderbook 0 0 KMD BTC "


[16-Jan-20 11:09 AM] gcharang#6833
- added DEX_orderbook to the docs
- updated encryption behavior(only datablobs with tagA set as inbox are encrypted)
- included the detail that a datablob is diplayed in the response of DEX_list only if all the filters' values match

@gcharang this is difficult bug to track down. i am assuming it is rare and doesnt happen very often? i made a few changes and also purgetime is 5 minutes to speed up the process. it happened during purge and orderbook, so you can create that condition after 5 minutes.


[17-Jan-20 01:43 AM] gcharang#6833
ok, will try to reproduce


[17-Jan-20 02:27 AM] TonyL#3577
On latest I'm starting to lose a lot packages with 10 nodes on the same server where 12 worked fine before: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/XSpGWkH5HK/
At the same time with 5 nodes it's almost 100% https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/2HzVfvg2Wx/


[17-Jan-20 02:28 AM] TonyL#3577
Visually loading on CPU is the same and not close to 100% in case of 10 nodes


[17-Jan-20 02:30 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe i dont understand the numbers. it seems in both cases all nodes got around 7000 packets?


[17-Jan-20 02:31 AM] TonyL#3577
700x it's a node port number


[17-Jan-20 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810
aha, ok it does seem a 10% loss with 10 nodes


[17-Jan-20 02:32 AM] TonyL#3577
7000 is a first node, 7001 is the second and etc


[17-Jan-20 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810
not exactly a lot, but much worse than before.


[17-Jan-20 02:32 AM] TonyL#3577
If needed I can retest on same servers with 10 nods on some older specific commit


[17-Jan-20 02:33 AM] TonyL#3577
To try find out where it became worser


[17-Jan-20 02:34 AM] jl777c#5810
my guess is -redndant this lis will work and after that it has higher loss


[17-Jan-20 02:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i added packet signing, but only if pubkey tag is set, so maybe not


[17-Jan-20 02:35 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, if it is fast to track down, it would help


[17-Jan-20 02:36 AM] jl777c#5810
also, what is the number of peers for both tests?


[17-Jan-20 02:37 AM] jl777c#5810
different p2p network topology will likely have very different delivery percentages


[17-Jan-20 02:38 AM] jl777c#5810
my guess is that it is due to different network topology more than anything else


[17-Jan-20 02:46 AM] jl777c#5810
for these tests, the specific peers for each node should be recorded. my prediction is that certain toplogies will get 99%+ while others will get 90% or less (with 10 nodes)


[17-Jan-20 02:56 AM] TonyL#3577
topology is non-det each time because peers choosing randomly, yes. But I've run 10 nodes cases multiple time with very similar results


[17-Jan-20 02:56 AM] TonyL#3577
will add network info to the test result output as well


[17-Jan-20 03:23 AM] jl777c#5810
just the raw getpeerinfo output from each node, to allow post mortem analysis


[17-Jan-20 03:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Found the version on which 10 nodes on the same server works fine for me:

that's strange - I'm not sure how to avoid that

will try to wait 1 minute between nodes start as an experiment


[17-Jan-20 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
it is very tricky and unpredictable


[17-Jan-20 04:31 AM] TonyL#3577
now I'm waiting just 5 seconds, maybe that is not enough


[17-Jan-20 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe start with a fully connected nodes and remove peers?


[17-Jan-20 04:32 AM] TonyL#3577
that may work, if nodes will get more than 1 peer for sure


[17-Jan-20 04:32 AM] TonyL#3577
I thought about few blocks mining also


[17-Jan-20 04:33 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe mine one block on each from 9 nodes before tests starts and they will find each other with blockchain god's help


[17-Jan-20 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
sometimes doing addnode for all the other nodes actually works and you can get a fully connected network, where all nodes connect to all other nodes


[17-Jan-20 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
would be good to test that network topology to make sure having fully connected network is 100% and then reducing from there


[17-Jan-20 04:45 AM] TonyL#3577
```
node0
node1: addnode 0
node2: addnode 0,1 
...
nodeN: addnode 0...n-1

this way?


[17-Jan-20 04:45 AM] jl777c#5810
no, simplere


[17-Jan-20 04:45 AM] jl777c#5810
after all nodes are up and running


[17-Jan-20 04:45 AM] jl777c#5810
addnode 0, addnode 1, addnode 2, ... addnode n-1


[17-Jan-20 04:46 AM] TonyL#3577
ah, by command


[17-Jan-20 04:46 AM] jl777c#5810
on all nodes, it doesnt hurt to addnode on that specific node


[17-Jan-20 04:46 AM] TonyL#3577
it doesn't work, I've tried


[17-Jan-20 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
hence ```sometimes doing addnode for all the other nodes actually works ```


[17-Jan-20 04:48 AM] jl777c#5810
also a set of peers that have been around a while, behaves differently than brand new nodes


[17-Jan-20 04:48 AM] jl777c#5810
something about the contents of peers.dat seems to make it prefer specific peers

@TonyL maybe it is even a bit slower, had to add more mutex to prevent the rare crash. it is sustaining 4k/sec on my testnet, which is pretty good performance.
i made a LOT of internals changes. most which has no visible external effect, but we now have a command processor for commands that are embedded in the normal payloads


[17-Jan-20 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
this allows proper implementation of DEX_cancel, which needs to take effect networkwide. for commands, it is required to have at least a CMDPRIORITY (currently set to 4) as it will require a bit more processing than normal packets. the way to send out a command is to just use the internal broadcast function with a different funcid than 'Q', using 'X' for cancel. i didnt implement the actual functionality yet, but the 100x harder part of being able to issue a onetime executed command networkwide, it is solved. on the local node, it is possible that the same command will be invoked more than once, but this is a small overhead


[17-Jan-20 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the other change is that ALL packets with a pubkey tag are encrypted. this includes all the orderbook entries. if you are thinking about this, you might wonder who is it encrypted to? since the orderbook is public info, we need all nodes to be able to decrypt it


[17-Jan-20 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
very good question!


[17-Jan-20 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
what i do is encrypt to the publicly known privkey, so all nodes are able to decrypt and the sender that encrypts it can be verified. the reason to do this is now we can validate that any non "inbox" tagged packet with a pubkey was indeed sent by that pubkey. [this also was needed to properly support DEX_cancel as we cant just let anybody cancel a specific order]


[17-Jan-20 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
now, the general method of having networkwide commands is completed, it will be much faster to add new functionality. but for now i want to make sure the current level of code is not losing a lot of sync percentage relative to the best levels we have seen


[17-Jan-20 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL i have a theory about the lower success rate. are you blasting with ffff ?


[17-Jan-20 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if not, then the mined priority will vary from the specified and when that happens, if a node detects it is lagging, it will start prioritizing. when this happens the lowest priority will start suffering, but if none of the nodes are showing LAG in the status, then it seems this is not the case


[17-Jan-20 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
one interesting test is if you change the TXPOWBITS from 1 to 12


[17-Jan-20 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
that will lower the total packets you can send, but we can see if it will propagate better at closer to production values


[17-Jan-20 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
this blasting is really not a real world packet flow


[17-Jan-20 07:52 AM] TonyL#3577
im sending random messages


[17-Jan-20 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810
random messages would get a distribution of priorities


[17-Jan-20 07:53 AM] TonyL#3577
I bet there was "LAG" in stats


[17-Jan-20 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577
let me re-test with 10 nodes to be sure


[17-Jan-20 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
aha! LAG combined with distribution of priorities will guarantee <100%

[17-Jan-20 07:58 AM] TonyL#3577
there is `lag` field and also `LAG` - not sure if it makes the difference


[17-Jan-20 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
lag <deleted> (fast medium slow) are the lag times for the deleted packets, for a fast/medium/long term time frame


[17-Jan-20 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
200, 1000 and 10000 approx window size for fast, med, slow


[17-Jan-20 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you see lags that are worse as it is faster, it is detecting possible lag. the other indicator is pend. if this number goes up steadily it will trigger LAG


[17-Jan-20 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
LAG means it is in LAG mode, which is when prioritization kicks in


[17-Jan-20 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
so lag (fast, med, slow) + pend -> state of LAG or not. if LAG is detected then a node goes into a much more passive mode and this is when prioritization has its biggest effect. there are several things it does, one of them is for a given runtime context with another peer, it will only request packets of the highest priority. assuming we are not saturating the network, this wont affect things much as eventually all packets are requested


[17-Jan-20 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
however if we are lagging, waiting until all the highest priority packets are requested and iterating, means the lowest priorities can be starved  and never requested. this is how a low priority packet is "dropped", it is basically never requested


[17-Jan-20 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so no bandwidth wasted for low priority packets that cant be propagated anyway


[17-Jan-20 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i think a lot can be learned by studying the internals of dexp2p, there are a lot of very simple, yet powerful methods, all working together


[17-Jan-20 08:06 AM] TonyL#3577
why lag detecting only for some of the 10 nodes? They are on the same host and CPU utilized on half


[17-Jan-20 08:07 AM] TonyL#3577
network latency should be equal for all (~0)


[17-Jan-20 08:08 AM] TonyL#3577
is lag just indicating that packages "stuck" in lowest priority protocol traffic jam and there is delay from estimated delivery time and it's non-det for equal conditions nodes?

[17-Jan-20 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
they might be on the same host, but the performance seen by those two nodes are quite different


[17-Jan-20 08:12 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe OS allocating resources between daemons some tricky way


[17-Jan-20 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
and as expected there is a large range of priorities


[17-Jan-20 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
you cant expect identical performance from 1/Nth of a server


[17-Jan-20 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe they all have identical probabilities, but for them to all get the identical performance would be quite unexpected


[17-Jan-20 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
like having 10 different nodes toss a coin 1000 times each and all of them getting exactly 500 heads and 500 tails. while possible it is certainly not expected


[17-Jan-20 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
your question seems to indicate you expect all nodes to get identical results...


[17-Jan-20 08:14 AM] TonyL#3577
I thought that if I spin 6 identical processes with resources allocation <<100% they will not be prioritized that much


[17-Jan-20 08:15 AM] TonyL#3577
It seems better to use docker containers for this test


[17-Jan-20 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
the above stats show 100% in sync


[17-Jan-20 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, sorry, not all have the same number of total


[17-Jan-20 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is the lag (23.3158 18.4461 5.7842)


[17-Jan-20 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
at 20 seconds of lag, it certainly triggers LAG mode


[17-Jan-20 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems there is some sort of bandwidth bottleneck?


[17-Jan-20 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
what happens with TXPOWBITS 12


[17-Jan-20 08:17 AM] TonyL#3577
let me try `TXPOWBITS 12`
`it seems there is some sort of bandwidth bottleneck?`
It might be  bottleneck of the network interface


[17-Jan-20 08:21 AM] TonyL#3577
oh! that's explaining my yesterdays test


[17-Jan-20 08:22 AM] TonyL#3577
I've took two machines with 16vCPU and 32vCPU: on machine with 16vCPU fit 10 servers max, so I thought it'll be ~20 servers for the machine with 32vCPU


[17-Jan-20 08:22 AM] TonyL#3577
but I was able to spin same 10 nodes without losses on the 32vCPU machine, however CPU loading lowered twice


[17-Jan-20 08:23 AM] TonyL#3577
And then I've updated the daemon in my tests and both machines fit only 5 nodes üòÖ


[17-Jan-20 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
does this mean there is no recent performance drop?


[17-Jan-20 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
txpowbits can balance the CPU vs network requirement, at 1 it is very network resource hungry


[17-Jan-20 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
at 12 it becomes 4096 times more CPU hungry


[17-Jan-20 08:30 AM] TonyL#3577
`does this mean there is no recent performance drop?`- no, there is on my side


[17-Jan-20 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
so you can tune it to fit your hardware setup so both are maxxed at about the same time


[17-Jan-20 08:31 AM] TonyL#3577
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/XsGrN4CZwn/ with `TXPOWBITS 12` less than 10% losing for 10 nodes


[17-Jan-20 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems more like 100% except for a couple problem nodes for each


[17-Jan-20 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
much cleaner stats, my guess is that the peers without the 100% are sparsely connected


[17-Jan-20 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
do all nodes have 3+ connections?


[17-Jan-20 08:34 AM] TonyL#3577
no, some got 1


[17-Jan-20 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
let me guess, node 5 and 9?


[17-Jan-20 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
their stats are pretty bad for most of the other nodes, dead end topology makes it hard to stream data to them. but i think you will find that they are getting the highest priority packets at a good percentage


[17-Jan-20 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i will think of how to increase the sync rates for such isolated nodes, but it could just run into bottlenecks for the node that it connects through, so i want to get the reliable file sync protocol implemented first and see how well it does on these sparsely connected nodes


[17-Jan-20 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if that takes care of it, then we just need to say that to stream you need 3+ peers


[17-Jan-20 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
and if we can now track performance for a 10 network node, hopefully we can test 100 node network and see how it does


[17-Jan-20 08:43 AM] TonyL#3577
I've tried a little bit more - looks like there should be two conditions for bad performance in this little network


[17-Jan-20 08:43 AM] TonyL#3577
1) you should have not many connections (1 or max 2)


[17-Jan-20 08:43 AM] TonyL#3577
2) you shouldn't have connections to the node with most amount of connections in the network (node 6000 got 6-7 connections usually - it specified as a `addnode` for first 3 nodes after it)


[17-Jan-20 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
too many connections shouldnt matter so much, unless you have a bunch of connections to nodes of 1)


[17-Jan-20 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
in that case all these nodes are having to go through your node. i think if there are no nodes in 1) then even 6 connections, it wont be so bad, but this is very very difficult to know ahead of time


[17-Jan-20 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it is good that we are understanding the various p2p topologies and the issues at this scale. i think at the 100 node scale we will discover new things too, and might need some algo tweaks to overcome it


[17-Jan-20 08:48 AM] TonyL#3577
Yeah, 100 nodes should be very interesting. Will try to interconnect 100 nodes during the weekends - still need to add to the scripts support for multiply IP addresses and data collecting from multiple test hosts. Now everything tuned for single server


[17-Jan-20 08:50 AM] TonyL#3577
`it is good that we are understanding the various p2p topologies and the issues at this scale. i think at the 100 node scale we will discover new things too, and might need some algo tweaks to overcome it` my main concern after test on the network from 10 peers is that peers not finding another peers (maybe thats because there are no blocks lets say)
So in case when I have 1 peer node, even if nodes are up for an hour - connections amount on nodes is const


[17-Jan-20 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
this is good and bad


[17-Jan-20 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
good as the network topology is not changing during the test


[17-Jan-20 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
bad if we cant get the topology we want


[17-Jan-20 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
your idea of generating a few blocks might make it find peers better


[17-Jan-20 08:51 AM] TonyL#3577
I've tried - no luck as well. maybe transactions also needed


[17-Jan-20 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
how many blocks?


[17-Jan-20 08:51 AM] TonyL#3577
I've started mining on node let's say 6, mined around 50 blocks


[17-Jan-20 08:51 AM] TonyL#3577
and still 1 connection


[17-Jan-20 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
way too few blocks


[17-Jan-20 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
until 100 or even 1000 i dont think it will help with peer finding


[17-Jan-20 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
one idea that combines another test of -dexp2p isolation can be used


[17-Jan-20 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
pick an existing assetchain and just spin up -dexp2p nodes


[17-Jan-20 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it should only send DEX messages between dexp2p nodes, but we need to test this


[17-Jan-20 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
that would give you an existing set of blocks to sync to, maybe ILN?


[17-Jan-20 08:53 AM] TonyL#3577
yep, ILN should be the fastest one


[17-Jan-20 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
it is very convenient to have a notarized on-demand chain without many blocks


[17-Jan-20 08:56 AM] TonyL#3577
That interesting test, definitely worth to try before 100 nodes network


[17-Jan-20 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it sounds like there are no specific bugs for me at this point, but you have good ideas on how to scale up the testnet. ultimately being able to stream on a larger scale network is what it is all about


[17-Jan-20 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
if we cant do that, then dexp2p doesnt solve the scaling issue.

@SHossain latest version should be crashproof. it also should support DEX_cancel id


[17-Jan-20 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
support for DEX_cancel 0 <pubkey> is there, just doesnt do anything except make a printout


[17-Jan-20 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
but the DEX_cancel id, should actually cancel the order and it shouldnt appear in the orderbooks anymore, you can verify cancelled status in the DEX_list


[17-Jan-20 09:55 AM] SHossain#0007
will update and test now

its a bit slow now and might cause a crash if you cancelled one that is being purged, but i will fix that later and just wanted to get the basics working


[17-Jan-20 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
now the only test is to make sure you cant cancel another pubkeys order


[17-Jan-20 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
and that it disappears from the orderbook


[17-Jan-20 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i will also add a cancel all orders from pubkey, which is a handy and quick cancelall command, but that is not yet


[17-Jan-20 10:32 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. then, i have to restart the other node with pubkey


[17-Jan-20 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
use DEX_stats


[17-Jan-20 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it will show its pubkey


[17-Jan-20 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it just changes each time you start


[17-Jan-20 10:32 AM] SHossain#0007
`018de3621076444692283d8b098eb11d7dd5a2dfba5a1a3bd377a0c059fe9b9d77`


[17-Jan-20 10:33 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, it changes everytime. but, if i start the daemon with `-pubkey=`, it stays the same


[17-Jan-20 10:33 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. without restart, i'll use that now. create order from nodeA and then, try to cancel from nodeB


[17-Jan-20 10:34 AM] SHossain#0007
```illegal trying to cancel another pubkey datablob! banscore this```

[17-Jan-20 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
sorry, crash will be intermittent


[17-Jan-20 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
no easy bugs for you


[17-Jan-20 10:35 AM] SHossain#0007
both nodes running with `gdb` today üòÖ


[17-Jan-20 10:36 AM] SHossain#0007
i assume the cancelled orders will be deleted when purge occurs


[17-Jan-20 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, all orders get purged


[17-Jan-20 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
make sure to check for memory leaks, now with encryption to all pubkey tags, there is a chance for memory leak


[17-Jan-20 10:37 AM] SHossain#0007
i see. so, GUI has to look at the `cancelled` part for filtering


[17-Jan-20 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX_orderbook should automatically look for cancelled field


[17-Jan-20 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
if not, that is a bug


[17-Jan-20 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
low level DEX_list callers would need to check cancelled


[17-Jan-20 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
and its meaning can be dapp specific


[17-Jan-20 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
you can find all cancels with DEX_list 0 0 cancel


[17-Jan-20 10:38 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, orderbook filters that out


[17-Jan-20 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
i think -dexp2p now has all required functionality for atomicDEX orderbooks


[17-Jan-20 10:39 AM] SHossain#0007
`low level DEX_list callers would need to check cancelled`
you are right. DEX_list shows all orders while DEX_orderbook filters out the cancelled ones


[17-Jan-20 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
whether it can scale arbitrarily is still to be validated


[17-Jan-20 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
but since -dexp2p is handcrafted C code, i would be very surprised if it cant be tuned to work very well at large scale


[17-Jan-20 10:42 AM] SHossain#0007
DEX_cancel is very fast


[17-Jan-20 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
but it probably takes a millisecond to run


[17-Jan-20 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
and it needs to propagate to the node first, so latency is a bit of an issue


[17-Jan-20 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
if we had a simple gui that allowed to submit orders and cancel them and it displays the orderbook, then people could do pretend order entry and see how long it takes for the orderbook to update


[17-Jan-20 10:44 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, that's a good idea


[17-Jan-20 10:47 AM] SHossain#0007
just for reporting, i had 2 orders that were cancelled. everytime i issue DEX_orderbook i get these printouts in stdout (these are non-critical and seems orderbooks just skips those are cancelled before displaying normal orders)
```

probably i could have said, that your printout shows correct info


[17-Jan-20 10:50 AM] SHossain#0007
if an entry is already cancelled, we get these printouts `modval.1716 (21b0e7ba) already cancelled at 1579285750` which seems right


[17-Jan-20 10:51 AM] SHossain#0007
you only die once üòÑ


[17-Jan-20 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, until cancel is out of debugging, i will keep those there. i am not happy at how slow it is internally


[17-Jan-20 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it should be 10,000x faster, just there was an internals confusion that wasnt fatal, but force me to use a slow cancel


[17-Jan-20 10:55 AM] SHossain#0007
the `id` values are different when i use `DEX_orderbook` and `DEX_list`


[17-Jan-20 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, this is the issue

all the nodes need to update state and while it isnt 100% guaranteed, with min priority of 4, the odds are very good a cancel packet will propagate fully


[17-Jan-20 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
and even if it doesnt, it isnt a giant disaster


[17-Jan-20 11:18 AM] SHossain#0007
the cancel order propagated to other node as well and both shows same data


[17-Jan-20 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
now we have a way for doing a single time function to run on all the nodes, at most once, with the failure mode being it wont run at all if it doesnt see it. so it wont be for all usecases, but for a lot of usecases will be good enough


[17-Jan-20 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it would even be possible to implement a balance based currency, though to make it 100% bulletproof would take a bit of work


[17-Jan-20 11:21 AM] SHossain#0007
only for one order the timestamp and recvtime is slightly different on the nodeB as the nodes are on different network in different countries

[17-Jan-20 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
actually, that is the effect of the local node doing it locally, while the rest of nodes doing it remotely


[17-Jan-20 11:22 AM] SHossain#0007
other 3 orders has same timestamp and recvtime on both nodes


[17-Jan-20 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if you have N nodes, the sending node could have a slightly lower timestamp than all the other nodes

https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo-cctools-python/tree/master/scripts/dexp2p/multi-server spent over 10 hours to code these Frankenstein scripts
it's really mind-blowing when you need to operate multiply servers. Easiest task was just to start the chain - harder to parse and evaluate the data correct way. 

Even in simple network case (2 servers and 5 nodes on each server) you getting 50 parts for DEX_list on each server (messages from 10 nodes for each of 5 nodes or nNodes^2 parts in total). And there is tag length limitation so I broadcast port as identification to tag and IP as message and then filtering. So for 100 nodes it'll be 10000 DEX_list parts in total). It seems I need few more hours to debug scripts (now it's producing nNodes DEX_list parts instread of nNodes^2) and then will be reasonable to spin many nodes

[18-Jan-20 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
no duplicates so far and pending is close to 0, so network is not saturated


[18-Jan-20 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i just need to see the stats printouts from the different test runs


[18-Jan-20 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the time lag is too big now


[18-Jan-20 08:36 AM] TonyL#3577
I can reduce nodes amount = loading on CPU to see if it helps with lag


[18-Jan-20 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
MAXFANOUT will likely have the biggest effect


[18-Jan-20 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
3 was a decent value for 10 nodes, but not for 100

`MAXFANOUT = 4`  : https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/H7XRQtQCdM/

[18-Jan-20 09:21 AM] TonyL#3577
on some nodes I can see something like a `err.572 pend.4884` is it fine?


[18-Jan-20 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
some nodes having connectivity issues. it seems i need to tweak the algo a fair amount


[18-Jan-20 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
err is too much lag


[18-Jan-20 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
overall the lag seems much lower


[18-Jan-20 09:33 AM] TonyL#3577
Going to test `MAXFANOUT = 6` also if this info can help


[18-Jan-20 09:33 AM] TonyL#3577
will take ~30 minutes to update/restart network and collect data


[18-Jan-20 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
yes maxfanout 6 is useful data


[18-Jan-20 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i also made a special version that disables the LAG mode, so it is only valid if you dont saturate the network. current settings seem ok for this


[18-Jan-20 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i have a feeling it is the LAG handling that is causing even more lag

it does seem the network is a bit oversaturated. can you keep the number of packets the same and reduce txpowbits to 6


[18-Jan-20 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
that way it will reduce CPU and not increase network bandwidth


[18-Jan-20 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
for now, we need to see a 100 node network get close to 100% sync


[18-Jan-20 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
so the latest version, with txpowbits 6, and broadcast packets at the same rate


[18-Jan-20 10:09 AM] TonyL#3577
`so the latest version, with txpowbits 6, and broadcast packets at the same rate` 

Should I left `MAXFANOUT 6` ? Not 100% sure what determining packets broadcasting rate (in spot of params, test conditions such as hardware and nodes amount will remain the same)


[18-Jan-20 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, keep it at 6, it did no harm and could help

you might need to add sleeps to your blasting loops


[18-Jan-20 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
with txpowbits at 6, packets will go out much faster, so much less CPU and a lot more bandwidth


[18-Jan-20 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you slow down packet generation to a fixed rate, we can keep network bandwidth the same and reduce CPU


[18-Jan-20 10:12 AM] TonyL#3577
I can add 1 second sleep lets say


[18-Jan-20 10:12 AM] TonyL#3577
or it's too much?


[18-Jan-20 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
1 second sleep after every N packets

how long did the test take to run, from start of blasting?

I run it approx. 2-3 minutes


[18-Jan-20 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
4000 packets from each node?

so 20 packets per second for 200 seconds

you can create any chain with `DEX` at the beginning of ticker, add `-dexp2p=2` and play around


[18-Jan-20 10:46 AM] TonyL#3577
`DEX` at the beginning is not necessary, just `-dexp2p` enabled is needed

how many peers spamming does it take to saturate the network?


[18-Jan-20 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
depends on the node bandwidth, cpu, network topology, txpowbits, packetsize


[18-Jan-20 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
on my 10 node network at low txpowbits, 5 or 6 that are blasting is when it starts saturating, then the prioritization kicks in


[18-Jan-20 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
with txpowbits of 16, you would need 50,000 nodes

[18-Jan-20 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
at least we know that this 50 node loading is close to the borderline


[18-Jan-20 11:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
I was thinking about BTC and KMD, right now KMD uses BTC hash power to secure. What if BTC for some reason stops being the biggest, can KMD change to any other coin? And what if KMD would be the biggest, will it use it's own hashrate then? And how does that mechanicly work, does KMD check what chain to use or is that a manual operation


[18-Jan-20 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure if you can tally the sync percentage,


[18-Jan-20 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD wont ever have the highest hash rate, let us not worry about silly things


[18-Jan-20 11:50 AM] TonyL#3577
`not sure if you can tally the sync percentage,` its automation may take at least one day of puzzle solving


[18-Jan-20 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
we can change to any other coin


[18-Jan-20 11:50 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL higher priority is validating 100+ node blasts


[18-Jan-20 11:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
Allright, sorry for the intermezzo guys. My non tech mind keeps thinking about those "silly" things


[18-Jan-20 11:50 AM] TonyL#3577
got it, so x2 CPU power 100 nodes test first


[18-Jan-20 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
if we cant get the lag down to the several second level, we need to tweak things anyway


[18-Jan-20 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
only when these low level stats are happy, does it make sense to validate the specific sync, though doing that could well help debug sync issues


[18-Jan-20 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810
i am very happy with this 50 node result. it is 5x bigger network and getting basically the same type of numbers than my 10 node testnet

`only when these low level stats are happy, does it make sense to validate the specific sync, though doing that could well help debug sync issues`
I'm already collect all the data to check sync - just need to write script which comparing different servers output. Shouldn't be so rocketscience with the fresh head


[18-Jan-20 11:52 AM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c both node see same data on WLC21 chain. it works!


[18-Jan-20 11:53 AM] TonyL#3577
hope tomorrow we'll see stable 100 nodes hehe. good day/night everybody!

[18-Jan-20 11:53 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain the more important test is to make sure that blasting away on the -dexp2p WLC21 nodes doesnt affect normal WLC21 nodes


[18-Jan-20 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the way to test is to add a normal WLC21 node and monitor its bandwidth usage, compare the bandwidth usage to a -dexp2p WLC21 node during a blaster loop


[18-Jan-20 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
we want to make sure the -dexp2p nodes are isolated from the other nodes


[18-Jan-20 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
this way, even KMD can get -dexp2p


[18-Jan-20 11:56 AM] SHossain#0007
you want the -dexp2p nodes to use only `-connect=` param between both of them?


[18-Jan-20 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[18-Jan-20 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
they should be normal peers


[18-Jan-20 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
and peers of each other


[18-Jan-20 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
being the only -dexp2p nodes, all the DEX messaging should be isolated just between the two of them


[18-Jan-20 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
we dont want it to bleed over into the normal nodes


[18-Jan-20 11:57 AM] SHossain#0007
ah....i see


[18-Jan-20 11:57 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, i have added them as normal peer and 2 nodes with dexp2p are connected


[18-Jan-20 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
is one of your normal WLC21 nodes a peer? and can you run bmon on it?


[18-Jan-20 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
we want to see bmon bandwidth go up a lot during the blaster, only on the -dexp2p nodes


[18-Jan-20 11:58 AM] SHossain#0007
i have normal WLC21 running on my NN servers


[18-Jan-20 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can monitor its bandwidth usage, somehow, that would be good


[18-Jan-20 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/w6N4mVdFxG/ the is a somewhat normal blaster test result, a bit on the laggy side due to CPU at 80% to 95%+


[18-Jan-20 12:01 PM] TonyL#3577
* I'm sending random messages, not ffff so results may vary for ffff on the same hardware server


[18-Jan-20 12:02 PM] TonyL#3577
just thought that random messages case closer to reality if simulate a network


[18-Jan-20 12:02 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. started bmon on my NN server. if anything spikes up, i would notice. if you think this is not right way, i can setup WLC21 on a separate server


[18-Jan-20 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
that should be good enough


[18-Jan-20 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
assuming the bandwidth you get on the dexp2p nodes added to the NN node will be noticeable


[18-Jan-20 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL random messages explains the 1% CPU per 20/tx vs 100/tx for me


[18-Jan-20 12:06 PM] SHossain#0007
yep. sending you bandwidth monitoring link on one of the blasting servers


[18-Jan-20 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i use ffff, which is a lot more efficient


[18-Jan-20 12:06 PM] SHossain#0007
i will use `ffff`


[18-Jan-20 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
but you are right, it is a lot more realistic to use random messages, and also it will allow making simulated orderbook quotes


[18-Jan-20 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the WLC test, broadcast ffff is the way to do it


[18-Jan-20 12:09 PM] SHossain#0007

@jl777c i fear you fixed the wrong bug :-)
https://github.com/jl777/komodo/commit/7a30542946edcc0d5c61cf11454ab9a597e5640b
when i now do `komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_broadcast "hello" 0 "BTC" "KMD" "" "0.07" "1100" # ask`, which should be the ask, like in the above example, i now get
```

@jl777c looks like i was confused/looked in the wrong terminal last time
everything is fine now, only price inverted (guess you only need to revert the last change)... sorry


[20-Jan-20 03:02 AM] cipi#4502
wait, no, the `bid`  has `baseamount` and `relamount` inverted...


[20-Jan-20 03:05 AM] cipi#4502
hmmm, or should it be that way? because i was querying the orderbook with `komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_orderbook 10 0 BTC KMD`
so base is BTC


[20-Jan-20 03:06 AM] cipi#4502
yes, i think it should be that way... so only price inverted atm


[20-Jan-20 03:09 AM] jl777c#5810
it is all very confusing. pushed a version that i think should be right, but please verify both BTC KMD and KMD BTC orderbooks to make sure all base/rel amounts and prices are correct


[20-Jan-20 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i changed to %0.15f format, but maybe %0.8f is sufficient


[20-Jan-20 03:14 AM] cipi#4502
i think 15f is safer... there was a utxo-coin (don't remember the name), that has more than 8 decimals... and all the erc20 also have more than 8

[20-Jan-20 03:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it is confusing, but once you figure out how to do an ask vs bid, it should be a matter of updating the numbers. you can calculate the price based on the volumes, and also the volumes based on the price


[20-Jan-20 03:24 AM] cipi#4502
yes, i think i have it now... and the good thing is, i know how to get the values from coinpaprika for the above orderbook


[20-Jan-20 03:25 AM] cipi#4502
https://api.coinpaprika.com/v1/price-converter?base_currency_id=btc-bitcoin&quote_currency_id=kmd-komodo&amount=0.07
where amount is your BTC balance you want to sell and the `price` from the json you get is the volume you have to put in the above `DEX_broadcast` (instead of 1100)


[20-Jan-20 03:25 AM] jl777c#5810
very nice! maybe a very frequently updating set of orderbook broadcasts can be a very good test


[20-Jan-20 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
without exceeding any remote api limits


[20-Jan-20 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
probably no way to come close to saturating the network, but at least there will be a lot of realworld info, which will be much easier to detect data problems than just random data


[20-Jan-20 03:27 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure if you saw, but DEX_cancel is half working, currently you can only cancel a specific id


[20-Jan-20 03:27 AM] cipi#4502
i will modify my script (that i use for real mm2 orderbook) to do that... and simply run it for a couple of coins...


[20-Jan-20 03:28 AM] jl777c#5810
once i fix the crashing bug, i will add DEX_cancel pubkey, which will cancel all current orders


[20-Jan-20 03:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i think already, there is enough functionality for it to be a useful DEX orderbook network


[20-Jan-20 03:28 AM] jl777c#5810
let me know if there are any missing functionality


[20-Jan-20 03:30 AM] cipi#4502
sure, will do
one question: the `destpub33` that may be specified in the DEX_broadcast is intended to be used as the pubkey of the mm2 node that has the order?


[20-Jan-20 03:30 AM] jl777c#5810
i changed the name in the rpc help to be pubkey33


[20-Jan-20 03:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a bit quirky


[20-Jan-20 03:31 AM] jl777c#5810
if the tagA is "inbox", then it is encrypted to the pubkey


[20-Jan-20 03:31 AM] jl777c#5810
if tagA is anything else, then it serves as authentication and uses the corresponding privkey to encrypt it to a publickly known privkey


[20-Jan-20 03:32 AM] jl777c#5810
so for DEX_broadcast, yes, use your local nodes pubkey (starting with 01, available from DEX_stats) and that will authenticate the broadcast is coming from your node


[20-Jan-20 03:32 AM] jl777c#5810
inside the payload can be the bitcoin pubkey, address, utxo list, atomic swap details, etc


[20-Jan-20 03:33 AM] jl777c#5810
by separating the -dexp2p pubkey from the bitcoin pubkey, this allows to build a reputation based on the -dexp2p pubkey, so you dont have to start from scratch when changing the bitcoin/KMD address


[20-Jan-20 03:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it does allow a -dexp2p pubkey to behave badly and then change to a new one and reuse the same bitcoin pubkey, but that can be caught by checking to see if a new dexp2p is using a known bitcoin pubkey


[20-Jan-20 03:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and i guess inheriting whatever reputation it had


[20-Jan-20 03:35 AM] cipi#4502
ok, that makes sense... was wondering why the pubkey on dexp2p was decoupled from pubkey of mm2... now i understand
but that means that every mm2 node needs to run komodod with dexp2p, right?


[20-Jan-20 03:35 AM] jl777c#5810
in general, the -dexp2p can be used for broadcasting realtime things, like a bad pubkey for atomic swaps, maybe an tagA "alerts", tagB "swapfail"


[20-Jan-20 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
depending on whether -dexp2p will be used as an alternate means or the only means


[20-Jan-20 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
it is relatively lightweight if using a small purgetime


[20-Jan-20 03:37 AM] cipi#4502
yes, already saw that is uses much less RAM then "normal" komodod


[20-Jan-20 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it looks like i might have finally fixed the purgetime crash, at least i have my testnet not crashing after 10 minutes so far. it never got past 3 minutes of purging before


[20-Jan-20 03:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the bug was very subtle and was triggered by packets random lag making the linked list not have a sorted timestamp


[20-Jan-20 03:39 AM] jl777c#5810
when purging, it stopped if the head of the list was younger than the purgetime, but on the other side of it could well be packets that are already expired


[20-Jan-20 03:40 AM] jl777c#5810
still this alone isnt enough to cause a crash, it had to combine with not all codepaths being mutex protected, so most of the time it is ok, but this case of having expired packets that are still around allowed some edge cases to cause a 1 in a million ptr corruption


[20-Jan-20 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
at least that is my latest theory on this one. i knew i would be punished for not mutexing all codepaths


[20-Jan-20 03:42 AM] jl777c#5810
before you ask why i didnt simply mutex all codepaths to avoid this pain, the reason is that 90% of the performance is lost if you mutex everything. the key to fast operation is going as fast as you can into the rotating hashtables without worrying about collisions


[20-Jan-20 03:50 AM] cipi#4502
that sounds much more complicated than i first thought
have you changed the default purge time? was is it atm?


[20-Jan-20 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
for purge testing it is set to 5 minutes now


[20-Jan-20 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the big complication is the need to make localhost rpc calls to access all the internal data


[20-Jan-20 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
this creates all sorts of race conditions


[20-Jan-20 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
and when you are processing thousands per second, that is literally several per millisecond


[20-Jan-20 03:53 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c 
> if tagA is anything else, then it serves as authentication and uses the corresponding privkey to encrypt it to a publickly known privkey

is the below statement correct?
```
if tagA is anything else, the datablob is signed by the pubkey provided through `pubkey33` and also encrypted to a publicly known keypair
```


[20-Jan-20 03:54 AM] jl777c#5810
imagine a rotating door where thousands of balls are being tossed into it at one slit (varying by packet lag) and from another slit being extracted and cleanly recycled. if any ball drops on the floor it will cause a crash. oh and all the balls are chained by four linked lists (tagA, tagB, tagAB, pubkey) so as they come into the rotating door they are chained to the most recent other ball (up to 4 different ones). when a ball is recycled, there cant be any reference to it. and you cant stop spinning the doors, it is always going nonstop

üëç 

[20-Jan-20 03:57 AM] gcharang#6833
is there a reason to expect `pubkey33`  as a parameter in the case of `tagA != "inbox"` ?
the node already knows what the DEX_pubkey is. it is either generated randomly for the session or created from the -pubkey that is set


[20-Jan-20 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
you might want to send unauthenticated packets


[20-Jan-20 03:58 AM] gcharang#6833
got it


[20-Jan-20 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
i just didnt want to constrain things, probably most all usecases will want authenticated


[20-Jan-20 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but who knows what usecases unauthenticated provides


[20-Jan-20 04:04 AM] cipi#4502
`komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_broadcast "hello" 0 "BTC" "KMD" "" "0.07" "1100" # ask`
shows `"relamount": 0.07000000000000001` in the orderbook... seems the rounding does some strange things... could be a problem if mm2 tries to use exactly the amount from there
strange is also that it does not always happen... `0.08` shows as `0.08`


[20-Jan-20 04:04 AM] gcharang#6833
if pubkey33 is not provided for the case of tagA != "inbox" , the datablob is not signed(un-authenticated) but is still encrypted to the publicly known keypair. is that correct ?


[20-Jan-20 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[20-Jan-20 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
unauthenticated would be unencrypted plaintext

why are authenticated datablobs being encrypted to a public keypair?
@jl777c


[20-Jan-20 04:44 AM] jl777c#5810
how else do you suggest making a way for all nodes to be able to see the decrypted data?


[20-Jan-20 04:54 AM] gcharang#6833
I mean, why encrypt it at all?


[20-Jan-20 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
to authenticate it

the decryption can authenticate the senders pubkey

good. it seems i am stuck on this purge crash issue for a while yet


[20-Jan-20 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
testing a version that was stable for a bit, but need a lot longer to know for sure. it did dramatically reduce the lag times, now down to 2 seconds, maybe 3, even when blasting on all 10 nodes. i put in a small sleep of a couple milliseconds after each broadcast. this reduced the CPU usage a bit, but the lag time came way down. i think before the system was being saturated and things that should have been running in parallel, were inadvertently serialized


[20-Jan-20 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, no rush to do another 100 node test, but there is reason to believe it will have much better performance. my testnet seems to saturate around 3000 to 4000 per second and the broadcast sleep basically limits it to 2500 per second max. at 100 nodes blasting, it seems the sleep would need to be 10x more.... so you will still need to put in sleeps, if you can add 50 milliseconds after each packet, that would be the best.

[20-Jan-20 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, it is back to one hour purgetime


[20-Jan-20 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
it will also make a DEX.log file in the local directory, but the size will be just one line. probably on non-unix nodes, the dexp2p will behave very differently


[20-Jan-20 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
no rpc level changes, just hopefully will run stable and with lower lag


[20-Jan-20 08:32 AM] TonyL#3577
sounds great! so will combine next 100 nodes test with better automation to only specify test cluster servers IPs, nodes per server and test time and get tests result as an output


[20-Jan-20 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
my testnet nodes are on the low side for RAM, with the one hour purgetime the memory use leads to swap and that leads to much bigger lags. make sure your nodes have enough RAM or reduce the purgetime to 300 seconds


[20-Jan-20 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
the test is now lagging, but no crashes yet. and this is the blast saturation test that always caused at least a few of the nodes to eventually crash


[20-Jan-20 09:50 AM] TonyL#3577
how much RAM approximately is needed for 1 hour 1 node in case of blasting?


[20-Jan-20 09:50 AM] TonyL#3577
I got 64Gb on servers I'm using so for 10 nodes per server it's approx 6.4Gb per server


[20-Jan-20 09:51 AM] TonyL#3577
oh but I never spam for one hour - just 4-5 minutes tests, and after each run daemons restarting so I should be safe with RAM


[20-Jan-20 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that should be fine.

[21-Jan-20 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
a much improved new version:
1. i cant reproduce the occasional crash anymore, under many different configurations
2. refactored internals a LOT, memory usage is much less and there is no hard limit to tx/sec rate, though you cant sustain the max rate of 16k/sec for more than maxlagtime of 1 minute
3. latency is improved
4. duplicates and errors shouldnt be any worse
5. higher sync rate for lower priorities

[21-Jan-20 05:12 PM] jl777c#5810
fixed. i had to always used %.08f format for amounts as they are internally 64bits but i made the price display toggle between 8 and 15 decimals based on whether price is >= 0.00000001


[21-Jan-20 05:24 PM] cipi#4502
prices/amounts are fine now, thanks
`DEX_cancel` supports only id as parameter atm? is it planned to also add other filters, like pubkey+tagA/tagB to cancel all orders of a pair, or will mm2 do this later for us?


[21-Jan-20 05:26 PM] jl777c#5810
now that the crash seems finally fixed, i can continue to add features. cancel all orders for a pubkey was next on my list. i can add a tagA/tagB filter also. that would require 2 calls to cancel all bids and asks


[21-Jan-20 05:27 PM] jl777c#5810
also, any other feature requests, you can make. i have things pretty extensible internally now and can issue network wide operations that executes, at most one times. it might not get there due to network congestion


[21-Jan-20 05:33 PM] cipi#4502
in mm2 there is the API-call `cancel_all_orders` which takes base and rel as argument and that also needs to be called twice to remove both bids and asks (base/rel and rel/base), so it would be the same
i use this call to remove all order from a pair in cases where i can't get a recent price for that pair (coinpaprika down, coin had no volume)
i don't know how the call is implemented internally in mm2... could be it already has a list of orderids and cancels them one by one... so could be that cancel by id in DEXP2P is enough and the rest is done by mm2, but not sure


[21-Jan-20 05:37 PM] jl777c#5810
i have not gotten much feedback at all from the mm2 devs, so i am just proceeding with the assumption that dexp2p could implement the entire live orderbook. if they end up not using it, it will just be a day or two of coding wasted, but not really wasted as it allows us to make sure it is adequate for the task.


[21-Jan-20 05:39 PM] jl777c#5810
with DEX_list allowing a low level view of the data from any of the 4 indexes and DEX_orderbook creating ready made orderbooks, it could be than mm2 can just use it as it. since there is no spec for -dexp2p and not much documentation, it is hard for the mm2 team to decide on how much of it to use. maybe if they see they can just use it as the order cache directly, they will. or maybe it will lack some vitally needed functionality or feature, in which case they can use it just as a low level packet fifo

[21-Jan-20 05:50 PM] jl777c#5810
having a realtime comms channel will make things a lot easier to do, but there is no need for such redundant work and i can see a lot of different usecases for -dexp2p that can use some simple reference implementations


[21-Jan-20 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure if dexp2p even works on non-unix systems and i dont plan on supporting them if it takes a lot of pain


[21-Jan-20 05:53 PM] jl777c#5810
but it should just work with windows as i piggybacked onto existing bitcoin peering code


[21-Jan-20 05:54 PM] jl777c#5810
and no new dependencies, it is all just C code in komodo_DEX.h


[21-Jan-20 05:56 PM] Sir Seven#7158
`any other feature requests`
smth like `DEX_genpubkey pubkey` that will generate new pubkey33 according to pubkey given and `DEX_setpubkey pubkey33` to make node use it instead.
The usecases will be - after importing new privkey from other instanse or after generating a brand new one.


[21-Jan-20 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as the pubkey is in the wallet, this can be done


[21-Jan-20 05:57 PM] jl777c#5810
but you cant relaunch with the -pubkey= param?


[21-Jan-20 05:58 PM] Sir Seven#7158
It's possible, yes, but will be a pain to relaunch for each privkey in wallet.


[21-Jan-20 05:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i want to avoid -dexp2p being dependent on the wallet too much to make it easier to make an independent implementation

[21-Jan-20 06:19 PM] jl777c#5810
my testnet is running stable at 3x saturation. 140 million packets sustaining 3k/sec


[21-Jan-20 06:20 PM] jl777c#5810
avelag of 5 to 15 seconds due to the saturation.


[21-Jan-20 06:32 PM] cipi#4502
btw, i can cancel all orders for a pair like this
```
for i in `komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_orderbook 10000 0 KMD DGB | jq -r ".[]|.[].id"`; do komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_cancel $i; done
```
and the orders are gone from orderbook immediately, even if there are hundreds of them... and under heavy load


[21-Jan-20 06:38 PM] jl777c#5810
i tried to make it fast. maybe there is no need for any other cancels?


[21-Jan-20 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
if not needed, that is less bugs for me to worry about. i already have the cancel all coded so maybe i just debug that and you get the single order cancel and the cancel absolutely everything


[21-Jan-20 06:39 PM] jl777c#5810
then using code like above you can clear out orderbooks


[21-Jan-20 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
actually with txpowbits of 1, it will be instant, but with production values of around 1 second per command, it would take forever. i think i need to support cancel tagA/tagB directly


[21-Jan-20 06:43 PM] jl777c#5810
global commands charge a 8x/16x txpow premium


[21-Jan-20 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess i can lower it to a 2x and 4x premium for cancel id/cancel pubkey, but still it will take a while to issue 100 commands. the problem is that cancel is not just a local command it needs to not only be broadcast networkwide, it needs to run once on all nodes


[21-Jan-20 06:45 PM] jl777c#5810
to avoid spam, everything is charging a txpow "fee"


[21-Jan-20 06:46 PM] jl777c#5810
it will need to be calibrated to match what is a reasonable execution time for the various commands


[21-Jan-20 06:54 PM] cipi#4502
i think a reasonable execution time also depends on how price updates for existing orders are implemented
i think in mm2 the old order is canceled and a new one is created... if this takes 1s per pair and you have 60 pairs, it would be probably too much (i normally do price updates every 90s for all pairs)
but maybe it could be changed, so i don't remove the old order, but only post new ones and the other nodes simply take the order with the most recent timestamp if it finds more than 1 order from one pubkey... on the other hand, this would mean that you can't post more than one order for a pair...


[21-Jan-20 06:56 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can do 2 cancels in a second, per CPU core, is that fast enough?


[21-Jan-20 06:57 PM] jl777c#5810
an 8 core system would be able to do 16 cancels per second


[21-Jan-20 06:57 PM] cipi#4502
yes, i think that should be enough... the nodes with many pairs also have many cores, so it would work


[21-Jan-20 06:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i havent tested issuing requests in parallel, but i think you should be able to calculate the txpow in parallel


[21-Jan-20 06:59 PM] cipi#4502
the txpow tells how much cputime is consumed for the operation, right?


[21-Jan-20 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
statistically


[21-Jan-20 07:00 PM] jl777c#5810
each bit makes half the remaining hashes invalid


[21-Jan-20 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so with 12 bits, only 1 in 4096 is valid with a 4 bit premium for cancel that is 1 in 65536


[21-Jan-20 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but if the baseline needs to be 16 bits, then cancel pow will be 20 bits...


[21-Jan-20 07:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess  i need to lower it to a premium of 2. one advantage of higher priority is that it propagates a lot better


[21-Jan-20 07:02 PM] jl777c#5810
so having it 4 more than baseline would maximize its reaching all nodes


[21-Jan-20 07:03 PM] jl777c#5810
need to tweak the exact costs with some benchmarks. maybe someone can get time to calculate statistics on various systems at various priorities (keeping track of what txpowbits is set to for that version)


[21-Jan-20 07:07 PM] cipi#4502
is it sufficient to measure the time till `DEX_cancel` call returns to get the benchmark values? so if i call `DEX_cancel` couple thousand times i should get a good value.


[21-Jan-20 07:07 PM] jl777c#5810
just directly specify the priority with a DEX_broadcast

payload of 4 bytes size


[21-Jan-20 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
dont use ffff as the payload that is the special one that blasts


[21-Jan-20 07:08 PM] cipi#4502
does it need to be different on each call or can i use the same over and over again?


[21-Jan-20 07:08 PM] jl777c#5810
certainly a few thousand times will give a good value


[21-Jan-20 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810
you should be able to use the same payload, it calculates a random nonce and also uses timestamp


[21-Jan-20 07:09 PM] jl777c#5810

even the 5 nodes per server is a bit laggy. what are the specifics for the limiter?

lol


[22-Jan-20 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, every 10th, but that makes a fast burst of 10 and if all nodes are doing it, we get a spike of 1000 in a fraction of a second. the buffering should handle it though, that would be a good test


[22-Jan-20 05:02 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe do 10 nodes per server and sleep for 1 second after every 5 broadcasts


[22-Jan-20 05:02 AM] jl777c#5810
that is 500 per second, so it should be well below saturation


[22-Jan-20 05:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is a way to do sub-second sleeps, equivalent to usleep() that would be much better control


[22-Jan-20 05:02 AM] TonyL#3577
isn't it 50 per second?

at txpowbits of 1,  a single node will blast out 1000 per second. so 100 nodes will be trying to blast out 100,000 per second, for 10 seconds or a million packets in 10 seconds. definitely saturated as the numbers show. the fact it did as well as it did means even under extreme saturation, the worst that happens is packets dont get delivered, but higher probability for higher priority


[22-Jan-20 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810

in my imagination nodes will need to be broken up into clusters of say 1028 nodes per cluster- each cluster could have 8 indexing nodes these indexing nodes would comunicate with the other clusters and other blockchains

that implies that I have some interest in caring what the data is
If you get a job doing data-entry for an accounting firm, should you care what the content of the data is and represents or just that you enter it properly?

[22-Jan-20 06:11 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
of course, but right now the data you are "mining"  is only usful to create "coins" that have percieved value. The data I am talking about has absolute value to the consumer(s). --content would still be none of your concern as long "as it is  formatted correctly" you would still get paid for  CPU/GPU/ASIC power and storage space.   same/same. When not serving the "system" auto switch to mine random things that have perceived value. Paid for bit and byte transfers

this is true for a normal miner. the DTO implementation depends on the miner nodes submitting valid data from outside world. the data submitted by a miner and its validity is consensus enforced

@jl777c what is the default OP_RETURN size, in bytes, of a KMD asset chain? I can't seem to easily find this in reading the code. `MAX_OP_RETURN_RELAY = 8192` seems related, but that seems like the maximum OP_RETURN size to relay, not the default for a chain

how long did the test run?


[22-Jan-20 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
its still lagging badly, but i see 2 million+ packets, so that is 20,000 per node, which means the test had to run for at least 2000 seconds?

it's just 500 seconds test


[22-Jan-20 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810

we need to scale back the network side a LOT


[22-Jan-20 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
try one packet, one second wait


[22-Jan-20 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
that is 100 tx/sec, so 500 seconds would be a total of 50000 packets

A little bit confused now. Testing on single server for a 100 seconds with 1 second sleep after each 10 broadcasts. So 850 per 100 seconds looks plausible (100 seconds test minus 85 seconds of sleeps for 850 packages , so 15 seconds for broadcasting/daemon responses awaiting). But package numbers in stats looks not ok 
```package 850 sleep 1 second

maybe it doesn't work at all when multiple nodes on single server


[22-Jan-20 09:08 AM] jl777c#5810
if a single packet isnt working, 10000 certainly wont


[22-Jan-20 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be a system issue of confusing what process to interrupt when a localhost packet arrives

using this way to validate network config, we can make sure we dont get stuck wondering why the network looks saturated when it is just that the nodes cant really talk to half the other nodes


[22-Jan-20 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
now, my testnet is actually on a single server, but it uses something (proxmox?) to create different nodes, each with its own ip address


[22-Jan-20 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe that is a way to get to 100 nodes, but it needs to be tested on a single server if you can setup the same things. noashh did the config for the proxmox

try it without any sleeps


[22-Jan-20 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is probably sharing the same "network" interface via localhost, probably not designed to be high performance. somehow proxmox makes it fully independent nodes


[22-Jan-20 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
but you are using the same node, just different ports


[22-Jan-20 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
at least we know the reason for the bad performance on prior tests


[22-Jan-20 09:54 AM] TonyL#3577
Yep, virtualization or containerization is needed. But was interesting to find out this limit - we use similar nodes starting structure in unit-tests, so know we surely know that it'll fit only for simple request-response tests.


[22-Jan-20 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
i cant predict the lag time with 100 independent nodes, it could be 4 seconds or 10 seconds, if the former, can be tweaked to get to 2 seconds. actually for every general size of network and local connectivity, there will be an optimal set of internal parameters (fanout, maxlag, etc). so we can make sure that the worst performance using the best parameters at each order of magnitude is acceptable


[22-Jan-20 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
then as the network grows, we can simply update the parameters


[22-Jan-20 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
but as i said, impossible to know without running the tests how it will actually do


[22-Jan-20 09:58 AM] TonyL#3577
most probably 100 servers will be in the same DC (or at least use same magistral wires) so anyway it'll be not 100% real world test but very interesting still üòÉ

after the 100 nodes are working well, i want to verify 1000 nodes. if it scales two orders of magnitude with a couple seconds extra lag, then i think that is sufficient

[22-Jan-20 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
already saturated, at less than 1000/sec


[22-Jan-20 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
at least the first half dozen priorities are almost all in sync


[22-Jan-20 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
without the sleep, it could be that you are sending out packets so fast, it just cant receive inbound packets. its supposed to be 100% fully duplex... but results show something breaks down without sleep. so even though actual bandwidth used is less than what is supposed to be there, packets are dropped


[22-Jan-20 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
this is what i see on my testnet also. so you now can see an in sync test vs saturated test where the lower priority numbers are very different


[22-Jan-20 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
a lot of times the packets sent locally is not even getting to any other node


[22-Jan-20 10:05 AM] TonyL#3577
what if embeed limiter right into the daemon?


[22-Jan-20 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
so clearly if the network is saturated, we cant be 100% in sync, the graceful degradation is to make sure the highest priorities are getting there


[22-Jan-20 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
the issue is that with txpowbits at 15, you wont get much more than 2 packets per second


[22-Jan-20 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe 10 for a fast CPU


[22-Jan-20 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is no point to put in sleeps in the core and we need to make sure it gracefully degrades


[22-Jan-20 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
which i think it is.


[22-Jan-20 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
while waiting for server provisioning, you can validate the percentage syncing of the different priority levels


[22-Jan-20 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
then you can throttle the bandwidth used by having a sleep every packet, every 10, every 20, every 30, ... and we can see how the percentage in sync degrades at the various priority levels

already it will create higher priorities, actually for half of them!

[22-Jan-20 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810

...


[22-Jan-20 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
half dropping with each extra priority


[22-Jan-20 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
so you need to record the priority that is returned, (or you can just convert the id to hex and count 0 bits)


[22-Jan-20 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
so after you send out the packets, you can tell what priority each packet was. given that and knowing which packets are in sync, you can get a tally for sync percentage by priority

@Sir Seven pushed a version that has DEX_setpubkey. if the wallet doesnt have the privkey, it makes a temporary session specific pubkey, if the wallet does have the privkey, it is like you started with -pubkey= ,but i havent tested actually sending encrypted packets and if the receivers see the proper sender pubkey. let me know if it works
@cipi DEX_cancel now can cancel by id, or if id is 0, by pubkey (all) or if that is "" then by tagA/tagB, but this is totally untested, so it might even crash. let me know if it works
@TonyL i had a feeling something was not quite right and maybe now at lower packets sent, 100 nodes will stay in sync!

Do not crash, yet do not work either.
`DEX_cancel id` works as intended tho.

If you start node without -pubkey=pubkey, you'll always get session spec pubkey33. AE: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/HT2zV2pWR7/

Ok. Have 2 privkeys in wallet. Started daemon with one -pubkey=pubkey, DEX_stats returns correct 01pubkey(1).

DEX_stats returns 01pubkye(1) and DEX_broadcast message 1 BASE REL 01pubkey(02) returns "error": "wrong sender".


[22-Jan-20 11:53 PM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven wrong sender means there is confusion as to the privkey, so it seems it is half working . will investigate

@Sir Seven DEX_setpubkey works for me. i pushed a debug version that prints the DEX_privkey and DEX_pubkey and it is changing as it should. the DEX_broadcast had a "wrong sender" error as i used the old pubkey in the DEX_broadcast that was updated

`DEX_cancel id` -- works as expected
`DEX_cancel 0 pubkey` -- cancels all orders

yes, i changed it to follow left to right precedence


[23-Jan-20 01:15 AM] jl777c#5810

if pubkey is not "", that is used, the rest dont matter


[23-Jan-20 01:15 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems it is working then. and the DEX_setpubkey now works too?


[23-Jan-20 01:17 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Got it, probably we should specify this in docs later on.

DEX_setpubkey works judging by debug outputs. Yet you can not broadcast and/or cancel orders with set pubkey. Only using pubkey daemon was started with.
Also, looks related, only pubkey showed in DEX_stats is actually working.


[23-Jan-20 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i was able to broadcast an order with the new set pubkey


[23-Jan-20 01:19 AM] jl777c#5810
i need to see a specific sequence of commands that shows this failure. the pubkey in DEX_stats is updated when DEX_setpubkey is called, and that controls the privkey used. for DEX_broadcast make sure to specify the new pubkey


[23-Jan-20 01:20 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Gimme a minute, will PM sequence.


[23-Jan-20 02:13 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it seems the new set of bugs are fixed and we now have a much more complete DEX_cancel and also DEX_setpubkey that allows to change the active keypair without restarting. with these things, the current version is a release candidate for the first three levels of the protocol: low level transport, messaging and orderbooks. we still need to validate the routing on 100 and even 1000 node networks, so likely there will need to be tweaks to the networking for that.

while waiting, i will make new bugs with the reliable file transfer layer. that will need a bit of low level support from the routing layer with a new command message and the actual file transfer layer. i am aiming for end of month to get the initial release for that, which will be about when the -dexp2p will be a month since the start of coding

Hi! I've tried to follow the docs and start 2 nodes, 1 on my working PC and 1 on remote dedicated Linux server.
Both are started with command `./komodod -ac_name=DEXP2P -dexp2p=2 -ac_supply=999999 -addnode=37.9.62.186 -addnode=94.130.224.11`.  
First thing that is unclear to me: I have `"error": "wrong sender",` in the response of `./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_broadcast "hello" 5 "BTC" "KMD" "01faed489d5ae6d66e6fb7f69a15aeb81051bd02169d29eb8883260f3798e40778" "0.1" "100"`

Next: my nodes see only the messages created by themselves, they don't have other nodes messages.
The logs are empty so I have no idea how to indicate what might be the problem.
But possibly it is the nodes have not connected to other peers at all since `./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P getpeerinfo` returns `[]` on both nodes.


[23-Jan-20 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
likely that chain is running out of date version, made a lot of hardforking changes recently

best to just spin up a set of nodes from the same commit to make sure they are compatible


[23-Jan-20 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810

use the pubkey from DEX_stats


[23-Jan-20 03:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if you launch with -pubkey= then it will derive the same curve25519 pubkey each time

Are newly connected nodes supposed to sync their `DEX_list` with other nodes that already have some data? If yes, how much time should it take? I've restarted my node and see only new messages, but other node has more in its DEX_list.


[23-Jan-20 03:33 AM] jl777c#5810
currently only new messages are seen. after the purgetime, all nodes will be as much in sync as network bandwidth allows


[23-Jan-20 03:34 AM] jl777c#5810
in the file sync layer, i will be adding ways to query older messages


[23-Jan-20 03:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the assumption was that the DEX nodes would be online most of the time, so i didnt solve the syncing issue. one big problem is that as the network gets saturated, there really is no way to sync the older packets as nodes are only able to keep up with the current


[23-Jan-20 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
one idea is to use significantly higher priority packets for ones you want to be able to sync from the past and then it would be possible for a node to sync up to just these higher priority packets


[23-Jan-20 03:37 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the type of plan i am working on for the file syncing, so maybe for data that wants to be able to be synced from the past is put into "files" and you can use the file sync method for those. like to make an orderbook from a node that has been online for the full purgetime and put that into a "file"


[23-Jan-20 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
given that, a node can see the current orderbook from the long time online node and it will have all the info needed to query the specific packets needed for it


[23-Jan-20 03:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the current design is definitely minimalist and i have only added the bare minimum to achieve orderbook propagation and highest performance. with the tagA/tagB indexing, any sort of special information can be made very easy to find. and the file layer will allow to put whatever critical info is needed for a bootstrapping node


[23-Jan-20 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
"tagA":"orderbook", "tagB":"base_rel" could get the localorderbooks from nodes once per 5 minutes, or any other convention to get the required data to bootstrapping nodes


[23-Jan-20 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind, there could end up being thousands of messages per second, continuously, so being able to keep up with that, while being able to make queries efficiently... that is the main problem that -dexp2p solved. if you have a specific requirement that is not covered, let me know. i will be adding more third layers on top of the basic messaging layer to make it easy to solve other usecases, but the primary usecase for -dexp2p is the scalable DEX orderbook


[23-Jan-20 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
i think having a way to query all priority 4+ data will help solve the bootstrapping issue and it also works for the file sync layer

@TonyL this feature might affect some tests if any node is left running

one quick is that if a node goes offline and comes back online right away, most of the other nodes will most likely think that it has all the messages that it had before going offline


[23-Jan-20 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
this decentralized memory effect will come in very handy for file level things and turned out i didnt need any new protocol messages, there is a #define KOMODO_DEX_VIPLEVEL 4


[23-Jan-20 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
that can be changed to a different value if 16x the normal pow is not the right amount. i also reduced txpowbits back to 1, it is just so hard to see 10 packets per second from 10 blaster nodes and all CPU at 100%...


[23-Jan-20 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
without sleeps, a blasting node wont have enough CPU to keep up.


[23-Jan-20 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
also the VIP bootstrapping (and it also works to get closer to 100% sync for VIP packets) could make the lag stats look worse as it might arrive up to a minute late and still be included in the stats. anything over MAXLAG wont affect the stats, but there wasnt an easy way to tell if a packet arrived due to lag or its vipness


[23-Jan-20 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i use a decentralized process to get the VIP packets in sync, ie. if any of your peers notices that you dont have a VIP packet, it will ping you about it. then the node uses the normal request process to pull the missing VIP packet


[23-Jan-20 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure i would consider it a bug if there isnt 100% sync for VIP packets, would like to see how well in sync the VIP packets are


[23-Jan-20 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
note: for networks not subject to saturation, you can set the VIP level to 0

fixed some performance issues, but still a few strange things. seems to just affect sync rate, and network performance. latest version is working better than ever, VIP priority is set to 2, txpowbits 1
to get the VIP sync, the duplicate counts have gone way up, about 10% on some nodes... so i will keep tweaking this, but things are in a stable state for now
commit: "improved version"


[23-Jan-20 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL i suspect my internal stats are a bit off, as there are cases where it thinks it doesnt have a datablob, but it turns out it does. if you can verify what is actually in DEX_list, that would help this issue. also, keep an eye out for duplicates in DEX_list output. there shouldnt be, but i saw that happen at least once

DEX_list response has `n: amount` - in many cases it returns just 0 instead of actual matches count.
AE: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/DjrcXhJgvr/
^^ exact same 3 matches, yet in 1st response n=3, and in 2nd n=0

As far as I can see, you can get correct n value only if asking DEX_list with single 1 param, like:
DEX_list '' 0 tagA '' ''
DEX_list '' 0 '' tagB ''
and DEX_list '' 0 '' '' pubkey

fixed, works fine.

Noticed one more thing with DEX_list:
`stopat` parameter sorts only with order ids and `stophash` sorts only with order hashes. As intended? In doc it's mentioned that both can do it with either id or hash.

Will check DEX_get soon.

i dont understand the question about stop sorts

if stopat is zero and stophash is set, then DEX_list stops at that hash (and doesnt include it)

3 nodes showing zeroes - checking why


[24-Jan-20 05:00 AM] jl777c#5810
first node has too many connections


[24-Jan-20 05:01 AM] TonyL#3577
yeah, in mode when it's 1 node per server I've coded that it's using just `addnode=firstnode`


[24-Jan-20 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
also, i think it was still in the process of syncing, as it does that at about 50 per second


[24-Jan-20 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
the test seems too short


[24-Jan-20 05:01 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm testing for 500 seconds


[24-Jan-20 05:02 AM] TonyL#3577
Should I collect the test data with some delay after blasting?


[24-Jan-20 05:02 AM] jl777c#5810
my nodes are staying in sync until the network gets saturated


[24-Jan-20 05:03 AM] jl777c#5810
what if you did a DEX_broadcast ffff ?


[24-Jan-20 05:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Let me try with `ffff`


[24-Jan-20 05:03 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the problem is that i am doing that instead of actual messages


[24-Jan-20 05:03 AM] TonyL#3577
In your network not all nodes connected to some single node, right?


[24-Jan-20 05:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i do have a monitoring node that is connected to a lot of them, but i dont blast from that node


[24-Jan-20 05:05 AM] TonyL#3577
I see, I might not blast from the first node as well


[24-Jan-20 05:05 AM] TonyL#3577
but anyway, graphs above from this first node


[24-Jan-20 05:05 AM] TonyL#3577
CPU/network/disk usage nowhere close to 100%


[24-Jan-20 05:06 AM] TonyL#3577
When I'm installing packages node is under 10x (and network like a 50x) more stress


[24-Jan-20 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i am surprised to see such lag


[24-Jan-20 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
on my nodes it is 2 seconds or less at < 1000 tx/sec


[24-Jan-20 05:07 AM] TonyL#3577
And all my nodes locating in the same hetzner DC


[24-Jan-20 05:09 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, in 10 minutes will see results with `ffff`


[24-Jan-20 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
what broadcast was used in the above tests? can you make one example


[24-Jan-20 05:13 AM] TonyL#3577
```TEST=$(( ( RANDOM % 1000000 )  + 1 ))
  curl --user test:test --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "DEX_broadcast", "params": ["'"$TEST"'", "0", "'"$1"'", "", "", "0.1", "100"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:$1/```

message is string with random number from 0 to 1000000


[24-Jan-20 05:13 AM] TonyL#3577
so lets say `DEX_broadcast 777 0 7000 "" "" 0.1 100`


[24-Jan-20 05:14 AM] TonyL#3577
Ok, with `ffff` more packages as expected

[24-Jan-20 05:17 AM] TonyL#3577
like a 
```DEX_broadcast 777 0 7000 "" "" 0.1 100
{
  "timestamp": 1579871818,
  "id": 3312335665,

[24-Jan-20 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
ah, 7000 was the tagA


[24-Jan-20 05:18 AM] TonyL#3577
yes, I'm using node port as a tag


[24-Jan-20 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
ok i will test with that broadcast


[24-Jan-20 05:19 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm sorry - in my latest version I'm concatenate server IP to message also to detect from server it was sent
So something like a: `DEX_broadcast 127.0.0.1_777 0 7000 "" "" 0.1 100`


[24-Jan-20 05:20 AM] TonyL#3577

[24-Jan-20 05:20 AM] TonyL#3577
from these results looks like I know now what was so magical in your setup


[24-Jan-20 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if you wait a bit longer it should reach 100% sync


[24-Jan-20 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so the bug is with non ffff packets


[24-Jan-20 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i will reproduce that and fix it

[24-Jan-20 05:22 AM] TonyL#3577
yeah, so it works now only for synthetic case


[24-Jan-20 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
in the meantime test 100 servers with ffff


[24-Jan-20 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i mean 10x 10 nodes per server


[24-Jan-20 05:22 AM] TonyL#3577
sure, on it


[24-Jan-20 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
and it would be good to wait until the stats totals are not changing


[24-Jan-20 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
but not more than 5 minutes after blasting is done


[24-Jan-20 05:23 AM] TonyL#3577
is purging time 5 minutes at the moment?


[24-Jan-20 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
3600 seconds


[24-Jan-20 05:30 AM] TonyL#3577
that's example of why I don't like synthetic things in testing such as regtest chains üòÉ


[24-Jan-20 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but it really is the same broadcast. i am getting 1 second pings with the non-ffff


[24-Jan-20 05:32 AM] TonyL#3577
so strange


[24-Jan-20 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be due to the json being returned


[24-Jan-20 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed a test version that adds a millisecond sleep after each broadcast


[24-Jan-20 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
in the non-ffff case, it alraedy had it in the ffff case


[24-Jan-20 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
try that with the 10 node test


[24-Jan-20 05:34 AM] TonyL#3577
great, will try it right after 100 nodes `ffff` test


[24-Jan-20 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
since it reproduces everytime it is easy to see if that is the fix


[24-Jan-20 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i remember things got a lot better for ffff case after that


[24-Jan-20 05:34 AM] TonyL#3577
but strange that it reproducing only on my side


[24-Jan-20 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i only ran it on one node, i still need to test on all nodes


[24-Jan-20 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
also i had the output going to the screen, which effectively adds sleeps


[24-Jan-20 05:35 AM] TonyL#3577
ah, I see - I got no real terminal sessions with test machines atm


[24-Jan-20 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe some memory issue, maybe > /dev/null


[24-Jan-20 05:37 AM] TonyL#3577
```  curl --user test:test --data-binary '{"jsonrpc": "1.0", "id":"curltest", "method": "DEX_broadcast", "params": ["'"$TEST"'", "0", "'"$1"'", "", "", "0.1", "100"] }' -H 'content-type: text/plain;' http://127.0.0.1:$1/ >> spam_p2p/packages/$2_$1_packages.txt
```
output of each call I'm redirecting to separate files btw


[24-Jan-20 05:37 AM] TonyL#3577
not each call = separate file but each node packages = separate file


[24-Jan-20 05:37 AM] jl777c#5810

[24-Jan-20 05:48 AM] TonyL#3577
`komodod running at 0%-1% CPU finally ---no load < 73Mb ram Vmem < 900 Mb --- starting ffff now` is it in some standby mode without broadcasting/receiving?

[24-Jan-20 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe its the sleep that you add. with the latest version there is a millisecond sleep per packet, so you should be able to run without external sleep


[24-Jan-20 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
and maybe the latest will be better anyway


[24-Jan-20 05:56 AM] jl777c#5810
this feels like a systems issue

sure, atm started with this 1 second sleep, then if it's fine will run without the sleep

in general it's interesting that CPU loading scales not linear with nodes per server amount increasing

with 1 node loading is 40-50% but with 10 nodes it's 1500% (all 16 cores)

[24-Jan-20 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a 1 millisecond sleep after each packet, so it will be hard to get 100% CPU usage just from blasting, at least until txpow is activated again


[24-Jan-20 06:25 AM] TonyL#3577
lets try 50 nodes now


[24-Jan-20 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
that test run seems 100% perfect


[24-Jan-20 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the one thing that is bad is that one node has 90% of traffic


[24-Jan-20 06:26 AM] TonyL#3577
yeah, looks like this milisecond sleep was the clue


[24-Jan-20 06:26 AM] TonyL#3577
thats just because of the bad network connection design


[24-Jan-20 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i told you it was a system issue


[24-Jan-20 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810

[24-Jan-20 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
CPU usage is proportional to packets per second and bandwidth per second


[24-Jan-20 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
memory usage is a fixed 5MB + whatever is needed for packets


[24-Jan-20 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
and now it is getting such good sync, the file level sync will be much much easier. i decided to just make the network do the decentralized sync efficiently so the file layer can assume close to 100% sync and just have to deal with the occasional missing fragment


[24-Jan-20 06:31 AM] TonyL#3577
btw in case of real usage network will be interconnected same way as mine I believe


[24-Jan-20 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
with 100% of packets in sync, it seems we know the sync rate for all priorities is 100%


[24-Jan-20 06:31 AM] TonyL#3577
because of the `addnode` param


[24-Jan-20 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
not if you turn off that node after there are enough other nodes running


[24-Jan-20 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
but yes, we should be able to run with any type of node configuration


[24-Jan-20 06:32 AM] TonyL#3577
but chain startup params will be hardcoded somewhere right


[24-Jan-20 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it is like adding a new syntax into a compiler


[24-Jan-20 06:32 AM] TonyL#3577
and it'll need to find first peers


[24-Jan-20 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
after you do this, then you can use that new syntax in the compiler and use it to compile itself


[24-Jan-20 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
so you can start with a seed node, the network forms, each with a few random peers + seednode


[24-Jan-20 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
kill the seed node


[24-Jan-20 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
the network is now having only random peers on each node


[24-Jan-20 06:33 AM] TonyL#3577
but how new clients will connect to network in such case?


[24-Jan-20 06:33 AM] TonyL#3577
new clients need to start the daemon


[24-Jan-20 06:33 AM] TonyL#3577
without `addnode` or `connect` param daemon will not find the peers


[24-Jan-20 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, will need to know the ip of at least one node in the network, maybe from a list on explorer


[24-Jan-20 06:33 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
still needs NN right


[24-Jan-20 06:34 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
question mark


[24-Jan-20 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
for small networks it is a bit of a hub and spoke topology at first


[24-Jan-20 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
-dexp2p has no blocks to notarize


[24-Jan-20 06:35 AM] TonyL#3577
aha, so implementation of network interconnection mechanism in production is something what needs to be implemented on some point


[24-Jan-20 06:35 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
small IoT devices would  just need a IP for 1?


[24-Jan-20 06:36 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
any other way besides IP addys?


[24-Jan-20 06:36 AM] TonyL#3577

peers.dat stores all peers ever seen


[24-Jan-20 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so the seednode is needed during the bootstrapping of the network, at some point you can make a DNS for long term running nodes


[24-Jan-20 06:40 AM] TonyL#3577
but lets say in case of atomicdex mobile


[24-Jan-20 06:40 AM] TonyL#3577
should mobile app request data from peers from some centralized explorer and then add `addnode` params on startup?


[24-Jan-20 06:40 AM] TonyL#3577
something like that?


[24-Jan-20 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810

every DEXP2P would connect to masters first if no peers are known for said network

[24-Jan-20 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
you saw how dramatically a 1 millisecond sleep affected things, with 10 nodes


[24-Jan-20 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
sharing the same hardware with 4 other dexp2p nodes... that is a much bigger change than a 1 millisecond sleep


[24-Jan-20 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
i think contention over the same network interface


[24-Jan-20 06:46 AM] TonyL#3577

[24-Jan-20 06:46 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it assumes that localhost can poll all the different ports instead of interrupt driven

```probably CPU was overloaded

not sure. I used it for the scaletest and it worked quite well.
@patchkez  has added some instructions to use the autogen script.

this is what I used for a trigger on the nodes, to send transactions.

[24-Jan-20 12:51 PM] cipi#4502
played a bit with DEX_cancel...
- cancel by id works
- cancel by pubkey (all orders) works
`komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_cancel "" 01660c5ca88c7a12eaa963ba11bd049cf95c2f2db409a7a31740aaa0f5647b4d74`
- passing some other pubkey returns error `wrong pubkey`
- cancel by tagA/tagB works too
`komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_cancel "" "" THC KMD` cancels all asks (and only the asks)
`komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_cancel "" "" KMD THC` cancels the bids (and only the bids)


[24-Jan-20 12:58 PM] cipi#4502
will update my script, so that it cancels the orders on each run and creates new ones (with eventually new prices)
it will than be the same functionality as the real mm2 node


[24-Jan-20 01:52 PM] cipi#4502
if i call `komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_cancel "" "" THC KMD` the orders are cancelled as desired
but the daemon shows a lot of these on each run
```
tagA THC mismatch XSN
tagA THC mismatch KMD
tagA THC mismatch USDC
tagA THC mismatch KMD
tagA THC mismatch BTG
```
i never posted THC/BTG or THC/USDC orders, only THC/KMD

https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/rjMF9jsTvh/ 100 nodes on 100 separate servers. Too interconnected via first node still, will try to create network better tomorrow

Now also maybe servers are too tiny (just two threads and 2 gigs of RAM. https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Mp7SMJQxDK/ 10 nodes on 10 same separate servers are in 100% sync but lag is huge


[24-Jan-20 02:26 PM] cipi#4502
updated the script, orderbook now contains only one bid/ask from my pubkey... price is updated every 30s (DEX_cancel + DEX_broadcast)
in production, what should be passed as `hex` to `DEX_broadcast` when i want to create an orderbook entry (tagA/tagB)? atm , i simply pass "hello"... should i leave it empty?


[24-Jan-20 08:59 PM] Mylo#8306
+1 the docker scaletest variations.   once the docker image is built, the environment variables can be passed in at runtime.  many deployable targets including google/aws/other clouds, physical servers with docker installed.   can deploy from central script to all of these using tools like nomad from hashicorp.


[24-Jan-20 09:14 PM] jl777c#5810
@cipi removed the tagA prints, was just there to make sure it worked. the payload would be whatever info mm2 would need for bob/alice to contact each other (and maybe even start the swap) it is totally up to the application. just put in whatever is needed by mm2


[24-Jan-20 09:18 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL the lag numbers are not as bad. notice it is the shortest term lag number that is bad, the medium and especially the longest are not so bad. if you are waiting 3 minutes after the test, then the VIP sync is contaminating the lag times. any VIP packet that arrives within maxlag (1 minute) will update the lag averages. it really shouldnt do that as strictly it isnt lag, but then again it is what the definition of lag is


[24-Jan-20 09:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the 100 server test results are actually very promising. can you run it for one hour? that will reduce the effect of the VIP sync on lag stats


[24-Jan-20 09:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i think the 10x10 config is ok, if you kill the first node after the network bootstraps, make sure each node has at least 3 connections

üëç  started for one hour same configuration.  
`i think the 10x10 config is ok, if you kill the first node after the network bootstraps, make sure each node has at least 3 connections` 10x10 configuration was much less interconnected than 100x1 from what are results above


[25-Jan-20 03:13 AM] cipi#4502
i have setup a second node, but the orderbook on that node is empty most of the time
sometimes i see orders though
the 2 nodes are connected (getpeerinfo)
i think it is related to the DEX_cancel which i call before each DEX_broadcast... DEX_cancel has a higher priority
will make the script wait longer between 2 runs and see if it makes a difference


[25-Jan-20 03:21 AM] cipi#4502
makes no difference... will sleep a bit between DEX_cancel and DEX_broadcast, maybe that helps...


[25-Jan-20 03:36 AM] cipi#4502
no difference either... i tempory remove the DEX_cancel, to see what happens


[25-Jan-20 03:41 AM] cipi#4502
ok, now the orders are showing up on the other node
seems to be a timing problem with DEX_cancel
@jl777c does DEX_cancel look at the timestamps? if not, maybe it should... and cancel only orders with a lower timestamp


[25-Jan-20 03:44 AM] cipi#4502
strange is that it works fine on the local node (the node that issues the DEX_cancel and DEX_broadcast)


[25-Jan-20 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
for id based it doesnt look at timestamp, for the others it should only be cancelling orders that are at or before the cancel packet. maybe this is the issue, it is <=, but in your case that will affect the immediate replacement. i will change it to be <


[25-Jan-20 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix. i guess the problem is that it is propagating too fast


[25-Jan-20 05:59 AM] cipi#4502
that did not help... i saw an order for a short time, but it disappeared from orderbook on the remote node shortly after (couple of seconds)


[25-Jan-20 06:01 AM] cipi#4502
btw, i use priority 0 in DEX_broadcast... should i use something higher? would it make a difference?


[25-Jan-20 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
for cancel it needs to be at least 4


[25-Jan-20 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
what it the timestamp on the cancel vs the order that disappeared


[25-Jan-20 06:04 AM] cipi#4502
need to log the output of DEX_cancel so i see what happens... give me a minute


[25-Jan-20 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
updated with a version that prints the details right before cancel, also increased to cutoff-10 seconds. you can look at DEX_get id and see the cancelled field to see if it was cancelled

strange, the orderbook-entries visible on the local node have `"timestamp": 1579961441`
and the cancel has `'timestamp' => 1579961441,` and `'recvtime' => 1579961441`
will try new version


[25-Jan-20 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
all the same timestamp would make it stay in the orderbook with the one version prior


[25-Jan-20 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
recvtime shouldnt affect the cancel logic, only the timestamp of the order and the timestamp of the cancel

it is working now, the orders remain in orderbook on the remote node too


[25-Jan-20 06:24 AM] cipi#4502
issuing node shows couple of those `check cancel ptr.0x7fffa40039a0 97ef3594 t.1579961891 cutoff.1579962186 (BTC,KMD)`
and the remote node shows couple of those `check cancel ptr.0x7fffb80066e0 c3b9cc44 t.1579962013 cutoff.1579962247 (,)`


[25-Jan-20 06:29 AM] cipi#4502
ooops, the orders started to disappear again after i added much more pairs
looks like the `DEX_cancel` from later pairs are cancelling orders from other pairs


[25-Jan-20 06:36 AM] cipi#4502
strange, if i keep the number of pairs low, it works... just tried with 8...


[25-Jan-20 06:40 AM] cipi#4502
looks to me (without knowing the code) like there is a place where a "OR" should be replaced with an "AND" when looking after orders to cancel.... it should cancel the order when timestamp is lower AND tagA AND tagB matches


[25-Jan-20 06:43 AM] cipi#4502
12 pairs work... 22 also...


[25-Jan-20 06:46 AM] cipi#4502
32 not...

How do you see that the main differences from this network to Internet Protocol confer advantages for building a decentralised network? (Asking for a techically minded friend, so may I quote you?)


[25-Jan-20 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
this works over the internet, so not sure i understand the question


[25-Jan-20 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you mean the low level tcp/ip or UDP where you are sending to a specific address


[25-Jan-20 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the main difference is that this builds a fully decentralized network directly


[25-Jan-20 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
so that makes building a decentralized network with pretty good performance characteristics, very easy


[25-Jan-20 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
@cipi so to summarize, things are working much better now, but at some point with large number of pairs it starts marking unrelated pairs as cancelled to? the code is always requiring both tagA and tagB match


[25-Jan-20 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven can you make a reproducible sequence to duplicate this behavior?


[25-Jan-20 09:06 AM] cipi#4502
yes, that's what i observe...


[25-Jan-20 09:15 AM] CMaurice#1685
thanks, yes, I get that it is built from scratch, I guess the reference to IP was an example in the context of our conversation. It's possible I answered his questions later, talking about the genericness of the blobs.

I have read the references to UDP, so perhaps one example might be that 100% reliability is relaxed to help prevent saturation? Though as I understand it packets are carried over TCP. I think at root an issue here is that without understanding the code is it difficult to get an idea of how the construction works at a higher level.

Does routing come with the Bitcoin/zcash code?

btw, thanks for all your work and the open sourceing of it, it's very engaging to be running such capable and efficient software

stats from 100 nodes after 1 hour test: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/sNcqy94t65/


[25-Jan-20 09:19 AM] TonyL#3577
by some reason stats collecting hanged on previous two attempts so wasted like a 3 hours of runs


[25-Jan-20 10:22 PM] jl777c#5810
@CMaurice the normal mempool has a gossip protocol, but it isnt designed for speed and there is some effort at making it private,so it trickles out the packets. i only use the peering code so i dont have to bother with the lowest level networking. i am able to send messages and process them. so all the routing is done within dexp2p


[25-Jan-20 10:23 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL i think the stats shows that the lag is mostly pretty good, some nodes are being starved of resources, but overall this is promising. when we get 100 independent nodes, i expect the numbers to be even better


[26-Jan-20 12:37 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c actually it's 100 independent nodes in last two stats reports


[26-Jan-20 12:59 AM] TonyL#3577
But I've used 100 really tiny VPS (like a 6 bucks per month each), so CPU got some high loading even with single node.
Let me try to scale it a little so we'll be able to compare the stats


[26-Jan-20 01:30 AM] jl777c#5810
@cipi the version you are running should be printing out the details of every message it is considering cancelling. are you seeing it show different tagA/tagB there? it seems either is it getting confused and scanning the wrong tagA/tagB, or randomly cancelling some unrelated message


[26-Jan-20 01:38 AM] cipi#4502
the local node (where everything works fine) is showing lines like this on each cancel-request
```check cancel ptr.0x7fffac05b120 717603bc t.1580027857 cutoff.1580031425 (BTC,KMD)```
the remote node (which is having the problem) is showing this
```check cancel ptr.0x7fffb8045dc0 0d671824 t.1580027926 cutoff.1580031493 (,)```
tagA/tagB is missing here


[26-Jan-20 01:39 AM] cipi#4502
i picked the 2 messages randomly, they are not directly related


[26-Jan-20 01:40 AM] cipi#4502
but they all look the same on the 2 nodes... the remote node has all messages without tagA/tagB, the local node has all with tagA7tagB


[26-Jan-20 01:44 AM] TonyL#3577
Will test orders placing/cancelling today
@cipi Am I understand correct that this network is from 2 peers only? How many orders and for how many pairs do you broadcast before cancelation start and how often do you cancel orders?


[26-Jan-20 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
@cipi in DEX_list the remote node has the proper tags?


[26-Jan-20 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
if the check cancel print isnt printing the right tagA/tagB, not sure how it works at all. it shouldnt cancel anything


[26-Jan-20 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
if so, the bug is the parsing of the cancel tag pair command


[26-Jan-20 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i will investigate this later today


[26-Jan-20 01:49 AM] cipi#4502
every 30s i get new prices from coinpaprika
i then cancel the previous orders (2 calls of `DEX_cancel`, base/rel and rel/base)
and post new orders (2 calls of `DEX_broadcast`, both with prio 0)
i tried with different number of pairs... with only 10 pairs it works, if using 20 pairs, the orders on the remote node start to disappear


[26-Jan-20 01:50 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe it worth to try manual limiting on broadcast when you  receive the prices


[26-Jan-20 01:50 AM] TonyL#3577
broadcast 10 first, then sleep a second and broadcast another 10


[26-Jan-20 01:50 AM] TonyL#3577
will it work same way in this case?


[26-Jan-20 01:51 AM] cipi#4502
i tried to sleep 1s between DEX_cancel and DEX_broadcast and it didn't help, i can try again


[26-Jan-20 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
check cancel ptr.0x7fffb8045dc0 0d671824 t.1580027926 cutoff.1580031493 (,)
the above indicates the remote cancel is not being parsed correctly. if so, this cant work very well at all


[26-Jan-20 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
(,)


[26-Jan-20 01:51 AM] TonyL#3577
ah, only 2 calls of `DEX_broadcast`, got it - will try this case


[26-Jan-20 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
that should have the tagA/tagB


[26-Jan-20 01:52 AM] cipi#4502
yes, i thought the same... and wondered why it works with few pairs


[26-Jan-20 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
is it always (,) in the remote node?


[26-Jan-20 01:54 AM] cipi#4502
yes, always

it should print different types of hex strings when you issue the cancel


[26-Jan-20 02:06 AM] jl777c#5810
8chars for cancel of id


[26-Jan-20 02:06 AM] jl777c#5810
66 chars for cancel pubkey


[26-Jan-20 02:06 AM] jl777c#5810
lenA,tagA,lenB,tagB for cancel by tag pair


[26-Jan-20 02:07 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be a hexstring that is sent to DEX_broadcast internally. before it was getting semi-random data, usually the pubkey for the payload, so cancelling all orders


[26-Jan-20 02:08 AM] jl777c#5810
the bug was over in the rpc call, where all it had to do was call the DEX_broadcast with the right parameters. the much more complex handling and processing of the command, seems to be ok. but maybe it has bugs too, so there are printouts there to help debug if any issues


[26-Jan-20 02:11 AM] jl777c#5810
@CMaurice it could well be there are other pre-existing projects that does similar things to what -dexp2p does, but i couldnt find any that were appropriate to put inside the coin daemon. now that we have a dexp2p support inside komodod, that means it can be directly interfaced with all the blockchain side of things


[26-Jan-20 02:11 AM] cipi#4502
that makes a lot of sense... the only thing that was preventing it from cancelling absolutely all orders was the timestamp comparison... compiling and testing


[26-Jan-20 02:12 AM] jl777c#5810
but first i want to get it to where it can do the networking as well as any best in class decentralized streaming protocol

https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Yt9nhYVBXN/ 100 separate nodes, this time a little bit better machines (500 seconds test)


[26-Jan-20 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, looks much better, if you gather stats right after test ends, my guess is the first lag number will be much closer to the 5 seconds. can you stop the first node and then make sure all nodes have 3 or more peers and rerun test?


[26-Jan-20 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i think as the network grows in size, we might achiever lower and lower lag times,as long as no single node is bottlenecking things


[26-Jan-20 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810
for now, change to collecting stats right after test ends to remove the lag contamination from VIP sync


[26-Jan-20 02:34 AM] TonyL#3577
`yes, looks much better, if you gather stats right after test ends` I'm gathering it after 3 min sleep + by some reasons stats gathering taking a lot of time in my scripts (like a 5+ minutes)


[26-Jan-20 02:37 AM] TonyL#3577
`can you stop the first node and then make sure all nodes have 3 or more peers and rerun test?` yep, very easy to stop first node after the network init but harder to ensure that all nodes got peers because connecting/disconnecting/new peers finding working some non-det way (at least from my point of view). Will try to do that


[26-Jan-20 02:43 AM] cipi#4502
@jl777c restarted both nodes... everything fine on local node, but remote node does not cancel any orders, they are all showing up in orderbook
i see console output like this on the remote node `skip lenA.1 lenB.174 vs newlen.8`


[26-Jan-20 02:44 AM] cipi#4502
local node shows eg `cancel ptr.0x7fffa400dd20 aceb61bb t.1580035397 cutoff.1580035453 (ETH,KMD) can celled.1580035463`


[26-Jan-20 02:52 AM] jl777c#5810
skip lenA.1 lenB.174 vs newlen.8 <- that explains it, i will need to get setup to do this and debug it directly. at least it is behaving in understandable ways now. does cancel by pubkey and cancel by id still work?


[26-Jan-20 02:56 AM] cipi#4502
strange
```
komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_cancel "" 01d0aef5d5928b02c29c6452ac909f29ce7a1c3ebf4aa6878421085b8ba26c864d
error: couldn't parse reply from server
```
but the daemon is running, DEX_orderbook still working


[26-Jan-20 02:58 AM] cipi#4502
DEX_cancel by id works fine, order is removed from both nodes (local and remote)


[26-Jan-20 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
so cancel by pubkey returns unparseable ?

yes, looks good now... remote node shows
```034b4d440343524f decoded cancel scan for (KMD,CRO)
cancel ptr.0x7fffb40fbaa0 f220cd99 t.1580038547 cutoff.1580038602 (KMD,CRO) cancelled.1580038612```
there are still a lot of old orders in the book from the previous run (i use session pubkey, so i can't cancel them any more), but the new orders look good


[26-Jan-20 03:39 AM] jl777c#5810
it helps to actually pass in the proper parameters to functions


[26-Jan-20 03:39 AM] jl777c#5810
something i should have learned by now


[26-Jan-20 03:40 AM] cipi#4502
üôÇ


[26-Jan-20 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
my only excuse is that i was in the middle of coding DEX_publish, so didnt remember all the details. current version supports the DEX_publish side of the publish/subscribe for files that are not changing in size


[26-Jan-20 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX_publish filename priority


[26-Jan-20 03:41 AM] cipi#4502
btw, DEX_cancel is called for all orders with tagA/tagB from that pubkey
```
cancel ptr.0x7fffb00082f0 57149161 t.1580038674 cutoff.1580038733 (ECA,KMD) cancelled.1580038743
cancel ptr.0x7fffb0008b70 97b0f7e7 t.1580038612 cutoff.1580038733 (ECA,KMD) cancelled.1580038673
cancel ptr.0x7fffa4014720 daeea241 t.1580038543 cutoff.1580038733 (ECA,KMD) cancelled.1580038612
```
so the number of DEX_cancels will rise till the timeout kicks in and removes this orders completely (i guess)


[26-Jan-20 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[26-Jan-20 03:42 AM] jl777c#5810
dont worry, it can iterate millions of orders in a second


[26-Jan-20 03:42 AM] cipi#4502
ok, wonderful


[26-Jan-20 03:42 AM] jl777c#5810
the DEX_publish filename will split up the file into 4kb fragments and send them to tagA/tagB of filename/data with volA incrementing


[26-Jan-20 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
after all the fragments are sent, it will broadcast a set of locators to filename/locators


[26-Jan-20 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
this is all under a specific publishers pubkey


[26-Jan-20 03:44 AM] jl777c#5810
so a file is really pubkey+filename, filename limited to 15 chars and should be located in the dir that komodod was launched


[26-Jan-20 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
for now, this is just a convenient way to blast up to 400MB of data in one command


[26-Jan-20 03:46 AM] jl777c#5810
but now this is working, the next step is to reconstruct the file on a remote node using DEX_subscribe
all it has to do is get the set of locators with filename/locators and then magically request any missing blocks


[26-Jan-20 03:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the "magically" part i still need to figure out the best way to do, also it seems there should be some tagA that has a list of published files. this way you can browse a list of available files and then recreate any specific one

it wont be hard to add a paywall before a specific file is broadcast and since it only exists for one hour (or less), the same content can be sold over and over

the volA/volB fields are proving to be useful outside of orderbooks, using it to encode things like fragment number, filesize, etc.


[26-Jan-20 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX_publish now sends a payload that is the SHA256 of the file that was broadcast in the "files"/fname tags, doing a DEX_list 0 0 files will list all files from all publeys


[26-Jan-20 04:08 AM] jl777c#5810
while there is nothing at the low level that prevents broadcasting the same filename again from the same pubkey, i will put a check in to prevent that at the rpc level. this will avoid file name collisions in innocent cases


[26-Jan-20 04:29 AM] CMaurice#1685
useful. Can you see any problems with distributing append-only logs wih this network. I'm thinking any initial descriptors required at the beginning of blobs might interfere. (Generally I am looking for interop with other distributed systems and understand this is not a concern for your work atm)


[26-Jan-20 04:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i will be implementing support for streaming files


[26-Jan-20 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
basically that is an append only log


[26-Jan-20 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so just stream the debug.log and it would replicate on all nodes that DEX_subscribe to it


[26-Jan-20 05:27 AM] Alright#0419
@CMaurice what do you mean by append only logs? simply storing data on chain does this


[26-Jan-20 05:48 AM] CMaurice#1685
@Alright for example, is there anything in the data model of the dat protocol that would preclude it's use in this network (https://datprotocol.github.io/how-dat-works/#data-model)


[26-Jan-20 05:50 AM] CMaurice#1685
now, I can't see why, given it would be sent as a blob and up to any client to make use of the dat


[26-Jan-20 05:51 AM] CMaurice#1685
discovery would be another matter entirely


[26-Jan-20 06:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt look to hard to use dexp2p as the transport layer for dat


[26-Jan-20 06:02 AM] jl777c#5810
but it isnt clear if dat can be used for streaming


[26-Jan-20 06:08 AM] CMaurice#1685
right. I'll keep further discussions elsewhere i think

except to say that there's a chance this could be popular for such transport uses as it's lighter and more portable (many nets have the baggage of node, npm)


[26-Jan-20 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
this has a lot of baggage from komodod, the actual dexp2p code is just 2500 lines of C


[26-Jan-20 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
but i guess even with the entire komodod, when stripped, it is 17MB

I was going to ask how to build  a nspv / dexp2p only node -- and was wondering if dexp2p could be deployed in a wasm compatable web browser -- but I am just waiting for this first phase to get to production -- my  guess is yes and to"wait for it" -- Streaming  data  with decentralized personal websites and selling/distributing "things" is my  usecase and will probably be where I will  finally hang  my hat and get to work. - waiting is painful - 17mb   -"According to the website HTTP Archive, which regularly studies the top 10,000 most-visited sites online, the average web page now weighs in at about 1.3 megabytes" - I 
 guess a dexp2p "client" could be made smaller - Back to work, Thank you!


[26-Jan-20 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
dexp2p client would fit in a 512kb or less, with nsPV support, but that would be a fair amount of refactoring


[26-Jan-20 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
-dexp2p option currently drags in the rest of the code


[26-Jan-20 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it would need to be ported into libnspv to have a chance to be able to be put into wasm


[26-Jan-20 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
@gcharang @SHossain @Sir Seven @TonyL primitive support for DEX_publish and DEX_subscribe is in the latest version. it might be fast enough for smallish (<100MB files) to stream, but it isnt very efficient yet, just the first version that was able to sync file to the network. for now it is just to make sure that a static file is transferred properly. 

DEX_publish filename 0 <- this will publish the local file at lowest priority above the VIP priority level
DEX_list 0 0 files <- this will show a list of all the published files, it will have the sha256 filehash

[26-Jan-20 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
if you know the filename already you can directly do: DEX_list 0 0 filename locators and get the id from the most recent published by a pubkey


[26-Jan-20 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
using that id: DEX_subscribe filename 0 id <- that should recreate the file locally


[26-Jan-20 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
to test a basic streaming, start the streaming video recorder and get the filename. then every second do a DEX_publish. horribly inefficient, but if it is the only thing streaming maybe it will be fast enough. on the receiving side, do the DEX_subsribe in a loop with a one second pause.


[26-Jan-20 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
probably it is too inefficient to be transfering the entire file every second, but things are setup so it wont be that much more work to broadcast and update just the new data


[26-Jan-20 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, the file contents can be anything from text files to video files

Seems like some garbage values were added to tags, causing `tag mismatch` error.


[26-Jan-20 02:09 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Small note for tests: DEX_publish will search for a file in a directory you've started komodod from, ae:
```bash
$ pwd
/home/workdir/komodo/files
$ ../src/komodod -ac_name=DEXP2P -dexp2p=2 -ac_supply=999999 -addnode=37.9.62.186 -addnode=94.130.224.11 -daemon
```
^^ in this case DEX_publish will search for files in `/home/workdir/komodo/files` directory, not in `/home/workdir/komodo/src`, where komodod actually is.


[26-Jan-20 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you need to DEX_list 0 0 published_file locators


[26-Jan-20 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
you subscribe to the locators id


[26-Jan-20 06:03 PM] jl777c#5810
the files tag is for validating the sha256 and to find what files exist


[26-Jan-20 06:04 PM] jl777c#5810
think of it this way. at first you have no idea what files are published. how can you discover what files exist?
answer: DEX_list tagA:files


[26-Jan-20 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
once you know the filename, you dont need to do the tagA files search anymore, as you know the filename


[26-Jan-20 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
given a filename, you need a set of locators


[26-Jan-20 06:05 PM] jl777c#5810
to do that you search tagA:filename tagB:locators


[26-Jan-20 06:34 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
hopefully instructions with example can be put up - maybe im tired


[26-Jan-20 06:35 PM] jl777c#5810
i already gave instructions


[26-Jan-20 06:38 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
ill relook in  the AM then


[26-Jan-20 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
fixed the DEX_subscribe so it only updates the new data for a file, but the DEX_publish is still brute force. there is a file size limit of about 500MB (for now). this means you can do a DEX_subscribe every second in a loop (with new id), and performance should still be decent.


[26-Jan-20 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
it also doesnt handle missing data (yet)


[26-Jan-20 07:35 PM] jl777c#5810
but on a network that isnt saturated, it seems very unlikely to have missing data


[26-Jan-20 07:42 PM] jl777c#5810
increased the filesize limit to 4GB, that should be sufficient


[26-Jan-20 08:15 PM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven i added an optional parameter to DEX_subscribe. you can set the id to 0 and specify a pubkey. in that case it will automatically do the filename/locators query for that publisher and use the id of the most recent


[26-Jan-20 08:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so now you can just do a loop with DEX_subscribe filename 0 0 <pubkey> and it will keep the published file in sync locally

[27-Jan-20 01:00 AM] jl777c#5810
also, not decided the best way to retrieve any missing packets, leaning toward a decentralized delivery


[27-Jan-20 01:00 AM] jl777c#5810
due to the filename limitation, might need to have a naming layer that maps from 15 chars to normal full paths


[27-Jan-20 01:01 AM] jl777c#5810
but of course, that is just  a matter to make a simple naming layer tagA:filename tagB:fullpath, well a modified full path relative to home directory


[27-Jan-20 01:01 AM] jl777c#5810
all this can be built on top of DEX_publish/DEX_subscribe


[27-Jan-20 01:02 AM] TonyL#3577
some additional field for a metadata might be useful


[27-Jan-20 01:02 AM] TonyL#3577
or appending of metadata to the message


[27-Jan-20 01:02 AM] TonyL#3577
at least for the package #0


[27-Jan-20 01:02 AM] jl777c#5810
tagA:filename tagB:metadata


[27-Jan-20 01:03 AM] jl777c#5810
if something can be done using the existing primitives, best to use them to make the new functionality, rather than bloating the internals


[27-Jan-20 01:03 AM] Sir Seven#7158
If we use tagB:fullpath, tagB:metadata will not take place.


[27-Jan-20 01:03 AM] TonyL#3577
`also, not decided the best way to retrieve any missing packets, leaning toward a decentralized delivery` maybe like a mark packages `filesum`:`piecenumber` and if node don't have `filesum`:`piecenumber` it starting to ask another peers it's connected to if they got this one

[27-Jan-20 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
so?


[27-Jan-20 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810

[27-Jan-20 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
26^15 = 1.677259342285726e21


[27-Jan-20 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
sufficiently large name space for all the files you can ever make


[27-Jan-20 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
remember the benefit is that tagA gets fully indexed


[27-Jan-20 01:06 AM] TonyL#3577
but to where can I write `Content-MD5` lets say?


[27-Jan-20 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
along with tagA/tagB


[27-Jan-20 01:07 AM] jl777c#5810
make JSON for whatever metadata you want, broadcast to filename/metadata with the hex of the JSON as the payload


[27-Jan-20 01:07 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX_get can they extract the hex, which converts right into the JSON


[27-Jan-20 01:08 AM] TonyL#3577
yep, I've understood the idea, and then we'll need to prove md5sum of metadata with md5sum


[27-Jan-20 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
but there is already a sha256 sum


[27-Jan-20 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
in the files/filename message


[27-Jan-20 01:10 AM] jl777c#5810
so the publisher posts what the sha256 sum is and the receiver can verify it, i will add automatic compare to the subscribe process


[27-Jan-20 01:10 AM] TonyL#3577

it is probably still running


[27-Jan-20 01:11 AM] TonyL#3577
@Alright you also need publisher pubkey


[27-Jan-20 01:11 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont specify id, it needs the publisher pubkey


[27-Jan-20 01:11 AM] TonyL#3577
in subscribe call


[27-Jan-20 01:11 AM] jl777c#5810
i decided to use the tagA/tagB mechanism to build most of the pub/sub, instead of creating new internals


[27-Jan-20 01:12 AM] jl777c#5810
that is how it came together so fast


[27-Jan-20 01:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i also serves as a good testing of the tag indexing


[27-Jan-20 01:12 AM] TonyL#3577
`it is probably still running`  can't locate yet from another node


[27-Jan-20 01:12 AM] jl777c#5810
do a DEX_list 0 0 filename "locators"


[27-Jan-20 01:13 AM] jl777c#5810
if it isnt there yet, then it is still processing


[27-Jan-20 01:13 AM] jl777c#5810
another message that is sent is "files"/filename


[27-Jan-20 01:13 AM] jl777c#5810
that way, all nodes (including publisher) can tell what files are published


[27-Jan-20 01:15 AM] TonyL#3577
ok, will wait more. But if compare time with 5mb file 777mb one should be uploaded already few minute sago


[27-Jan-20 01:15 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe timeout interrupted the process


[27-Jan-20 01:17 AM] Sir Seven#7158
`amountA` tag contains published file size, correct?


[27-Jan-20 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, timeout probably affected things


[27-Jan-20 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
amountA is the file size, amountB is the number of locators


[27-Jan-20 01:29 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL pushed a hardfork version that is limited to 500MB file (test with 100MB or smaller first) also changed network parameters to make it a bit faster, it is hardforking change


[27-Jan-20 01:30 AM] jl777c#5810
you will see on the subscribe side: write:... prints, that appears for each fragment written to disk


[27-Jan-20 01:38 AM] jl777c#5810
this allows to verify the efficiency of the subscribe process. currently, if you have a publish in a loop and a subscribe in a loop, it is making all new locators so it would be creating redundant messages, but now there seems to be no bugs with basic functionality i can optimize the publish side


[27-Jan-20 02:25 AM] TonyL#3577
with 100mb file worked good


[27-Jan-20 02:59 AM] SHossain#0007
i spoke to my DC. they can provide 61 ipv4 addresses as a package. created a support ticket to get that. need to drive down to my DC on Wednesday to install Vmware ESXi.


[27-Jan-20 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
it is very useful to have a bank of ipv4 addresses


[27-Jan-20 03:10 AM] jl777c#5810
calibrated the network settings to allow 500kb/sec, which is 4mbits, should be plenty even with 50% loss of bandwidth due to retries


[27-Jan-20 03:12 AM] jl777c#5810
finding a few issues with large files, probably will need to implement the logic to retrieve missing fragments before improving publish

i'll update both my nodes now


[27-Jan-20 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
good. maybe you can test the streaming setup gcharang came up with?


[27-Jan-20 03:50 AM] gcharang#6833
obs: <https://obsproject.com/> to create a file that keeps increasing in size (set the output format to mkv)
vlc:  <https://www.videolan.org/index.html> to play a file that is being constructed


[27-Jan-20 03:54 AM] SHossain#0007
sure. let me get in speed


[27-Jan-20 04:03 AM] SHossain#0007
doing the recommended setup by @gcharang


[27-Jan-20 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
you will also need to make a shell script that loops on the subscribe on the receive side, probably put a 1 second sleep on it and a shell script loop on the publish side, but without a 1 second sleep


[27-Jan-20 04:43 AM] SHossain#0007
@gcharang what will be the streaming service in setup?


[27-Jan-20 04:44 AM] gcharang#6833
dexp2p is the streaming service üòÖ 
in obs, select the option to save video to file


[27-Jan-20 04:44 AM] SHossain#0007
oh. so, if i have a .mp4 already i can use that without using OBS?


[27-Jan-20 04:45 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, you can just stream it to the network using dexp2p and on another node, use subscribe to recreate it and play using vlc


[27-Jan-20 04:45 AM] gcharang#6833
but mp4 files can't be played properly when they are incomplete


[27-Jan-20 04:46 AM] SHossain#0007
i see. i will to try both option. but, instead of using .mp4 i will convert that to .mkv

[27-Jan-20 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
both publishing and subscribing need to be called in a loop to make it stream


[27-Jan-20 05:32 AM] jl777c#5810
if you think about what publish does, this will make more sense


[27-Jan-20 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it is taking a snapshot of the current file, making fragments out of it and broadcasting each one to the network


[27-Jan-20 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
then also posting a locators file, so any other node can reconstruct it


[27-Jan-20 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
and also sending a message to files/filename so people can get a list of all the available files


[27-Jan-20 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
if any part of the file changes, of course, the existing fragments might be obsolete


[27-Jan-20 05:34 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks. just getting my head around this streaming


[27-Jan-20 05:34 AM] SHossain#0007
will upload the video to my server and start streaming from there and will subscribe from my local computer


[27-Jan-20 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
just think of it as sending a file to the network


[27-Jan-20 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and the file just keeps growing in size, so you send the updated parts


[27-Jan-20 05:35 AM] gcharang#6833
> will upload the video to my server and start streaming from there and will subscribe from my local computer
fyi, this won't help in testing the streaming of a file growing in size

i did just fix one of the last (i hope) bugs with the incremental publish, so definitely update


[27-Jan-20 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
you just want to DEX_publish a filename that is growing in size


[27-Jan-20 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
be it a debug.liog


[27-Jan-20 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
or a video file


[27-Jan-20 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
or audio file


[27-Jan-20 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
or a novel


[27-Jan-20 05:37 AM] SHossain#0007
got it.


[27-Jan-20 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the processing of a 200mb publish now takes about 3 minutes the first time and 6 seconds the second time, when there are no changes


[27-Jan-20 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so with a 30 seconds of buffering, this is actually good enough up to those file sizes. i am doing a compare of 100% of the file to catch any changes. if that is changed to just the last block, it will take only milliseconds to do a new DEX_publish


[27-Jan-20 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
so its getting closer and closer to being useful


[27-Jan-20 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
speed is up to 1MB/sec, and if there are no bugs, i will add a mode for append only files (actually just the last fragment will be allowed to change until it becomes full)


[27-Jan-20 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
then it should be able to continously stream until it hits the 1GB file limit. probably we can say that is big enough as it will be taking 15 minutes to broadcast, which is already 25% of the purgelimit


[27-Jan-20 05:46 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. will use 2 local nodes actually then for this test with latest code. need to setup the 2nd one


[27-Jan-20 05:46 AM] SHossain#0007
let me get some food and will be back on this soon


[27-Jan-20 05:49 AM] jl777c#5810
latest code seems to work as expected for me. there is a printout each time a new packet is broadcast and also when a fragment is saved locally. the publish will do subscribe calls automatically to sync and have the same data other nodes would have, and you can see it "write..." when it updates. each printed line requires network wide action (at least for the nodes that are subscribed)


[27-Jan-20 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
plz ask any questions, been a long day, not sure how much longer i will be online


[27-Jan-20 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
the biggest thing left is the request for missing data, though i am not seeing any need for this so far, still we cant expect the sync to always be 100%, so it is needed. i think after that will just be some small features and bug fixes and the DEX_publish/DEX_subscribe layer will be done. i had allocated this entire week for this so lets find any and all bugs while it is fresh.


[27-Jan-20 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
for now dont go over 1GB, and i expect streaming to bog down when the file gets to around 50MB due to the latency, still it is a good test to find out if streaming video even works at all, and if so, when it stops streaming cleanly


[27-Jan-20 07:28 AM] SHossain#0007

let me know how big the stream file gets when the playback starts getting inconsistent


[27-Jan-20 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
the packets are already broadcast to the network , so any node that is in sync will be able to reconstruct the video stream

can you set the playback buffer to a bigger size?


[27-Jan-20 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
one minute worth if you can


[27-Jan-20 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810

at 126MB, it will take a few seconds between each update, also even  a single missing fragment will have no error recovery today


[27-Jan-20 07:45 AM] SHossain#0007
will start a fresh stream with low resolution video


[27-Jan-20 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
just happy to get the incremental updates working,i feared it would take a lot more


[27-Jan-20 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
126MB got created pretty fast


[27-Jan-20 07:46 AM] SHossain#0007
the stream looked pretty fine when i subscribed to it


[27-Jan-20 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
probably 20MB is the practical size limit for now, unless you can make the playback buffering much bigger


[27-Jan-20 07:47 AM] SHossain#0007
sorry, where can i set the playback buffer? in VLC?


[27-Jan-20 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
just being able to stream at all, that is enough to validate as i know it cant continue and bound to become too slow at some filesize until append mode is added


[27-Jan-20 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
in the playback settings, maybe there is a way to say to make a bigger than normal buffering


[27-Jan-20 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
you know when you playback on the web, it shows two bars, one that is ahead of what you are playing.


[27-Jan-20 07:48 AM] SHossain#0007
checking VLC settings


[27-Jan-20 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
it is getting ahead of the current position so if there is some delay, the playback wont be affected


[27-Jan-20 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
but ultimately if you cant stream the data at full speed, the playback will eventually need to stop


[27-Jan-20 07:49 AM] SHossain#0007
in that case, i have even a lower resolution video at 720p. can try that one


[27-Jan-20 07:50 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Try 480...


[27-Jan-20 07:50 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Did you just stream 1080?


[27-Jan-20 07:50 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
That's awesome


[27-Jan-20 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
he did a full 4k resolution


[27-Jan-20 07:50 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Holy shit


[27-Jan-20 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
but it couldnt keep up as the current algo is not supporting append mode, so it reprocesses the entire file


[27-Jan-20 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
just wanted to make sure the basics are working

ok. 30 sec


[27-Jan-20 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
that should work to 50MB or even 100MB before the send side cant keep up


[27-Jan-20 07:56 AM] SHossain#0007
the only issue was on the receiving side, the file generation ended after 18.3MB


[27-Jan-20 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
tomorrow i can make it so the playback buffer can be set to 10 seconds, or even 5 seconds.


[27-Jan-20 07:56 AM] SHossain#0007
VLC didn't have any issue playing it back


[27-Jan-20 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you manually do a DEX_subscribe for that file, it only makes 18MB?

[27-Jan-20 07:58 AM] SHossain#0007
could that be an issue of any kind if i use a latter file `id`?


[27-Jan-20 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
the locators id has to change, otherwise the data represented by the locators cant change


[27-Jan-20 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
in


[27-Jan-20 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX_stats, is the output matching on both your nodes?


[27-Jan-20 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems that maybe some sleeps need to be added in the scripts


[27-Jan-20 08:01 AM] SHossain#0007
now i tried the very first `id` and the file received is 5.6MB which contains 10 sec video


[27-Jan-20 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, each id is the latest id from publish


[27-Jan-20 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
what if you use the latest id?


[27-Jan-20 08:01 AM] SHossain#0007
```
while true
do
./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_publish 15-37-54.mkv 0
sleep 1
done
```


[27-Jan-20 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
what about on the receive side?


[27-Jan-20 08:01 AM] SHossain#0007
the subscribed node didn't have any sleep in the script


[27-Jan-20 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
change the sleeps on both sides to 5 seconds


[27-Jan-20 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
with 30 seconds buffering that should give enough time to catch up


[27-Jan-20 08:02 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[27-Jan-20 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
but if your nodes are not in sync, then it wont matter


[27-Jan-20 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if you get the id from the larger publish, and use that for subscribe, does it get all the data?


[27-Jan-20 08:03 AM] SHossain#0007
just used the latest `id`, it pulls the full file containing 126MB


[27-Jan-20 08:03 AM] jl777c#5810
without errors?


[27-Jan-20 08:03 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[27-Jan-20 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
ok so the streaming should work, without sleeps was probably just too aggressive


[27-Jan-20 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
try another one


[27-Jan-20 08:04 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[27-Jan-20 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
and maybe do it without the playback player at first, just to make sure the file keeps growing as it should


[27-Jan-20 08:06 AM] SHossain#0007
stream started


[27-Jan-20 08:06 AM] SHossain#0007

10MB in size


[27-Jan-20 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
do this level testing without the player and monitor the subscribe side file size


[27-Jan-20 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
no idea what the player is doing and why it decides to stop


[27-Jan-20 08:09 AM] SHossain#0007
the player stops as soon as it reaches the EOF

what if you manually run the DEX_subscribe


[27-Jan-20 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a problem with the script


[27-Jan-20 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
manually run the script and see if it makes errors

no, i stopped it few mins ago


[27-Jan-20 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why the subscribe side stopped


[27-Jan-20 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
keep the publish side going


[27-Jan-20 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
manually run the subscribe and make sure it is updating the file


[27-Jan-20 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
if not, at least we can see that the id is wrong, or errors, or something more than "it stopped"


[27-Jan-20 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
then when you are able to keep the file growing, the player should just work


[27-Jan-20 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
lets start at the low level and go step by step to find out where it is going wrong


[27-Jan-20 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
we know publish works


[27-Jan-20 08:15 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. running both side


[27-Jan-20 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
we know subscribe works


[27-Jan-20 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yet it stops...


[27-Jan-20 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810

yep


[27-Jan-20 08:22 AM] SHossain#0007
it seems working like that


[27-Jan-20 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so the bug seems to be the auto-fetching of the id


[27-Jan-20 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it always returns the first one?


[27-Jan-20 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if using id 0 and relying on pubkey?


[27-Jan-20 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
this will be a pain to do, but if you can manually copy paste the new ids, it will likely keep the streaming player happy


[27-Jan-20 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
and i will need to duplicate this unchanging id bug to get the streaming to work


[27-Jan-20 08:24 AM] SHossain#0007
i used `id` = 0 and it fetched the full stream of 197MB


[27-Jan-20 08:25 AM] SHossain#0007
shall i try the script with id=0 on subscriber node?


[27-Jan-20 08:25 AM] SHossain#0007
to see if the file continues to grow


[27-Jan-20 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
what id were you using in the subscriber script??


[27-Jan-20 08:25 AM] SHossain#0007
the id from the output of first node


[27-Jan-20 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
then of course it wont change


[27-Jan-20 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
same id ->same data


[27-Jan-20 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
use 0, for it to auto fetch


[27-Jan-20 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
bug was in your script


[27-Jan-20 08:26 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. yes


[27-Jan-20 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
it should just be DEX_subscribe filename 0 0 <pubkey>


[27-Jan-20 08:26 AM] SHossain#0007
doing that now for new stream


[27-Jan-20 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810

@SHossain the next test is to see how many streams can be done at the same time. my estimate is that we can do 1000 10kb packets per second, so that is 10MB/sec of bandwidth, if each stream is using 512 kbits/sec that means we can support about 20 streams at once


[27-Jan-20 09:13 AM] SHossain#0007
let me start with 2 then


[27-Jan-20 09:14 AM] SHossain#0007
seems i can use multiple instances of OBS studio at the same time


[27-Jan-20 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
i am starting to think about how to integrate dexp2p to the coin side of things. keeping in mind that even KMD can run -dexp2p nodes, that means we can make enhanced KMD functionality. a simple feature to add would be a paywall which would add an address and amount needed for a DEX_publish, at first it would just publish that this file would be available if enough funds are sent to the address. then when the funds arrive, the next call to DEX_publish would work normally. it does require trust in the publisher, but it seems the same as for any web purchase


[27-Jan-20 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
open to other ideas on what sort of payments linkages are desired for dexp2p


[27-Jan-20 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the content seller should share the paid funds with the nodes that run the dexp2p, so you can make money by running a node, or by selling content. i will need to add network stats tagA, handle registrations (so you can have a handle, pubkey and payment address linked). then the payments can pay to the top N nodes (based on current statistics) in a single sendmany payment along with payment to the content seller


[27-Jan-20 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
something like that


[27-Jan-20 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
the payments layer will be next, after the file layer is done


[27-Jan-20 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i would also like to be able to substitute payment in lieu of txpow as the txpow really slows things down for large files


[27-Jan-20 09:39 AM] SHossain#0007
2 streams running at the same time


[27-Jan-20 09:39 AM] SHossain#0007
adding more

`missing` message is flooding now

it worked in the first for a bit, then went wonky

Advertisers will pay through nspv pay per click depending on the content - corporation can pay for storage and use....average Joe that only used 5gb has to share 10gb to get personal storage free


[27-Jan-20 09:44 AM] SHossain#0007
though receiving file size is increasing


[27-Jan-20 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
seems network is close to saturation, indeed i will need to add a way to fill in the missing fragments


[27-Jan-20 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it will make the file the full size if it gets the last fragment, just that it will have gaps in the data


[27-Jan-20 09:44 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I have more methods written down at my office


[27-Jan-20 09:45 AM] SHossain#0007
the video files seems got broken due to missing data


[27-Jan-20 09:46 AM] SHossain#0007
they play only for few seconds then display 
```An error occured
Could not demultiplex stream

```


[27-Jan-20 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
you could pay a storage provider to store your data for you long term, it wouldnt be trustless, but rather the model of having a business who needs to provide good service to keep getting paid. the payments could be made incrementally over the duration of the storage contract


[27-Jan-20 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain the missing data wouldnt align to frames, so it would likely be all broken when there is a missing fragment


[27-Jan-20 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
at least we know how to force the network into this state of missing fragments, that is required step to validate the request command i will implement next


[27-Jan-20 09:47 AM] SHossain#0007
cool


[27-Jan-20 09:48 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll check next if i can stream 4K video


[27-Jan-20 09:48 AM] SHossain#0007
only test we did with 720p HD


[27-Jan-20 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
all is working as expected, actually better than i expected if you were able to get to 300MB filesize


[27-Jan-20 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i solved how to make it realtime performance regardless of filesize. a bit tricky, but i should have it done this week

[27-Jan-20 09:56 AM] SHossain#0007
could be due to my local network


[27-Jan-20 09:57 AM] SHossain#0007
720p stream even yielded better video quality

Lol


[27-Jan-20 10:00 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I'm saying most video streams are 720


[27-Jan-20 10:00 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, for low bandwidth users it's 720.


[27-Jan-20 10:01 AM] SHossain#0007
i do watch 720 when 1080p or 2160p is not available


[27-Jan-20 10:01 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
And the sometimes are laggy because of servers


[27-Jan-20 10:01 AM] Mark81#4505
@SHossain   can you elobrate steps to do this  stream to dexp2p and how to watch it from other node?

basically the link above shows the install instructions which you can use. skip the blaster part and change the blaster script with the content from here https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/455851625915875338/671391767383375882


[27-Jan-20 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
you should get a new video file created in your `src` directory which you can play with VLC player or other compatible player


[27-Jan-20 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
if you need all in one place, i can put them in github


[27-Jan-20 10:04 AM] Mark81#4505
and how to broadcast?


[27-Jan-20 10:05 AM] SHossain#0007
for broadcasting you need OBS studio software


[27-Jan-20 10:05 AM] SHossain#0007
and another script 
```
while true
do
./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_publish 15-37-54.mkv 0
sleep 1
done
```


[27-Jan-20 10:06 AM] SHossain#0007
change 15-37-54.mkv file with your own one


[27-Jan-20 10:06 AM] Mark81#4505
so can i upload video with out streaming?


[27-Jan-20 10:06 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, you can


[27-Jan-20 10:07 AM] SHossain#0007
OBS studio is only helpful for Live-Streaming


[27-Jan-20 10:07 AM] SHossain#0007
otherwise, you can upload any video or any file


[27-Jan-20 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
1GB file size limit


[27-Jan-20 10:07 AM] Mark81#4505
and to find it i need publisher public hash?


[27-Jan-20 10:08 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[27-Jan-20 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
you can DEX_list 0 0 files


[27-Jan-20 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it will list all published files


[27-Jan-20 10:08 AM] Mark81#4505
ok


[27-Jan-20 10:08 AM] SHossain#0007
when you use DEX_publish, you will see your pubkey33


[27-Jan-20 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
from that you can find pubkeys


[27-Jan-20 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
and filenames


[27-Jan-20 10:08 AM] SHossain#0007
`DEX_stats` also lists publishers pubkey


[27-Jan-20 10:08 AM] SHossain#0007
i mean for your own node


[27-Jan-20 10:09 AM] SHossain#0007
let me write a blog post about it then


[27-Jan-20 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont start with -pubkey= then it will generate a session specific keypair


[27-Jan-20 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
pubkey needs to be for an address in your wallet


[27-Jan-20 10:20 AM] cipi#4502
don't know if it is a bug or not, but when i use the wrong pubkey on a DEX_broadcast, the local node shows
`senderpub f06574261c3b1459e44e20a2c0b35188b7782d3932273d8f17fa928af95bac65 != pubkey 6997b69b30fce3d70137544ad974576ff25991113308007cd5abedd4244f197f`
but the order is still broadcasted and visible on other nodes


[27-Jan-20 10:20 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Content suppliers and seeders get paid - leachers pay with advertisements or out of pocket- object is to distribute as much as you leech to keep it free or supply enough great content to retire


[27-Jan-20 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
@cipi can the content be decrypted by any other node than 016997b69b30fce3d70137544ad974576ff25991113308007cd5abedd4244f197f


[27-Jan-20 10:23 AM] cipi#4502
how do i check that? DEX_list?


[27-Jan-20 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX_list or DEX_get and see what payload is displayed


[27-Jan-20 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
broadcasting to a pubkey would encrypt it if it is to inbox, i guess if not to inbox it wouldnt...


[27-Jan-20 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
it does seem a bug to not reject this


[27-Jan-20 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
what is the senderpub on the other nodes?


[27-Jan-20 10:27 AM] cipi#4502
no, the orders with the wrong pubkey don't have the field `decrypted` in the DEX_list output, the others do
instead, they have `"error": "wrong sender"` in DEX_list
`"senderpub": "01f06574261c3b1459e44e20a2c0b35188b7782d3932273d8f17fa928af95bac65"`, which is the correct sender (`"publishable_pubkey": "01f06574261c3b1459e44e20a2c0b35188b7782d3932273d8f17fa928af95bac65"`), but the braodacst was with an old pubkey

the first one is a correct one, the second one that was broadcasted with wrong pubkey


[27-Jan-20 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it detects this, seems it isnt a big issuw


[27-Jan-20 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
probably good to just reject this at the rpc level


[27-Jan-20 10:29 AM] cipi#4502
no, was just wondering that the orders are still broadcasted, but  this may be a feature in the future


[27-Jan-20 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
the payload is rejected, so it is in the orderbook falsely. i guess i need to check for such wrong senders and not put it in the orderbook


[27-Jan-20 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
then again, it might allow for some future feature


[27-Jan-20 10:31 AM] cipi#4502
good idea, just remove them from DEX_orderbook output


[27-Jan-20 10:36 AM] Mark81#4505
Is it yet feature to publish file to be ready for sended to another pubkey that fulfill conditions like payment?

One useful feature might be auction type of selling were highest bidder win if there are no new bids given like an hour or so?


[27-Jan-20 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
good idea. i will add to my list. DEX_auction rpc call


[27-Jan-20 10:53 AM] Mark81#4505
Video channel subscriptions would be quite easy to do? How about file storage rent from files uploaded? Or could it be on subscription based model part of that payment goes to nodes holding your content?


[27-Jan-20 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, video subscriptions wouldnt be very hard at all


[27-Jan-20 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no place to upload as the lifetime is one hour, however one thing i wrote above is you can submit (encrypted) data to a service provider who will store it for you for a specified amount of time, with progress payments along the way

@jl777chey there, dont mean to interrupt - cant get a simple answer elsewhere: can you confirm if Ethereum 2.0 plans are looking a lot like what KMD currently offers? from what I read I cant help but notice the parallels but Im also just a layman - thanks!

Adding a way to store and monetize other people's data with  komodo instead of dapps would be a game changer for sure.. Think Tank time.

Nspv might not be fast enough for everything....but it is a thought that could evolve


[27-Jan-20 09:37 PM] jl777c#5810
@jpsyduck for ETH 2.0, do you need to sync all shards or just one of them is enough? not sure of all the details, but i think ETH 2.0 is aiming for a much tighter integration of all the shards into a single master chain, whereas KMD is at the center of its ecosystem, but with all the chains being very independent. we even have totally external chains being dPoW notarized


[28-Jan-20 12:08 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain updated with new version that improved efficiency of the sending. still not totally optimized, but it should be much better. i think it might be able to stream all the way to 1GB size now, though it will get a bit inefficient toward the end when each update will broadcast almost 1MB of locators. to improve this more would need to handle incremental updating on the subscribe side, but that is not so urgent if we can stream all the way to 1GB file. there is a new flag for DEX_publish at the end that defaults to 0, if set to 1, it will rescan the entire file for changes. if 0, it just checks the very end of the file


[28-Jan-20 12:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so i think now, it should be able to handle multiple streams at the same time much better also


[28-Jan-20 12:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i have found some files that are getting decryption errors and that needs to be tracked down and fixed, so probably will be a while before any more pub/sub improvements


[28-Jan-20 12:17 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks. will start testing dual stream soon

does it sync if you do the subscribe manually?


[28-Jan-20 01:44 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, manually worked


[28-Jan-20 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
so you are saying that running the same command in a shell script loop doesnt sync, but the same command manually syncs?

you should replace the priority field

updating my script and starting a new broadcast


[28-Jan-20 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
but still this wont explain why manual subscribe synced and the same in a script doesnt sync. however, for now, always do the rescan DEX_publish as no rescan mode is not fully debugged yet

[28-Jan-20 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
0.02%


[28-Jan-20 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
so 99.98% is there!


[28-Jan-20 06:06 AM] SHossain#0007
i can start again with rescan flag when i'm back


[28-Jan-20 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, please. and i will start on a way to automatically get the missing blocks (even though they should already get there as they are VIP blocks..., so this will take a while to find and fix the sync bug and add a mechanism that allows to request the missing)

the file doesn't get decoded inside the p2p network. it's decoded/encoded in your computer. the `DEX_publish` call just uploads the file that you are specifying


[28-Jan-20 11:04 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
yes --


[28-Jan-20 11:05 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
have no idea when I stop publishing


[28-Jan-20 11:05 AM] SHossain#0007
so, the final file, i can download in one computer without any error. but, on other computer it gets error for 1 missing fragment


[28-Jan-20 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
do the RAM.xxxx match on the two nodes?


[28-Jan-20 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
remember it is only 99.998% in sync


[28-Jan-20 11:07 AM] SHossain#0007
i just downloaded it again without any error on the computer that doesn't have issue to download


[28-Jan-20 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
subscribe DOESNT download


[28-Jan-20 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
it only constructs a file out of the messages you already have in RAM


[28-Jan-20 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you have it 100% in RAM, it wont have errors


[28-Jan-20 11:07 AM] SHossain#0007
you are right.


[28-Jan-20 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
if you dont, it will have errors


[28-Jan-20 11:08 AM] SHossain#0007
not 100% synced


[28-Jan-20 11:08 AM] SHossain#0007
sorry, i meant the constructs bit but used download instead

i have just 2 things left to fix:
a) get sync from 99.99% to 100%
b) automatically compare sha256 from files/filename vs what subscribe gets

if you have any other issues for the DEX_publish/DEX_subscribe layer, let me know sooner than later. i am about to move to the payments layer. fixing bugs while it is top of mind goes 10x to 100x faster

[28-Jan-20 11:46 AM] SHossain#0007
so, it would be `movie3.mkv.0145a9c3bc35372ff3b7f4301ed380d152d17c3d43da3d651a9cd196221a437f46` for you

it is where you ran komodod from

[28-Jan-20 11:54 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
can  ALL codecs be streamed?

you can stream ANY file type

i haven't noticed any memleak issue yet

there is no point to go over 1GB, that is the limit

ok


[28-Jan-20 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
since the data only lives for one hour, 1GB seems plenty big


[28-Jan-20 11:58 AM] SHossain#0007
the RAM `RES` usage never went over 2GB total


[28-Jan-20 11:58 AM] SHossain#0007
stayed within the range of 1900MB


[28-Jan-20 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
but did it reduce back to the starting level after it was purged?


[28-Jan-20 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
ie. is the purging working properly


[28-Jan-20 11:59 AM] SHossain#0007
the chain is being used still. didn't get time to purge fully

Only things I really see is there is no way to watch a live stream / start at last packet - there might be a bashcommand  for that...maybe - also 15 characters is way to small, 30 would be better for file name.  I'll keep looking at finding a solution to start watching from most recent packet - Use Case: trying to set up Live Chat

[28-Jan-20 10:27 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain it could be that the process doesnt free up the memory until the system forces it to... try this:
1. broadcast a large amount so it is noticeable, 
2. wait an hour for RAM.0 so all the packets are gone
3. broadcast same amount, so it would be noticeable

my prediction (hope) is that 3. wont increase the memory much (at all?), which would indicate that during 2, it was freed as if it wasnt, after 3., the memory usage would need to increase to double.

If you try to publish file after cancelling order - daemon stops responding to rpcs.
AE:
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_broadcast messagehere 4 BTC KMD pubkey33 100 20`
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_cancel id`
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_publish publish.tar.gz 0`
Here DEX_publish will fail by timeout, as any other rpc after it.


[29-Jan-20 12:40 AM] jl777c#5810
what id is being cancelled?


[29-Jan-20 12:40 AM] jl777c#5810
does it matter, or does it need to be the broadcast right before that is cancelled


[29-Jan-20 12:43 AM] jl777c#5810
i do DEX_get after the cancel and it works


[29-Jan-20 12:45 AM] Sir Seven#7158
DEX_get works after cancel, yes. Problem occur right after you issue DEX_publish call.


[29-Jan-20 12:46 AM] Sir Seven#7158
id being cancelled is id of order broadcasted in 1st call above.


[29-Jan-20 12:47 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Something like this:
1. broadcast a new order.
2. cancel it.
3. publish any file.

And on DEX_publish daemon stops responding.


[29-Jan-20 04:05 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Yet, no crash in gdb. Hm.


[29-Jan-20 04:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Reproduced on my side with calls sequence above, without `DEX_get` reproducing too


[29-Jan-20 04:28 AM] TonyL#3577
@Sir Seven is it reproducing if you spin fresh (= without not-updated peers) chain?


[29-Jan-20 04:29 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Checked on bootstrapped chain, let me check a fresh one.


[29-Jan-20 04:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Try to publish file right after DEX_broadcast and also try to publish file right on start (just to isolate it more)


[29-Jan-20 04:30 AM] TonyL#3577
brb in 1-2 hours


[29-Jan-20 04:31 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Checked before, happens only after DEX_cancel call.


[29-Jan-20 04:39 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Repeats on fresh chain with above sequence: `broadcast -> cancel -> get -> publish`


[29-Jan-20 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
sounds like a mutex deadlock, can you use gdb and find out what mutex is being deadlocked, it should be DEX_globalmutex, but i can see how it would do that


[29-Jan-20 08:28 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
looks  like a  localhost  "server"  needs to be created to make all the  bells  and  whistles  work  - this  will make it possible to integrate into the real world and  live stream throught the DEXP2P port -- anyway, I will now attempt to find a local dev - localhost server nodes could probably become translators for other types of  decentralized data clusters -  back to my day job

[29-Jan-20 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven i cant reproduce the hang, but the cancel is not working. does DEX_cancel set the "cancelled" field?


[29-Jan-20 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
the DEX_get for the cancelled id, returns 0 for me


[29-Jan-20 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
also, does a DEX_broadcast work in place of DEX_publish? if so, it is very strange as DEX_publish actually has no mutex and just used DEX_broadcast internally


[29-Jan-20 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
what about using rescanflag of 0 vs 1 for the DEX_publish


[29-Jan-20 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
also do all three variants of DEX_cancel trigger the hang, or just cancel by id?


[29-Jan-20 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
trying to see how widespread the hang is


[29-Jan-20 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
update: only id with a pubkey can be cancelled, by that pubkey. that is why cancel wasnt working for me.


[29-Jan-20 12:57 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
fastest and  best way  to  recieve live stream is  to create a flag to start  viewing at last packet recieved  in the daemon - ffmpeg and other apps can transcode the send file -- i  think a  few  more  commands in the receive/DEX_subscribe  for live viewing  would  leap ahead of people trying it the hard way - there are ways  to  transcode  in low/med/high bandwidth  at the same time -- its  reading the file live is where I  am having  troubles with  finding solutions. - who knows  -  maybe there  is  a  method / version out there I can not find.

after i stopped publish & subscribe, all 3 nodes are in sync for RAM value

ok  - I  am out for the  weekend -- Summary: live  streams use servers/ip addresses and ports to make live connections using RTMP - looks like RTPM likes FLV /  SWF file format and probably a couple others.

thanks. i have servers.


[30-Jan-20 03:42 AM] SHossain#0007
i wanted to setup one of my servers with virtualization for 50 VMs


[30-Jan-20 03:43 AM] SHossain#0007
hence the ESXi


[30-Jan-20 03:43 AM] SHossain#0007
that would do a load/scale test of dexp2p


[30-Jan-20 03:43 AM] Mylo#8306
ok cool.  yes that or docker üòõ


[30-Jan-20 03:44 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain pushed a version that has initial implementation to request the missing blocks. when you do a subscribe, if there are any fragments missing, it will broadcast and 'R' request to the network. this will make all nodes behave like the VIP block has just arrived and will do the normal pinging to all their neighbors. which should allow the node that is missing the block to pull it from a neighbor


[30-Jan-20 03:44 AM] jl777c#5810
so do the tests where you were getting 99.99% in sync, but had a few missing and see if this makes it any better, without having negative effects, like longer lag, or increased duplicates, etc.


[30-Jan-20 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
i still cant duplicate the cancel + publish deadlock and am waiting for more info @Sir Seven assuming the retrieval of the missing blocks work, that is about the only thing left that i know of before i can start on the payments layer

[30-Jan-20 03:49 AM] TonyL#3577
`@TonyL#3577 it would be interesting to see if video can be streamed on the 100 node network` isn't ~100% sync a requirement for streaming at the moment?


[30-Jan-20 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess i assumed my fix for sync works


[30-Jan-20 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
also slower streams should work, especially if using higher priorities


[30-Jan-20 03:53 AM] TonyL#3577
great, I'll return to 100 nodes tests from Monday üëç  Will add VNC GUI to test VPS'es configuration to be able to see the picture


[30-Jan-20 03:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if this works, all 100 nodes would be able to watch the same stream at the same time


[30-Jan-20 03:54 AM] jl777c#5810
make sure to have 30 seconds of buffering to allow for lag and time to requests the missing blocks

there were some missing fragments error showed up. but, video is running fine so far without stopping


[30-Jan-20 04:12 AM] SHossain#0007
RAM seems in sync


[30-Jan-20 04:12 AM] SHossain#0007
let's see how this goes


[30-Jan-20 04:12 AM] SHossain#0007
current stream is 720p


[30-Jan-20 04:18 AM] jl777c#5810
there was an error with the missing fragments error, if missing is 0, it is likely a filesize error from rounding


[30-Jan-20 04:18 AM] jl777c#5810
sounds like it is working a bit better than before


[30-Jan-20 04:19 AM] jl777c#5810
do you see any printouts like: received REQUEST command for 5ad0d1c0 t.1580384430


[30-Jan-20 04:19 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, it is working better than before. sometimes RAM values differs for a minute, then, they catch up


[30-Jan-20 04:21 AM] SHossain#0007
there was missing 37, 173, 63, 83, 126


[30-Jan-20 04:21 AM] SHossain#0007
but, since then, no more errors


[30-Jan-20 04:21 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, good. so missing that were made not missing!


[30-Jan-20 04:22 AM] SHossain#0007
unfortunately didn't check for `received REQUEST command for 5ad0d1c0 t.1580384430` and now the stdout is way past that

```


[30-Jan-20 04:23 AM] jl777c#5810
the best proof is if it is able to stream when before it wasnt able to


[30-Jan-20 04:23 AM] SHossain#0007
stream stopped


[30-Jan-20 04:23 AM] jl777c#5810
out of sync?

after 271MB


[30-Jan-20 04:23 AM] jl777c#5810
if in sync, you need a bigger buffer

yes, RAM is out of sync

[30-Jan-20 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
is RAM.30045 going up?


[30-Jan-20 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
on subscriber node


[30-Jan-20 04:32 AM] SHossain#0007
subscriber node doesn't show the `received REQUEST` messages


[30-Jan-20 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the one sending it


[30-Jan-20 04:33 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[30-Jan-20 04:33 AM] SHossain#0007
but, the script is not running there anymore


[30-Jan-20 04:33 AM] SHossain#0007
and manual subscribe was done for once only


[30-Jan-20 04:33 AM] jl777c#5810
REQUEST messages are still arriving?


[30-Jan-20 04:34 AM] SHossain#0007
nope


[30-Jan-20 04:34 AM] SHossain#0007
not in the last 5 minutes


[30-Jan-20 04:34 AM] SHossain#0007
guess, those are the old requests


[30-Jan-20 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, seems expected. but the unexpected is that it isnt updating. let me add prints for the bystander node only


[30-Jan-20 04:35 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[30-Jan-20 04:37 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed debug version just for bystander node


[30-Jan-20 04:37 AM] SHossain#0007
updating that node


[30-Jan-20 04:38 AM] jl777c#5810
after it is restarted, it should resync the VIP packets, hopefully it gets to RAM.30574 1881b95c


[30-Jan-20 04:38 AM] jl777c#5810
then we can do a manual subscribe on the subscriber node and it will have useful debug info in DEX.log of bystander node

cool. updating all nodes


[30-Jan-20 05:02 AM] jl777c#5810
one interesting observation: initial publish was doing about 100 packets per second, i restarted a node and it is getting all the VIP packets at 600 per second. 6x faster


[30-Jan-20 05:02 AM] SHossain#0007
nice


[30-Jan-20 05:03 AM] SHossain#0007
i restarted both nodes with latest source now


[30-Jan-20 05:06 AM] SHossain#0007
waiting for connections between them


[30-Jan-20 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i cant get any node to go out of sync


[30-Jan-20 05:08 AM] SHossain#0007
only the bystander node is connected to both publisher and subscriber node. pub and sub nodes are not connected to each other


[30-Jan-20 05:08 AM] SHossain#0007
all of them have different ip


[30-Jan-20 05:08 AM] SHossain#0007
should i wait a bit?


[30-Jan-20 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
no need, it should route packets end to end

[30-Jan-20 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
has the connections changed?


[30-Jan-20 05:20 AM] SHossain#0007
there were missing fragments and DEX.log now has a lot of data


[30-Jan-20 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
good to know if such a network performs decently


[30-Jan-20 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, if DEX.log has the data, that tells me that the issue is on the subscriber node


[30-Jan-20 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
but it crashed, so maybe the issue was the impending crash


[30-Jan-20 05:21 AM] SHossain#0007
connections still 1 on both sub and pub node


[30-Jan-20 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
very good!


[30-Jan-20 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so sparse networks can stream too


[30-Jan-20 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
at least a mini network of 3


[30-Jan-20 05:23 AM] SHossain#0007
i can run the subscribe script on bystander node if you like


[30-Jan-20 05:23 AM] SHossain#0007
only can't watch the video


[30-Jan-20 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[30-Jan-20 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
this is the worst config for streaming, so that is the best one to use for testing


[30-Jan-20 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
still streaming?

yes, still streaming

pushed fix with fewer prints, fix for off by one filesize, also changed the purgetime to 24hours to help test larger files. this version, has only one reproducible issue i know of and that is fetching the expected filehash, for now ignore that the checkhash is all 0

so maybe a buffer of 60 or more seconds is needed. depends on video resolution and network, but only if we are indeed getting 100% sync


[30-Jan-20 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
which we appear to be!


[30-Jan-20 06:55 AM] SHossain#0007
bystander's node still printing more outputs in DEX.log


[30-Jan-20 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
so this proves that missing blocks are indeed being requested and delivered


[30-Jan-20 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
now we know the process works, i have disabled the DEX.log, probably wont affect performance much. so it is a matter to tune the playback buffer to be big enough so it is at 100% sync by the time the playback reaches that point


[30-Jan-20 06:57 AM] SHossain#0007
1 minute buffer?


[30-Jan-20 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
what buffer did you use for the last test?


[30-Jan-20 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
whatever it was, double it

its a good sign it continues playback even with missing, that means it is getting them in time before the buffer runs out

do another publish manually on the publishers node

here is a workaround that should keep things better in sync. do a DEX_broadcast with a higher priority, something like 8 that will dramatically reduce the chance of the locators to not get to the other nodes. then with a 90 second buffer it should sync better


[30-Jan-20 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
while these results are pretty good, actually better than i expected as it was just the first level of REQUEST, it is clear i need a fallback in case the REQUEST doesnt bring in the missing. that wont be ready until next week


[30-Jan-20 07:25 AM] SHossain#0007
bystander node also can't find the id


[30-Jan-20 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
publish at priority of 8


[30-Jan-20 07:25 AM] SHossain#0007
`DEX_get 1250843408` doens't return anything


[30-Jan-20 07:26 AM] SHossain#0007
sure. will do priority 8 now


[30-Jan-20 07:27 AM] SHossain#0007
all nodes have different RAM value now


[30-Jan-20 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be off by a few due to the lost locators messages

[30-Jan-20 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
it really isnt a streaming friendly protocol now on the locators side, so maybe i need to improve that too, however duplicating these missing data cases is very good as it is getting not so easy to do. it could be that priority 8 and 90 seconds buffer without DEX.log will be sufficient to get to 200 to 500 MB


[30-Jan-20 07:32 AM] SHossain#0007
shall i do that now or wait for update?


[30-Jan-20 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i am seeing all the data arrive, whenever the locator is there. only problem when locator is missing


[30-Jan-20 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
what update?


[30-Jan-20 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
changing to priority 8 and buffer of 90 seconds doesnt require an update


[30-Jan-20 07:32 AM] SHossain#0007
meaning, if you are going to change anything in the source


[30-Jan-20 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
and it wont be till next week for any significant update


[30-Jan-20 07:33 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. i'll set the buffer to 90 sec now and priority 8 for the next streaming


[30-Jan-20 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i want to get test results with the current REQUEST method. then i will lower the data blocks to priority of 0 and see if we can maintain the same performance. if so, that will make it much better as currently it is using VIP priority for data, which is a bit of overkill


[30-Jan-20 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so you are running several tests to see how far it gets and after that i will know what the next steps should be


[30-Jan-20 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
hopefully we can go from 100MB to 200MB+ with this next set of tests

[30-Jan-20 07:37 AM] SHossain#0007
it takes some time before subscriber can subscribe after a stream has started with priority 8

diagnose it


[30-Jan-20 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
was it due to not sync or buffer too short


[30-Jan-20 07:41 AM] SHossain#0007
buffer might have been short due to missing file arriving late i guess


[30-Jan-20 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. maybe wait until you see the stats lines are not so far apart, but not more than a couple minutes


[30-Jan-20 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
are the nodes in sync now?


[30-Jan-20 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
if so, it was due to too short a buffer and maybe you can just resume the playback

[30-Jan-20 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
modern systems overhead for writing and reading a file is near 0, as it all ends up being cached to RAM anyway


[30-Jan-20 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you have some very ancient HDD that actually spins and takes 10+ milliseconds for a write, but even such old devices have much higher write bandwidth than network


[30-Jan-20 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
dont worry about using files


[30-Jan-20 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
to do live video chat, each side publishes a file that is streamed


[30-Jan-20 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can stream one file from one node, doing a second file from a second node is just doing the same thing and if they are just two sides of a conversation, then it is video chat. however there is no encryption in dexp2p for the file layer at this time. it probably wouldnt be very hard to add this, but it would require an additional parameter to rpc call

seems you are not running latest, but that is some sort of strange error. is anybody else seeing such errors?


[30-Jan-20 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, i see, you are running old version on at least one node and new version on at least one node


[30-Jan-20 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
hence the confusion with modval > purgetime


[30-Jan-20 11:13 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
ill retart and  try  again


[30-Jan-20 11:14 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280

[30-Jan-20 11:14 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
maybe bash scripts  were  running from last run


[30-Jan-20 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
it is the komodod that is out of date


[30-Jan-20 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
the node that printed that out was on the old version of one hour purgetime


[30-Jan-20 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
it got a packet with a one day purgetime


[30-Jan-20 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
incompatible -> strange errors that are not real errors as i will add network protocol versioning at some point


[30-Jan-20 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
current protocol is not designed for more than one streaming file at a time as it is 100x less efficient than possible


[30-Jan-20 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
wait till next week to do parallel streams

Okay. DEX_publish will be locked only after DEX_cancel.
No matter if you cancel order by id, pubkey pr tags.
Withought using DEX_cancel -> all works just fine, and no calls will be locked after DEX_cancel except publish.
AE: `broadcast -> cancel -> broadcast` have no issues.

For mutex, what can I see with gdb:
On DEX_publish call, `zcash-msghand` thread will be locked by thread `zcash-httpworke`. If I got it correctly.

The one usecase came to mind for dexp2p is the App Store for Blockchain based apps.


[30-Jan-20 07:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Signed and verified by Blockchain tx, and requested and sent to the end user device through broadcasting the app file with install scripts for specific OS.

Agreed @grewalsatinder was thinking about that as well. It‚Äôs at least one measure to help ensure you‚Äôre getting what the author published, which I‚Äôm always skeptical of.

@Sir Seven thanks for detailed report. pushed fix


[30-Jan-20 10:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
combining with the Verus's ID, this p2p broadcasting can also be used to serve p2p websites üòâ


[30-Jan-20 10:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
we have seen the similar usecase with zeronet project, but that was with torrents network


[30-Jan-20 10:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the downside with zeronet is that it had to download the whole history of the website to get the updated content of the zeronet website.


[30-Jan-20 10:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but with this dexp2p, only the current required website is possible to be served.

by integrating it with nanopayments, the content could be delivered only if a few satoshis was paid. since the data is only in RAM for an hour, a popular site would get revenue every hour


[30-Jan-20 10:21 PM] jl777c#5810
new version is a "hardfork"


[30-Jan-20 10:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, and we do have the cc-channels already, so as you said before, Komodo has all the building blocks needed to make a full fledge amazing blockchain based app


[30-Jan-20 10:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think of such app to be not an app, but a system service, running in a background showing just the toolbar icon instead of taskbar app icon.
purpose of that to instead using a desktop app, using the web browser


[30-Jan-20 10:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
it can be for example accessed like with `kdapp://SomeDEXWebsite` etc. or may be `http://SomeDEXWebsite.kdapp`


[30-Jan-20 10:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and if designed to be non JS based, like nspv HTML page, it can still do things it needs to do


[30-Jan-20 10:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I actually lean more towards WASM instead of Js built app,

Can't reproduce cancel -> publish lock bug now.

Got another one:
Started two-nodes chain from bootstrap, waited ~30s, got segfault.
backtrace:
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/BddPpyzqD5/

On `Fix peerpos mismatch` `b136cc5`, should I just take latest commit?

pushed fix, use latest


[31-Jan-20 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain found and fixed a bug that might explain loss of sync, not sure if it fixes it, as i cant reproduce the non-syncing. when you get a chance, update to latest, and do the sync test like before. but you can make the publish side have a 10 second sleep


[31-Jan-20 01:08 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Doesn't segfault in background now.

Got one on DEX_broadcast, backtrace:
https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/gjCq2GYqTs/

Happens on broadcast without pubkey, AE `./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_broadcast message1 12 TA TB '' 11 10`

On `345c141` `Revert restart request `


[31-Jan-20 01:14 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed a workaround for this, if pubkey isnt specified, it defaults to the DEX_pubkey. the edge case for crash is still there, but this will work around it for the most part. will fix it more fully later

that id was missed, do another publish


[31-Jan-20 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
also i properly fixed the Sir Seven bug, so all should be happy now


[31-Jan-20 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
a priority 12 message should get to all nodes, unless it just wasnt connected


[31-Jan-20 07:36 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. publishing with priority 12. but, publishing is very slow. timing it now


[31-Jan-20 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if a node doesnt have a locators packet, it wont be able to know what blocks to get


[31-Jan-20 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i am adding txpow and command priorities now


[31-Jan-20 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
it should take about 1 second for a locators packet


[31-Jan-20 07:38 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it was set a bit too high, reduced it with latest version

it took some time to publish some fragments


[31-Jan-20 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810

2 minute buffer


[31-Jan-20 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is the first time the publisher node was too slow

ok. doing 1 sec sleep. buffer already set to 2 min


[31-Jan-20 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, i forgot i hardened the txpow against fpga


[31-Jan-20 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
let me update the constants


[31-Jan-20 08:01 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[31-Jan-20 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, new constants should work much better, keep sleep at 1 second


[31-Jan-20 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i forgot i made things 30x slower already and things were set 30x too slow


[31-Jan-20 08:03 AM] SHossain#0007
updating


[31-Jan-20 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
fyi, its set to a 2 hour purgetime now. one day was too long, it never forgot anything


[31-Jan-20 08:07 AM] SHossain#0007
cool


[31-Jan-20 08:07 AM] SHossain#0007
should i change `sleep 5`  to `1` in subscriber node?


[31-Jan-20 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
testing 1GB file had not enough time at 1 hour


[31-Jan-20 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
at current settings sleep 5 or 1, it shouldnt matter


[31-Jan-20 08:07 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[31-Jan-20 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
just depends on if it is fast enough,but the more times publish is called now, the less efficient it is


[31-Jan-20 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i think i solved how to make it efficient enough for streaming, but it requires some complex logic to handle that in a way that doesnt break what is already working


[31-Jan-20 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so next week for that. i am hoping that the edge case bug i fixed will allow 100% sync in the cases we were losing sync

when i tried to open the video file


[31-Jan-20 08:10 AM] SHossain#0007
guess thats the syatem issue


[31-Jan-20 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe bad video makes it hang?


[31-Jan-20 08:12 AM] SHossain#0007
not sure exactly. mouse moves on this 1950x Ubuntu 18.04. everything else just not active


[31-Jan-20 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
might be good to manually subscribe the first part of the video to make sure it syncs before starting the video player


[31-Jan-20 08:12 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll get back to it tonight


[31-Jan-20 08:13 AM] SHossain#0007
so far publisher node streamed 115MB file


[31-Jan-20 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, at least it is back to working again


[31-Jan-20 08:13 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, it's working it seems


[31-Jan-20 08:14 AM] SHossain#0007
my fear is, this hang might be related to my machine. but, we will see.

@SHossain 
I've got once something similair on master branch, few weeks back.
You issue `stop` call, daemon stops responding to rpc, yet hangs here in background as running process and prevents lock on ./komodo/ directory. Same behavior?


[31-Jan-20 02:48 PM] SHossain#0007
i haven't checked this part `prevents lock on ./komodo/ directory`
but, daemon keeps running in the background as running process using full single CPU thread


[31-Jan-20 02:48 PM] SHossain#0007
might be similar to yours


[31-Jan-20 02:49 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Hmm, will try to reproduce on my end. Thought about it as a 1 time occurrence.


[31-Jan-20 02:50 PM] SHossain#0007
nope. it wasn't 1 time for me. first i ignored it today when i was testing last time. then, now.


[31-Jan-20 02:51 PM] SHossain#0007
i run all daemons through `gdb` for catching any unexpected crash or behaviour while testing


[31-Jan-20 02:51 PM] SHossain#0007
hope the above backtrace data helps to identify the issue

[31-Jan-20 11:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if CPU usage was 100% during this time, it is due to the inefficient protocol that is not updated yet


[31-Jan-20 11:12 PM] jl777c#5810
the locators file is half a MB+ when the file is 500MB, which means you are hashing 500MB checking id, incrementing nonce, repeating


[31-Jan-20 11:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if you get unlucky it could be a long time before you find a valid nonce


[31-Jan-20 11:13 PM] jl777c#5810
so for now lets say 200MB is the size limit for publish for streaming


[31-Jan-20 11:13 PM] jl777c#5810
until it goes to a purely incremental publish, there will be these performance based limits i talk about

mshark is just compounding the monthly rewards. supernet has a bit of a broader charter and its funds are used to support the ecosystem, but usually it doesnt spend all of the rewards so the total should be gradually going up

The richlists updates each 20minutes via rpc call directly from the daemon so it should be pretty accurate

Hello, I have a cryptocurrency project. project content; poll, election voting in the blockchain. I need experienced friends with the details of the project.


[02-Feb-20 07:25 PM] jl777c#5810
for elections, we just make a new coin. send it to voters and have them send it to addresses of candidates. normal blockexplorer and richlist does the tally


[02-Feb-20 09:10 PM] gcharang#6833
@Tuncay van√ßin if you need to use the same blockchain for multiple polls/elections, you can use Oracles: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/oracles.html> #kmdlabs is expereinced in doing that
 you could even create new tokens <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/tokens.html> and airdrop them to different addresses based on any criteria you'd like. Then have the voters send the tokens to the candidates' addresses

[02-Feb-20 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
ok


[03-Feb-20 12:24 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain there is a new release that prepares for much better streaming. i change the DEX_publish to get a sliceid at the end, if it is 0, it will be like rescan was before.
publishing a slice will create a 1MB fragment of the file, using the same method as publishing with rescan


[03-Feb-20 12:27 AM] jl777c#5810
this allows MUCH faster publishing and subscribing, as each is done to a 1MB slice. it does mean there is an additional step of:
DEX_publish 0 0 filename 1
DEX_publish 0 0 filename 2
...
DEX_publish 0 0 filename n

and then all the fragments will need to be combined to create the actual file. once the low level slice publishing/subscribe is working, then i will make a DEX_stream rpc call that will automatically issue the correct DEX_publish ... sliceid on the publish side and on the subscribe side, i can probably just add an automatic slice combiner/cleanup of the zillions of files


[03-Feb-20 12:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so for now, what is important is that the proper slice is put into the proper filename.offset and that it isnt doing any redundant


[03-Feb-20 03:33 AM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c nice. updating my nodes. do i need to publish the slices manually? or is there a script to send them automatically?


[03-Feb-20 03:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the DEX_publish extracts the slice and publishes it


[03-Feb-20 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
but it only creates file.0, file.1, ... file.n-1

these 1MB slices can then be combined and compared with the original file


[03-Feb-20 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
for now only the slice extraction and publish is done.


[03-Feb-20 03:39 AM] jl777c#5810
for the subscribe, you would need to subscribe to the file.0, but maybe that wont even work with current rpc. i will be changing the subscribe side anyway, so as long as you see the packets go out and the proper sized slice files created locally, that is good enough for now


[03-Feb-20 03:41 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks for the explanation. i'll test the publish now

just waiting on the VPS to finish updating


[03-Feb-20 03:50 AM] SHossain#0007
so, instead of using `./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_publish test.mkv 0 1` i should use `./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_publish test.mkv 0 0` now?

not broadcasting more than 652MB while the file size is about 823MB


[03-Feb-20 04:40 AM] SHossain#0007
the reason broadcasting stopped is i guess the lock in the daemon like last time. it just hanged and not responding to `stop` call


[03-Feb-20 04:49 AM] SHossain#0007
took some time before the daemon stopped after the RPC `stop` call. like about 10 minutes and i got this on my `gdb` screen

file size is lower and hash doesn't match


[03-Feb-20 04:54 AM] SHossain#0007
but, on the bystander node, manual subscribe does show similar result and hash as the subscriber's node


[03-Feb-20 04:55 AM] SHossain#0007
so, it seems the file is ok on other nodes


[03-Feb-20 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
yes that is the old way, and it is going to have problems over 200MB, 500MB+ is actually quite good for that mode


[03-Feb-20 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
change the last 0 to 1, or 2, 3, 4, ... to get slices, but that is not practical to do by hand for a streaming file, only for a static file


[03-Feb-20 06:25 AM] SHossain#0007
oh...cool


[03-Feb-20 06:26 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, manually doing might not be practical


[03-Feb-20 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
but you can manual test the slices to make sure it is slicing properly


[03-Feb-20 06:26 AM] SHossain#0007
then, this new system worked very fine. except for the slight glitches on the video playback


[03-Feb-20 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
but you used the old system


[03-Feb-20 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the inefficient and not good enough to stream method


[03-Feb-20 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
having sliceid of 0 is identical to how it used to be (unless i made new bugs)


[03-Feb-20 06:28 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, i used `./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_publish 11-53-30.mkv 0 0` in a loop


[03-Feb-20 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the old way


[03-Feb-20 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the new way would need to do:
./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_publish 11-53-30.mkv 0 1
./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_publish 11-53-30.mkv 0 2
./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_publish 11-53-30.mkv 0 3
./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_publish 11-53-30.mkv 0 ...
./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_publish 11-53-30.mkv 0 653


[03-Feb-20 06:30 AM] SHossain#0007
got it. will test this


[03-Feb-20 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
and that will publish 11-53-30.mkv.0, 11-53-30.mkv.1000000, 11-53-30.mkv.2000000, 11-53-30.mkv...., 11-53-30.mkv.653000000


[03-Feb-20 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
currently the only way to reconstruct the file is by manually concatenating it, so i would start with a much smaller file

just one slice though


[03-Feb-20 06:39 AM] SHossain#0007
i'm doing more


[03-Feb-20 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
if the slicing works then i will make a DEX_stream rpc that basically checks the file size and do a bunch of DEX_publish with sliceids


[03-Feb-20 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
or maybe it just does the next one, so you can then put DEX_stream rpc in a while true loop


[03-Feb-20 06:40 AM] SHossain#0007
just wanted to post the output. i'll publish a smaller file now


[03-Feb-20 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
once the publish side is automated with the DEX_stream, then i will make a DEX_streamsub(scribe) that will automatically get the slices, combine them and extend the main file


[03-Feb-20 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
once that is in place, then streaming becomes 100x more efficient than the old way as only locators for 1MB are needed, and it fits in <1kb, as opposed to 600kb to 1MB which will then take forever to calculate the nonce. that is why it seems stuck for so long with the old way


[03-Feb-20 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr there is a clear path to very efficient streaming

@jl777c do all fullnodes respond to queries by nspv clients by default or does it need any parameter at launch?


[03-Feb-20 07:02 AM] gcharang#6833
^ not the dexp2p related ones, the regular commands


[03-Feb-20 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
the latest fullnodes should respond to most of the nSPV commands, only if addressindex and spentindex are set will they respond to all of them

can you tell me why not 24?


[03-Feb-20 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt really matter, 23 or 24. the reason is 23 * 11 bits is 253


[03-Feb-20 08:39 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, security wise doesn't really matter, but users would be confused and may think they missed backing up a word
can we make this 24?


[03-Feb-20 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
plz make an issue in libnspv repo with all the details for OUR libnspv connection error.


[03-Feb-20 08:39 AM] gcharang#6833
will do


[03-Feb-20 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we just need to document it better if people are getting confused over the number of words?


[03-Feb-20 08:40 AM] gcharang#6833
I mean the experience compared to other apps
where the number of words is either 12 or 24. "23" just looks odd


[03-Feb-20 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
23*11 is 253


[03-Feb-20 08:43 AM] alesha123#1898
Other services will not accept 23 words


[03-Feb-20 08:43 AM] gcharang#6833
I don't understand the significance of 23*11


[03-Feb-20 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
other services likely doesnt support our method of generating wif, so it wont matter even if it was 24 words, it still wont be compatible


[03-Feb-20 08:47 AM] gcharang#6833
> I don't understand the significance of 23*11
ok, 11 comes from 2 ^ 11 = 2048 --> number of bip39 words
and 253 is just less than 256


[03-Feb-20 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
special handling would need to be made for the 24th word


[03-Feb-20 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
these are the bip39 words, but it isnt using bip39 method


[03-Feb-20 08:48 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, got it


[03-Feb-20 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i wont reject a PR that adds 24th word properly that extracts just the 3 bits from it, but this code was long ago and not fresh in mind anymore, will take me a while to get back up to speed. for such bugs, it is best to ask while it is still fresh for me, then i can fix it immediately. after such a long time, if it isnt broken, i dont really want to "fix" it

[03-Feb-20 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
can you run a seed node and see if it connects properly?


[03-Feb-20 09:18 AM] gcharang#6833
I did run a OUR node locally and used it as a seed. it had `nLocalServices 70000005 1, 1`
nSPV client showed the same behaviour (shutting down after the brief output)

are you asking me to try something else?


[03-Feb-20 09:18 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, didnt realize you already did that. how many peers did your fullnode have?


[03-Feb-20 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is running out of peers? but that seems unlikely


[03-Feb-20 09:29 AM] gcharang#6833
it has 6 peers and all of them have `"services": "0000000070000005",`
dimxy is debugging it currently. he might have better luck

I think that I must choose a value for ASSETCHAINS_ADAPTIVEPOW for chips (strictly above 3 I think). Maybe I should perform some tests with different values, I don't know. I saw a 3 for "DEX" somewhere but with chips'blocktime, I don't think that 3 will work, maybe 4. What do you think about it ?

@phm87 4 or 5 are probably good numbers, but the best way is to test to see how responsive the filters you want

reversing the byte order makes the client connect properly
 
the problem with RICK was that, the nodes in the nspv key were outdated. will send a PR with new nodes


[04-Feb-20 12:34 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain pushed update with DEX_stream filename <priority>
you can call it in a loop and it should figure out what DEX_publish sliceid to issue, so you can just iterate it to get all the slices automatically published. things to watch out for are missing checkhash, also try long filenames, earlier it was a bug where i added the slice offset to the filename, but that would go beyond the max len of 15


[04-Feb-20 12:35 AM] jl777c#5810
working on the DEX_streamsub that will connect to these slices and automatically create the original file from the slices, but at least half the problem seems to be solved now

with new chains those prints are gone


[04-Feb-20 02:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it probably was kmdkrazy nodes not updated


[04-Feb-20 02:07 AM] jl777c#5810
latest has alpha version of DEX_streamsub


[04-Feb-20 02:07 AM] jl777c#5810
pass in filename priority and pubkey


[04-Feb-20 02:07 AM] jl777c#5810
you can start it at anytime and when it sees the DEX_stream, it should start getting the slices


[04-Feb-20 02:08 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. updating


[04-Feb-20 02:08 AM] jl777c#5810
ignore wrong size errors and strange values for now, checkhash doesnt seem to work either


[04-Feb-20 02:09 AM] jl777c#5810
just want to make sure you can be DEX_stream on one node while DEX_streamsub on the other node and see how much of a delay from when a slice is published to when it syncs on the streamsub node. this time is the minimum size for the playback buffer, and best to double or triple it to have some margin for error


[04-Feb-20 02:09 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont actually create the file yet, it is just getting the various slices for now, which clearly needs to work properly before construcing the full file


[04-Feb-20 02:11 AM] Sir Seven#7158
On latest:
If you use slice number too high, daemon will crash.
AE, after broadcasting ~100kb single file:
`DEX_subscribe file.txt 0 2`, where 2 does not exist daemon will crash.

[04-Feb-20 02:12 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, will investigate that. slice support on subscribe side is not fully working yet, but i am seeing the subscribe side within a few seconds of the publish side


[04-Feb-20 02:12 AM] jl777c#5810
for slices, use DEX_streamsub and not DEX_subscribe


[04-Feb-20 02:13 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Yet to check streamsub, DEX_subscribe with correct slice num seems to work just fine.


[04-Feb-20 02:15 AM] jl777c#5810
streamsub just looks at local files and issues the appropriate DEX_subscribe (without going off the end), but i do need to fix any crashes after the streamsub is reconstructing the file and cleaning up the temp files properly

checkhash is 0 for all slices


[04-Feb-20 02:18 AM] jl777c#5810
since it is doing it incrementally, it should be possible to stream indefinitely, even with a hour purgetime


[04-Feb-20 02:19 AM] jl777c#5810
i will post when the various smaller issues are fixed, but for now working to get it to actually reconstruct the real file


[04-Feb-20 02:19 AM] SHossain#0007
cool


[04-Feb-20 02:26 AM] SHossain#0007
publisher sent about 160 slices. but, subscriber pulled only 25 of them


[04-Feb-20 02:33 AM] jl777c#5810
is it getting 100% of the 25th slice?


[04-Feb-20 02:34 AM] jl777c#5810
"filesize": 994536,
seems it got only a partial block


[04-Feb-20 02:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i fixed the checkhash and added a comparison to it


[04-Feb-20 02:35 AM] jl777c#5810
update and see if it can find the missing data and fix it


[04-Feb-20 02:38 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. updating


[04-Feb-20 02:39 AM] SHossain#0007
50 files on the last streamsub node are 25MB in size


[04-Feb-20 02:40 AM] SHossain#0007
50 being 2 files for 1 slice as there are same amount of `.locators` file for each slice


[04-Feb-20 02:43 AM] jl777c#5810
for a new test make sure to remove all the existing locators and slices files


[04-Feb-20 02:43 AM] jl777c#5810
rm <filename>.* should do it


[04-Feb-20 02:43 AM] SHossain#0007
yep, i was doing that already üôÇ


[04-Feb-20 02:44 AM] jl777c#5810
with checkhash working, it is having a bit more lag, about 10 seconds


[04-Feb-20 02:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but all slices seem to be 100% matching before it goes to the next one


[04-Feb-20 02:45 AM] jl777c#5810
the case of a node coming online after the stream starts, is a much different code path and i see issues with that. for now just test the cases where you are nice to it

no need for sleep on the streamsub side

or even the publish side


[04-Feb-20 02:48 AM] SHossain#0007

will start the script again without sleep


[04-Feb-20 02:52 AM] SHossain#0007
restarting stream as i'm not getting any new slices there anymore


[04-Feb-20 02:53 AM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c `sleep 1` is good on `DEX_stream` node?


[04-Feb-20 02:53 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[04-Feb-20 02:53 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. thanks


[04-Feb-20 02:55 AM] SHossain#0007
without sleep on streamsub node, it's getting files faster.
but, while stream node is using sleep 1, the sub node sometimes showing `couldnt find id`. this is not an issue

but, still working fine


[04-Feb-20 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
when it bogs down or stops syncing, try the new update. i think i fixed the streamsub slowdown


[04-Feb-20 03:05 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. updating and starting a new stream soon


[04-Feb-20 03:13 AM] jl777c#5810
other than occasional "couldnt find id" errors when it tries to go too fast, the streamsub was within 1 second of the publishing for 108 MB file, it seems it is almost ready for a real video stream as the DEX_stream file, the streamsub wont have any file to view, but we can see if the streamsub script is keeping up


[04-Feb-20 03:18 AM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven i dont understand your crash and how you issued the command, there is no way to issue the sliceid from rpc


[04-Feb-20 03:18 AM] jl777c#5810

Yes, can't reproduce problem with slices.


[04-Feb-20 03:33 AM] Sir Seven#7158
It's a different one. Hm. Still, same backtrace as previous one.
I probably missed something before.

it has 1 connection


[04-Feb-20 04:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are streaming file with same name as before, it can get confused with older slices


[04-Feb-20 04:02 AM] jl777c#5810
@Sir Seven pushed possible fix for your crash


[04-Feb-20 04:02 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain latest version also creates the full file on the streamsub node


[04-Feb-20 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i just put it into <filename> this allows to compare with the DEX_subscribe version of the file


[04-Feb-20 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming network has connectivity, this version might be able to stream indefinitely


[04-Feb-20 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
having a sleep 3 on the streamsub side removes most of the "couldnt find id" errors, it happens if the requested data isnt there yet


[04-Feb-20 04:11 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. updating again and trying. just give me some time please


[04-Feb-20 04:11 AM] Sir Seven#7158
Getting error instead of crash. Looks fine.


[04-Feb-20 04:13 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain no problems, with latest version if you start clean, it should be able to display the stream for a lot longer than before, possibly indefinitely if there are no bugs. just let me know when you are able to get a stream test going. will start to cleanup the streamsub files


[04-Feb-20 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, got a "stream" working from a big file of 108MB, it synced in realtime (no sleep on publish side, 1 second on streamsub side), streamsub side automatically deletes the slice files as the main file is extended. i think file publishing (both allatonce and streaming) is now feature complete and just need to fix bugs


[04-Feb-20 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810
stream is going at about half a megabyte per second, with < 5seconds latency, so the playback buffer might be able to be set to a much smaller number, like 10 seconds or even 5 seconds. but first make sure it works with 30 seconds buffer


[04-Feb-20 04:58 AM] SHossain#0007
stream started on my side as well


[04-Feb-20 04:58 AM] SHossain#0007
26MB


[04-Feb-20 04:59 AM] SHossain#0007
after 26MB couldn't get new file and they are not joined


[04-Feb-20 05:00 AM] jl777c#5810
need to troubleshoot it by finding what is going wrong


[04-Feb-20 05:00 AM] jl777c#5810
at the low level, all that is happening are publish and subscribe

bystander node seen these ^^


[04-Feb-20 05:00 AM] TonyL#3577
I think I'm ready with many nodes streaming try. Is it right time to do or it's better to wait?


[04-Feb-20 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a good time to see how your nodes do, starting with 10


[04-Feb-20 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
i am seeing good results


[04-Feb-20 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
shossain, not as good


[04-Feb-20 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
seeing what sort of results you get will help troubleshoot


[04-Feb-20 05:02 AM] TonyL#3577
great üëç  is there some new mechanism for broadcasting? last few days was on other things so missed progress there


[04-Feb-20 05:02 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX_stream <filename> <priority>


[04-Feb-20 05:02 AM] jl777c#5810
do the above in a loop


[04-Feb-20 05:02 AM] jl777c#5810
that will make 1MB slices and publish them


[04-Feb-20 05:03 AM] TonyL#3577
will I get errors when there is nothing more to slice or it'll start again from beginning?


[04-Feb-20 05:03 AM] jl777c#5810
on the receive node do a: DEX_streamsub <filename> <priority> 0 <pubkey>


[04-Feb-20 05:03 AM] jl777c#5810
do that in a loop

[04-Feb-20 05:04 AM] SHossain#0007
i have these 3 files in there in the sub node


[04-Feb-20 05:04 AM] jl777c#5810
it will keep waiting for more data to be added to the file


[04-Feb-20 05:04 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain you need to find the specific id the publish side made for the full 35th slice


[04-Feb-20 05:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it is the 36th slice


[04-Feb-20 05:05 AM] jl777c#5810
find the id from the publishing node, see if it exists on the streamsub node


[04-Feb-20 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
if not, it would explain how things get stuck. i only send out a single slice locators message


[04-Feb-20 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
also what happens if you delete: 12-56-35.mkv.26000000.016a0791ad51def703a61814db20f853a7b017477d3951293c4958975473ac383c


[04-Feb-20 05:07 AM] SHossain#0007
sorry, you mean the .27000000 th one?


[04-Feb-20 05:07 AM] jl777c#5810
you can do a DEX_list 0 0 12-56-35.mkv 35000000


[04-Feb-20 05:07 AM] SHossain#0007
oh..ok


[04-Feb-20 05:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes,


[04-Feb-20 05:07 AM] jl777c#5810
you can do a DEX_list 0 0 12-56-35.mkv 26000000


[04-Feb-20 05:07 AM] jl777c#5810
what ids does that show?


[04-Feb-20 05:08 AM] jl777c#5810
basically you need to find the correct id it should be using from the publishers node


[04-Feb-20 05:08 AM] jl777c#5810
then see if that id is on the sub node


[04-Feb-20 05:08 AM] jl777c#5810
or why it is trying to get the wrong id

[04-Feb-20 05:10 AM] SHossain#0007
`DEX_list 0 0 12-56-35.mkv 26000000` ^^ matches the sub node


[04-Feb-20 05:10 AM] SHossain#0007
testing the 27000000 now


[04-Feb-20 05:10 AM] jl777c#5810
but that is wrong, it should be for a full MB


[04-Feb-20 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
slices are 1MB


[04-Feb-20 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
except for the very last one


[04-Feb-20 05:12 AM] SHossain#0007
do you want the data for the 27000000th slice?


[04-Feb-20 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[04-Feb-20 05:12 AM] SHossain#0007
both node see same data


[04-Feb-20 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
publisher node has same for DEX_list 0 0 12-56-35.mkv 26000000 ?


[04-Feb-20 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
then that is the problem


[04-Feb-20 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
ok fixing, will take a bit


[04-Feb-20 05:13 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, the output i posted in the gist is taken from publisher node


[04-Feb-20 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the publishing caught up to the actual file and got confused


[04-Feb-20 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
pushed fix


[04-Feb-20 05:22 AM] SHossain#0007
updating


[04-Feb-20 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
make sure to clear all the old files and reproduce the way you got stuck


[04-Feb-20 05:29 AM] SHossain#0007
yep. cleared old one and started streaming

that is where it is stuck


[04-Feb-20 05:34 AM] SHossain#0007
but, in the beginning, it couldn't send full 1MB. all slices were same size `998235`


[04-Feb-20 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
all slices??


[04-Feb-20 05:34 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[04-Feb-20 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
is there a sleep 1 on the pub side?


[04-Feb-20 05:35 AM] SHossain#0007
when i started the streaming with fresh file after updating nodes


[04-Feb-20 05:35 AM] SHossain#0007
`is there a sleep 1 on the pub side?
`
yes


[04-Feb-20 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
change to sleep 3


[04-Feb-20 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
we want the streaming file to grow faster than we publish


[04-Feb-20 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a tricky edge case


[04-Feb-20 05:36 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. doing new stream
after i deleted the `13-27-44.mkv.19000000` files, the stream worked fully


[04-Feb-20 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the .problem is publishing 1MB when there isnt 1MB available to publish...


[04-Feb-20 05:37 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, instead of the sleep, just try new version


[04-Feb-20 05:37 AM] jl777c#5810
it should avoid publishing until there is a full MB


[04-Feb-20 05:38 AM] SHossain#0007
new stream with fresh files and `sleep 3` seems to be streaming full 1MB file

sleep 3 seems fixed it


[04-Feb-20 05:38 AM] jl777c#5810
its a workaround


[04-Feb-20 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if it gets to 200MB, without problems try the new version


[04-Feb-20 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if problems before 200MB, then try the new version


[04-Feb-20 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
without any sleep on the pub side


[04-Feb-20 05:39 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[04-Feb-20 05:39 AM] SHossain#0007
32MB so far


[04-Feb-20 05:40 AM] SHossain#0007
lot of REQUEST being sent. but, so far seems good with sleep 3


[04-Feb-20 05:41 AM] SHossain#0007
file growing on sub side. 49MB


[04-Feb-20 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
video is streaming on the playback side?


[04-Feb-20 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
smooth?


[04-Feb-20 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
i find it bogs down on publish side around 150MB, investigating that


[04-Feb-20 05:42 AM] SHossain#0007
yep. it stopped once. maybe due to the sub side didn't have enough data or reached EOF while waiting to pull new slice


[04-Feb-20 05:42 AM] SHossain#0007
but, no glitch on the video


[04-Feb-20 05:42 AM] SHossain#0007
63MB


[04-Feb-20 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
we are getting closer! it seems the slowdown at 150MB is the only mystery left, assuming the latest fix can remove the sleep


[04-Feb-20 05:44 AM] SHossain#0007
original file grown to 133MB and 80MB on the sub side.


[04-Feb-20 05:44 AM] SHossain#0007
i guess due to sleep 3, the publisher is sending slowly


[04-Feb-20 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
where is the pub sending from?


[04-Feb-20 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
80MB?


[04-Feb-20 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
or 133 MB


[04-Feb-20 05:45 AM] SHossain#0007
from 133MB


[04-Feb-20 05:45 AM] SHossain#0007
the 133MB file now grown to 166+MB


[04-Feb-20 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
how long of a sleep on the sub side?


[04-Feb-20 05:45 AM] SHossain#0007
no sleep on sub


[04-Feb-20 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
wait, so pub is broadcasting 166MB and sub is only at 80MB?


[04-Feb-20 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
what fname is the pub loop showing?


[04-Feb-20 05:46 AM] SHossain#0007
not exactly. 166MB is the growing file that is being streamed by publisher


[04-Feb-20 05:47 AM] SHossain#0007
since it sends a slice 1MB every 3 seconds, it publishes the file slowly

this is from publisher ^^


[04-Feb-20 05:48 AM] SHossain#0007
sub received 13-36-59.mkv.112000000

sub is in sync


[04-Feb-20 05:48 AM] SHossain#0007
118MB on sub side now


[04-Feb-20 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so there is no problem


[04-Feb-20 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
just slow publishing


[04-Feb-20 05:48 AM] SHossain#0007
no. there is no problem


[04-Feb-20 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
update to new version


[04-Feb-20 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
remove sleeps


[04-Feb-20 05:48 AM] SHossain#0007
`just slow publishing`
yes


[04-Feb-20 05:49 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. updating and removing sleep from publisher


[04-Feb-20 05:49 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure why it slows down at 150MB for me... maybe alien server will not slow down for much longer time


[04-Feb-20 05:50 AM] SHossain#0007
hopefully üòÇ


[04-Feb-20 05:52 AM] SHossain#0007
publisher using 8700k and subscriber using 1950x with 64GB RAM on each and SSD
all CPU threads are mostly idle as there is no mining or other daemon running


[04-Feb-20 05:53 AM] SHossain#0007
and one of the bystanstander node is alien


[04-Feb-20 05:55 AM] SHossain#0007
started stream


[04-Feb-20 05:56 AM] SHossain#0007
we have a small issue with no sleep

some of the slices are less than 1MB


[04-Feb-20 05:56 AM] SHossain#0007
hope that's not going to make any issue


[04-Feb-20 05:56 AM] jl777c#5810
does it update with a full sized one?


[04-Feb-20 05:57 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, when there is 1MB full slice available, publisher uploads full sized ones


[04-Feb-20 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is a 13-54-56.mkv.18000000 that is full 1MB?


[04-Feb-20 05:58 AM] jl777c#5810

hmmmm, they stopped at the same place

[04-Feb-20 06:02 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[04-Feb-20 06:04 AM] SHossain#0007
mrlynch is on his way to me. we will work the ESXi setup today and will try to finish that up. once the server is ready, i'll need to take it back to DC


[04-Feb-20 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
new version is there, it should check to make sure there is 1MB available to add to stream, if not will return the message

40MB streamed so far


[04-Feb-20 06:12 AM] SHossain#0007
no sleep on any side


[04-Feb-20 06:12 AM] SHossain#0007
playback is smooth


[04-Feb-20 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
let me know when the publish side starts slowing down


[04-Feb-20 06:13 AM] SHossain#0007
sure


[04-Feb-20 06:14 AM] SHossain#0007
so far this version seems much better than before with the checks and/or printouts. no slowdown yet and 80MB streamed on sub node


[04-Feb-20 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
it helps to have the exact check to avoid the cause of the bug


[04-Feb-20 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
this means the publishing will lag behind the file by 1MB, but that seems not a big problem


[04-Feb-20 06:15 AM] SHossain#0007
103MB


[04-Feb-20 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
almost isolated the slowdown


[04-Feb-20 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
you should start seeing each slice taking longer and longer


[04-Feb-20 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
unless the bug is just on my node


[04-Feb-20 06:16 AM] SHossain#0007
no slowdown yet


[04-Feb-20 06:18 AM] SHossain#0007
148MB


[04-Feb-20 06:18 AM] SHossain#0007
it started slowing down a bit


[04-Feb-20 06:18 AM] SHossain#0007
still working. but, publisher side is bit slow


[04-Feb-20 06:22 AM] SHossain#0007
184MB


[04-Feb-20 06:22 AM] SHossain#0007
the file that is growing in size on publisher node is 254MB while published 191MB till now


[04-Feb-20 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, this is the 150MB slowdown i see on publisher side


[04-Feb-20 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
eventually the streamsub side will use up the buffer and playback will stall


[04-Feb-20 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
this will take a while to fix as i have no idea what is causing the slowdown. will post when it is fixed.


[04-Feb-20 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
actually, might have just fixed it. verifying


[04-Feb-20 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain confirmed fixed! problem was too many HDD access, so a system with very fast nvme wouldnt slow down much, but eventually would. pushed fix. going at full speed at 150MB


[04-Feb-20 06:36 AM] SHossain#0007
the publisher node is using M.2 NVMe


[04-Feb-20 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
"streaming" a 4.8GB file, which doesnt fit into the RAM, this will take a while, but all the smaller streaming should work smoothly now


[04-Feb-20 06:37 AM] SHossain#0007
updating


[04-Feb-20 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
a very slight slowdown at 300MB, started at 65 tx/sec, now down to 60


[04-Feb-20 06:42 AM] jl777c#5810
400MB, down to 55/sec


[04-Feb-20 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
so there still might be some slowdown, but it could just be my nodes running out of RAM


[04-Feb-20 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
so make sure to track the tx/sec on the bystander node to see if it holds steady


[04-Feb-20 06:47 AM] SHossain#0007
streaming file now


[04-Feb-20 06:52 AM] SHossain#0007
139MB so far


[04-Feb-20 06:59 AM] SHossain#0007
270MB


[04-Feb-20 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
900MB, down to 45/sec


[04-Feb-20 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
so a very gradual slowdown. what is your tx/sec?


[04-Feb-20 07:01 AM] jl777c#5810
plz post every 100MB or so


[04-Feb-20 07:03 AM] SHossain#0007
stopped at 317MB


[04-Feb-20 07:03 AM] SHossain#0007
it was 34/sec


[04-Feb-20 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
non 1MB slice?


[04-Feb-20 07:04 AM] SHossain#0007
1MB slice


[04-Feb-20 07:04 AM] SHossain#0007
actually it's still streaming


[04-Feb-20 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
so just a temporary issue at 317MB?


[04-Feb-20 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i am past 1GB!


[04-Feb-20 07:05 AM] SHossain#0007
my main file still at 388MB and growing


[04-Feb-20 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
publishing side is stuck?


[04-Feb-20 07:05 AM] SHossain#0007
i'm basically emulating normal 720p stream


[04-Feb-20 07:06 AM] SHossain#0007
publishing side still working, just slightly slower


[04-Feb-20 07:06 AM] SHossain#0007
while the main file is growing over 400MB, we streamed only 330MB


[04-Feb-20 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
streamsub side is stopped?


[04-Feb-20 07:06 AM] SHossain#0007
nope


[04-Feb-20 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
so publisher is just slowing down, what is tx/sec?


[04-Feb-20 07:07 AM] SHossain#0007
video playback stopped once for reaching EOF

will it continue playing?

yes, if i resume, it continue the video


[04-Feb-20 07:08 AM] SHossain#0007
for me it was always 34/sec


[04-Feb-20 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
are you at a steady 34/sec?

yes


[04-Feb-20 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
at that rate, probably the publishing cant keep up with the real stream


[04-Feb-20 07:10 AM] SHossain#0007
sorry, my bad. the publishing side is good. the subscriber side is now slow


[04-Feb-20 07:10 AM] jl777c#5810
is there a sleep in the sub side?

sub node is stuck on 118?

that's the last file i found in my subscriber's src directory


[04-Feb-20 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
what if you run the DEX_streamsub once, manually


[04-Feb-20 07:40 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. found the last piece on the sub node. it was 335000000


[04-Feb-20 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
is it 1MB?


[04-Feb-20 07:40 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[04-Feb-20 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
run DEX_streamsub manually once


[04-Feb-20 07:41 AM] jl777c#5810
what does it do?


[04-Feb-20 07:42 AM] SHossain#0007
i've deleted the old file on sub node and did manual DEX_streamsub. but, that got only 1 slice


[04-Feb-20 07:42 AM] SHossain#0007
337000000


[04-Feb-20 07:42 AM] SHossain#0007
not the full file


[04-Feb-20 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
each call to streamsub will get one slice


[04-Feb-20 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
run it again


[04-Feb-20 07:43 AM] SHossain#0007
aha...didn't realise that


[04-Feb-20 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
338?


[04-Feb-20 07:43 AM] SHossain#0007
yep, 338


[04-Feb-20 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it only streams as you have it in an infinite loop


[04-Feb-20 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
run the loop


[04-Feb-20 07:43 AM] SHossain#0007
now, its increasing 1MB each second


[04-Feb-20 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it was a temporary stuck condition


[04-Feb-20 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
likely caused by some long lag for one of the packets


[04-Feb-20 07:44 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, that could be the reason


[04-Feb-20 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
that is what couldnt find id means


[04-Feb-20 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe adding a one second sleep to the subscribe loop makes sense


[04-Feb-20 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be you were calling it so fast, it starved resources from the syncing


[04-Feb-20 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so lets do a 1 second sleep in the receive side and no sleep on the pub side


[04-Feb-20 07:45 AM] SHossain#0007
got 512.9MB file total on sub node. at the end getting wrong size


[04-Feb-20 07:45 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. starting fresh stream


[04-Feb-20 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
i am past the one hour purgetime and almost 2GB, still 35/sec


[04-Feb-20 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a sustained streaming at 2megabits/sec for over an hour


[04-Feb-20 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
oops, found a bug on the receive side at 1GB, seems something is still limiting to 1GB


[04-Feb-20 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
testing fix


[04-Feb-20 07:49 AM] SHossain#0007
i have an Ubuntu 18.04 ISO file which is 2.1GB. can try streaming that üòÑ


[04-Feb-20 07:49 AM] SHossain#0007
only thing is, it wouldn't be a stream. just normal file transfer


[04-Feb-20 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
no need to test that, i have the 4.8GB file for a normal file transfer


[04-Feb-20 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
the hardest case is a video stream that grows to multi-GB


[04-Feb-20 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
update to the latest


[04-Feb-20 07:50 AM] SHossain#0007

[04-Feb-20 08:13 AM] SHossain#0007
34/sec is kinda fixed for me


[04-Feb-20 08:21 AM] SHossain#0007
397MB


[04-Feb-20 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly much better than the other day so far!


[04-Feb-20 08:21 AM] SHossain#0007
yep


[04-Feb-20 08:21 AM] SHossain#0007
video playback even didn't stop for a sec


[04-Feb-20 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
we might get to the former 1GB limit, but now there is no limit at all


[04-Feb-20 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
what size playback buffer?


[04-Feb-20 08:22 AM] SHossain#0007
playback buffer i guess is 2 minute


[04-Feb-20 08:22 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, 2 min set in VLC


[04-Feb-20 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if you have a chance after this test and assuming it goes well, you can try with 10 second buffer


[04-Feb-20 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe that will stop occasionally, depends on network lag


[04-Feb-20 08:24 AM] SHossain#0007
on the next test i can put 10 sec buffer


[04-Feb-20 08:25 AM] TonyL#3577
just setup my first stream

MCM London Comic Con 2017 [4K UHD]
A short video of Comic Con 2017 in London. Recorded with Samsung NX1 + Samsung 16-50mm f/2-2.8 S Lens on the last day of the event.

Tried to record flat color in camera with Gamma DR settings and pulled the shadows down mostly as for post processing in Premiere Pro.

517MB so far


[04-Feb-20 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
so its not a real video stream?


[04-Feb-20 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the next case to test would be having 2 streams at once, basically a video phone call


[04-Feb-20 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
my test got past 1GB


[04-Feb-20 08:29 AM] TonyL#3577
For 10 nodes test should 1 broadcast and 9 watch?


[04-Feb-20 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[04-Feb-20 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
and dont broadcast from the fully connected node


[04-Feb-20 08:31 AM] SHossain#0007
i've downloaded that video and put in a loop through OBS studio which just records in my drive


[04-Feb-20 08:31 AM] SHossain#0007
instead of using my webcam


[04-Feb-20 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, so it is creating the stream at the realtime video rate


[04-Feb-20 08:31 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[04-Feb-20 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
that seems like basically the same as if webcam was creating it


[04-Feb-20 08:32 AM] SHossain#0007
yep, exactly


[04-Feb-20 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
is your network still single connected nodes to a hub?


[04-Feb-20 08:32 AM] SHossain#0007
i have 4 nodes on this network. each node has 2 connections


[04-Feb-20 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
(3.1093 3.0091 3.0009) lag indicates that it is taking a few hops to broadcast


[04-Feb-20 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, 4 nodes each with 2 peers is good


[04-Feb-20 08:33 AM] SHossain#0007
645MB


[04-Feb-20 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
probably playback buffer of 30 seconds to be safe when doing 2 nodes publishing to each other


[04-Feb-20 08:33 AM] SHossain#0007
it's almost same as the growing stream file on publisher node


[04-Feb-20 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i am seeing a couple seconds lag from publisher to streamsub


[04-Feb-20 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
when things are working smoothly, it is quite stable


[04-Feb-20 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
just occasional "couldnt find id" errors on the streamsub side


[04-Feb-20 08:36 AM] SHossain#0007
basically in OBS Studio, you can select different source as input (webcam, external player, VLC video, different audio channel)


[04-Feb-20 08:36 AM] TonyL#3577
`For 10 nodes test should 1 broadcast and 9 watch?` is it fine if on these 9 nodes only one will have a VNC GUI to check picture in video player?


[04-Feb-20 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
that is due to lag and asking for the latest slice that isnt there yet


[04-Feb-20 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL yes, all slices are sha256 hashed, so as long as the streamsub nodes are keeping up with the publishing side, it is all good

[04-Feb-20 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
i think about 10 256kilobits per second video streams can be done at the same time, before the network saturates, but first we need to make sure a single broadcast works stable

10 half megabyte streams is 5MB/sec, just might fit into the network, but the nodes generating the video better have extra cores


[04-Feb-20 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, if the network saturates, streaming cant work smoothly

in general there is a lot of info in this file: 1080p video, 3 audio tracks and various subtitles


[04-Feb-20 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
for me, things seem to be working pretty smoothly in the "nice" scenario, ie. starting fresh without any old files, not starting a node mid-stream

my nodes starting to purge, up to 1.9GB, still at 35/sec, just couple seconds delay between publish and subscribe


[04-Feb-20 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain is memory usage stable for you? (once it starts purging)


[04-Feb-20 09:13 AM] SHossain#0007
1311MB on publisher node


[04-Feb-20 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the memory doesnt seem to get released immediately, but if there was a significant memleak, it should keep going up as the GB flow through


[04-Feb-20 09:13 AM] SHossain#0007
1307MB on sub node

[04-Feb-20 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it is some sort of signed 32 bit int error. investigating

just playing with Docker, Rancher and swarming nodes. we might need a DHCP server of our own which will provide automatic IP to the nodes we launch with DEXP2P or any other chain.

2M difference in filesize after 9 minutes


[04-Feb-20 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
seems due to lag, surprised it is working as well as it is


[04-Feb-20 10:46 AM] TonyL#3577
yep, before with lag we got tons of `err` and `pend`


[04-Feb-20 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
must be due to the protocol optimizations


[04-Feb-20 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
if you check the bandwidth used, it should be pretty close to the data being transferred


[04-Feb-20 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
at least it should be


[04-Feb-20 10:46 AM] TonyL#3577
would be great if it's possible to connect nodes some reliable way


[04-Feb-20 10:47 AM] TonyL#3577
also is it hard to make zcash-parms not-necessary in dexp2p mode?


[04-Feb-20 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
its possible, but the next thing i was going to add was integrate payments, which would require the zparams


[04-Feb-20 10:48 AM] TonyL#3577
ah, I see


[04-Feb-20 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
actually, i might detour and add DEX_bitmessage (private messaging where the destination node cannot be determined, even with ip level analysis)


[04-Feb-20 10:49 AM] jl777c#5810
basically encrypt the payload to a specific destination and then broadcast that to the entire network from the publicly known keypair. only the destination node would be able to decrypt it, all nodes would get it


[04-Feb-20 10:50 AM] TonyL#3577
oh we can make messenger with it


[04-Feb-20 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it should just be a few days work, while payments integration is open ended


[04-Feb-20 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
a reasonably secure messenger, yes. and it is all open source, so no worries about backdoors or centralized servers snooping


[04-Feb-20 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the only leak is that with a highly connected set of nodes, it can be determined what ip address is sending the original message, but the contents and destination unknown


[04-Feb-20 10:51 AM] TonyL#3577
sounds like it's somewhere close to decentralized internet creation


[04-Feb-20 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess i can even fix that leak, but the overhead would be quite high... all nodes would need to DEX_bitmessage at the same time


[04-Feb-20 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess for a privacy oriented network,  it would be worth doing. i probably should add the option to do this


[04-Feb-20 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so it might take the rest of the week to get very good private messaging


[04-Feb-20 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
@mrlynch might be of interest to integrate such messaging into PIRATE

connections amount between nodes - it starting to interconnect more and more with more time. Maybe I need to ban in advance on network creation all nodes not specified as `addnode` params ü§î


[04-Feb-20 11:52 AM] TonyL#3577
but it's should be closer to a "normal" network. 1st server don't have peers on start, 2,3,4 connecting to node 1, 5-10 connecting to 3 random nodes (by "connecting" I mean IP in addnode param on startup)


[04-Feb-20 11:52 AM] TonyL#3577
code before was really bad - I've left stub there and nodes 2-10 just connected to 1st one

but not so much, and sync is ~100% still


[04-Feb-20 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
ideal traffic pattern is if each node has about the same R.nnn and S.nnn


[04-Feb-20 11:55 AM] TonyL#3577
what `S.nnn` means?

[04-Feb-20 11:56 AM] TonyL#3577
looks like some nodes got very low amount of `S.nnn`


[04-Feb-20 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
received packets vs sent packets

[04-Feb-20 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
those are the nodes that are not routing anything, just the leaf node in the propagation


[04-Feb-20 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you are only streaming from one node, this is normal

{Reactions}
‚úÖ 

[04-Feb-20 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
if all 10 nodes are streaming and each source has a pattern like the above, it should average out a lot more


[04-Feb-20 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
before a single node had 95%+ of S.nnnn


[04-Feb-20 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
now half the nodes are sharing that burden


[04-Feb-20 11:58 AM] TonyL#3577
hmm, i may try to connect from my home PC to this network to watch my little pony in GUI mode


[04-Feb-20 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
dup.nnn and pend.nnn and err.nnn are all very low, that is good. it seems network is not saturated now and you should get 100% sync, especially for VIP packets


[04-Feb-20 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess its been a while since we did these tests, i guess along the way to get streaming working, i fixed a lot of things that helps with the performance


[04-Feb-20 12:01 PM] TonyL#3577
yep, looks very solid - nothing crashed, was able to get pic and 0 losses in 10 nodes network


[04-Feb-20 12:03 PM] TonyL#3577
I can spin 100 nodes and broadcast if needed


[04-Feb-20 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
with good connectivity?


[04-Feb-20 12:03 PM] TonyL#3577
yeah, connectivity should be somewhat similar to above


[04-Feb-20 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, good test. see if with one stream, it has similar stats


[04-Feb-20 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
bad script code is fixed üòÖ


[04-Feb-20 12:04 PM] TonyL#3577
okie, will spin it now


[04-Feb-20 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
then start adding more streams until it starts lagging too much

3.7GB streamed, mem usage still at 1.65GB, so it is pretty conclusive that the data packets are being freed

ok, so new 100 nodes network looks like almost what we wanted to make (just first nodes got a little bit more connections that needed)
lets try to broadcast

broadcasting just finished (took almost one hour to broadcast)
episode size is `959M`, nodes got around 100Mb only: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/QrV7SWmWcw/ 
nodes with 10-15 connections got only like a 12Mb pieces


[04-Feb-20 02:24 PM] TonyL#3577
problem is that I'm getting stdout (responses on DEX_streamsub ) from all 100 nodes in a single stream. But can't see error messages, visually it's like a stuck and same outputs repeats with such https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/2Jbff5BmwS/ prints


[04-Feb-20 02:27 PM] TonyL#3577
shutting down servers to not burn rubles, tomorrow can repeat with a smaller file and will separate output of responses on `DEX_streamsub ` to different files
lag for some nodes looks pretty low: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/YZJY8hNTY5/


[04-Feb-20 03:18 PM] SHossain#0007
me and @mrlynch tested few things with Rancher and Docker. he just left now and got the server with him to test and setup further. hopefully we will have new updates tomorrow on orchestrating and spinning up nodes quickly on demand. launching N nodes are kind of easy once you have the basic setup done right.

its an arbitrary cost reduction to force people to use segwit, on the blockchain it still exists, on the network it still needs to be broadcast and that is what they claimed was unsafe if it was more than 1MB. apparently its only unsafe if it isnt segwit bytes. of course all that is nonsense, a byte is a byte is a byte to the internet and if you claim propagating more than 1MB is dangerous, then allowing 4MB that only counts as 1MB is a blatant attempt at ...

[04-Feb-20 10:49 PM] jl777c#5810
also nothing prevents internally pruning the signatures from normal tx and not putting it in the utxo set. it is just a misdirection


[04-Feb-20 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
in fact, a node can totally parse out every tx and store it in whatever most efficient fashion it wants to internally. signatures are actually one of the most resource hungry things on the blockchain as they need to be validated. so you can fill the signature space with thousands of signatures at 25% the cost and increase the CPU load significantly, by spending 75% less


[04-Feb-20 11:02 PM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL are you able to preserve the nodes across shutdowns? i have seen that over time, a network improves connectivity and that initially bootstrapping it, usually has bad performance. but some time later it is doing much better. sort of what you saw above


[04-Feb-20 11:02 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you have to start over from scratch each time, it will always be in the inefficient stage


[04-Feb-20 11:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the data not getting to all the nodes is very disturbing... it is not that many tx/sec so it should all have been routed to all nodes. please do some  tests on connectivity to make sure packets get from each node to each other node

[04-Feb-20 11:31 PM] jl777c#5810
reducing utxo set is total nonsense


[04-Feb-20 11:31 PM] jl777c#5810
the utxo set is an implementation specific data structure


[04-Feb-20 11:33 PM] jl777c#5810
different implementations store utxo info in different ways, and like i said above you can have an implementation that strips out the signatures, or stores it efficiently with a txindex. this is what iguana did. there is nothing magical about segwit signature data, if you can segregate it onchain, clearly you can segregate it internally in your data structures

ask how validating a signature is less cost to the network than opreturn data. and also why couldnt there be an implementation that just doesnt store signatures after it is validated

[04-Feb-20 11:36 PM] jl777c#5810
and where exactly in the utxo set are the signatures needed?


[04-Feb-20 11:38 PM] jl777c#5810
if you have a data structure locally that only adds in transactions with validated signatures, then after it is in there, you dont need to store the signature data in it, just have a reference to where it is in the blockchain (that can be done with a 64bit index)


[04-Feb-20 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
he is confusing implementation specific costs with overall network costs. you can certainly go out of your way to make some implementation that has whatever arbitrary cost metrics you want to match, but that is irrelevant. what is relevant is what costs an efficient implementation would have.


[04-Feb-20 11:43 PM] jl777c#5810
anyway, as i explained above signature data is one of the most expensive data a blockchain has, pricing it at a 75% discount only serves the purpose of claiming 1MB size (in 75% adjusted terms), while actually having a 4MB blocksize


[04-Feb-20 11:43 PM] jl777c#5810
it would have been a million times simpler to just change the 1MB blocksize limit to 4MB

[05-Feb-20 02:58 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly the signatures need to be verified (this is why signatures impose more load than opreturn data), my point is that after it is verified locally, this validation state can be remembered. once it is validated, it wont become invalid (until it is spent or reorged). so wait enough blocks to not have to worry about reorgs and make sure to remember when a utxo gets spent. the signatures dont need to be validated again to verify that the utxo is still valid.


[05-Feb-20 02:58 AM] jl777c#5810
from above he admits ```(this is the same for non-segwit and segwit transactions)```


[05-Feb-20 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
when a previously validated utxo is being spent, then of course the signatures needs to be verified, but just do this and then purge the scriptSig after 10 blocks have passed. signature pruning can be done with pre-segwit bitcoin. if you cannot explain why pre-segwit bitcoin cannot prune signatures with the same security tradeoff as segwit, you need to admit signature pruning has nothing specific to do with segwit.


[05-Feb-20 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr segwit has nothing to do with scaling, has nothing to do with pruning signatures, yet their claim is that segwit is what enables this. very disingenuous

what prevents making a copy of the blockchain for bootstrapping that doesnt have signatures in it? if you are going to reduce the security guarantees for segwit, you need to compare it to similarly reduced security guarantees for non-segwit

@gcharang @TonyL @Sir Seven I added DEX_anonsend rpc call. it doesnt have many parameters:
DEX_anonsend "message" priority destpub33

what this does is create an encrypted message to the destpub and then encrypt it again using the known privkey. this makes it so that it looks the same regardless who sent it, and only the node with destpub's privkey can decrypt it. on that node there will be "anonmsg" and "anonsender" fields on the normal JSON for a packet. for now anonsender will always be the publicly known pubkey, but i will add another layer of encryption to allow authentication of who is sending it.

note that a high resource attacker will be able to tell who broadcast the initial packet, so it is possible that the ip address of the sender can be known but since all nodes get the packet, nobody would know who the intended receiver is. not perfect privacy, but pretty decent privacy and the advantage is the speed.

@gcharang @TonyL @Sir Seven updated so now the anonsender pubkey is determined properly by the destination node, but never appears in plaintext. what this means is that the only thing that can be deduced even by monitoring all ip traffic, is which ip address sent out an anonmsg, but not its pubkey, nor the destination pubkey, and certainly not the contents


[05-Feb-20 06:11 AM] jl777c#5810
to shield the sender from being identified, i would need to add automatically generated cover traffic and it would significantly reduce throughput. as long as we dont claim perfect privacy, i think this achieves a fairly unique level of speed/privacy tradeoff.

[05-Feb-20 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, its about 3 megabytes per second, but you are doing only 35 packets per second, which is 350k, so there is a factor of 2x to 3x overhead...


[05-Feb-20 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
then again with such variance, the exact moment you show the numbers for dramatically change things, average bandwidth needs to be usd


[05-Feb-20 06:49 AM] cipi#4502
`sudo iftop -nNP -f "port 14868"` will show the traffic for DEXP2P


[05-Feb-20 06:51 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks @cipi . i'm using DEXP2P2. let me check the port for that


[05-Feb-20 06:53 AM] cipi#4502
cool.... the values in the bottom right corner are the ones you are looking for...


[05-Feb-20 06:53 AM] SHossain#0007

@SHossain install ntop package in pfsense


[05-Feb-20 07:04 AM] mrlynch#5735
it will store traffic data and you can view historical graphs going back to 1y (or however much you set it to)


[05-Feb-20 07:04 AM] SHossain#0007
ah...thanks

lmk if you need help setting it up


[05-Feb-20 07:05 AM] SHossain#0007
since i moved away from OPNSense and installed pfSense, i didn't look into it much


[05-Feb-20 07:08 AM] SHossain#0007
its `ntopng` now


[05-Feb-20 07:08 AM] SHossain#0007
package name changed from `ntop` for pfsense


[05-Feb-20 07:10 AM] mrlynch#5735
yes, that's the one


[05-Feb-20 07:11 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. thanks. now i have better dashboard for my local bandwidth usage monitoring


[05-Feb-20 07:14 AM] mrlynch#5735
had to reset esxi host, apparently esxi firewall came back after reboot


[05-Feb-20 07:15 AM] SHossain#0007

[05-Feb-20 07:15 AM] mrlynch#5735
yes


[05-Feb-20 07:15 AM] SHossain#0007
it's fine


[05-Feb-20 07:15 AM] mrlynch#5735
bit of a nuisance as you can't disable from console


[05-Feb-20 07:15 AM] SHossain#0007
there was no important data on that server. it was a fresh installation


[05-Feb-20 07:15 AM] mrlynch#5735
lost the vm's from yesterday üò¶


[05-Feb-20 07:16 AM] SHossain#0007
hmmm...i thought those VMs stays inside the VFS, like the SSDs


[05-Feb-20 07:16 AM] mrlynch#5735
but that's fine, i've got a playbook to deploy XX vm's at once


[05-Feb-20 07:16 AM] SHossain#0007
ESXi is only on the USB drive


[05-Feb-20 07:16 AM] mrlynch#5735
i might let rancher go with this, as we could deploy and control multiple vm's through playbooks running in native ubuntu


[05-Feb-20 07:16 AM] mrlynch#5735
rather than introducing docker in the scheme as well

@mrlynch which ESXi version did you install?


[05-Feb-20 07:33 AM] SHossain#0007
did you experience any NIC driver issue?


[05-Feb-20 07:38 AM] mrlynch#5735
i didn't reinstall esxi, just reset config to defaults


[05-Feb-20 07:39 AM] SHossain#0007
ah...ok


[05-Feb-20 07:44 AM] SHossain#0007

[05-Feb-20 08:38 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. i'll stop now


[05-Feb-20 08:39 AM] SHossain#0007
RAM usage stayed the same


[05-Feb-20 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems the only bugs are with larger networks and it isnt clear to me that those are not just network issues


[05-Feb-20 08:49 AM] TonyL#3577
btw, @jl777c are you routing your traffic trough the internet or your testnet is local network?


[05-Feb-20 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
over the internet


[05-Feb-20 08:51 AM] TonyL#3577
just thought to make local network because of white IPs limitation - but then realized maybe it'll be unfair test


[05-Feb-20 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
we want to use the fixed ip over internet, get it as close to a normal network


[05-Feb-20 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
no idea how your network can have decent ping times, but lose 80% of a streamed file


[05-Feb-20 08:53 AM] TonyL#3577
will try to move slowly step by step now to understand what's going on


[05-Feb-20 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, streaming uses all the lower level aspects, so need to start with simplest and work up to streaming


[05-Feb-20 09:43 AM] TonyL#3577
I think I found the reason: I've tried this time very simple network with 5 nodes only with same 1Gb mlp episode broadcasting

but locators and pieces files changing very fast on receiving servers - it's just not concatenating to the main file


[05-Feb-20 09:45 AM] TonyL#3577
and I can see that timestamp on main file change changing permanently but size remains const


[05-Feb-20 09:45 AM] TonyL#3577
is it like that by design?


[05-Feb-20 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
each new slice it should be updating the mainfile


[05-Feb-20 09:48 AM] TonyL#3577
ok, on my side it's not


[05-Feb-20 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810

great, will update now and try with 2 nodes first


[05-Feb-20 09:57 AM] TonyL#3577
my scripts atm

To stream:
```#!/bin/bash

while true; do
  ./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXTEST -conf=/root/node_0/DEXTEST.conf -datadir=/root/node_0 DEX_stream pony_8x01.mkv 0
done```

to watch:
```#!/bin/bash

while true; do
  ./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXSTATS -conf=/root/node_0/DEXTEST.conf -rpcport=7000 -datadir=/root/node_0 DEX_streamsub pony_8x01.mkv 0 $1
done```


[05-Feb-20 09:57 AM] TonyL#3577
are some sleeps and etc needed?


[05-Feb-20 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
what its doing is determining what DEX_subscribe call to make, then seeing if it can concatenate any


[05-Feb-20 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it should be ok without any sleep, but adding a sleep 1 second is not a bad idea


[05-Feb-20 09:58 AM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain is file propagating fully between all nodes in your tests?


[05-Feb-20 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
it could be the missing sleep 1 second, maybe a race condition between the concatenate and file delete


[05-Feb-20 10:04 AM] TonyL#3577
it might be some tricky thing like a my ssh client is too fast


[05-Feb-20 10:05 AM] TonyL#3577
because I'm using not real terminal for ssh session but some parallel sessions lib


[05-Feb-20 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the latest version wont delete the slices, so it would eliminate the race condition


[05-Feb-20 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
so if it works, i know how to fix this. if not, then need more info, like what prints are appearing


[05-Feb-20 10:06 AM] TonyL#3577
sure, will update you with fresh results shortly


[05-Feb-20 10:14 AM] TonyL#3577
just found a possible reason in my test infra as well  - on tests restart watchers `DEX_streamsub` scripts were still in background


[05-Feb-20 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, having two of them active at once is unknown behavior


[05-Feb-20 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
race conditions definitely possible in that case


[05-Feb-20 10:15 AM] TonyL#3577
but old one should have not correct pubkey


[05-Feb-20 10:15 AM] TonyL#3577
because streaming node restarting each time with non-det pubkey


[05-Feb-20 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
in that case, shouldnt have any effect


[05-Feb-20 10:15 AM] TonyL#3577
so not 100% sure if it a clue, but anyway removed


[05-Feb-20 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810

glad it wasnt networking, but just about the file. pushed a new version that waits for one slice before deleting the slice, this should avoid the race condition, even without a sleep 1

[05-Feb-20 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
that is normal, node doesnt have all parts for the slice yet


[05-Feb-20 10:45 AM] TonyL#3577
however I can't see stdout prints right now (because started daemons by script)


[05-Feb-20 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
even with 100 fragments, it can have gaps so until the checkhash matches it will keep retrying


[05-Feb-20 10:46 AM] TonyL#3577
`glad it wasnt networking, but just about the file. pushed a new version that waits for one slice before deleting the slice, this should avoid the race condition, even without a sleep 1` - yeah maybe it's even worth to try with 50 or 100 nodes now


[05-Feb-20 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
until 20 nodes works, no point to do 50


[05-Feb-20 10:47 AM] TonyL#3577
because file size growth is the only problem I've faced in yesteday's test


[05-Feb-20 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
plz verify the latest version still works with file growth

having thousands of slice files is bad enough on the publishing node, best to clean it up on the streamsub nodes


[05-Feb-20 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
on such a small network,there shouldnt be any lag at all. the fact it is so slow is disturbing


[05-Feb-20 10:53 AM] TonyL#3577
watchers and streamer locating in same DC and loading on server not so high


[05-Feb-20 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
there shouldnt be any lag

[05-Feb-20 10:56 AM] TonyL#3577
how lag is calculating: if watchers started to watch later than stream started is it counting as a lag?


[05-Feb-20 10:57 AM] TonyL#3577
this time I've started to watch manually from CLI to separate prints, maybe it made the difference


[05-Feb-20 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, yes, it is based on localtime vs timestamp of message


[05-Feb-20 10:58 AM] TonyL#3577
that explains things


[05-Feb-20 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
all the nodes should startup and run for a minute or so before starting any broadcasts


[05-Feb-20 11:05 AM] TonyL#3577
looks like file is growing on latest


[05-Feb-20 11:06 AM] TonyL#3577
will monitor a little bit more to be sure


[05-Feb-20 11:07 AM] TonyL#3577

even one missing packet in a slice will prevent it from completing

when .245 gets all packets, it should catch up

clearly it had some sort of connection issue at first, but now network is alive longer, it seems it is better


[05-Feb-20 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if you do another test with these nodes without restarting, it should do better

yeah, right after this file is synced (or not), I'll broadcast another episode in the same network


[05-Feb-20 11:26 AM] jl777c#5810

interesting, so some stable network bootstrap we need


[05-Feb-20 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
dup for node.245 is probably due to other nodes seeing it doesnt have a packet, it making a request, then not getting a packet for a while ,making another request, ... so some sort of problem with that node. however: A.32186 dup.5746

800 dups in 26k blocks isnt great, it isnt horrible

the 4/1 thing bothers me a lot, the rhetoric about small blocksize while increasing size is upsetting


[05-Feb-20 11:44 AM] Gig#0273
*The recurring trope in Bitcoin is that the block stays small because it can‚Äôt scale, and that the SegWit transactions are smaller. Actually its the opposite. SegWit transactions are larger in bits than Legacy, and the blocks get bigger only when you send them!*


[05-Feb-20 11:45 AM] Gig#0273
from my article


[05-Feb-20 11:46 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why that video explains why these obviously smart guys are doing their best to push a nonsense technical argument. they spent a full 3 years making no advance in bitcoin (at best segwit is a sideways movement and really backwards due to the extra complexity), so of course they need to position it as the best thing ever


[05-Feb-20 11:46 AM] Gig#0273
my new conclusion is that bitcoin split and split both satoshi's vision with it, i.e. Big blocks AND HFT, no either/or but both

Though not a technical criticism but if bitcoin is supposed to be censorship free why are they forcing LN adoption when bill drafts all over the world are hinting at regulating these gateways severely.


[05-Feb-20 11:51 AM] jl777c#5810

[05-Feb-20 08:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the last time I met Andreas, and told him about Komodo's Atomic-Swaps tech advancements, he argued as per his so far readings at that time atomic-swaps tech lacked malleability problem, which he presumed exists in Komodo's atomic-swaps solution.
I did sent him the bitcointalk links at that time and asked the next NZ ETH conference 2016 days if he got a chance to read those, to which he said being busy with other things among writing his books etc.
I never heard back on that from him.
I can only guess he makes up his mind on something presuming on the subject and just only go with the research on the subject which makes sense to him, without hardly going back to the past subjects which probably could have advanced further and actually solved those issues he presumed are unsolved or unsolvable.
@Gig


[05-Feb-20 08:11 PM] Alright#0419
each step of the process requires confirmations(and dpow if chain supports it), meaning malleability does not affect it


[05-Feb-20 08:11 PM] Alright#0419
once it's in a block, barring reorgs, it's not malleable


[05-Feb-20 08:12 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
true, but he won't get it if he won't read the sent links and just already have made up his mind.

[06-Feb-20 03:56 AM] Gig#0273
it hadnt escaped me KMD must have this tx malleability still since no segwit here


[06-Feb-20 03:56 AM] Gig#0273
from the little i know about tx malleability its a little strange


[06-Feb-20 03:56 AM] Gig#0273
e.g.


[06-Feb-20 03:57 AM] Gig#0273
1. it doesnt stop a recipient getting getting their BTC iirc


[06-Feb-20 03:58 AM] Gig#0273
2. more confusingly for me: i would think changing a hash (or txid) after messing with the data in a transaction would be a good thing


[06-Feb-20 03:58 AM] Gig#0273
since it shows the data has been tampered with


[06-Feb-20 03:59 AM] Gig#0273
clearly i must be missing something but have no idea what it is - can anybody help me understand?


[06-Feb-20 04:01 AM] jl777c#5810
malleability fix is INDEPENDENT from segwit


[06-Feb-20 04:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it was included with segwit, also zcash has a new signing that fixes the malleability, came with sapling update


[06-Feb-20 04:01 AM] jl777c#5810
but our atomic swaps are designed to work even if there is txid malleability by waiting for notarization


[06-Feb-20 04:02 AM] jl777c#5810
malleability affects atomic swap implementations that dont wait for confirmations


[06-Feb-20 04:06 AM] Gig#0273
you understand my confusion with how changing a hash after being tampered with is a bad thing, when in any other situation that would be a good thing? (e.g. MD5 checksums for downloads)


[06-Feb-20 04:06 AM] Gig#0273
> malleability fix is INDEPENDENT from segwit


[06-Feb-20 04:06 AM] Gig#0273
ok cuz a lot of spin was put on that


[06-Feb-20 04:07 AM] Gig#0273
e.g. segwit fixes the issue


[06-Feb-20 04:07 AM] Gig#0273
when clearly it can be fixed in numerous ways


[06-Feb-20 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
the usual nonsense, bundling a lot of things along with segwit and then claiming only segwit can fix those other things


[06-Feb-20 04:26 AM] jl777c#5810
very misleading


[06-Feb-20 04:26 AM] jl777c#5810
fixing malleability was something that needed to be done, it could have been done with a soft fork


[06-Feb-20 04:26 AM] jl777c#5810
and it was (along with the segwit abomination)


[06-Feb-20 04:27 AM] jl777c#5810
all the benefits segwit supposedly gave, could have been had with a change of a constant MAXBLOCKSIZE and the various real improvements, like malleabilty fix. optimize the implementation to not store the signatures any longer than needed and basically could have been essentially the same as the legacy bitcoin

works great tho

streamsub will overwrite the file with same name..


[06-Feb-20 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so dont streamsub on same node you do the stream from


[06-Feb-20 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
you could do a DEX_publish and DEX_subscribe as that puts it in a different filename

@jl777c `DEX_setpubkey` allows using a pubkey not owned by the node to calculate the DEX_pubkey.
is that intentional?

?


[07-Feb-20 02:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems it is not an authenticated packet


[07-Feb-20 02:52 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, the receiver is "pubkey": "012767b0e6d680cf65b1993ddb4ccbb7f1acd027a04ed93c0b06f97714284e214d"
I didn't check in a non receiver node. will try that


[07-Feb-20 02:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i think this is a useful mode as it can create packets that try to spoof things


[07-Feb-20 02:53 AM] jl777c#5810
we can disable it, but it wouldnt prevent someone from trying to spoof things


[07-Feb-20 06:07 AM] gcharang#6833
I tested with  a third node. it can't see the payload @jl777c 
maybe the node with wrong pubkey is defaulting to the actual keypair and encrypting things properly?


[07-Feb-20 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
you should be able to see what pubkey it is from DEX_stats


[07-Feb-20 06:14 AM] gcharang#6833
DEX_stats shows the DEX_pubkey set using the not-owned pubkey


[07-Feb-20 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
are you sure it isnt the session pubkey?


[07-Feb-20 06:19 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, sure 
I just double checked from the daemon's output
```
DEX_pubkey.(01e28518858a
```


[07-Feb-20 06:20 AM] SHossain#0007
it's always a random DEX pubkey set if you didn't specify any pubkey like 02 or 03 when you started the chain


[07-Feb-20 06:20 AM] gcharang#6833
I specified pubkey when I started the chain


[07-Feb-20 06:20 AM] SHossain#0007
hmmm...strange. never seen different DEX pubkey if normal pubkey is set


[07-Feb-20 06:21 AM] gcharang#6833
DEX_setpubkey can change DEX_pubkey with or without -pubkey set


[07-Feb-20 06:23 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, using setpubkey will change things


[07-Feb-20 06:26 AM] gcharang#6833
I'm using DEX_setpubkey and a pubkey not owned by the node
then sending a encrypted message
the recipient is able to decrypt it and others are not able to
 everything is behaving as usual but I am expecting otherwise


[07-Feb-20 06:27 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c maybe the third node is not showing the decrypted value just because it thinks it can't? it can see the pubkey set and tagA as inbox. maybe it doesn't try to decrypt it?


[07-Feb-20 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
you sent it to inbox, which will encrypt to the specified pubkey


[07-Feb-20 06:41 AM] jl777c#5810
send to a non-inbox tagA


[07-Feb-20 06:43 AM] jl777c#5810
if it can be decrypted it will be and that authenticates oit


[07-Feb-20 06:47 AM] gcharang#6833
the datablob says
```
"error": "wrong sender"
```
on all the nodes


[07-Feb-20 06:48 AM] gcharang#6833
and
```
senderpub 2fecc330ac599af200605079bd75fee8db33a9175e8af8c1c04d5a1b8f4fac13 != pubkey 2767b0e6d680cf65b1993ddb4ccbb7f1acd027a04ed93c0b06f97714284e214d
```
in the daemon output


[07-Feb-20 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, so it cant authenticate a fake pubkey


[07-Feb-20 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
this is as it should be


[07-Feb-20 06:51 AM] gcharang#6833

NTX token / or KMD assetchain?


[08-Feb-20 05:57 PM] Mylo#8306
I guess the transparency can be anywhere if it‚Äôs volunteers, there‚Äôd still be conversions to local currency.  I don‚Äôt think it would stymie the subtle corruption, I guess it would allow it to be brought to light just as gently in an acceptably digestible way for partnering sailing schools to see.  Maybe this is the grassroots way.  It is mildly dangerous to stoke the anger of the ways though, petty danger - accidental fires etc.

If the ‚Äúbitpanda‚Äù EUR stablecoin thing becomes a thing, I‚Äôm happy to work with.  I have Eu passport and if they have bank integration with those Estonian e-residency services could certainly be a transparent funding solution in the future.

What is needed for another currency? A willing partner with appropriate licensing in local jurisdiction?

H, James. As altsbit is hacked, all users have to withdraw all coins including KMDice but the chain isn't running. Ever since Chickenpool doesn't support KMDice, no miners mine the chain anymore. Could any devs mine the Kmdice chain, so that we could withdraw our kmdice?

When new cc-dice2 be ready later, I suppose Kmdice will be hardforked or get snapshot?

@jl777 @SHossain I have been thinking this upstream technology and it came to my thought that would it be possible to do such thing as: Lets say komodoplatform wants to sponsor stream by publishing price for stream (one for creator and one for viewers).

i will keep such usecases in mind as i work on the payments integration

Yes, it came to my mind that best way to promote is to do trough these streamers that create content. It would be great to see someday in AtomicDeXtop spot of the week section were you can grab a spotlight and do stream and get paid for content via sponsored payer. Also it would get users interested to watch it through same app and get rewarded for that. And what a promote would that be for technology that komodo does!

JL, so my Supernet are showing up on the https://supernet.explorer.dexstats.info/ chain, which wallet is the best to get them where they need to go for the 25 KMD?  i was using an old Agama wallet - not sure i trust it to send now but maybe it still works = my new Verus wallet shows my KMD but doesn't support the Supernet coin  - where do i send the supernet for the offer?  i will send a few test ones.

[09-Feb-20 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
just ping me when it is done, i wont magically know that it happened


[09-Feb-20 08:29 AM] viennavtc#9673
i just sent two - hoping they get there with old agama - let me know if you see them soon - i have a decent amount - which means we go way way back to the NXT days = it's been a fun trip no doubt


[09-Feb-20 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i see 2


[09-Feb-20 08:32 AM] viennavtc#9673

[09-Feb-20 08:32 AM] viennavtc#9673
keep an eye out for more - i guess i should just sent them all now


[09-Feb-20 08:34 AM] viennavtc#9673
send them all i meant, since you are ready for them


[09-Feb-20 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810

of course my next large one got choked up on something... still processing


[09-Feb-20 08:40 AM] viennavtc#9673
no wallet is saying synchronization in process.... so i will have to see what happens, strange it worked so quickly for the first two


[09-Feb-20 08:43 AM] viennavtc#9673
is there a better/newer wallet i can use to send them?  still choking on next transaction


[09-Feb-20 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
i only see one tx


[09-Feb-20 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to be in sync


[09-Feb-20 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
first tx worked as even old utxo was still valid


[09-Feb-20 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
now it is spent, you need to be in sync


[09-Feb-20 08:44 AM] viennavtc#9673

JL, now my old agama wallet will not sync for Supernet Lite mode.. i get an error saying 'Unable to get transaction history data (code: apiElecturm Transactions) - really don't understand how it allowed me to send 2 tokens and now is stuck - is there any other (more current) wallet that will allow me to activate the Supernet token in lite mode?


[09-Feb-20 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
try the new verus wallet


[09-Feb-20 11:51 AM] viennavtc#9673
it won't let me activate supernet in lite mode, only native and then there are no peers


[09-Feb-20 11:51 AM] viennavtc#9673
with verus


[09-Feb-20 11:56 AM] SHossain#0007

[09-Feb-20 12:25 PM] viennavtc#9673
and is there a max amount i can send?


[09-Feb-20 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
0.0001 less than what you have


[09-Feb-20 12:33 PM] viennavtc#9673

[09-Feb-20 01:46 PM] viennavtc#9673

[09-Feb-20 01:48 PM] viennavtc#9673
should i expect the KMD soon


[09-Feb-20 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
plz wait a bit, i just found out 2 minutes ago


[09-Feb-20 01:50 PM] viennavtc#9673

awesome, thanks


[09-Feb-20 02:12 PM] viennavtc#9673
btw what do you think they cost back then? I have no clue


[09-Feb-20 02:12 PM] SHossain#0007
maybe $5


[09-Feb-20 02:12 PM] SHossain#0007
or $7


[09-Feb-20 02:12 PM] viennavtc#9673
vs $.77 or so now?


[09-Feb-20 02:18 PM] viennavtc#9673
Oops, JL is paying out about $20 each for them


[09-Feb-20 02:51 PM] allbits#5898
They cost less than three dollars at almost all times in 2014


[09-Feb-20 02:53 PM] allbits#5898
@viennavtc did you switch to the supernet blockchain prior to dec 25 2017?  If so, you would have received a payout on your supernet holdings, received as kmd

[09-Feb-20 03:35 PM] allbits#5898
Yes you received the kmd payout on December 25th. I see it on the blockchain

[09-Feb-20 05:18 PM] SHossain#0007
this is what i got


[09-Feb-20 05:19 PM] SHossain#0007
we need to see what's happening and if James can increase number of blasts in a single command


[09-Feb-20 05:19 PM] mrlynch#5735
started another 3 min


[09-Feb-20 05:19 PM] mrlynch#5735
but they're definitely blasting


[09-Feb-20 05:20 PM] SHossain#0007
ideally, we would blast with about 20-30 nodes which should propagate to all nodes in realtime


[09-Feb-20 05:20 PM] SHossain#0007
119 & 112 per sec


[09-Feb-20 05:20 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'll leave them running over night maybe they get to 16 conn


[09-Feb-20 05:21 PM] SHossain#0007
115/sec


[09-Feb-20 05:21 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, let's keep the daemon running


[09-Feb-20 05:21 PM] SHossain#0007
we can do the streaming test when we wake up


[09-Feb-20 05:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes


[09-Feb-20 05:21 PM] mrlynch#5735
minion-30 got to 8 conns


[09-Feb-20 05:22 PM] SHossain#0007
cool


[09-Feb-20 05:22 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, the peer discovery might take some time


[09-Feb-20 05:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
they're slowly getting there


[09-Feb-20 05:22 PM] SHossain#0007
as long as they reach 16 minimum, we can expect some good result with that good connectivity


[09-Feb-20 05:22 PM] SHossain#0007
at least this network is not hub and spoke


[09-Feb-20 05:23 PM] SHossain#0007
my initial test about a month ago resulted in hub and spoke network and wasn't good for testing


[09-Feb-20 05:24 PM] SHossain#0007
well, the fault was the setup i had with custom data dir and unique p2p port in the same machine


[09-Feb-20 05:24 PM] SHossain#0007
with dedicated static ip, let's achieve better results üòÖ


[09-Feb-20 05:24 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes


[09-Feb-20 05:25 PM] SHossain#0007
also, it seems we only used about 30GB from setup to test till now on this server


[09-Feb-20 05:25 PM] SHossain#0007
so, not much bandwidth usage yet


[09-Feb-20 05:25 PM] mrlynch#5735
üò¨ we'll eat up a lot of b/w with video streaming


[09-Feb-20 05:26 PM] SHossain#0007
we can limit streaming to 100-200MB file


[09-Feb-20 05:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'll look into setting up some sort of monitoring for ram, cpu and b/w on a dashboard


[09-Feb-20 05:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
ideally we need a dashboard with all nodes showing those stats


[09-Feb-20 05:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
wouldn't limiting file size also limit the scale?


[09-Feb-20 05:27 PM] SHossain#0007
when the publisher publishes a file, it gets propagated throughout the network and each node saves it in their RAM


[09-Feb-20 05:27 PM] SHossain#0007
`wouldn't limiting file size also limit the scale?`
not necessarily


[09-Feb-20 05:27 PM] mrlynch#5735
what about blu-ray 2.5 hrs movies? :))


[09-Feb-20 05:28 PM] SHossain#0007
because, i tested over 4GB file, and it worked fine


[09-Feb-20 05:28 PM] SHossain#0007
2.5 hours movie on 720p might be only about 1.5GB max


[09-Feb-20 05:29 PM] mrlynch#5735
720p is so 2010 :))


[09-Feb-20 05:29 PM] SHossain#0007
since we know that we can stream larger files, that's not a big issue. the main test for streaming would be, one or 2 publisher broadcasting and about 10 nodes subscribed to those streams


[09-Feb-20 05:30 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, i personally like only 1080p and 2160p üòÑ


[09-Feb-20 05:30 PM] mrlynch#5735
you need bigger screens, but yes, we'll see tomorrow


[09-Feb-20 05:31 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, i guess for these testing we should use bigger monitors. but, we will use what we have for now üôÇ


[09-Feb-20 05:31 PM] SHossain#0007
subscriber can be more depending on our bandwidth. and if any other community member or  tester wants to join the testing, that would be nice too


[09-Feb-20 05:32 PM] SHossain#0007
and, hopefully @TonyL can join too. he was also testing streaming with multiple nodes


[09-Feb-20 05:34 PM] SHossain#0007
@mrlynch maybe tomorrow, we might want to use some of those dedicated ips in the chain param with `-addnode=`


[09-Feb-20 05:34 PM] SHossain#0007
that might help us interconnect better


[09-Feb-20 05:34 PM] SHossain#0007
Thank you very much for the help. See you tomorrow üôÇ


[09-Feb-20 05:35 PM] mrlynch#5735

minion 38 got to 18 connections


[09-Feb-20 08:43 PM] Mylo#8306
@mrlynch I think netdata monitoring does multi node multi owner federated dashboard. @webworker01 has netdata scripts in his notary node repo I believe


[09-Feb-20 09:45 PM] webworker01#3884
not sure if it's federated, master slave is possible for sure


[10-Feb-20 02:32 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks @Mylo @webworker01 . yes, we thought about using netdata. webby already did some customization to netdata dashboard and we were thinking to use that type with certain metrics


[10-Feb-20 02:36 AM] SHossain#0007
we will use @webworker01's customization technique üôÇ


[10-Feb-20 04:16 AM] mrlynch#5735
thanks, using @webworker01's netdata dash. thanks!


[10-Feb-20 04:19 AM] mrlynch#5735

[10-Feb-20 04:23 AM] TonyL#3577
`and, hopefully @TonyL#3577 can join too. he was also testing streaming with multiple nodes` @SHossain sure, I can connect spin/connect to your network up to 100 nodes for a few hours but for now looks like even few got huge lag so probably it doesn't have much sense (https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/455851625915875338/676235585022590977 lag there is very big as well as pending  so network feels not good). Interesting that with same addnode on all nodes (=all nodes interconnected) it lag as well


[10-Feb-20 04:25 AM] TonyL#3577
If you can spin 5 nodes and try to stream 1Gb file from one and then check if other 4 get whole file it would be a very good test because I never was able to do it


[10-Feb-20 04:26 AM] TonyL#3577
(network totally stuck on some point). And from my point of view it's not a setup issue so would be great to compare with another testnet setup


[10-Feb-20 04:31 AM] mrlynch#5735
i have 50 nodes with different ip's ready


[10-Feb-20 04:32 AM] mrlynch#5735
about 2/3 of nodes have between 15-19 connections and 1/3 are sitting at 51


[10-Feb-20 04:32 AM] SHossain#0007
@TonyL yes, i can do that on 4 nodes manually and @mrlynch maybe we can only start one of your VM to subscribe to that stream


[10-Feb-20 04:32 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll prepare for a stream soon

[10-Feb-20 04:34 AM] TonyL#3577
`about 2/3 of nodes have between 15-19 connections and 1/3 are sitting at 51` as I remember the goal was to make network where each node got around 3 connections


[10-Feb-20 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
6 connections to 8 on each node i think is good


[10-Feb-20 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
3 is the minimum


[10-Feb-20 04:35 AM] SHossain#0007
so, in conf file, we need `maxconnections=8`


[10-Feb-20 04:35 AM] SHossain#0007
@mrlynch let's get this done then ^^


[10-Feb-20 04:36 AM] TonyL#3577
also since first node is in `addnode` param on all nodes you need to kill it after network setup or it'll die


[10-Feb-20 04:39 AM] SHossain#0007
you mean kill the seed node?


[10-Feb-20 04:39 AM] mrlynch#5735
few moments, i'll update daemons to latest


[10-Feb-20 04:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if you set maxconnections to 8, it might end up with a lot less


[10-Feb-20 04:39 AM] jl777c#5810
set maxconnections to 16


[10-Feb-20 04:39 AM] mrlynch#5735
ok


[10-Feb-20 04:40 AM] jl777c#5810
3 is minimum, 16 max and target of 6 to 8


[10-Feb-20 04:41 AM] TonyL#3577
`you mean kill the seed node?` yep because it'll saturate. But it'll be visible from test results


[10-Feb-20 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
once the network learns about the peers, yes, kill the seednode to avoid bottlenecks


[10-Feb-20 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
hopefully the ip are static and peers.dat are relevant across test runs


[10-Feb-20 04:42 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, ips are static


[10-Feb-20 04:42 AM] SHossain#0007
will kill the 2 seed nodes once the peers are interconnected and will start a local node to keep monitoring


[10-Feb-20 04:42 AM] mrlynch#5735
updating daemons now, might take 10 min


[10-Feb-20 04:43 AM] mrlynch#5735
set `maxconnections=16` in confs

i can use 2 bystanders to subscribe too

wanted the simultaneous streaming with the nodes @mrlynch is preparing

what I wanted to try is: 1 node streaming, 4 nodes watching - got problems with such setup

network saturating fast

[10-Feb-20 05:30 AM] SHossain#0007
with your node, it's 3 node subscribing while one node is publishing


[10-Feb-20 05:32 AM] SHossain#0007
@grewalsatinder you can also try installing this one `sudo apt install ffmpeg` and Ubuntu's default video player should be able to play it


[10-Feb-20 05:32 AM] SHossain#0007
since i have the codec, default video player plays it for me


[10-Feb-20 05:33 AM] SHossain#0007
though, with VLC there are plenty customization options like setting up the buffer size

oh it's keep buffering further! üòÑ


[10-Feb-20 05:40 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, because the network has all files, your node should be receiving that fast


[10-Feb-20 05:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and I'm not behind vpn so can be receiving all data too fast on this gbps line.

is that expected?


[10-Feb-20 05:43 AM] SHossain#0007
since it works with VPN on those 2 nodes, on open network should be fine


[10-Feb-20 05:43 AM] SHossain#0007
hmmm...maybe restart the playback

since i started VLC


[10-Feb-20 05:44 AM] SHossain#0007
maybe change your buffer size in VLC settings


[10-Feb-20 05:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
actually it's expected, as I undersatand, since it's not a stream from network.


[10-Feb-20 05:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
probably the mms:// protocol are supposed to wait for continued buffer


[10-Feb-20 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
set buffer size to at least 10 seconds


[10-Feb-20 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe even 30, if laggy connection

i'm actually mimicking live-stream


[10-Feb-20 05:52 AM] SHossain#0007
just instead of my webcam, i am using a video in loop as source and recording that in my drive, which is being published


[10-Feb-20 05:53 AM] SHossain#0007
if you publish a static video file, it wont be classed as live-stream


[10-Feb-20 05:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
how you using that loop? can you share that script too?


[10-Feb-20 05:54 AM] SHossain#0007
it's not a script, it's a software called OBS Studio

@grewalsatinder what's the file size on your end now?

`@TonyL#3577 it seems simultaneous streaming is working` with 4 watchers and 1 streamer?

3 watcher and 1 streamer


[10-Feb-20 06:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if RAM.nnnn is in sync, basically all nodes can stream, streaming is just copying data that is already in RAM to a file


[10-Feb-20 06:02 AM] TonyL#3577
I see, so something specific with my setup most probably


[10-Feb-20 06:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
few months ago for a uni project I tested a video streaming setup just using ffmpeg.
I did save the ffmpeg settings/commands.
unable to find those at the moment.
will get back to here after some search.


[10-Feb-20 06:03 AM] SHossain#0007
RAM values are quite close between the nodes


[10-Feb-20 06:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
filesize is 404.0 MB


[10-Feb-20 06:04 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. so, you are getting the slices nicely


[10-Feb-20 06:04 AM] SHossain#0007
it seems


[10-Feb-20 06:05 AM] SHossain#0007
there is `sleep 1` in your script. that is making your end a bit slower to grab the slices. but, this is not anything bad


[10-Feb-20 06:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep

only when I was canceling the ffmpeg command, and the video saved that video was playing.

that will give us better understanding of stability


[10-Feb-20 06:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
AFAIK threestream is planning on a multichain project so I figure yes with them ,  bittube I think could be convinced.  Bittube was also interest in DEX integration and may be able to provide devs for trying to get cryptonote working.  I‚Äôll keep you all updated.  I did tell them this was really new tech though not to inflate expectation at this point

[10-Feb-20 07:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
gonna stop kmd/dex chain and restart dexp2p


[10-Feb-20 07:03 AM] SHossain#0007
@mrlynch file name will be changed. just a min. i'll get the new one
@grewalsatinder we will do video call a bit later üòÖ


[10-Feb-20 07:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
üòÖ yea


[10-Feb-20 07:04 AM] SHossain#0007
i will start the old stream to publish while i get some food and mrlynch can subscribe to those


[10-Feb-20 07:05 AM] mrlynch#5735
how many nodes and for how long? please bear in mind that once i start streaming i can't easily stop the nodes üòÑ


[10-Feb-20 07:06 AM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c any suggestion on this?


[10-Feb-20 07:06 AM] SHossain#0007
i guess about 20 minutes on all 50 nodes?


[10-Feb-20 07:07 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll start publishing as soon as i get the answer


[10-Feb-20 07:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I see 2 DEXP2P folders in my .komodo


[10-Feb-20 07:08 AM] SHossain#0007
oh, i'll also have to kill the original 2 seed nodes before streaming


[10-Feb-20 07:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was running DEXP2P


[10-Feb-20 07:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
now also see DEXP2P2


[10-Feb-20 07:09 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, DEXP2P2 is the one we are using now


[10-Feb-20 07:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain you gave me DEXP2P2 in command üòÑ


[10-Feb-20 07:09 AM] SHossain#0007
DEXP2P is bit old


[10-Feb-20 07:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was using DEXP2P üòÑ


[10-Feb-20 07:09 AM] SHossain#0007
lol


[10-Feb-20 07:09 AM] SHossain#0007
that is  the issue then


[10-Feb-20 07:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
since I used command from docs link


[10-Feb-20 07:09 AM] SHossain#0007
the seed nodes also keeping that chain alive


[10-Feb-20 07:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
deleting the both DEXP2P folders


[10-Feb-20 07:10 AM] SHossain#0007
DEXP2P2 doesn't have any blocks


[10-Feb-20 07:10 AM] SHossain#0007
not needed anyway


[10-Feb-20 07:11 AM] SHossain#0007
both chain has same start command except the -ac_name


[10-Feb-20 07:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
hmm... no I was wrong I think.
the shell scripts are having p2p2, so those are correct ü§î


[10-Feb-20 07:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
not sure how I got DEXP2P then ü§î


[10-Feb-20 07:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
anyway


[10-Feb-20 07:12 AM] SHossain#0007
we will setup a brand new chain with 2 seed nodes, yours and mine for video call


[10-Feb-20 07:12 AM] SHossain#0007
no other testing will be conducted on those until we get that working


[10-Feb-20 07:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
started stream again


[10-Feb-20 07:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
can you try again

broadcasted some packets. lets see if he see them


[10-Feb-20 07:52 AM] SHossain#0007
my local node and seednode shows same data. but, seems satinder's node doesn't see them


[10-Feb-20 07:54 AM] SHossain#0007
@mrlynch how many connections you have now?


[10-Feb-20 07:55 AM] mrlynch#5735
2-3, mostly 2


[10-Feb-20 07:55 AM] mrlynch#5735
cleared peers.dat and restarted nodes


[10-Feb-20 07:55 AM] mrlynch#5735
doing few addnodes now


[10-Feb-20 07:55 AM] SHossain#0007
let me do the same


[10-Feb-20 07:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
we're still on DEXP2P2 right?

[10-Feb-20 08:08 AM] SHossain#0007
i mean test in controlled environment


[10-Feb-20 08:10 AM] mrlynch#5735
i'll stop the nodes then


[10-Feb-20 08:10 AM] SHossain#0007
sure


[10-Feb-20 08:19 AM] SHossain#0007
both seed nodes up for new chain


[10-Feb-20 08:23 AM] mrlynch#5735
@jl777c after adding maxconnections=16 in .conf it seems that nodes don't connect to each other anymore
i've issued addnode cli commands and still nothing
ideas?


[10-Feb-20 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
remove the maxconnections=16


[10-Feb-20 08:25 AM] mrlynch#5735
just as i went to remove i saw that 2 nodes got 3 conns.. shall i give it a few minutes?


[10-Feb-20 08:27 AM] SHossain#0007
the seednodes has 53 and 54 connections


[10-Feb-20 08:27 AM] mrlynch#5735
that's ok


[10-Feb-20 08:27 AM] SHossain#0007
local node has only 2


[10-Feb-20 08:28 AM] SHossain#0007
if local node doesn't get connected to few of the 50 nodes, i won't be able to publish properly


[10-Feb-20 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
if it worked without maxconnections, i guess no need to fix it


[10-Feb-20 08:30 AM] mrlynch#5735
ok, i removed maxconnections and conns started going up, currently all nodes sit at 4-5

minions with less connections are behind with aprox 50MB

i guess need more connections


[10-Feb-20 08:54 AM] mrlynch#5735
no, wait.. i messed up


[10-Feb-20 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
lets do this without maxconnections which seems to limit it far more than it should


[10-Feb-20 08:55 AM] mrlynch#5735
i forgot to push more forks in orchestration and 5 nodes started later


[10-Feb-20 08:55 AM] mrlynch#5735
it seems they're all on par


[10-Feb-20 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
is there a way to automatically get the DEX_stats line from all the nodes and put it into a file?


[10-Feb-20 08:55 AM] mrlynch#5735
yes


[10-Feb-20 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the publisher node is the reference for sync, seems the nodes are lagging a bit, but the request mechanism should kick in to fetch whatever is missing and the more peers the better it should work, just dont want to require any crazy number of average peers


[10-Feb-20 08:56 AM] mrlynch#5735
what's the cli command for DEX_stats?


[10-Feb-20 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
komodo-cli -ac_name=NAME DEX_stats


[10-Feb-20 08:56 AM] mrlynch#5735
i'll do some addnodes and we can start another run with 20 nodes for 10 min

how often do you need DEX_stats to be run?


[10-Feb-20 08:57 AM] SHossain#0007
publisher is getting a lot of request and serving those files


[10-Feb-20 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, and to see the DEX_stats line every minute would be good, especially the few minutes after the streaming stops


[10-Feb-20 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the publishing is going about 10% faster than the network can keep up in realtime (with the existing connectivity)


[10-Feb-20 08:58 AM] mrlynch#5735
i'll do a while loop, addnode and start over with 20 nodes

@SHossain same file name, yes?

43MB passed


[10-Feb-20 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming 20 nodes works streaming from minion01, we need to stream from a normal node that isnt so connected


[10-Feb-20 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
it shouldnt matter as i limit the number of times a packet is sent from a single node without a request, but good to verify the performance is similar


[10-Feb-20 09:03 AM] SHossain#0007
the local node where i'm publishing from has only 3 connections


[10-Feb-20 09:03 AM] mrlynch#5735
all minions are clients


[10-Feb-20 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, okd


[10-Feb-20 09:04 AM] SHossain#0007
all other nodes are subscribers


[10-Feb-20 09:04 AM] mrlynch#5735
5 or 6 minions have 50 conns, rest of them 4-8


[10-Feb-20 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are publishing from a 3 connection node, that is a very good test


[10-Feb-20 09:04 AM] SHossain#0007
`"connections": 3,`


[10-Feb-20 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
any idea why the 5 or 6 have so many connections?


[10-Feb-20 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess it is actually very similar to a real network, so maybe this is a very good simulation


[10-Feb-20 09:05 AM] mrlynch#5735
ready


[10-Feb-20 09:05 AM] SHossain#0007
those are dedicated VM with public ip. not exactly sure why some got many conns


[10-Feb-20 09:05 AM] mrlynch#5735
i had to push some addnode


[10-Feb-20 09:05 AM] mrlynch#5735
i can exclude those though


[10-Feb-20 09:05 AM] mrlynch#5735
and use a different batch of minions that are not so connected


[10-Feb-20 09:05 AM] SHossain#0007
i already did about 100MB or stream


[10-Feb-20 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
lets make sure it works with these 20 nodes


[10-Feb-20 09:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
@SHossain do you want to start minion-01 yourself? to see stdout?


[10-Feb-20 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
the more different network configs we validate, the better. it could well be that only certain configs work very well, and some might work very poorly


[10-Feb-20 09:06 AM] SHossain#0007
@mrlynch yes, on the next test, i can control minion-01


[10-Feb-20 09:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
go


[10-Feb-20 09:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
i'm ready


[10-Feb-20 09:06 AM] SHossain#0007
oh...you didn't subscribe before?


[10-Feb-20 09:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
10 minutes, minions 01 to 20 starting now


[10-Feb-20 09:07 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. stream is already publishing


[10-Feb-20 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
you shouldnt start the stream until after the network establishes connections


[10-Feb-20 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
it should still work, but will always be lagging and needing to catch up

[10-Feb-20 09:08 AM] SHossain#0007

can't stop it for 10 min now

the filesize mismatch can happen when a node joins later to the stream. because, it would start gathering slices from the beginning. (just an idea)


[10-Feb-20 09:18 AM] SHossain#0007
if they all started at the same time and got different size, yes, that seems an issue

if the nodes are not fully in sync, it will take a while for the REQUEST commands to fetch all the missing data, it goes at about 10% the normal speed, you will see about 5tx/sec during the back filling

hopefully with enough time, all the nodes will eventually get all the data, but it seems the stream is broadcasting too fast for network capacity,so need to either lower the bandwidth needed or increase network connectivity


[10-Feb-20 09:27 AM] TonyL#3577
how there might be 55 connections in 20 nodes network?


[10-Feb-20 09:27 AM] jl777c#5810
most at 7 and 8 connections, which is good


[10-Feb-20 09:27 AM] SHossain#0007
we have over 50 nodes

it could be the 55 connections nodes are bottlenecking, not sure without seeing the DEX_stats lines

i repeat, subscribing to a stream only writes the file, you are still syncing all the data


[10-Feb-20 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so this is a 50 node test


[10-Feb-20 09:28 AM] SHossain#0007
got it


[10-Feb-20 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
if all nodes are in sync, then streaming on one or 50 is no difference to network load


[10-Feb-20 09:28 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, all nodes in the network would see those packets


[10-Feb-20 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
only when a node is missing packets and makes a request will it create a bit of additional network load


[10-Feb-20 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
if you measure bandwidth per node, you should see an average of streaming bandwidth on each node


[10-Feb-20 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
but this needs to be validated, there is some overhead

[10-Feb-20 09:29 AM] mrlynch#5735
sorry about the formatting, will add a timestamp and a break for each 60s


[10-Feb-20 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
what about DEX_stats on the other nodes?


[10-Feb-20 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
lag times are all around 3 seconds, so there is not the horrible lag we say with tony networks


[10-Feb-20 09:31 AM] mrlynch#5735
i only took DEX_stats on nodes 01-20


[10-Feb-20 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
but all 50 nodes are on the network


[10-Feb-20 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
they should all be getting the same data


[10-Feb-20 09:31 AM] mrlynch#5735
ok, will amend the script


[10-Feb-20 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a broadcast network


[10-Feb-20 09:31 AM] mrlynch#5735
so get DEX_stats from all nodes

{Reactions}
üëç 

[10-Feb-20 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[10-Feb-20 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
all along, this has been a 50 node test and it appears to be having similar results to 10 node network, ie. 3 second lag


[10-Feb-20 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
if you do a non-streaming publish/subscribe test i think it will allow to find the issues better


[10-Feb-20 09:32 AM] mrlynch#5735
do you want me to kill the other nodes that are not in the testing round or leave them be?


[10-Feb-20 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
depends on their DEX_stats


[10-Feb-20 09:33 AM] mrlynch#5735
hmm, ok. how do you want the next round? shall we repeat this one with 20 nodes and gather DEX_stats from all 50? reduce to 5 minutes?


[10-Feb-20 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
5 minutes is enough of a test


[10-Feb-20 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
need to see the DEX_stats


[10-Feb-20 09:34 AM] SHossain#0007
`if you do a non-streaming publish/subscribe test i think it will allow to find the issues better`
i can publish a normal file, and you can probably subscribe to it and check the hash after the next test with all nodes?


[10-Feb-20 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can just extract the single stats line for each node, that will help see the data better


[10-Feb-20 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and broadcast for 5 minutes, but DEX_stats for 10 minutes so we can see 5 minutes during the test and 5 minutes after

yes, after even restart, it got 49 connections

for this test

200MB is good size


[10-Feb-20 09:59 AM] SHossain#0007
also did maxconnections=8 on minion-01


[10-Feb-20 09:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
ok

DEX_subscribe


[10-Feb-20 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
so one command to do the entire file: DEX_publish


[10-Feb-20 10:02 AM] SHossain#0007
ok.


[10-Feb-20 10:03 AM] SHossain#0007
so, i'll do `./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXSCALE kmdd 5`


[10-Feb-20 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
dont forget the DEX_publish

oh...sorry. yes, that's missing


[10-Feb-20 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007

no...no. you don't need do while loop


[10-Feb-20 10:06 AM] SHossain#0007
you just need only 1 command line


[10-Feb-20 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
until the file is fully broadcast, it wont be able to DEX_subscribe


[10-Feb-20 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
the DEX_stats can gather stats until the publish is done


[10-Feb-20 10:06 AM] SHossain#0007
i'm just trying to do a final check on minion-01 and publisher node with connections


[10-Feb-20 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810
then DEX_subscribe to get the file and make sure it syncs


[10-Feb-20 10:07 AM] jl777c#5810

[10-Feb-20 10:48 AM] SHossain#0007
inside the src directory


[10-Feb-20 10:49 AM] SHossain#0007
or from where you launched the `komodod` command


[10-Feb-20 10:49 AM] mrlynch#5735
nope


[10-Feb-20 10:49 AM] mrlynch#5735
commands are basically run from `~/`


[10-Feb-20 10:49 AM] SHossain#0007
minion-01 couldn't do anything as it had all 0


[10-Feb-20 10:49 AM] SHossain#0007
check homedir

but no kmdd


[10-Feb-20 10:50 AM] SHossain#0007
yep, the first one


[10-Feb-20 10:50 AM] mrlynch#5735
ah


[10-Feb-20 10:50 AM] SHossain#0007
the file gets renamed with publisher pubkey


[10-Feb-20 10:50 AM] SHossain#0007
as extension


[10-Feb-20 10:50 AM] SHossain#0007
if you do `ls -lh` of that file, you will get the size


[10-Feb-20 10:51 AM] SHossain#0007
rename that to `kmdd` or `komodod` and it should work

[10-Feb-20 10:51 AM] mrlynch#5735
that was a quick download


[10-Feb-20 10:51 AM] mrlynch#5735
shall i stop DEX_stats collection?


[10-Feb-20 10:51 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, it was in your RAM already


[10-Feb-20 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
you had all the blocks


[10-Feb-20 10:52 AM] mrlynch#5735
very nice


[10-Feb-20 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, need to see the DEX_stats, hopefully formatted sanely


[10-Feb-20 10:52 AM] SHossain#0007
reconstruction from RAM is very fast. even for a 1GB file


[10-Feb-20 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it is basically limited by your storage speeds, unless some packets are missing and it needs to REQUEST them


[10-Feb-20 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
so if the lag stats are still looking good, it seems time to do a blaster test


[10-Feb-20 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
using DEX_broadcast ffff on 5, 10, 15, 20 nodes, until the network saturates


[10-Feb-20 10:56 AM] mrlynch#5735
last 23 min of DEX_stats <https://pastebin.com/FnACq7KF>


[10-Feb-20 10:56 AM] SHossain#0007
do you have each broadcast as 5x now?


[10-Feb-20 10:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it is 5x, let me check


[10-Feb-20 10:57 AM] mrlynch#5735
there's a break and a timestamp at every minute


[10-Feb-20 10:57 AM] mrlynch#5735
from all nodes


[10-Feb-20 10:57 AM] SHossain#0007
@grewalsatinder did 4 broadcasts today and he had 20 packets on his node


[10-Feb-20 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
it does 10, but it only broadcasts if it is exactly the specified priority, so on average it is 5


[10-Feb-20 10:58 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks


[10-Feb-20 10:59 AM] SHossain#0007
blast test soon üòç


[10-Feb-20 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX_stats shows 100% sync! 1 to 2 second lag for the most part


[10-Feb-20 11:00 AM] SHossain#0007
should we proceed with blast?


[10-Feb-20 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, last test gets a 100% score


[10-Feb-20 11:01 AM] mrlynch#5735
sweet


[10-Feb-20 11:01 AM] SHossain#0007
@mrlynch do you have the script that we did last night blasting?


[10-Feb-20 11:01 AM] SHossain#0007
just need to change the chain name


[10-Feb-20 11:01 AM] mrlynch#5735
the broadcast ffff?


[10-Feb-20 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
you cant blast on all the nodes, it will definitely saturate


[10-Feb-20 11:01 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, the ffff


[10-Feb-20 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
so start with 5 nodes and sample a few DEX_stats to see if they are in sync


[10-Feb-20 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
keep adding 5 more nodes until it saturates


[10-Feb-20 11:02 AM] SHossain#0007
seednodes are offline. so, i'll monitor the local node. minion-01 also not connected to other nodes


[10-Feb-20 11:02 AM] mrlynch#5735
so collect DEX_stats from all nodes, start with 5 and and keep pushing


[10-Feb-20 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, if you can manually sample a few nodes with each 5 so we know when to stop the test


[10-Feb-20 11:03 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, manual collect is possible


[10-Feb-20 11:03 AM] mrlynch#5735
```#!/bin/bash
while true
do
./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P2 DEX_broadcast ffff

[10-Feb-20 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[10-Feb-20 11:03 AM] SHossain#0007
chain name to DEXSCALE


[10-Feb-20 11:03 AM] mrlynch#5735
`yes, if you can manually sample a few nodes with each 5 so we know when to stop the test` i'll collect DEX_stats for all nodes and tail -f it


[10-Feb-20 11:03 AM] mrlynch#5735
yes yes

[10-Feb-20 11:03 AM] jl777c#5810
just manually collect on a few nodes is enough to see if things are saturated


[10-Feb-20 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
RAM.nnnn being the same, pending.0 or low number, lag times not increasing


[10-Feb-20 11:04 AM] mrlynch#5735
do we run it on a time limit or while true?


[10-Feb-20 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
blast while true


[10-Feb-20 11:04 AM] mrlynch#5735
ok


[10-Feb-20 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
we keep adding 5 more blasting nodes until we saturate the network. we are trying to find how many nodes blasting will achieve this


[10-Feb-20 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
it is like a crash test dummy test. ram the car into a wall and see if the crash test dummy would have survived


[10-Feb-20 11:06 AM] mrlynch#5735
@SHossain do you want to do minion-01 manually?


[10-Feb-20 11:07 AM] SHossain#0007

minion-01 see very less packets


[10-Feb-20 11:47 AM] mrlynch#5735
hmm.. some have pend less than 1000


[10-Feb-20 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
basically under heavy load, a network will have inconsistent and variable latency, but file transfers work, streaming would need a big buffer. and the behavior we are seeing here is similar to how 10 node network performs


[10-Feb-20 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe need to have a blast ffff and sleep 1


[10-Feb-20 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
just one blast and sleep 1 second


[10-Feb-20 11:48 AM] mrlynch#5735

[10-Feb-20 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
with all 50 nodes blasting, each node needs to process the other 49 nodes packets, so we likely exceeded the processing capacity


[10-Feb-20 11:48 AM] jl777c#5810
my prediction is that doing that will have a much smoother performance


[10-Feb-20 11:49 AM] mrlynch#5735

[10-Feb-20 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so all along, the daemon is still runing without restarts?


[10-Feb-20 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
that is good if that is the case

it's a 10gb card no? @SHossain

that is a possibility

yep, 10gb card on a 1gb line

are the other minion stats like minion-01

broadcast at priority 2


[10-Feb-20 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
then it should do much better with the VIP packets


[10-Feb-20 11:58 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, there are few like minion-01

and plenty about 30/sec


[10-Feb-20 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
right now all are non-vip, so if it doesnt get there, it is just left behind

where would i see that?


[10-Feb-20 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
and i guess cant run blasters on all nodes, just run it on half of them

in DEX_stats vip is returning 5


[10-Feb-20 11:59 AM] mrlynch#5735
ok


[10-Feb-20 11:59 AM] SHossain#0007
add `2` after `ffff`


[10-Feb-20 11:59 AM] SHossain#0007
that would be priority 2

[10-Feb-20 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
it is not clear there is any reproducible bad behavior, other than "saturate the network and not all packets gets to all nodes"


[10-Feb-20 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
which i dont think i can solve


[10-Feb-20 12:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
i'm concerned that packets don't actually leave the network


[10-Feb-20 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
the network must remain below the saturation level


[10-Feb-20 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
these packets are all localhost?


[10-Feb-20 12:22 PM] SHossain#0007
how to enforce below saturation level?


[10-Feb-20 12:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
maybe next step would be another host with a different ip set and run 25 on host 1 and 25 on host 2


[10-Feb-20 12:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
no


[10-Feb-20 12:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
each node has a different public ip


[10-Feb-20 12:22 PM] mrlynch#5735
but they're in the same subnet


[10-Feb-20 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
with the proper txpowbits you can make it very very expensive to saturate the network


[10-Feb-20 12:23 PM] SHossain#0007
i have another server that we can use. but, that's about 4 hours drive from my home one way. still would be under same network


[10-Feb-20 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i think having the packets have a more than 0 ping time would be like adding more sleeps and help the nodes catch up


[10-Feb-20 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
what i think we can do is connect these 50 nodes to DPOW network!


[10-Feb-20 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
that will get us to 85+ nodes


[10-Feb-20 12:24 PM] mrlynch#5735

i find atomicDEX mobile is pretty good, polished and fast wallet along with atomic swap support


[10-Feb-20 12:35 PM] SHossain#0007
your mileage might vary


[10-Feb-20 12:37 PM] mrlynch#5735

[10-Feb-20 12:58 PM] stranger#2879
same as native mode


[10-Feb-20 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
@mrlynch i assume you updated to the latest version today


[10-Feb-20 01:00 PM] SHossain#0007
afaik, yes, it was updated this afternoon


[10-Feb-20 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
good


[10-Feb-20 01:00 PM] mrlynch#5735
yes


[10-Feb-20 01:01 PM] SHossain#0007
i can launch another node if needed


[10-Feb-20 01:01 PM] SHossain#0007
actually 2 more


[10-Feb-20 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
we have enough, especially when i add my 10 more


[10-Feb-20 01:02 PM] SHossain#0007
cool


[10-Feb-20 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
but lets not go crazy on DPOW, just some file sync tests to make sure it is smooth


[10-Feb-20 01:03 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. broadcasting a 4.8MB file


[10-Feb-20 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, like that and making sure it gets 100% sync


[10-Feb-20 01:03 PM] SHossain#0007
what priority?


[10-Feb-20 01:03 PM] SHossain#0007
5?


[10-Feb-20 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
5 or higher is needed to get 100% sync


[10-Feb-20 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
vip level


[10-Feb-20 01:04 PM] SHossain#0007
can do 8 or 9 too


[10-Feb-20 01:04 PM] SHossain#0007

@mrlynch this should subscribe to the file and re-constract in local nodes.

started DPOW on 61 nodes

oh...ok


[10-Feb-20 01:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
do you want me to subscribe to that file?

yes please


[10-Feb-20 01:07 PM] SHossain#0007
if your nodes seen this


[10-Feb-20 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
you will need to wait until after the nodes get connected


[10-Feb-20 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the other nodes will send you the packets that you missed before you joined


[10-Feb-20 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
there is a network memory


[10-Feb-20 01:08 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. will wait for ping to broadcast again with different name


[10-Feb-20 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean to sync the above


[10-Feb-20 01:08 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok


[10-Feb-20 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
nodes that were offline when it was broadcast should be able to retrieve it


[10-Feb-20 01:08 PM] SHossain#0007
ah...ok. my head is just slow now üòÖ

minions are not on the list


[10-Feb-20 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
without pubkey i guess it wouldnt register, but they shouldnt be on the list

[10-Feb-20 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
yes keep doing the streamsubs


[10-Feb-20 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
until all are in sync


[10-Feb-20 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
or we get to where a node cant sync. then it is a bug


[10-Feb-20 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
the REQUEST are the minions asking other nodes to send them info about the missing data


[10-Feb-20 01:39 PM] mrlynch#5735
hmm... they seems to be stuck at 192


[10-Feb-20 01:39 PM] SHossain#0007
missing slices


[10-Feb-20 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you look at duplicates, it wont show any big increase as the node that requested the info has to specifically request a message id for it to be transmitted


[10-Feb-20 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
if there is 1 missing message out of 100 for a slice, it will keep trying


[10-Feb-20 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
until the hashes match


[10-Feb-20 01:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
nope, stuck at 192M


[10-Feb-20 01:44 PM] mrlynch#5735
should i stop it?


[10-Feb-20 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
all of them?


[10-Feb-20 01:46 PM] jl777c#5810
is it still getting closer?


[10-Feb-20 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
you can tell by the number of missing slices

what is the output of streamsub call


[10-Feb-20 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
wait 10 seconds and do a second streamsub call


[10-Feb-20 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
is it changing?

@TonyL did you try doing file sync tests on your networks?


[10-Feb-20 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
not streaming as that is the most difficult

oh, thats right even small manual stuff was wonky on small network


[10-Feb-20 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
which can certainly explain missing locator packets


[10-Feb-20 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
which will cause that error


[10-Feb-20 01:56 PM] TonyL#3577
nice that it's confirmed now, looks like the only known bug for now


[10-Feb-20 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i rely on vip packet to get to all nodes, but in some cases it doesnt and that is fatal for a stream

[10-Feb-20 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
is that because these tests didnt use bandwidth?


[10-Feb-20 02:01 PM] SHossain#0007
it seems these latest versions uses very low bandwidth

mrlynch was saying it didnt go outside the network


[10-Feb-20 02:02 PM] SHossain#0007

[10-Feb-20 02:03 PM] TonyL#3577
I think this stuck (=vip packages loss) might be related to usage of not local traffic in general

i think it is just my node syncing all the vip messages it missed


[10-Feb-20 02:08 PM] SHossain#0007
but, that could be due to that my node is not in the pubkey set and not running notarizer?

I guess I assumed saturation was that there were not enough recources allocated on reviever side and that "side chains" could be used as buffers to recieve and organize but not "calculate" - I am just trying to think of ways to cheat by creating multiple paths. Saturation is what is holding this back and I am not sure exactly what is being saturated..  -- buffering with  sidechains - 1 main chain + 7 possible sidechains / DEXP2P antara modules........

Regarding the recent Forbes article about creating any stablecoin and the current defi stablecoin twitter post, I sent that information to a friend who is knowledgeable in the current defi developments, and he answered the following. I'm interested in your thoughts and how you think Komodo will still be successful with the new developments:

"That is exactly what the Defi projects already do on the Ethereum basis, in contrast to Komodo already up and running, and not alpha or beta state. Maker has the stablecoin DAI, synthetix has sUSD, etc. Basically any Defi project can create its own stablecoin with a smart contract. Do not underestimate the power of the network effect (= adoption). Currently, 99 percent of the Defi applications run on Ethereum (see defipulse.com), thus it will be hard for other projects / latecomers to get any attention or market share, especially when they are only in alpha or beta phase right now. The mentioned Defi projects on Ethereum have been existing since circa 2017 and have been kicking off big only recently."


[11-Feb-20 01:27 PM] TonyL#3577
For every ETH tx you need to pay gas and something like a cryptokitties 2.0 might DoS all current Defi apps. That's besides of smartcontracts security issues and limitations of balance based system (UTXO allows to point multiple outputs in single tx) so it's easier to scale on transactional/logic level besides infinity scaling on blockchain level to provide any required TPS on demand by just one more chain spinning with value sharing and so on. Just my 5 komodoshi


[11-Feb-20 01:31 PM] TonyL#3577
From my point of view ETH at the moment looks like some experimental/sandbox thing to demonstrate concept of smartcontracts. And if they massively change things (and they obv need it to be real life mass-adoption platform) all current applications on top of ETH automatically became not even alpha most probably because of necessity to rework stuff to these changes

true, and since ETH 2.0 being incompatible with ETH 1.0, all the work these projects did with ETH 1.0 has to be re-done and re-architect with ETH 2.0

[11-Feb-20 02:12 PM] Mylo#8306
& a lot of these DeFi projects are small scale (user wise), even if 100k users, it's enough for a small city only.
existing DeFi projects will have options to re-write their code to ETH 2.0 as satinder mentions.  polkadot is making it easy for eth devs to move to it as well.  there is also CDP being produced in cosmos with kavalabs.

it is a huge space of new fintech products.  single chain architecture unlikely to succeed at scale & yes, gas is an unpopular model for high computation & storage stuff.


[11-Feb-20 02:15 PM] Mylo#8306
tying into the bitcoin userbase is also important.  bridges, gateways etc.
these are paid for services in cosmos afaik thru hubs.  in kmd, you (the organization) has the option to manage this as an internal cost (infrastructure).

bottom line is, kmd stablecoin solution comes baked into smart chain.  product development can accelerate with these building blocks

CPU and GPU mining totally dominated BTC mining and there was no need for anything more efficient, except for people wanting things to be more efficient and that is why ASIC are made. think of komodo tech as ASIC, takes longer to make but once it is made it is a lot more efficient

@jl777c What about ETH 2.0 which is supposed to resolve the issue of low Tx speed and high Tx costs?


[12-Feb-20 01:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought the main point was that ETH was doing defi for years. if you are now invoking some future version that isnt here yet, it seems there is nothing that is established for years


[12-Feb-20 01:19 AM] t_dan#3334
At least the fact that many projects have already built on it and will probably adapt quickly, as well as the already established network effect.


[12-Feb-20 01:23 AM] CHMEX#0686
If you have to adapt to the new tech meaning rewrite everything some projects will take that chance move to something they are 100% in control of. One of that is an Antara chain.


[12-Feb-20 01:23 AM] t_dan#3334

and certainly KMD wont be doing any ETH-killing\

the way it works is that established usage is established and it will likely stay established for a long time

it is the new growth that is up for grabs


[12-Feb-20 01:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so the question isnt whether ETH will continue having defi, of course it will


[12-Feb-20 01:26 AM] t_dan#3334
I just wanted to see a realistic opinion if komodo has a chance to get a good market share in the Defi space


[12-Feb-20 01:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the question is if KMD will get a significant share of the expanding defi market


[12-Feb-20 01:27 AM] jl777c#5810
being able to have a native coin that represents a stablecoin seems to be a pretty rare thing and quite useful.


[12-Feb-20 01:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
The potential market for Defi is huge, even grabbing only a moderate 1% of the total global possible marketshare would be an insane amount of usage

To comment this ETH debate. Once chain comes over populated there is no way out of that than paying more tx fees. Same goes Ethereum as in gas model and for bitcoin in txfees costs. Only way to escape that is to not be so popular in peoples minds torwards your chain.  It is a benefit to be on your own chain at least when your competitor idea is taking wind under wings and resources off from others in ethereum based one chain rule them all model.


[13-Feb-20 05:14 AM] Mark81#4505
what i havent still seen on blockchain saga is model where blockchain is changing dynamically based on transaction load on mempool its blocktimes and rewards. If mempool is filling from transactions it would speed up blocktimes and reducing rewards based to blocktimes so that actual coin minting time is staying same like it was launched in beginning.  I cant imagine what this all would take to build but what i think would actually one of best solutions to combat high transaction output.


[13-Feb-20 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that the faster blocks would have less security... but i guess that is balanced by the lower payments


[13-Feb-20 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
it wouldnt be hard to change the block target time based on full blocks


[13-Feb-20 05:43 AM] Mark81#4505
We have started thinking from beginning that bitcoin model of constant block reward is one and only model. Why cannot it be that block reward is time based from previous block?  After that you would only need worry about how to keep chain securitized and what would be new consensus model in chain that has variable blocktime rate. would it be that it need to have two difficulty adjustment? one based from mempool and one from hashing of network.


[13-Feb-20 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
lowering target time would lower hash rate


[13-Feb-20 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
variable block rate, the ondemand chains do this, but at an extreme endpoint

@jl777c `mm2` uses libtorrent to create it's independent network to communicate between nodes, where the orderbook and ordermatching is done.
with new network ID, it is also scalable.

So, in that sense why we needed another scalable solution such as `dexp2p`?
what difference is the main difference in relation to `mm2` scaling in comparison to `dexp2p` ?
Trying to understand the reason why `dexp2p` was started. üôÇ


[13-Feb-20 11:15 PM] jl777c#5810
libtorrent is slow


[13-Feb-20 11:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
isn't the komodod also using libtorrent lib in it's core for p2p layer? ü§î


[13-Feb-20 11:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if not, what is it using? and how it's faster?


[13-Feb-20 11:16 PM] jl777c#5810
mm2 used a very inefficient method to broadcast as it was just a placeholder, so it needed a new p2p network layer. after seeing discussions about it for 6 months, i decided to just write it as i knew i could in a few weeks


[13-Feb-20 11:16 PM] jl777c#5810
bitcoin doesnt use libtorrent that i know of


[13-Feb-20 11:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i use the same peer networking as bitcoin code, it is the actual same code that is handling a new p2p message


[13-Feb-20 11:17 PM] jl777c#5810
its faster as i made it faster

[13-Feb-20 11:18 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, from bitcoin whitepaper I thought it's still using libtorrent for p2p.


[13-Feb-20 11:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
is that some custom p2p or anything I can read on what bitcoin's p2p layer is built upon?


[13-Feb-20 11:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it is libevent, just tcp connections

given that, and only that, to get an efficient broadcast without a lot of redundant traffic and having it decent performance...


[13-Feb-20 11:21 PM] jl777c#5810
well it did take me a few weeks to get working, maybe someone else would have taken a lot longer to achieve the current level of performance and efficiency


[13-Feb-20 11:24 PM] jl777c#5810
basically the mm2 orderbook matching bogged down with 100+ users, but it wasnt coded to handle more than test amounts of traffic. someone had to make a more efficient orderbook/ordermatching, so i did. not sure what the mystery is, unless you missed the atomicDEX stress test


[13-Feb-20 11:26 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the origin of dexp2p, but i made it generic so it can be used for any usecase that needs to have efficient message broadcasting over p2p network, so it supports file sync, even video streaming. with the tagA/tagB and e2e encrypted messages it can easily be used by a dapp to implement a notarizer or a discord equivalent, or subatomic, or ...


[13-Feb-20 11:27 PM] jl777c#5810
blockchains are non-realtime and have an unpredictable blocktime, 10 minute wait for notarization, basically not usable for realtime cases. dexp2p provides the realtime response and it is inside the coin daemon, so it can do subatomics (dexp2p directly linked to payments)


[13-Feb-20 11:27 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I missed the tests I think. I was busy somewhere else, and was only glancing here on channels for some months occasionally.


[13-Feb-20 11:28 PM] jl777c#5810
it basically melted down during the first minutes


[13-Feb-20 11:29 PM] jl777c#5810
so clearly a solution was needed. maybe i overdid it and made a new highly flexible decentralized messaging solution, but it works quite well for orderbook, ordermatching and trade executions


[13-Feb-20 11:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Thanks :)

[13-Feb-20 11:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
can you also share any specific challenges faced stabilising dexp2p to handle big data packets on p2p network?


[13-Feb-20 11:35 PM] jl777c#5810
i implemented a txpow on a per packet basis, the larger the packet the more txpow needed for more data, so it gets very expensive to send big packets


[13-Feb-20 11:36 PM] jl777c#5810
the file transfers use 10000 byte packets and it is reassembled into slices and slices into file


[13-Feb-20 11:37 PM] jl777c#5810
once the low level messaging worked reliably, the file level was just a couple days work, most of it fiddling with getting streaming working. no real hurdles


[13-Feb-20 11:37 PM] jl777c#5810
though there is a bug still with streaming, so maybe that is the hurdle


[13-Feb-20 11:38 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
wow! so the txpow, which was used in DiceCC, and I think also used in AdoptedPoW also helped with dexp2p... ü§î


[13-Feb-20 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a different variant of txpow


[13-Feb-20 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
but yes, the concept of using pow per message is quite useful, but bitmessage did this years ago


[13-Feb-20 11:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
ah yes.... with bitmessage it clears more üôÇ


[13-Feb-20 11:40 PM] jl777c#5810
there is also an anonsend rpc call that sends to everybody


[13-Feb-20 11:40 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
need bit more to know on txpow
is that also like bitcoin's PoW? using SHA256 to do PoW per transaction or event message sending data packet over network?


[13-Feb-20 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
but only the destination can decrypt it


[13-Feb-20 11:41 PM] jl777c#5810
every data packet gets a hash sha256(curve25519(sha256(message)))


[13-Feb-20 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
the curve25519 is to make it fpga resistant and also there are no ASIC for the above hash that i know of and unlikely for there to be anytime soon


[13-Feb-20 11:44 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and I guess it won't be a big deal to change it, since it's jus p2p network based and nothing related to blockchain and avoiding hardfork concerns, in case some naughty fpga programmer figures it out and make that algo work on fpga. Please correct me if any assumption in this line is wrong.


[13-Feb-20 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
there are "network hardforks" that would be needed if the basic algos are changed, but that is a matter of updating to new version, there is no blockchain to sync. also, i designed it so that dapps can track if their messages are getting through, and if not, just raise the priority level. that wont help against an fpga, but against a spam attack, it can make the spam exponentially more expensive to make


[13-Feb-20 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it also allows someone who really, really wants to broadcast their packet to generate a higher priority one. when the network is saturated, it goes into a different mode and routes the highest priority packets first, the lowest ones it might just totally ignore

https://zcash-rpc.github.io/z_sendmany.html

Just an idea I had to increase privacy and the anonset of PIRATE if z_sendmany would accept an optional parameter 5 with an random int
It would be possible to add 0-N payments before the actual payments and 0-N payments after the actual initiated payment.
meaning there are 0-N fake payments in one transaction. The receiving address must be a valid address but nobody needs to have the privkey to those. 
Meaning generate it in RAM and forget about it
Of course it would need to be limited to the output limits of 54.


[16-Feb-20 03:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but unless its usage is used by everybody, just the usage of it would stand out


[16-Feb-20 03:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i think having a lot of subatomic activity will provide a lot of cover traffic, and its not as if there is any easy (possible?) way to correlate the zaddr to ztx


[16-Feb-20 03:36 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes definitely more organic traffic like from subatomic swaps will provide a lot of cover. I don't know any way to connect zaddr to ztx unless somebody gets the transaction history from lets say an exchange. But for that if you buy from an exchange once arrived send it to a new address nobody else knows


[16-Feb-20 03:39 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, for any zaddr you transact with externally, be it exchange, subatomic, donation address, do it with a small balance address and sweep into the real zaddr(s) from those. assume some day everybody you ever transacted with will be compromised and their nodes z_listreceivedbyaddress and the lifetime z_getoperationstatus becomes available to the attacker


[16-Feb-20 03:40 AM] jl777c#5810
granted, it is highly unlikely that this will happen, especially as z_getoperationstatus is cleared after each daemon restart, but better to be prepared against the worst case and not need it, than not being prepared and to need it


[16-Feb-20 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no blockchain record, but if the attacker can get access to everybody elses wallets, then a LOT of info becomes available for your public zaddr.

That is very true yes

i just created EURKTEST coins from KMD following https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/pegs.html
the core blockchain level code is functional, but we still need to test the validation and also make some sort of GUI for issuing/redeeming

Hi jl777,
Regarding DEXp2p and some of the tech to flow out of that (subatomic swaps, DPOW chain) I have noticed that there seems to be no, or minimal, need for actual 'blocks'.
Last week I saw a presentation (pitch) by someone who has been involved in blockchain for over 10 years. His company has a product that isn't a blockchain, but seems to have evolved from or been influenced by his experience with and knowledge of blockchain and crypto.  
The day before that I met someone else who also claimed to have been involved with blockchain for a similar amount of time.  His company also provides a non-blockchain solution for problems that blockchain solutions target.
I would think the major advantages of minimizing, or where possible eliminating, 'blocks' would be related to speed and chain size.
Do you see any other areas where using Komodo/blockchain technology while reducing or eliminating actual blocks might be practical and/or advantagous?


[20-Feb-20 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
you mean like streaming video via dexp2p, or subatomic swaps, or betdapp. just for starters


[20-Feb-20 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
blockchains have their limitations


[20-Feb-20 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
dexp2p fills the gap and at the same time can be easily integrated with blockchain(s)


[20-Feb-20 01:17 AM] CrisF#3405
Yes, exactly like those.


[20-Feb-20 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
whenever trying to solve problems that have realtime requirements, blockchain is weak


[20-Feb-20 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
dexp2p allows to be strong in that area too

[20-Feb-20 01:19 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why i am making the reference dapps, like the notarizer, subatomic and betdapp


[20-Feb-20 01:20 AM] jl777c#5810
considering that these are a few hundred lines of code to one thousand, they are not very complex, yet they do some pretty complex things, so i hope other devs will be able to make their own dapps. i make the reference dapps, others should make variants and entirely new ones

would you say a non core blockchain dev be able to create notarizer, subatomic and betdapp using other programming languages?


[20-Feb-20 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
these dapps only call the existing rpc calls


[20-Feb-20 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so you dont have to write blockchain core code, but you do need to be able to use the rpc calls for them.


[20-Feb-20 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
and what languages can issue rpc calls?

@jl777c if you want blockbook integration i made a general purpose asset integration into the bitcoin type stuff there i spent a few weeks on it, and its pretty general purpose so other token platforms can integrate into it for example https://txp.syscoin.org/address/sys1qlj6agxnpq7cj69wk4fkht3k9r6regydk8agv6v?filter=1045909988


[21-Feb-20 01:30 PM] sidhujag#3327
blockbook is cool because it gives you xpub searching, address searching, balance history filtering, and custom date timespans much like your bank account (see what tx you made of certain address from nov to feb 2019). I made assets natively integrated with all its features, so xpub (hd wallet), address stuff all just works with assets


[21-Feb-20 01:30 PM] sidhujag#3327
could be a good backend to you rwallet options for assets


[21-Feb-20 01:31 PM] sidhujag#3327

Hi jl777c, so I have a dream someday of someday seeing a coin like the one i'm going to describe below. Tell me how far out in koo koo land I am in thinking something like this is possible. If there is a glimmer of hope to it, i'd like to learn more about blockchain and programming to help something like it materialize some day:

A coin heavily focused on decentralization. Primary aims (besides being secure through komodo dpow for security and zksnarks for privacy [who knows, maybe forced like Pirate]):

1) Allow ANYONE to have a meaningful contribution to hashrate with hardware from CPUs and GPUs, to more specialized as FPGAs and ASICs. The aim here would be a multi-algorithm system with variable weighting making sure none have a distinct advantage over the others.

2) Prevent (or heavily disrupt) centralization of hashrate. This would be done through a completely different paradigm than most blockchain today.
This would require both proof of stake as well as proof of work.

Proof of stake nodes (using hash verified non-tampered code) would be the only gateways for proof of work to be submitted (like little micro mining pools). These nodes would allow a maximum pre-determined value of hashpower each (possibly variable?). Collateral per node would also scale, becoming more expensive as nethash increases. These nodes would expire after a length of time (1 or 2 months?), requiring renewal with an adjusted collateral amount.

Requiring collateral investment in order to provide proof of work would require more commitment to the project from miners, greatly diminishing centralized participation such as nicehash whales or massive farms. Something similar to Sinovate's approach could also be used in which the collateral for the node would be burned.


[22-Feb-20 09:56 PM] CiPhEr#2091
It seems burning of collateral for nodes which expire regularly would help control inflation as well as require a monetary commitment to the project from the miners. I believe it plausible this would prevent the centralization of nethash into the hands of only a few pool operators and also prevent the majority of hashrate being consolidated into just a few large mining farms. 

What do you think? Perhaps the technology isn't available at this time to do this, or is it? I'm sure there are a lot of potential attack vectors to this system but perhaps with the right implementation they could be overcome?


[23-Feb-20 01:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems overly complicated. if you just want to get rid of pools make it so it is impractical to have a pool


[23-Feb-20 01:20 AM] jl777c#5810
one way to do that is if the mined funds are locked to a random time in the future (like VRSC did at the beginning)


[23-Feb-20 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
a pool that cant payout for a long time seems wont be popular. VRSC also made a hash algo that is CPU friendly, and latest version there is no fpga version yet, even though they are trying for several months to make one


[23-Feb-20 11:56 AM] CiPhEr#2091
cool, those are some great insights. Thanks jl777c!

Succinct description of "Cross Notarizations" that are going to rock the crypto world. This is how shit-coins can be saved & how they will save BTC with 100% fees in exchange for timestamps. But it's bigger than that. It will enable constant value & unlimited tx/s.

it is a decentralized form of notarization, which is good if it can be achieved. but if you are relying on this and the miners dont pay for the txfee on the more expensive chain, then you wont get the security. i prefer an approach where there are responsible NN operators who have the BTC funds and are making sure the notarizations are happening.

KMD is the only way I know of (currently) to get high security in small and medium coins without hardly any centralization. I'm trying to it w/o elected notaries. Elected notaries are semi-centralized w/ large benefits that any other design may not be able to achieve.  My interest was kicked off by BTG & BTG's interest was kicked off by KMD.  People see the idea of notarizations they know there is something important there.  BTC was meant to be a timestamp server, not a coin, even if SN did not view it this way. The coin should be viewed as being there only to pay for the timestamps that financial contracts like alts need. That's the future of Satoshi-style crypto (aka non-POS). I don't know why, but timestamps are everything.  Value flowing up from ideas like KMD, mine, & lightning to BTC via "fees in exchange for timestamps" is the only way BTC can survive on fees-only.  All the fighting in the crypto world is misplaced. Hodlers wanting BTC to be their personal ponzi scheme results in them hating alts.  But alts will save their ass and end the ponzi scheme in order to get stable value that rises only if the timestamp demand is there. BTC value can rise with alts collecting fees and sending them upstream to BTC, creating demand for space in BTC blocks paying up to 100% fees. Alts need only pay $0.06 per byte in 2MB block to supply BTC with 12.5  BTC per block indefinitely (at today's $10k/BTC). Hodlers can make BTC value rise, but value miners collect to defend against state attaacks depends entirely on others paying for timestamps. They can only pay in accordance to how much the world pays alts etc for fees on txs KMD is not incompatibale with what I'm trying.  Both systems may need each other. Due to KMD's centralization, mine can't be as fast.  But mine has other possbiilities like being a heirarchy, network, or ring of coins supporting each other and pegged to each other (if they want) w/o coins needing to give permission or change anything for the others.

as I understand the process of DEXP2P, the video files from the m3u has to be first downloaded to your system, and then has to be streamed with the same process as explained in video streaming, and sent to the p2p audience.

Hierarchy of notarizing is being investigated,   nothing stops the joining of two systems ( or the zawy system from being experimented on a smart chain) . Multichain notarization May be Avenue to investigate for further blockchain interoperability. With MoMoM we have some of that but this could be a way of linking together two MoMoM like systems.

we can also have the NN add to the data being notarized to use the same method as the zawy notarization

it is definitely not incompatible


[24-Feb-20 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
and the advantage is that all nodes are able to validate that some very high hash rate mining (actually doesnt matter what chain it is from) was done that proves the existence of a notarization tx in a merkleroot of a header

Hi @mobipoi #5774, #questions-and-feedback would  be a more suitable channel for feedback, and the #dev / #cc channels are a good place for discussing the tech you want to use.

@mobipoi People say the Komodo developed well but failed in marketing. But I think the Komodo has failed to develop. komodo has made development that no one needs and cares about. Komodo is a stubborn project that has extremely excluded productivity and efficiency.


[28-Feb-20 10:13 PM] Deleted User#0000
chainlink, which Komodo claimed to be technically defective, is being selected in the market. the only reason is that Komodo was wrong and that chainlink was right.

[29-Feb-20 12:45 AM] TonyL#3577
upd received files list on second node - just took some time. most probably that's because it's in totally another location :)

@jl777c  could you please advice is there any way to track file uploading progress at the moment to make a upload % progress bar with time estimation?
Otherwise it'll be not user friendly


[29-Feb-20 12:51 AM] jl777c#5810
i added "progress" field in DEX_stats, if it is there it means it is in the process of DEX_publish


[29-Feb-20 12:52 AM] gcharang#6833
@TonyL I'm still in the process of documenting the details, but here is some info
```
 when DEX_publish is issued, it broadcasts three types of datablobs
1) tagA == files , tagB == <file_name> - 1 datablob
2)  tagA == <file_name> , tagB == locators - 1 datablob
3) many datablobs with tagA == <file_name> , tagB == data
```
I guess you can look for the datablobs with `tagA == <file_name> , tagB == data` and count them


[29-Feb-20 12:52 AM] jl777c#5810
let me know if it works


[29-Feb-20 12:52 AM] TonyL#3577
> i added "progress" field in DEX_stats, if it is there it means it is in the process of DEX_publish 
thanks! will try it now


[29-Feb-20 12:53 AM] TonyL#3577
just will need to make uploading in separate thread so because now DEX_publish taking control until file is uploaded


[29-Feb-20 12:54 AM] TonyL#3577
thanks for advice @gcharang ! but response of `DEX_list 0 0 filename` is equal to size of uploaded file because it contains all blobs data inside so not effective unfortunately

am I need to copy selected for uploading file first to the same folder with komodod? 
I've tried to use absolute path to files but getting `'error': 'file not found'`


[29-Feb-20 02:15 AM] TonyL#3577
Let's say I have `/test.txt` file 

```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=TESTF DEX_upload "/test.txt"
{'result': 'error', 'error': 'file not found', 'filename': '/test.txt'}
```


[29-Feb-20 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
it searches the directory where you were when you launched


[29-Feb-20 02:24 AM] TonyL#3577
I see - will add a hack which copy selected for uploading file to the dir then rm it after uploading

no need

[01-Mar-20 10:11 PM] gcharang#6833
@bogybogy if you don't want to launch a smart chain, you can directly use the KMD chain for storing this opreturn data. see the OP_RETURN parameter of the sendtoaddress RPC: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-api/wallet.html#sendtoaddress>
as far as I understand your intention and the suggested solution, this will increase transparency and makes your word set in stone as well as verifiable (existence and time of creation)
but decentralization, not so much; as you are the only person who will hold the privkey and if any dispute arises, others need to come to you for resolution.
this is a step towards open ness leveraging blockchain but it isn't actually a decentralized system enforcing outcomes for real world events/items
which is mostly unsolved btw

@jl777c in your opinion, why the governments are suddenly starting to recognise Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency as equally "currency"?
They have been reluctant to accept it before. And now when the risk of economic fall is getting nearer by time, they have started accepting cryptocurrency as "currency".
So far I notice South Koria, India and some French nation to accept cryptocurrency as currency.
What could be the motive in such thought or acceptance change in your opinion?

> South Koria, India and some French nation to accept cryptocurrency as currency
I don't know about the rest. But in India, it in't that cryptos are now considered as currencies. 

Earlier, RBI (india's central bank) ordered lesser banks to not provide bank accounts to any businesses that deal/trade with cryptocurrencies. Their reason was that cryptos may pose a threat to the existing banking system and cause financial instability

Now, the Supreme court of india ruled that, the ban is arbitrary and RBI hasn't shown any evidence for their claims. As trading in any asset is a right, it can't be restricted arbitrarily. The trading can be regulated , but not banned. So now exchanges and other crpyto businesses can get a bank account in India (if a bank dares to allow it). I know of atleast 2 exchanges that got bank integration within a day

Is it possible to generate special wallets with CC?
like say add variables for when generating wallet to give it static lead numbers/predetermined amount of coins when generated?
through a consensus rule


[14-Mar-20 01:39 AM] jl777c#5810
a wallet doesnt usually exist onchain. it is just a privkey that is able to spend coins


[14-Mar-20 01:40 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are centrally creating "wallets" by issuing some fixed number of coins, that seems to achieve what you want to do


[14-Mar-20 01:40 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Yes I would be


[14-Mar-20 01:41 AM] BlackJesus#6161
i know there a tools to generate wallets but can paramters be added to these tools and recognized by the chain


[14-Mar-20 01:42 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure what you are trying to do. where do the coins come from?


[14-Mar-20 01:42 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I've got a good idea for using blockchain for part control but I would need to be able to control the lead numbers for organization and generate wallets that have predetermined amounts of coins in them


[14-Mar-20 01:42 AM] BlackJesus#6161
they would just be generate, because the sum of coins on this chain would be irrelevant


[14-Mar-20 01:42 AM] BlackJesus#6161
generated initially


[14-Mar-20 01:42 AM] jl777c#5810
can you just send a predetermined amount of coins to an address?


[14-Mar-20 01:43 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I'd like for that to be automated though


[14-Mar-20 01:43 AM] jl777c#5810
what would prevent someone from getting a zillion wallets?


[14-Mar-20 01:44 AM] BlackJesus#6161
essentially I would like to spin up a wallet and be able to control the first 3-4 characters of the wallet and put an amount of coins in the wallet


[14-Mar-20 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
faucet CC is somewhat like what you are asking


[14-Mar-20 01:44 AM] BlackJesus#6161
its part control in industry


[14-Mar-20 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
you can certainly constrain things to only go to addresses with specific prefix (suffix)


[14-Mar-20 01:44 AM] BlackJesus#6161
imagine you have a process on a part. We could use a wallet to respresent said part X.


[14-Mar-20 01:45 AM] BlackJesus#6161
As X comes in contact with machines they will perform transactions against the wallet of the part


[14-Mar-20 01:45 AM] BlackJesus#6161
to confirm the process is done


[14-Mar-20 01:45 AM] BlackJesus#6161
as well as verify if done correctly/incorrectly based on the amount sent to the wallet


[14-Mar-20 01:45 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe you want to use tokens for this?


[14-Mar-20 01:46 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Part X having a weld procedure done on it. if the process faults the machine has its own wallet and can be identified by the static characters that lead the wallet but it would also process a transaction in a specified amount if the part had 0 faults whilst in process or if it had a fault whilst in process


[14-Mar-20 01:47 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I've seen these systems in my industry ran by a centralized database and they are a mess


[14-Mar-20 01:48 AM] BlackJesus#6161
blockchain could facilitate this and make it much simpler as well as the overhead to run a chain is much lower than a database


[14-Mar-20 01:48 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I NEED to be able to control wallet generation though to produce static lead numbers when gernerating a wallet


[14-Mar-20 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
how about something like this:
0. represent the raw materials with fungible tokens
1. at each step that processes the raw material into some processed material, also have a different token for each variant
2. send tokens.0 -> process doing some step on it, which will then consume that token.0 and issue a token.1 to the next step


[14-Mar-20 01:50 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as each step is properly consuming and issuing new tokens, at any given time there is an accurate onchain representation of what is actually happened


[14-Mar-20 01:50 AM] BlackJesus#6161
welders could lead with lp, maybe another process leads with cp. But essentially the machines could check the blockchain of the part for a "total" to know all past previous processes were completed or if certain proceses failed based on the amount received.


[14-Mar-20 01:50 AM] jl777c#5810
you can put into the token description, whatever text description you want


[14-Mar-20 01:50 AM] BlackJesus#6161
ok


[14-Mar-20 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
using the consume token -> generate token model would then allow to see how many are in which state, there can be more than one output state. so you can have a consumed token.0 generate an error token.1, or a normal token.1


[14-Mar-20 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
there can be token.2, token.3, ... that consume higher and higher level tokens


[14-Mar-20 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
presumably at some factory there is a finished product that will also be represented by a product token, it would consume multiple tokens for all its internal parts and emit a finished product token


[14-Mar-20 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i think using the tokens is isomorphic to what you want to do with constrained amounts and addresses, but the tracking becomes easier this way


[14-Mar-20 01:55 AM] BlackJesus#6161
True, your way does make the tracking easier. But can we interface the machines with a block explorer and see these tokens. So on our end we could force the machines them to check against the balance before initating the procedure.


[14-Mar-20 01:56 AM] BlackJesus#6161
also do you have a write up on the token generation you're talking about so I can better undertstand how to inititate a chain that uses that.

assets is the Token marketplace


[14-Mar-20 01:57 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I need this system to be fungible and easily expandable though, because plants are always decommissioning/recommissioning/commissioning machines and having those static numbers leading the wallets makes it very easy to add more machines and classify them.


[14-Mar-20 02:01 AM] jl777c#5810
tokens are fungible


[14-Mar-20 02:02 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Is there anyway to control wallet generation though?


[14-Mar-20 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810
you can make remote queries to specially configured nodes to get token balance


[14-Mar-20 02:02 AM] CrisF#3405
THis is a good overview and tut `https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-tutorials/beginner-series-part-4.html#introduction`


[14-Mar-20 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810
depending on what you mean by a "wallet", that would determine the answer


[14-Mar-20 02:02 AM] BlackJesus#6161
the token idea is definitelly better than my sending an arbitrary amount based on outcomes.


[14-Mar-20 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810
the traditional "wallet" is just a privkey, there are 2^256 possible privkeys


[14-Mar-20 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810
all of them valid wallets


[14-Mar-20 02:03 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I just want to be able to control some of the lead characters of the public key


[14-Mar-20 02:03 AM] BlackJesus#6161
and generate them in sequence


[14-Mar-20 02:03 AM] jl777c#5810

@jl777c  I have a suggestion on present elections, If we can categorize some positions on each region ( like 4-5 positions each region) should allocate to persons who provide value to our KMD ecosystem, which encourages the community bring some new talent(core developers). (we have 4 NN positions for dev as of now).

1) Developer is must for that position ( this solves most of our lack of developers)
2) Should create meaningful project by next year
3) People should poll them as best project
4)Community moderation is must for every position.

Reason:  This way we are defining standards to NN Postions

Some positions are just like sleeper cells, They just active whenever we have elections fever. we need more and more dedicated developers around KMD ecosystem not partimers. we see only handfull of the developers who work with Jl777.

@Nabob | $ARRR people are mostly unhappy with existing 4 dev nodes, as well as NN dependency on core team. NNs should decentralized by any meaning, including not being dependent on KMD team

ppl unhappy in many aspects we cant solve or address all those issues. komodo creating funds more than 70 percent of mining funds for NN nodes. those notary nodes have much more responsibility to give back to the komodo community. my suggestion is with in decentralized voting system, but instead blindly selecting nodes with their voting power -- i was asking to put constraints/competion for some nodes on each region like dedicated developers.  @kolo 

this way if we can able to bind like 30% developers, we can have more productivity.

more efffort + more dedication = more productivity


[22-Mar-20 03:27 AM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530

Keep in mind that the main-responsibility and job of a NN is providing BTC level security - our team is targeting the creation of a global "todo-list" where NNs could pull and resolve (at least) one or more tasks per season NN. In our internal discussion we didn't want to "force" for it though but either reward NNs with a NN score boost (as long as the operations are 'acceptable') or grant other privileges.

I want to explain why we are interested in idea of central exchanges. We need escrow services in Version 2 for Marmara for manual settlements. We discussed with @jl777c the use of physical notary offices, Post Offices, Credit Unions and even bank branches. I think many small exchanges acting as local escrows which settles down credit loops would be very helpful. They will be acting as small TRUST centers. They can be established everywhere in the world. But of course, those trust centers should be responsible against hacking and any damage. The main idea is to have many small exchanges. You can think of OTC point with a small community. Of course, such a tool should be open source so that there may be many escrow services. Irresponsible trust centers should be somehow banned and not be able conduct the services any more. The idea may be developed more. I saw some open source exchange systems already.  We can choose one of them to start with. Or several alternatives may be developed.  @Paro has already 2 persons in the team experienced with php. But we should not be addicted to one language only. We have not started coding Version 2 in MCL yet. The idea of escrow services made of those many small exchanges may be integrated into Marmara CC coding. @dimxy 
The idea is to code the multilaw protocol into a system with many exchanges as TRUST points. @CrisF What is your opinion?

Economy was much better during the 6 months banking crisis in 1970s of Ireland. They used almost the same idea of Marmara Credit Loops where small communities were responsible for settlements at the maturity dates of promissory notes. Those many small exchanges will be TRUST points exactly same. They are not central exchanges any more. They are community exchanges.

While while the banks were closed, risk of default on the cheques was shouldered by neighbourhood pubs.

I was just pondering on a way to tie this into the PBaaS developments, with the multi-coin reserves, enabling the Credit Loops to gain liquidity through trustless conversions to and from PBaaS chains. That would allow any crypto holder to easily access Credit Loops without going through an escrow first.

That is good idea, too. That will work with Version 1 without any problem since it is based on 100% collateralization any way. But I want to remind something for Version 2. Version 2 is a real money creation business exactly same as in banking system. Therefore, the nonredemption problem cannot be solved without a TRUST mechanism.


[29-Mar-20 05:56 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
I'll have to do some reading up on Marmara. But at first glance an exchange utilizing (among other mechanisms) the PBaaS multi-currency bridges could act as such a TRUST mechanism for version 2. But I need to read up first, before I even know if this even makes any sense. Maybe there's an easier / more logical way to do that.

One of the biggest issues in alternative currencies ( pre-crypto) was the self-issuance of credit by the ‚Äúbank‚Äù itself .   Basically the ‚Äúbank‚Äù only had a limited amount of services to provide, so their credit/debt ratio gets all messed up leading to devaluation of the currency compared to what it is pegged against.  Tip:  restrict the ‚Äúbank‚Äù ability to self-issue, it exacerbates the Gresham law effect when compared with it‚Äôs real fiat base

Sell-issuing similar to banking occurs among people as p2p credit creation by means of post-dated cheques in many countries. It is a trust based system in nature. Marmara Version 1 was possible due to 100% collateralization. But in reality, post-dated cheques and promissory notes are trust based. Credit creation itself is not the source of the problem. Credit creation is the practice of human being for 5000 years as written by David Graeber in ‚Äú5000 years in Debt History‚Äù Book. What makes bank credits a big problem is the interest bank credits bear. The simple math behind that is explained in the brief story by Louis Even. https://www.michaeljournal.org/articles/social-credit/item/the-money-myth-exploded

[29-Mar-20 07:53 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
The fiat currency system is actually deflationary rather than inflationary due to interests embedded into debt based money. It sucks the wealth of people through the interest. A total of 100 Units of Fiat money is created but asked back as 100+X. That X is not produced by anyone in Economy. In post-dated cheques (p2p credit creation), 100 units are created but that is destroyed at the date of maturity.

Bank credit does not circulate but post-dated Cheques circulate in credit loops.


[29-Mar-20 08:10 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Bank credit circulation depends on the the model used,  in commercial trade system they are more or less equal participants.  Will only lira be collateralized or will ‚Äúextended‚Äù credit be allowed? ( like a lien on accounts receivable) .   That may be the difference with mcl and the commercial trade exchanges I see out there now ).  Still will have a slight issue with full parity,  got to pay taxes / bills in the National currency which requires transactions and transformation which does cost some.  I guess that is my next question, Is the holding bank charging a fee for transformation of mcl back into lira?

[29-Mar-20 08:48 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
As I understand the main reason for escrow is to make sure there is no identity theft. A KYC-attestation to a digital ID would enable you to not use centralized entities and use decentralized mechanisms without loosing trust. This gives people the freedom to choose their own trusted KYC-authority and reduce the risks that inherent to centralized exchanges.


[29-Mar-20 10:01 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I need to look at how identity theft problem is solved in trustless manner but that is only one reason.
Let me ask like this. Suppose there is a postdated cheque dated with maturity of 1.1.2021. Would you accept such a credit from somone that you have no trust? You are right. Identity is very important. But suppose that identity has no money at the day of 1.1.2021 in his wallet or bank account. In case of nonredemption, that person should not be able to create/Associate his identity by opening a new wallet/account. He/she should be blacklisted. The problem is very complex. We would be really very happy if you can suggest a trustless way. The first Version has therefore 100% collateralization. But in reality, maybe collateralization is 0% at the issuance date. The most important one is the payment date. It is a trust based system.


[29-Mar-20 10:28 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
The oracle could check on any non-redeemable loops at the due date, linked to that ID and based on result, accept or deny the the creation of a new loop. That would mean that an ID can create 1000s of new wallets/addresses, no new loops would be accepted.
In case the person in question creates a new ID, it should then be protocol that a KYC-provider checks the status of previous attestations for this person. This could be done by allowing KYC-providers to check the hash of a specific unique detail of the KYC-data (eg ID-card number, social security number) with other trusted KYC-providers. If they receive one acknowledgement that this detail is known, the attestation should be declined.


[29-Mar-20 10:30 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
KYC always involves some kind of trust. Even if I show you my national ID-card, you still have to trust that it is from a legitimate source, issued without errors (and I've seen those on official IDs) and no forgery.


[29-Mar-20 10:36 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
In Escrow case, those trust based KYC providers should also manage manualsettlement processes. Therefore, KYC Providers are exchange points. They may be even physical notary offices which are very common in some countries. You may find several in one district. That is good business for communities.


[29-Mar-20 10:42 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
For manual settlement I don't see any way around those exchange points.


[29-Mar-20 10:46 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Those exchange points can even be used to 'renew' the KYC-attestations at every contact, building towards a 'virtue' system, so legitimate users build up credibility.

> Those exchange points can even be used to 'renew' the KYC-attestations at every contact, building towards a 'virtue' system, so legitimate users build up credibility.
@ùôäùôûùô£ùô† 
That is the idea. Currently banks do that. They do not issue check books to everyone. They do not issue cheque books to people who are in blacklist. Especially nodes in the middle can query the issuers whether they are  blacklisted since they do not know the initial creator/issuer of a credit.


[29-Mar-20 11:29 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
As long as the issuer is publicly verifyable KYCd (an attestation should be rendered invalid as soon as a credit cannot be settled) the credit is trustworthy. I can see cases where somebody builds up some level of credibility, creates a large number of credits and exits, though.
Post-dating cheques and defaulting on it is legally regulation in some countries. I think it will be important to have those laws extended to MCL as well...

@banks  

Marmara Credit Loops with especially Version 2 meet the most necessary requirements if not all for Decentralized Finance most of which is credit creation as mere function of banking system. We need to somehow embed credit Loops into a good GUI. It would be wonderful to see them inside AtomicDEX but it may be a goal displacement since it will be very specific. Our team is working on a separate GUI which I believe meet most requirements for DeFi. But as I said, an excellent DeFi is only possible with the real credit creation, main function of banks. That means Marmara Version 2 which has the potential to transfer all post-dated cheques, Bonds, Promissory Notes, Credits etc into blockchain.

or just take `locktime` number and add `2629800` to it, if it is less than current unix timestamp it hasn't been claimed. This only works on the most recent inputs. looking at older txids that have already been claimed won't make sense

If volume is larger than n then decreasse blocktime to lets say 5 minutes and divide blockreward from lets say 10 to 5 to still have same amount of coins on average getting created into supply. When the volume than decreasses revert back to 10 min block time and 10 btc reward per block.

Howdy jl777, happy friday. I‚Äôm working on a mm2 ideas.

This one is less easy, would it be possible to have mm2 integrate with Antara transactions?
Scenario:
Antara module for items for sale, tx contains the listing details.
A marketmaker sets a flag (in a protocol layer addon) with the txid of the Antara module, for this item.
As the atomic swap proceeds, tx hashes and uuid info is recorded into related Antara module transactions.

If too complicated, I guess  it can be an ‚ÄúNFT‚Äù for a real item, but an Antara module for this specifically can contain all swap details of both sides...?


[10-Apr-20 07:38 AM] Mylo#8306
The mm2 devs, particularly @artemciy_dice mentions protocol layers (as rust traits) to add functionality & @artem.pikulin has a generous offer on his NN proposal to give guidance on such mm2 integrations.


[10-Apr-20 07:39 AM] Mylo#8306
Is this some of the dev outreach visions for the next few years?


[10-Apr-20 07:54 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
> @artemciy_dice mentions protocol layers

To give some context: The layer we're putting directly on top of the dexp2p transport, in the caretaker prototype I'm working with, is the embedded SQLite database. dexp2p makes it a master-master-master* one. This makes the decentralized nature of the technology much more transparent and easier to play with. A developer can experiment with angles of attack by modifying the database with a usual "update" or an "insert" and see if the network will accept or reject it. That replicated SQLite layer is working already ( https://gitlab.com/artemciy/mm-pubsub-db/-/blob/2f7c75c7/373-p2p-order-matching.md#replication-demos ), between two caretaker nodes right now and by the end of this week - between the three of them. We're also already using this layer to gather swap statistics for the AtomicDEX mobile UI ( https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/584762059430821909/688691606173384742 ) and soon (like, next week) - for order book and order matching UIs.


[10-Apr-20 07:57 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Also caretaker prototype is organized roughly as an ECS (Entity Component System) - instead of a single protocol we're building an ecosystem of protocols, where protocol upgrades are easily achievable as subsystem forks. I have a pool of ideas for such experimental protocols at https://gitlab.com/artemciy/mm-pubsub-db/-/blob/master/373-p2p-order-matching.md#gossip-use-cases


[10-Apr-20 06:05 PM] Mylo#8306
Wow so much info. Couple of the links in gossip use case section 404 but no biggie.

I was over this article and I ask my self what chances we can have that a project in crypto build something so strong


[27-Apr-20 09:33 PM] bogybogy#3962
At the moment if we look around crypto projects we can see only few, cardano algorand  tezos and Komodo,all other projects got many scientists involved


[29-Apr-20 02:06 AM] mobipoi#5774
Correct me if this isn't viable, the idea is the temporary reduction on KMD interest to 4 or 3% % and use the difference to fund immediate expense such as server cost to get the DEX up and running or other recurring cost that will help bring project to life while it in the early phase , this can be seen as a ecosystem investment proposal another one is having a *donatate button" in the wallet  next to the claim button, users can tjen click donate in place of claim interest this can be done without a proposal or can be, but the interest reduction can be done in form of vote , it would be great to see more community engagement through voting and not just survey or announcement, allowing actually holders to have a stake in how the eco sys can grow please share your thoughts on the Idea

The DEX doesnt need servers as each user runs his/her own node.

i think he is saying that if there is a permanent 51% attack then the longest chain wont be notarized and new nodes will be confused by it. which indeed would cause a problem if there is a sustained permanent 51% attack. certainly BTC using pure PoW with the majority of hashrate on earth is the most secure. For smaller chains that dont have such large hashrate, dPoW is a very practical system. Also, notary nodes do anchor to the bitcoin blockchain, which means the BTC notarization data is indeed used as these notaries are the ones that are proposing notarizations. this point he seems to ignore


[01-May-20 01:38 AM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr dPoW isnt perfect, but it seems to be the best practical way to add security to a chain in the absence of giant hashrate.


[01-May-20 01:46 AM] Alexfrog#1338
yeah, his diagrams of the attack are always: "Chain A gets notorized onto the bitcoin blockchain.  Then longer chain B is built.  Then nodes start accepting chain B as the longest, and notorizing it"

Cutting edge tech is always needed to keep going ahead. To be sustainable, however it must be supported by a wide base of those end user products (like a pyramid, sorry for the silly metaphor). The revenue from the general user base funds the work of top skilled people.

I pay my respects to the Komodo team, who has walked silently so far. as a long-time Komodo fan, I hope you can choose and focus instead of trying to be good at everything. I'll be looking forward to seeing Komodo continue to develop.

If I were to use oraclesCC to store the contents of json data (DATA) and  stored with it, its hashed value (HASH).
I then want to create an index of HASH like addressindex so HASHes can be searched.

Is this buildable and where is the best starting spot to look at how indexes are created and searched in Komodo?

There are 3 theories described, which the author describes front running on page 8.
This is somewhat mitigated in kmd by the notary nodes mining 75% of blocks?

There‚Äôs a bunch of maths, maybe it is decipherable for use in further dPoW marketing?

NN easy mining requires to compromise the NN to conduct a mining attack and since we already rely on NN, it doesnt increase the attack surface. basically as long as majority of NN are not compromised, it is extremely difficult (impractical) to attack. which is probably why we have not seen any successful attacks against dPoW

Now that you are stepping back and taking a well deserved break from the drivers seat, what are the plans for the coins like supernet, crypto777, revs, tumbler, jl777hodl etc.
I feel the longer they sit in limbo the more they decline in value, and we can see there is little to no liquidity in these market's.
Is it possible  to just distribute/liquidate them now and pass them over to us holders so we can make our own decision to sell or hodl before they lose further value?

McAfee has just superimposed himself upon the crypto-privacy sector with 'Ghost' zk-SNARKS coin.

He also has a functional Atomicdex on his platform ... McAfeeDEX

Whatever happened with the 'NIX‚Äôs privacy protocol, the Ghost Protocol' ... which apparently allowed for an "intermediary swap" for trading over AtomicDEX. 
CIRCA AUG 2019 - The first privacy coin swap between NIX and KMD

Why is mcCafee able to do z-tx's over his atomicdex and not us ?
What are our superior strengths in ARRR and how best do we exploit them to counter his claim to be the complete privacy coin?

The question to ask is if the McAfee DEX is fully decentralized or not. If there's some centralized part it will be taken down eventually.

Our community is currently testing subatomic swaps, that allow private swaps with Z transactions. Those are not standard swaps like we have in AtomicDEX. I doubt it is even possible to do a normal atomic swap with z transactions.

dIco is still viable, I see nothing wrong with it, it is a very unique approach which is there for any project developers to take.
Atomicdex is pretty much leading the way in atomic swaps
dpow actually works unlike veriblocks and the other solutions

im certain that if komodo used the same false promises, shilling, throwing around hype words, announcements and the rest of it like other projects, that it too would be "successful", but that doesnt seem to be what komodo is aiming for.

Thanks @CHMEX  @Audo ... I am just wanted some reassurance that those assets will not just wither away and die a lonely existence, 2017 last payment (3 years) is this the new standard ? Or is it just that there was not enough 'reward' to make it worthy. It be nice to kept updated somewhere on each of these projects that were individually invested into, not just a blanket response/update, it would go a long way to maintain enthusiasm and support.

most of the assets just depend on DEX (atomicDEX), this has its own project team and nothing has changed about it, other than it is the main focus for the team. CHIPS is one of the few that doesnt benefit from DEX, and it is approaching user testing. so not sure why you think thing will "wither away and die a lonely existence"

@Deleted User i dont measure success by marketcap as you seem to obsess over. we will continue to develop tech that solves issues in crypto, like security (dPoW is a success), scaling (50+ chains already in existence is a success), speed (dexp2p achieves thousands of crypto secured packet per second, another success), smartchains (projects like MCL, kogs, shows that very complex logic can be built right into the chain, yet another success)

Successful GUI-fying is all about solving a real and existing problem that customers are having and solving it better (easier, faster, with less effort, less money) than their existing solution to that same problem. The issue with cutting edge tech is often that it solves something that customers do not yet perceive as a problem. Another issue is timing, where the solution must come out & be available just as this perception of a problem emerges and before the customers are asked to change too much of their existing behavior (as that creates another hurdle to adoption).

>  I have a question about Antara framework,  how is it protected from spam(dos) code?

you are looking at this through the lens of ETH. on a ETH chain, anyone can launch arbitrary smart contracts. so, they need to penalise large computations(/loops) with gas.

In a komodo smart chain, the antara modules are part of the source code and not the blockchain.  so, other than the people who launched the chain(+ the community), no one else can add extra code. this is just like asking how do we prevent `getnewaddress` from having infinite loops?

Hmm, maybe @gcharang knows where to find tech docs on the ETH part of swaps.  @cryptopleb, you can ask the devs who are directly working on this in #ü§ù‚îÇdex-mobile.


[26-May-20 03:50 AM] gcharang#6833
@cryptopleb if you can understand solidity contracts, this is the one used for swaps involving ETH/ERC20: <https://github.com/artemii235/etomic-swap>
technically, the algorithm is the same whether the swap is between utxo-coin/eth or eth/erc20 or utxo-coin/utxo-coin. you can read about it here: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/atomicdex.html#introducing-taker-and-maker>

Would it be possible for notarization to be done by miners after PoW as the final step required to earn the block reward?


[28-May-20 04:04 PM] CoffeeMonger#4070
I guess it could cause a lot of small forks.


[28-May-20 06:16 PM] CoffeeMonger#4070
To clarify I mean in lieu of using notary nodes at all.


[28-May-20 11:10 PM] gcharang#6833
@CoffeeMonger notarization requires the notaries to spend BTC to create transactions on the BTC chain. there is no good(reliable) method to incentivise normal miners to do it


[28-May-20 11:25 PM] CoffeeMonger#4070
I have some questions about that @gcharang . Wouldn't the block reward more than cover the TX fee?


[28-May-20 11:26 PM] gcharang#6833
if it is KMD alone, as it is an established chain, its block reward might compensate the BTC transactions, then, what about other chains being secured dPoW ?


[28-May-20 11:29 PM] CoffeeMonger#4070
They could do it how ever they prefer. Some could use notary nodes. Some could notarize to KMD which would be cheaper than doing it on the BTC chain.


[28-May-20 11:32 PM] CoffeeMonger#4070
You could set up a chain that notarizes to KMD but doesn't require any TX fees. Anyone could notarize to that for free.


[28-May-20 11:39 PM] CoffeeMonger#4070
If it worked it would be less centralized.


[28-May-20 11:39 PM] CoffeeMonger#4070
I wonder though if multiple miners notarized valid blocks to the same block if it would mess up using SPV using Merkel Roots to verify TXs.


[28-May-20 11:42 PM] CoffeeMonger#4070
I guess you have the same problem now if a block gets notarized then isn't included in what later becomes the longest chain.


[28-May-20 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
relying on an unreliable process for chain security is not a good idea. komodod dPoW process uses a practical distribution of notarization powers that has high aggregate reliability without centralization. it isnt fully decentralized, but if it was then only financial incentives for each block would incentivize miners. and it is very likely for there to be undesired incentives as we see with on/off mining, minority attacks and even 51% attacks.


[28-May-20 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if something is free, what prevents massive spam to saturate the chain?


[28-May-20 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
if a block is notarized, that defines what the longest notarized chain is, so it avoids the case you mention

Thank you for your reply. You said that it wasn't a good idea to rely on an unreliable process. Is that because you think it is inherently unreliable or that it just has no vetting.


[29-May-20 12:02 AM] CoffeeMonger#4070
Are you saying miners are unreliable or just miners having to notarize their blocks?


[29-May-20 12:16 AM] jl777c#5810
what happens if no miners decide to notarize?


[29-May-20 12:16 AM] jl777c#5810
then the entire notarization security is stopped


[29-May-20 12:17 AM] jl777c#5810
which means there needs to be some significant financial subsidy to ensure miners are always incentivized to notarize. in such case, the subsidy cost needs to compete against all other possible mining revenues and when miners are currently maximizing ROI in realtime by switching between coins... how can you ensure a steady stream of BTC notarizations?


[29-May-20 12:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can figure this out, you are much smarter than me

@t_dan Because zcoin and zcash are already available in AtomicDEX, so it looks like the challenge of including privacy coins into atomic swaps has already been solved? So then PirateChain should also follow, right?

I‚Äôm a former coin developer looking to start a new project. What‚Äôs the best way to include Komodo‚Äôs notarization features in it? I am not interested in launching as a Komodo chain unless there is funding that can be applied for. At this point in time I prefer a bitcoin source code fork that includes Komodo notarization enhancements.


[10-Jun-20 07:39 PM] n64#1985
I was responsible for buying in to the integration on GAMEcredits so I am familiar with the seasonal updates that are needed. I‚Äôm no longer with that project and that project is migrating to erc-20


[10-Jun-20 10:00 PM] gcharang#6833
> I am not interested in launching as a Komodo chain
we call them "Smart Chains". I'm not sure how much you know about them, but they aren't like sidechains or childchains or whatever else. You launch a completely independant chain that doesn't have any relation to the KMD chain other than the source code. You and your community can control this source code and make any changes you wish because it is an independent chain. the only link to the KMD chain is if you opt into dPoW, to which you seem to have no objection.

take a look at the hush and verus projects. they are source code forks of komodo and add many features that aren't present in the main codebase. their only link is that, they receive any critical security updates etc., via git pull and merge and they are both protected by dPoW

also, there is already a framework in the komodo codebase that allows smart contract like functionality. the main difference from ETH is that, the chain will only run trusted "contracts", the "contract" code is in the daemon and not in the blockchain

> At this point in time I prefer a bitcoin source code fork that includes Komodo notarization enhancements
if you still want a plain bitcoin source fork with dPoW, you might want to look at the chips codebase or talk with dukeleto. he had a doc explaining all the changes needed to enable dPoW in a BTC fork, but I'm failing to find it right now

Edit: Found it! <https://github.com/leto/mastering_komodo_dpow/blob/master/mastering_komodo_dpow.md> not sure how current it is, but it should have all the basic info

Thanks @gcharang - I am familiar with the actual code to get implemented, I guess I was more curious on the process side of things - when game was integrated, each notary had to run a node and the project paid some amount to cover Komodo transaction fees on the notarization funds. Has that changed?
I‚Äôm considering a fork of gamecredits to Komodo asset chain but no idea what that entails, and at the same time I‚Äôm looking at a brand new coin that simply utilizes the same enhancements that I brought to game in the first place

it's the same now.

my intuition is that, compared to adding KMD features into GAME, it will be a lot easier to add GAME features into komodo

@n64 What are the enhancements from Game that you need, as it may be that Komodo has it already? 
Basically Komodo assetchain is like you have a fork of KMD but you use the same code and no modifications necessary. Also you can fork KMD if you want if you have changes that must be done but they won't be done on KMD (like Verus, Hush ...).


[11-Jun-20 07:50 AM] n64#1985
@Mihailo @gcharang  there are no enhancements per se in the codebase of GAME that are needed. I'm thinking more along the lines of there's already some community there and that allows some level of distribution of the new coin


[11-Jun-20 07:56 AM] n64#1985
this is why the fork aspect of it is pretty low priority... I'm happy to start w/ a completely fresh community

it should be in the current codebase, you need to pass in the right parameters. though maybe the actual implementation is still in one of the research branches

the concept is to make a bi-directional burn protocol

I store my KOMODO on the Agama Wallet (v0.3.2a-beta). I haven't logged in for very long time. Now, I get an error message that says to try another server. The SPV server list has two choices. Neither one works. I have my KMD wallet address, but don't have the ability to send my coins to another address. Any suggestions? Thanks


[24-Jun-20 01:05 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@trkohl  Agama has been deprecated for awhile. Use one of the other wallets in our ecosystem.  https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/?wpv-wallet_category=desktop&wpv_aux_current_post_id=287&wpv_view_count=297-TCPID287

@jl777c do you consider komodo tech completed ? Or do you do see some aspect yet to be developped ? (im not taking about debugging / desinging stuff)


[29-Jun-20 07:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if I may express my mind on this question:
I consider the current Komodo tech as first earliest tech version which works with each other nicely enough to make a smart blockchain based application.
It has all the pieces so far identified and required as per ideas emerged to solve problems like interoperability, customisable blockchain architecture depending on the needs of making a decentralised applications, solutions to scale with blockchain clusters if in future required, and unbeatable blockchain related security aspects covered which assures the Komodo tech stack if not the only then one of the superior technologies offered in cryptocurrency industry.

The efforts and code that James has written in over half a decade for Komodo technology is being improved further by the other developers in the team. Like any other industry, the state of any business is not static or can be treated as finished. And so is the state of Komodo technology. It will never finish, but keep improving as time goes by. As the project and ecosystem will face new challenges or will see possible other solutions in industry which can be offered by Komodo technology, those I believe will be adopted by Komodo tech and made available to the developers and users. It is a constant process.

[03-Jul-20 09:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Doesn‚Äôt this also mean that any public key less than the generator point is a burn address , as 1 being the minimum number to multiply by the generator point?


[03-Jul-20 11:09 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure how to know if the privkey is of any specific value, given a pubkey. outside of the all 0 pubkey


[03-Jul-20 11:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I guess a way of rephrasing it,  must a private key always be an integer?  Or can private keys be fractional, like the number  1.2

[07-Jul-20 07:31 AM] Strob#3417
Under 0.004 is considered zero but we still mine some since  a part of the block we mine always contain free tx (zero fee) no?

I don't think governments around world have realized what CBDC means yet. 
If CBDC is issued, Bitcoin and other blockchain projects will have more presence. 
CBDC issuance is unlikely if government recognizes destructive nature of atomic swap.

let's say you're dealing with someone who can't use china's yuan CBDC. chinese with a yuan CBDC can pay tokens locked with his CBDC password instead of the yuan CBDC. token is the same as yuan for Chinese with CBDC wallets, so the foreigner can collect the token and pay it to other chinese. Chinese, who received the token, unencrypts locked yuan and moves it into their own wallets. In eyes of the chinese authorities, yuan is perceived as a deal between chinese people who have nothing to do with it. this is because transactions with foreigners in middle do not leave any trace on yuan's CBDC trading record.

It may be that chinese authorities have yet to seriously consider a contract deal using CBDC's cryptography system. even if they don't issue wallets to foreigners, yuan's CBDC could be a means of trading, and as a result, china's central bank will not be able to track all transactions made with the CBDC. but it won't take long to realize this, so it's reasonably predictable that central banks won't be able to choose CBDCs easily.

it always occurred to me that an established old school centralized gambling outfit would be open to the idea of having first mover advantage and taking this open source to develop a new product on it- there are many internet casinos around, so the probability that one of them sees that advantage should be rather high...
I am convinced that although this is decentralized and goes against the current business model of online poker rooms, a very profitable business case can be made out of this- the issue is just to systematically reach out to those casinos...
For years, there has been talk about that one trailblazer use case as a door opener for the whole  ecosystem, but somehow none of the team strategists have deemed it worth paying attention to this potential door kicker of a use case

if aPoW is implemented to CHIPS, no need for any other solution to implement to it, like verus-hash. aPoW is more than sufficient solution and as last time explored, easier to implement than verus-hash, if I understood these things correctly.

@jl777c  "komodo isnt centralized around me anymore. this makes it much stronger", but the Dex is if I am correct?  And the Dex is essentially tied to KMDs demand, and you control how the Dex earnings are distributed using such to buy kmd, unless it is  automated dividend why not make one now that way the system is truly free

Hi @jl777c  - Hope you're well.  Maybe you can help me elaborate some answers for the end of this article and help me to refine my answer. 
Based on this tweet, I feel comfortable up to the New nodes vs. Old nodes part.  
https://twitter.com/sethisimmons/status/1285690668195762178?s=20 

`Trusting Nodes Vs. Mining.`
I can start with simply cost challenges may someday change this (It's EXPENSIVE to run a notary node), and it is something I have thought about bringing to the devs attention if it makes sense.  A KMD price surge could create a reduction at the code level for Notary rewards/mining advantages.  My guess as to why it hasn't come up is possibly because (A) the price has been historically low and node operator costs are high, the community understands and accepts this to date and/or (B) It hasn't been needed or considered a flaw, but I can respect the arguments to be made for bringing the mining rewards back into the favor of miners, especially if the price surges, while still ensuring one of the random 64 nodes gets to drop that TX hash of the KMD data into the BTC chain.

For the Nodes, the keyword being Random, they all run pretty much the same hardware and there is no set order that they get blocks in.  They do not have the ability to change or censor transactions, they only have the ability to perform the extra function of backing up this data to a ZipDrive (This is my favorite dPoW analogy).  This was recently proven by the Agama wallet hack resolution.  TLDR, The nodes and devs couldn't perform any actions other than outhacking the hacker to try and save users funds.   dPoW, Notary Nodes, and anything else people claim is centralized about KMD couldn't stop it.  If they could have, then simply having notaries pause or censor all the hackers transactions would have saved JL777 a bunch of coin (He paid out most losses from his pocket, whatever the team couldn't save).  The friend being your password multi-sig is a poor analogy, at no fault of Justin's of course.  I think a better metaphor is nodes being parking garage attendants/security.  They see/interact with all the cars but only perform a single set of functions and cannot drive the cars.

As to trust, you must always verify and all the code is open source as well as the activity being verifiable.  Compromising the nodes wouldn't be a scenario I see possible, and even if it was, see above for limitations of doing that.  Imagine 64 XMR community members having this responsibility not just by choice, but also at the election of the coin holders.  I think you will understand the challenge presented.  It is not a preset group. 50% of the Nodes are voted in every year.  Only developers get 4 designated nodes, 28 are retained if they desire based on top performance and the other 32 are replaced annually.
PirateChain picked up 3 nodes last year in an election process.  They retained one based performance this year and had to get re-elected for the other 2 if they wanted them, which they did.


[21-Jul-20 03:44 PM] FishyGuts#5085
As to Checkpoints, The Komodo solution is more like a zip drive than a bitcoin checkpoint.  By this I mean, it's not up to the code or KMD to decide, it's just a ZIP drive of data to be used as/if needed.   It is used in reverse to how bitcoin implemented it.  It is being used as a data security feature, and not for optimization. 
Additionally, it focuses on interoperability, and not just to be available for UTXO based chains.  Pretty sure Monero could be dPoW'd now, not that it wholly needs to but a ZIP Drive was successful in it's day for a reason.  This said, it only provides data, not a rollback or automatic solution.  

As to the Rest, I am not knowledgeable enough to answer those questions accurately, but I have submitted your questions and this article for more advanced minds to review.

There's an imaginary scenario of nodes ignoring a notarization as the basis for one of the 'flaws'.

It may not be perfect because of 64 nodes needing to exist, but that is te design. its the best for low hash chains. New notary networks can be spun up to nota to kmd, without cost. Eg labs

First of all thank you for writing that article, it is the 1st article that I read about dPoW & it helped me understand a lot about dPoW. But after 1 year operating a NN, I do have some concerns: 
> dPoW does not mine/generate blocks, so Notary Nodes cannot act as attackers in a 51% attack
but NN are eligible to easy-mining, a collusion between several NN certainly lead to a 51% attack
> Why it‚Äôs a lose-lose situation for a Notary Node to act against dPoW
what if they are already in a lose situation & there are nothing to lose or nothing to gain ? This is what happened during the last weeks of last season where ~20 NN stopped notarizing on 3rd party coins.
> Myth 1. Notary Nodes is a Centralized Solution
there are 64 NN, but from my observation, with the current implementation of iguana, notarizations are not equally spread but tends to centralize around a pack of well connected nodes, & sometimes it leads to situation where a single NN submitting bad (spent) inputs & it can disrupt the entire notarization activity, it happened at least once last season, once last week & can happen again.
Overall imo JEhrenhofer made some points & the bottom line it's all about trust in the NN, or at least the majority of them being honest.
But with the current implementation of iguana that favoured well connected nodes with low latency, I feel like if some malicious actor manage to gather 13 NN keys, it's enough to conduct some sort of attacks, just my 2 cents.


[21-Jul-20 11:22 PM] Mylo#8306
64 - 20 still leaves 40+ to notarize. It is why there are 64.

The bad inputs that disrupt, yes this is an area to improve.

Well connected nodes, yes some concentration to certain nodes, but not centralized.

Decentralization as a scale, and not an absolute. There is always a point of failure. Elec, network, source code. But there'll be bigger problem than notarizing.

Dpow2 will fix well connected node syndrome using the dexp2p message system.  Probably bad input disruption as well.  Imo a matter of drawing on a whiteboard and running some simulation/emulation.


[21-Jul-20 11:23 PM] Mylo#8306
For a solution dpow v1 solved the low hashrate problem.

V2 will improve the edge cases of potential failure.


[21-Jul-20 11:36 PM] gcharang#6833
> but NN are eligible to easy-mining, a collusion between several NN certainly lead to a 51% attack

only on the KMD chain. and the KMD chain has external hashrate too. more than 40 independent entities is a lot better than 4 mining pools with 95% hash power


[21-Jul-20 11:41 PM] PHBA2061 | VietStaking Validator#2530
yes, the point I was trying to make is 51% attack on KMD chain is certainly possible if some NN colluded together, contrario to what grewalsatinder wrote in his article

& about FishyGuts questions
> If they could have, then simply having notaries pause or censor all the hackers transactions would have saved JL777 a bunch of coin (He paid out most losses from his pocket, whatever the team couldn't save).
imo this is not viable (no matter if tx can be censored or not), in the sense that you won't be able to differentiate the hacker's tx & users' tx, because it's a seed/WIF hack.

each node uses the valid notarizations it has seen to reject any alternate chain that violates it. so it is an automatic decentralized checkpointing system. if evil notaries submit false notarizations, it gets rejected, so it seems not a real issue.

the only real issue that appears to be is that a set of evil notaries in combination with majority of hashrate, could enhance the mining ROI by invalidating other miners non-notarized blocks. this is not a double spend issue if you are following the rule to wait for notarizations, so it would only affect mining ROI. granted at very high values of KMD, that alone might cause detrimental issues.

so, we are already working on dpow2, which will create a continuously updating set of notaries (avoiding the lame duck notary timeframes) and also solving the clumping of  notary signers.

tl:dr dPoW isnt perfect, but it is the best system ever created to allow low hash rate chains to be very secure

I have known Komodo Proyect for many years. I admire the team's work in R & D & I (e.g. jl777)

I've recently re-read in-depth about Delayed Proof of Work (dPoW) (for nex DpoW2 ) and its uses by other UTX0 blockchains to prevent 51% attacks using the Bitcoin network.

I wanted to ask, if the komodo team knows the Dash ChainLocks technology to prevent 51% attacks (PoW network like bitcoin).
I think that with this technology the security they offer with the Komodo's Blockchain Security Service can be interesting, cheap & better.

From komodo devs team: Have they considered study ChainLocks technology and making a PoC with this, using the Dash blockchain?

I think that the synergies between both networks and projects would be very interesting for the development of the public blockchain ecosystem & the new dPoW2.

As a first thought, a PoC for Komodo would be very cheap in fee vs  Bitcoin.
What do you think? Thank you


[22-Jul-20 08:32 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Chain locks are self-referential,  DPoW is external reference.   Also chainlocks in their current state require masternodes ( LLMQ)  which isn‚Äôt necessarily applicable to a lot of the chains that utilize dPoW .

[23-Jul-20 05:08 AM] BlockChainTech#1817
@crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy Yes, but with ChainLocks techology it protects 51% attack and the hashrate is not relevant. And used the net it would be cheaper.


[23-Jul-20 05:18 AM] BlockChainTech#1817
The theme is 51% attack protection for blockchains proyects smaller,  not the hashrate.
Currently is 'not possible' in the Dash network, this attack due to the protection of TIER 2 MN network with ChainLocks.

In addition, it would be very difficult to do it attack by renting hashrate, it is the project with the most hashrate with x11 algorithm more used. 6.5 Phash/s


[23-Jul-20 05:19 AM] BlockChainTech#1817
That's the focus, which I was referring to to do a PoC


[23-Jul-20 05:32 AM] gcharang#6833
@BlockChainTech when poly said dash's system is "self referential" vs dPoW has "external references", it means that, to corrupt the KMD blockchain, the external reference, BTC needs to be corrupted. which is a very difficult task that hasn't been accomplished yet. by corrupt KMD, I mean: to double spend KMD to someone who only accepts notarized txns as final. it can't be done even if the notary nodes are centralized. the worst that can happen is notarizations won't happen and txns won't be considered final.

as dash is "self referential", a sufficiently centralized LLMQ could in theory successfully double spend. as corrupting the dash chain and master nodes is enough for the attack to work.

At this point, the maths says even if a nation state tries to take over with the hashing power they can produce, it' wouldn't be so damn easy to take over BTC network.
There is no other cryptocurrency which can match the expense of try to reversing a transaction. That's why BTC is the first choice

@jl777 have had time to look development of reserve currencies in verus? It came justvto my mind that would it be possible to do some of your assets on that way. It would reflect asset value through these baskets of reserves and provide liquidity them for those who want to sell assets. And also would provide more liquidity by those who wants buy this asset.

[03-Aug-20 01:29 AM] jl777c#5810
cashier CC would likely just be enabled on some existing chain when it is ready. such details are not so critical at this point, but maybe it would make sense to add it to the BET chain

the best decentralized solution for storage as of now is IPFS. the redundant nature of blockchains (all data exists on all nodes) makes it a poor format for storing large quantities of data

thats very interesting and deep topic imo - when/if blockchain should be used as some kind of "data db" for application. As I think in many (most) cases of current attempts of apps building it's miss-usage of tech.

the key to the data storage problem is not to require all nodes to store all transaction history, ie. manychains approach. by having dedicated usage chains, only people that care about that chain would even sync that chain. if any particular chain became so popular people start having problems storing all the data (that is called a good problem), then some application specific data storage solution can be used. there could be a regularly scheduled snapshot/archiving that reduces the size of the active chain dramatically

HODL is waiting for some non-bitcoin address assets to be divested before liquidation payout
CRYPTO payout is indeed imminent! so CRYPTO, REVS and SUPERNET snapshots will be taken as of August 15th and then a revshare will go out soon after. even though the chart says 50% payout for SUPERNET, i will pass through 100%, but REVS will take its 5% off the top.

i have not been trading actively, current markets are too distorted for me to make much sense out of them. the VRSC is indeed staking from a different address: https://explorer.veruscoin.io/address/RGBRrwfwKpwnftvFsjP1hqgAjuwKYRzV6t

the trading market is VERY different now than in the earlier years of crypto. also, overall trading is really messed up, just look at the non-crypto trading. trading at ATH, when economy is in a total mess. though most of the gains are from a handful of mega-tech companies.

 if i am not confident that i can make gains from trading, i dont trade. that is just long experience of trading and knowing when not to trade.

when bankrupt companies (hertz, etc) trade at large market caps, the overall investing landscape is broken. currently fundamentals dont matter at all.
however, we keep pushing forward with the fundamentals thing, ie. revshare

Sad but "centralized" experiments to do swaps are closed (sparkswap) but they could have evolved to a DEX (if you replace the website and centralized orderbook by any of the DEX <https://medium.com/sparkswap/sparkswap-is-shutting-down-86cfab3216d2>

95% -> CRYPTO 1375020.537647341 cutoff 0.0001, 1.37488211 per CRYPTO
but the amount that would have gone to SUPERNET 441681.03141666 cutoff 0.0001 will do its own airdrop at 0.76930759 per SUPERNET. note that this is double what is obligated to send according to the flowchart. in spite of someone (Mark81?) trying to convince me to send out the obligated amount, it seems best to just pass through 100% of it.```

I think to have a fair answer for your question, we should have a debate with ETC team, I don't think ETC team is aware of what is dPoW yet, would be interesting to know what they think of dPoW.

The notary network is what we are really selling with the dPow solution. Sure there could be a few more bonuses, faster deposit on exchanges or cheaper 51% attack insurance policies. But with dPow 2.0 is the notary network going to fundamentally change?

Seems so simple/obvious but it IS a fundamental change of thinking from KMD-centric to solution-oriented!


[20-Aug-20 02:23 AM] costa2439#3771
should start with the exchanges recognize the security of dpow and match the confirmations made to the btc network for any currency with dpow


[20-Aug-20 02:25 AM] costa2439#3771
then the rest will wonder why kmd and dpow coins only need 2 or 3 confirmations?

@grewalsatinder  described iguana as a blockchain management daemon. A quick web search of crypto exchange software loads a list of whitelabel companies  offering backend services for exchanges. Has iguana been adopted by any of these companies? My thinking is that it may be easier to work with some of these service providers then individual exchanges, especially if iguana can already do the integration. And or, can iguana be used to build a whitelabel CEX? Maybe the path to getting exchanges using dPow is to integrate with the whitelabel providers or become one?

not sure why the obsession with dPoW marketing. it doesnt bring in much revenues and if anything it costs us to add support. it is something we offer the community at basically cost (as nobody seems to want to pay for security). if other projects want it, then fine. otherwise, it is not a priority for us to be pushing it. the main purpose of dPoW is to secure the ecosystem coins. it does

I guess the obsession towards dPow marketing (beyond kmd CMC rank) is because kmd is advertising 3 products. The Dex and antara are unfinished and we are in a marketing holding pattern  until they are more officially released. dPow however, has been out for a few years now and I'm exploring why hasn't it been adopted. It seems to be the most secure solution out there and we keep witnessing chains being 51% attacked when apparently kmd has a working solution for this. It makes my head shake that kmd dPow doesn't get the recognition it deserves. So I started thinking about dPow from a sales point of view, and this has led to more questions.

Of all the different revenue sharing assets, gaining percentages of DEX revenues etc. As I understand, Jumblr is effectively dead but still receives revenue from AtomicDEX, do you think there could be a push to convert assets like JUMBLR into DEX, effectively retiring JUMBLR?


[21-Aug-20 09:44 AM] Regnar#6164
Probably be a bit difficult with different prices for different assets, and different revenue amount, or possibly inflating DEX. But if it were considered, it would probably be alright to treat it as a stock split or reverse stock split, with percentages of DEX revenues remaining the same.


[21-Aug-20 09:45 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788

there is no way to make it 100% of supply, so the old variants will still exist

Don't they share the same addresses? a JUMBLR address will be identical to a DEX address right? Agreed with the depreciated issue. Might not be worth exploring further

Again, I asked if there was consideration for it, not that you do it. I'm convinced it is not needed and would be complicated. 
That being said it wouldn't be magic, just quickly looking at it, increased DEX supply to 1.3M and add the 15% of JUMBLR's atomicDEX revenue to DEX's revenue shares (ie. 65%) then each DEX would receive the same 50% of AtomicDEX revenues, and JUMBLR would be converted at roughly 0.3 DEX per JUMBLR. 

but again, no need to get more into it. There's other complications that aren't easily addressed, such as you said already

> HODL has the SIA notes, but they are not very liquid and it is taking forever to convert them
@jl777c 

Aren't the SIA notes very valuable, setting aside liquidity?

```

An Initial Public Offering (IPO) was announced on May 13, 2014 with the idea of selling 1250 SiaNotes for fundraising 250BTC (at that time about $100,000) on the NXT Asset Exchange platform. That meant a value of 0.167BTC per SiaNote or 2400 NXT or $73.

The huge interest on the project drove to finally sell them for $192 (about 0.5BTC at the time) per SiaNote during the IPO, representing a total fundraising of about $240,000. All SiaNotes were sold in two days.

SiaNotes were later redeemed at 1:1 ratio by current SiaFunds during early 2015.

was speaking more about the bonds side of things. basically any public company is able to issue an arbitrary amount of bonds at close to 0% interest. so they do, way more than they actually need. what to do with all the excess funds? stock buybacks of course.

that way all the execs get nice options paydays, probably incentive pay bonuses of many millions (since the bonus is usually triggered on some higher stock price)

with interest rates at basically 0%, it forces pension funds (which need to hit some historically reasonably ROI of around 5%) to start buying equities, as they cant come close to the required ROI with debt instruments. 

tl:dr fed actions create incentives for everyone to buy all the equities. and still the vast majority of stocks are not doing so well

Agreed! also the present value of future Cash Flows (dividends, free cash flow) goes up as you discount a payment stream with lower rates, finance 101. Which is why earnings multiples have gone up to 25x with Tesla, 1000x. But like you said since 10yr bonds are yielding 60 bps, pre-inflation, everyone has to buy stocks.

dPoW is designed for ecosystem coins, for them it takes no development work and is very efficient. to do this for even external bitcoin forks is starting to require core dev work,  not a lot, but whenever you have to make core changes, it is a big deal. now to go to an external protocol, it is a BIG task. to do that for some marketing thing... where is the manpower for it? and will they really want to do this. historically, we have found that projects that are big wont want to use an external service.

so it would cost us a lot, require a lot of work on the large projects part and likely the large project wont want to do it. uphill battle all the way. for smaller projects with dev talent, it is a different story

with this advancement of Komodo's AtomicDeFi, while the Ethereum DeFi yield farming having so many issues (congestion/fees), and many "investors" hoping for another platform to offer the same yield farming contract potentials, would you be willing to code up a contract that allows this activity?

or is it not worth it / against your principles / not fitting your vision of Komodo Platform?

by the definition of "fiat", it is impossible to do trustless atomic swaps between fiat and crypto. as you know, the fiat authorities can freeze, block, stop any payment of fiat whenever they want if they so wish.

I guess that question may also means if the pegged cryptocurrency can be built on like usdt etc with KMD tech and that can be used by some centralized exchanges.
In that terms the tech is there, like gateway cc, peggs cc, prices cc, oracle cc etc. These are built using custom consensus version 1 tech and currently upgrading to version 2. As soon as things gets finalized and considered stable enough to make it use for making decentralized fiat pegged cryptocurrency I guess we will get the answer to your question. At least such pegged decentralized fiat crypto currency can sure be expected to be tradable in our own product like Atomicdex.

Hi jl777

Will iguana continue to be maintained for use in embedded environments to sign tx?

Or will the future be centered around nspv?


[10-Sep-20 10:34 PM] jl777c#5810
for embedded environment, libnspv is probably better. iguana is more of a toolkit that has all the various parts needed, so it can be repurposed for many usecases. as far as maintenance, that is up to whether some dev will become a maintainer for it

@dukeleto  @grewalsatinder 
afaik there is no "nspv default embedded web client" as in a nspv binary that runs in a browser. what does exist is a static html interface to interact with a nspv binary running natively on the OS.
launch the nspv binary and visit `127.0.0.1:7771` in browser to access it. replace 7771 with the coin's rpcport mentioned in the coins config


[13-Sep-20 10:28 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@gcharang exactly, and as I understand @dukeleto was asking about any documentation etc for the native binary of nspv web GUI, unless I understood his query incorrectly

```Well, the main reason for this thread is that I have a question for those who know a bit more about AtomicDEX's inner workings - ideally, those working with the team Smiley

Would it be possible to integrate this option algorithm developed by @aliashraf? It is basically an Atomic-Swap-based algorithm for put and call options, based only on Bitcoin Script and a very similar algorithm to TierNolan's original Atomic Swap mechanism. It uses, however, a Segwit feature (create a txid without needing a signed input) and thus wouldn't work with coins which do not support that.```https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5251998.msg54625091#msg54625091

article recommended to those who think bitcoin will be replaced by ethereum or better blockchain. this article was easy and pointed to the point. It's like this in addition. If bitcoin contained in smartphones are left to DeFi smart contracts, there can be a day when interest can be given to principal guarantees. It is now a short-term destination for smart contracts and DeFi.

why bitcoin? this is because people's thoughts are easily entrenched. It's like a hook-and-loop fastener that has to stick somewhere. technology alone does not predict this trend. 

bitcoiner like me have been clamoring for years that the direction of technology, or atomic swap, will move toward a financial ecosystem centered on bitcoins. they have something in common that they pay more attention to humanities topics such as the nature of trust than technology.

Jl777 may need to do some thinking about aDex and the vision he wishes for it, it's has been years in the making big decisions are bound to occur as the journey progresses, it also a legacy the vision that inspired such in that first place , no easy answers but tough decisions maybe made , all in all respects what you decide I assume so does the community


[07-Oct-20 02:38 AM] jl777c#5810
when people start getting put in jail (bitmex), it is time to make sure that the people working on a project can do so in a safe environment. this means that complying with regulation is the only way to achieve that. that being said, it is open source, so if a single person decides to post a version without geo limits, then how can that be stopped?

as far as protecting peoples investments, a solution is being worked on that will achieve that and ideally allow long term holding, without requiring KYC to sell. i hope that something can be officially announced today on this.

Can I make some suggestions for the token cc?
Tokens need the ability to have a counter field in tokeninfo. Such that a game nft can gain or lose strength/hitpoints/age/etc. 

We need to be able to rewrite the token description.  

And the final suggestion would aid in something like  linking digital art to NFT.
An additional function to lock an outside hash in an extra metadata field. Something like the ownership of a file or picture is locked by a hash. This new function takes that hash plus the token privkey and creates another hash to store in this extra metadata field. The NFT privkey unlocks the picture hash.

Just a few thoughts.


[09-Oct-20 11:33 PM] jl777c#5810
nothing prevents adding/removing characteristics from a specific NFT, you need overlay logic to track these changes to the base NFT

it started as that but has been refined and streamlined. will post more details tomorrow, trying to reduce it to as few steps as possible and to make it as easy as possible. to prepare for it, you should get VRSC synced ahead of time. to be fully decentralized, you need to run a. fullnode

I am creating a MSHARK redemption mechanism so that you can send MSHARK to a redeem address and then the KMD and VRSC that is proportional to what you sent in will be sent to the senders address (address of first vin). it currently has 3.5 million VRSC and 7.3 million KMD, so it works out to 5.2 KMD and 2.5 VRSC per MSHARK redeemed. the amount redeemed will be rounded DOWN to the nearest integer, so dont send in fractional amounts.

When this is ready, i will post more details but it should just be a matter to send the MSHARK to a specific address, wait for the next processing (daily, weekly, monthly, on-demand) and then the KMD and VRSC will arrive in the address you sent from


[11-Oct-20 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
For HODL, it is stuck with illiquid assets and the liquid assets in it only add up to about 0.05 KMD. if you have a large amount of HODL and want to salvage at least something from it, i can accomodate, just DM me for 2000 or more HODL redeem


[11-Oct-20 04:08 AM] jl777c#5810
for SUPERNET, i can buyback at 25 KMD in lots of 100 or more, just DM me about this


[11-Oct-20 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
The above provides liquidity for the three assetchains that are not revshares. still working on the DEX related revshare assetchains and will announce. details on that early next week

For CRYPTO, i can do a buyback at 3 KMD. it could very well generate more revshare than that over time, but it is hard to predict.

Does the above mean that Supernet as a pass-through asset/managed hedge fund/whatever you name it concept is getting wound down? This is not a complaint, I just want it stated clearly if you will no longer be putting effort to developing it. I hold SN since NXT days as a long term investment & would continue, but will take the buyout if is the end of the road for it.


[11-Oct-20 06:01 AM] bishop#9773
With no immediate rush to redeem MSHARK, does this mean the KMD/VRSC ratio could change in the future by the amount of KMD rewards and VRSC stakes that continue? Just trying to get a sense if the holders are effectively getting you to claim rewards and stake the Verus by not redeeming (no effort on their part) or if that's potentially an incentive to redeem.


[11-Oct-20 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the MSHARK redemption will be frozen at the initial rate, so it is incentivized for people to redeem

@jansako havent decided yet what to do with SUPERNET.  maybe it makes sense to wind it down as it probably wont be super active in the near future, but maybe after all the other assets are transitioned, there will be enough bandwidth. as i said, not sure yet. so if you want, you can cashout at anytime, or continue to hodl. i doubt the buyback price will go much below the 25 KMD, but i doubt it would be able to go up significantly. maybe to 30 KMD, but i cant see it going to 50 KMD. since it is basically denominated in KMD, its value depends heavily on the value of KMD.

Could supernet be liquidated among its holders?  distribute assets, kmd and others coins


[11-Oct-20 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
practically speaking, i would convert the holdings to mostly KMD if it is decided to do that, but as i wrote above, i want to see how things settle out after the rest of the assets are simplified


[11-Oct-20 12:08 PM] costa2439#3771

Ajusted nav is 33.65 kmd and KMD ECO System ( not part of the calculation yet) 

Bet 2733
Bots 288166
Dex 254052
Etc...

It seems that its real value would be much higher than 25 or 30 if it were to be liquidated in the near future

I may miss something

what happens to the MSHARK held by SuperNET? according to dexstats.info SuperNET holds 395 879 MSHARK. 

is the VRSC from that holding going to be passed through to SuperNET asset holders?


[11-Oct-20 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
@costa2439 the current NAV calculation shows 24.72 and i am offering (not forcing) 25KMD. if you dont want to accept this price, then you dont need to. this liquidity is offered as a convenience and yes, it does give the long term advantage to those who hodl instead of liquidate. i certainly cant do a buyback at some theoretical price as the buyback is using actual liquid KMD


[11-Oct-20 04:30 PM] jl777c#5810
as the liquid NAV goes up, the buyback price will be adjusted


[11-Oct-20 04:31 PM] jl777c#5810
@crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy if supernet does the MSHARK redeem (probably it will), then the KMD+VRSC will be added to its holdings, which would affect the liquid NAV

[12-Oct-20 01:22 PM] mobipoi#5774

buyback price for SUPERNET is increased to 30KMD each.  this is provided solely for convenience if you need some liquidity,  current plan is that SUPERNET will continue at least some more years as VRSC, CHIPS and MCL might need some support and SuperNET has decent sized stakes in those. also SuperNET  helps out ecosystem projects, even if it doesnt own much of it.  my assessment is that if SuperNET wasnt there, nobody else would be offering the same type of assistance.  so i have decided to continue.

that being said,   SuperNET is not very active in the investment side anymore and has plenty of liquidity, so i will be adjusting the buyback price more frequently. 

minimum of 100 SUPERNET to redeem. 

just send to RLVzC4tr9cNKvuw2z4m8KuMfZURwCehx55 and i will send. 30x KMD to the address (first vin) that it came from. DM me txid after you send

Announcement regarding DEX, REVS, MGW, BOTS and JUMBLR

Please read: 
https://medium.com/veruscoin/verus-superior-defi-for-community-driven-liquidity-e2592b251146

After reading the above, did you get the same feeling as me? It is a fantastic technical achievement and the plan is to migrate the DEX revshare assetchain coins to a verus liquidity pool. The liquidity pool feature is coming soon to VRSC mainnet.

1) all the existing DEX revshare assetchains can convert to vDEX according to the ratios: DEX 1:1 vDEX, BOTS and JUMBLR 1:0.3 vDEX, REVS 1:0.075 vDEX, MGW 1:0.1 vDEX. These ratios preserves the proportional revshare ratios between them based on each coins total supply and revshare percentage.

2) it is expected the user will need to send their coins to a burn address and the corresponding vDEX will be sent back to the address it came from (first vin input), this process will happen regularly. daily at first, then weekly, then monthly, then by request

3) We can then all make sure that there is an active vDEX liquidity pool on verus.

For those who dont want to wait until vDEX is available, you can use atomicDEX to convert to KMD. It is not required to convert to KMD, just a convenience for those that want liquidity now.

did you read the above?


[16-Oct-20 03:02 AM] jl777c#5810
vDEX is a combined form of all the DEX revshare assetchains, preserves the relative revshare ratio between them. it simplifies things by having just a single verus token for liquidity pool

revshare percentages stay intact relative to the various assets. if you dont convert to vDEX, then you can trade using atomicDEX


[16-Oct-20 03:27 AM] jl777c#5810 (pinned)
there will be a buyback at 15KMD price for DEX, 5 for BOTS and JUMBLR, 1.5 for MGW and 1 for REVS

Will atomicdex use vdex pool?


[16-Oct-20 03:30 AM] jansako#3330
The original expectation for DEX revshare was the 50% of 1/777 dex fee. In real numbers that means an average volume of 4 Million USD per day (give or take) equivalent for 1 year to receive 1$ of revshare. What is the rough expectation for this new vDex? Again, give or take, what will it take for vDex to be successful?


[16-Oct-20 03:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont have exact estimate now, but i would expect 5 million per day would get close to achieving the same


[16-Oct-20 03:33 AM] jl777c#5810
basically the same,  just a bit of overhead is expected


[16-Oct-20 03:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i cant speak to when atomicDEX will use the vDEX liquidity pool,  liquidity pools have a totally different way of "trading". that being said, i remember seeing someone post a way to update shurli with a standard trading type of GUI on top of verus liquidity pools. maybe a similar thing can be done with atomicDEX


[16-Oct-20 03:39 AM] jansako#3330
Just to be clear, we are talking about a liquidity pool containing vDex and other things (what else?) that users are trading against, with a volume of roughly 5 mil $ a day. 
- What do you expect the size of this pool to be? (obviously it is easier to achieve that volume with a large pool)
- where will the pool assets come from? (correct me if I am misunderstanding the concept based on other liquidity pools & the article above)


[16-Oct-20 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
are you familiar with uniswap?


[16-Oct-20 03:41 AM] jansako#3330
In general terms yes


[16-Oct-20 03:42 AM] jansako#3330
you have to start with an 'asset pool', hence my question


[16-Oct-20 03:42 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont mean the trading volume of vDEX being 5 mil.day, but rather the trading volume via atomicDEX. how much vDEX trades is not very relevant


[16-Oct-20 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
once the liquidity pool exists, then anybody can fund either side of it. and it would achieve an equlibrium price based on the value of what is in the pools


[16-Oct-20 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
also, it is possible to use verus pools without. funding/redeeming from the liquidity pool. in that case, you can essentially just directly trade a specific price against the blockchain


[16-Oct-20 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
Pinned a message.


[16-Oct-20 03:45 AM] jansako#3330
I think I may have misunderstood this. Are you saying that in essence the DexFee would be redirected to directly go into this liquidity pool and it's value will go up as that happens?


[16-Oct-20 03:45 AM] jansako#3330
that is how the value of vdex woudl then rise?


[16-Oct-20 03:47 AM] jl777c#5810
each vDEX will be a proxy for a proportional share of the dexfee, presumably that would give it its value and people will fund/trade with the liquidity pool based on that


[16-Oct-20 03:49 AM] jl777c#5810
not all the details about that are finalized, but i just wanted to assure people that. the DEX (REVS, MGW, BOTS, JUMBLR) revshares will continue to be represented in the vDEX token, with the same as the current proportions. so this change is more just a lateral move to simplify things.  actually several people have requested this and this migration to vDEX achieves it in a clean way without allowing people to sell empty (post snapshot) coins

{Reactions}
üëç 

[16-Oct-20 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
to get the vDEX, you need to burn an old asset, so that preserves the total supply


[16-Oct-20 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, if all this is too vague and you want to cash out, i will make sure there is a buywall for it

Not vague, I am trying to dumb it down for my own understanding. üôÇ

What is the timeframe for implementation?


[16-Oct-20 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
for now, just imagine that all the 5 revshare assets are combined into a single one, which just happens to be able to use the verus liquidity pool.

all of this is working on the VRSCTEST testnet, so when it is on the mainnet. i dont want to make prediction of exactly when that would be, but  i havent heard of many issues that needs to be fixed. that being said, any hardfork is always subject to many things that could delay it. best is to keep up with VRSC news and of course when it is ready, i will announce it here.


[16-Oct-20 03:54 AM] jl777c#5810
for now, just get up to speed with the verus liquidity pools. i have a feeling the early birds will make some outsized arbitrage profits, as there will still be the buyback active on atomicDEX

@jl777c  yes


[16-Oct-20 04:17 AM] jl777c#5810
someone that is compliant in each jurisdiction would be able to do this, so atomicDEX adding the ability to tap into the regulated fiat, this seems a big positive and not a negative


[16-Oct-20 04:18 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, there will be those that are eager to say bad things about komodo who will try to twist things into some negative thing


[16-Oct-20 04:18 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no way to tap into the regulated fiat funds, without having a regulation compliant solution. so a multi-regulation product is the answer

[16-Oct-20 05:03 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
This is exactly what I imagined - all except the interop between clusters being an issue......so I suppose the purchase price for vDEX would/will be the same if it was purchased with VRSC - KMD or BTC?? ...
No investor stage 1 from assets or anyway to be part of the first 1,000,000 vDEX? I guess sometimes these are private investments.


[16-Oct-20 05:07 AM] jl777c#5810
all the DEX. revshare assets are the stage 1


[16-Oct-20 05:07 AM] jl777c#5810
they convert prorata to vDEX

they are the same thing

verus discord #trading just had a discussion. about this


[16-Oct-20 05:17 AM] hastrup#8742
So dex rev share are over and  there is two options sell or swap. Or am I understanding it wrong?


[16-Oct-20 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
that is incorrect


[16-Oct-20 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
all that is happening at this step is DEX (and others) are being. converted to vDEX so we can. use the verus liquidity pool


[16-Oct-20 05:19 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing else is changed and while some details will change, it wont be any giant percentage. change


[16-Oct-20 05:20 AM] hastrup#8742
Thank you for the clarification. So the more people swap to vdex does that mean the ones that don't. get a bigger rev share of komodo dex?


[16-Oct-20 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[16-Oct-20 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX and vDEX are equivalent


[16-Oct-20 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
you can. think of it more like. DEX is being listed on a new "exchange", it just happens to be the verus liquidity pools, which requires a verus compatible token, ie. vDEX


[16-Oct-20 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
both DEX and vDEX will be proxy ownership of the same amount of revshares,  they are equivalent


[16-Oct-20 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
other than DEX can be used on atomicDEX and not on. verus liquidity pools and. for now vDEX can. be used on verus liquidity pools.


[16-Oct-20 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe in the future atomicDEX will have trading. against the verus liquidity pools. but that is hard to say as it is. a fundamentally different trading model


[16-Oct-20 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure you can guarantee an. atomic price/volume from a liquidity pool

How the revshare is distributed that is the big difference right? Between vdex and dex

vDEX and DEX will get the same revshare

you need to burn. DEX to get a vDEX

they are 1:1

[16-Oct-20 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
how they are paid is still to be determined, but the capitalized price of both DEX and vDEX will be far more than the. initial revshares and the liquidity at the market price will be the more significant


[16-Oct-20 05:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think all revs are also accumulated


[16-Oct-20 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
important thing to realize is that both DEX and vDEX. are the same, and it is backed by the dexfee. the specifics on how the. dexfee is distributed will need to change, but it. will. still be backing the vDEX (and DEX, BOTS, JUMBLR, REVS, MGW)


[16-Oct-20 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
ultimately both DEX and vDEX requires trust in me and i am saying they are both the same


[16-Oct-20 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it will take some months for all the details about the actual revshare payout mechanism to be clarified,  but then. again it would take a while for a million. dollars of revshares to accumulate,  so it. seems not so urgent. an. issue

I guess I was thinking if REVS,JUMBLER ect. Can be cashed in now for kmd - they will get burned right?
- it just seemed somewhat logical for some dumb reason to remove the KMD on stage 1. Not sure why my simple math says that. Circle of life I suppose


[16-Oct-20 05:52 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
And removing circulating supply wouldn't be a bad thing either IMO - just visualizing without a degree in finance


[16-Oct-20 05:58 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I guess making KMD or (assets) the only way to purchase vDEX in stage 1  should be on the list of "Things to do" - something like that.


[16-Oct-20 05:59 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280

> I guess making KMD or (assets) the only way to purchase vDEX in stage 1
If the goal is to increase liquidity  - as I understood as the main purpose for making this move is - restricting acquiring vDEX with KMD only would counteract that intention.
Apart from that: Every liquidity pool must have VRSC included. That means that any (external) currency that is bridged with the Verus ecosystem will be able to acquire vDEX through easy conversions.


[16-Oct-20 06:19 AM] t_dan#3334
The question is what will happen with the fees collected by AtomicDEX? Originally they were supposed to be distributed to DEX etc. revshare asset holders. But now that they are being moved to the Verus Chain and will be part of Verus Liquidity pools, they won't be part of AtomicDEX anymore. So what will happen to the AD fees collected?


[16-Oct-20 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
you misunderstand


[16-Oct-20 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
what is being moved is the DEX assetchain coin


[16-Oct-20 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
to a 100% equivalent vDEX


[16-Oct-20 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
they are the same


[16-Oct-20 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
no difference. in value


[16-Oct-20 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
1:1 the same


[16-Oct-20 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
identical


[16-Oct-20 06:24 AM] t_dan#3334
Yes, but do they generate revenue in the Verus Ecosystem, or do they still generate revenue on AtomicDEX?


[16-Oct-20 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
vDEX is proportionally balanced across the 5 different assetchains


[16-Oct-20 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
this migration has NOTHING to do with the dexfee collection, disbursement side of things


[16-Oct-20 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it is. just the DEX coin that is. moving to vDEX so it can use the verus liquidity pool in. addition to atomicDEX


[16-Oct-20 06:25 AM] t_dan#3334
Ok, so it will still generate revenue with the fees collected on AtomicDEX?


[16-Oct-20 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
granted, whatever trading of DEX that would have happened on atomicDEX, moves to verus


[16-Oct-20 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
but other than the trades of v


[16-Oct-20 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
vDEX itself on. verus,  the rest of atomicDEX fees, it is still represented by DEX (and vDEX) since they are the same


[16-Oct-20 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX and vDEX are the same, identical claim on atomicDEX dexfees


[16-Oct-20 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
as i. have said many times, the exact specific mechanism of dexfee distribution is yet to be determined, and as it clarifies, of course details will be posted.


[16-Oct-20 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the key is that DEX and vDEX will be capitalized by the dexfee revshare stream


[16-Oct-20 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
also, did i mention that DEX and vDEX are identical in value?

And what about that new JUMBLR concept, where KMD, VRSC, vARRR and JUMBLR were supposed to be integrated into one chain and where JUMBLR would have benefited by the mixing going on?


[16-Oct-20 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is still possible, but realistically if there is any fee, nobody uses it, so maybe it is done without any fee


[16-Oct-20 06:34 AM] t_dan#3334
I see. So the original purpose of the specific JUMBLR coin is now more or less given up and mixed into the new vDEX asset?


[16-Oct-20 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
when JUMBLR was available (for years), virtually nobody used it.


[16-Oct-20 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and PIRATE is. much better for privacy anyway


[16-Oct-20 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the spirit of jumblr will live on, but the revshare of no usage is not much, so. my assessment is that it is much better to get 0.3 vDEX for. JUMBLR

So trading on the Verus liquidity pools is fee-free and no revenue is generated there? As far as I understood is: Trading of vDEX will move over to Verus liquidity pools, and generating yield will still be by the collected AtomicDEX fees.


[16-Oct-20 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[16-Oct-20 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
though you will still be able to trade DEX on. atomicDEX


[16-Oct-20 07:33 AM] t_dan#3334
got it. Yes, the current DEX, until burned for vDEX, right?


[16-Oct-20 07:33 AM] t_dan#3334
Once vDEX, it cannot be  traded on AD anymore.


[16-Oct-20 07:34 AM] jl777c#5810
correct


[16-Oct-20 07:34 AM] t_dan#3334
cool


[16-Oct-20 07:37 AM] t_dan#3334
So basically there will be three different, separate trading systems:
1. AtomicDEX with true atomic swaps (has fees),
2. Subatomic swaps with the Shurli GUI (fee-free),
3. Verus liquidity pools, where you can also swap / trade coins, also with the Shurli GUI (fee-free).


[16-Oct-20 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
at least, shurli is planned. to do some of 3. with an easy to use GUI


[16-Oct-20 07:41 AM] t_dan#3334
Quite a lot of options or platforms to choose then!


[16-Oct-20 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810

> 3. Verus liquidity pools, where you can also swap / trade coins, also with the Shurli GUI (fee-free).
I gather you mean that *fee-free* means that shurli doesn't take any fees. On the Verus network the normal 0.0001 transaction fee still applies, as well as a fee of 0.025% on every conversion. 
If you convert through a pool from one currency to another, that counts as two conversion: CURRENCY1 --> POOL --> CURRENCY2, even if done in 1 transaction.


[16-Oct-20 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
atomicDEX now allows to convert BOTS, JUMBLR, REVS, MGW into DEX at the same ratio. there is no actual need to do this as they are all equivalent, but if you want to, it is available


[16-Oct-20 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
atomicDEX makes it so easy to setup such things and the liquidity multiplier is fantastic

Hey @jl777c ,
THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AT FIRST! I feel it, you are into it because of a better world. üëç 

I have two questions for clarity and one proposal:

1. Which assets will stay independent after the migration to vDEX?
- Besides vDEX -> CRYPTO, SUPERNET and CHIPS?

2. You say 1 DEX is 1 vDEX, but i do not think so because of the total supply. Let me explain what I mean:

Supply:
408000.07 DEX = 408000.07 vDEX
699130.49 JUMBLR **x 0,3** **=** 209.739,15 vDEX
352128.1 BOTS **x 03** **=** 105.638,43 vDEX
1125134.58 REVS **x 0,075 = ** 84.385,1 vDEX
543108.45 MGW **x 0,1 =** 54.310,85 vDEX

**Total supply of vDEX = 862.073,6 vDEX**

1 DEX is not equivalent to 1 vDEX as I understand it correct above... not even 2:1

3. DEX (50%), BOT (15%), JUMBLR (15%), REVS (5%), MGW (5%) collected all together a percentage of 90% of the DEXfee. The left 10% was meant for op. costs and promotion.

- My proposal is to change the conversion ration to the revenue percentage for a real 1:1 ratio. In this calculation we should redistribute the 10% op. costs and promotion to all coins.

Example: DEX (55%), BOT (16,5%), JUMBLR (16,5%), REVS (6,%), MGW (6%)

408000.07 DEX **x 0,55 =** 224.400,04 vDEX
699130.49 JUMBLR **x 0,165 = ** 115.356,53 vDEX
352128.1 BOTS **x 0,165 = ** 58.101,14 vDEX
1125134.58 REVS **x 0,06 = ** 67.508,07 vDEX
543108.45 MGW **x 0,06 =** 32.586,51 vDEX

Total supply of vDEX ***should*** be in my view 497.952,29 vDEX

> Supply:
> 408000.07 DEX = 408000.07 vDEX
Strange, there used to be 1 million DEX, now the total supply has shrinked to 408,000 DEX?


[16-Oct-20 11:48 AM] t_dan#3334
Have 60% of the original 1m DEX already been "burned" and been converted to vDEX?


[16-Oct-20 12:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
DEX asset only equals 50% of vdex


[16-Oct-20 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, already many of. the chains have had coins burned


[16-Oct-20 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
so the vDEX supply is based on the pre-burn supply


[16-Oct-20 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
volume on. atomicDEX is going crazy, a lot of people are doing. the buyout and so far atomicDEX is running perfectly


[16-Oct-20 12:07 PM] jl777c#5810
the ratios that i posted are correct for the conversion to vDEX


[16-Oct-20 12:08 PM] LocoMB#8593
so vDEX will live on VRSC chain? I guess there will be a detailed HowTo for the exchange in due time, correct?

[16-Oct-20 12:58 PM] ejuliano#8606
i tried to read through all msgs but i might have missed it... i still have some misunderstandings, my question is:
is the "official" atomicdex still going to payout to DEX asset in its current form if it is retained instead of swapped for vdex or kmd buyout? 
or is there no more going to be revenue from atomicdex?


[16-Oct-20 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the atomicDEX revenues will create backing for the DEX, but to get the actual revshares. directly you would need to do some conversions. as i. have said. already, the details on. this are. still being worked out and will be announced when. it. is known


[16-Oct-20 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
the vDEX will be pegged. to DEX. and both DEX and vDEX have equivalent claims on the atomicDEX revshare


[16-Oct-20 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
especially at first, when the revenue stream hasnt ramped up yet, the vast vast. majority of value will be from the. fully capitalized price vDEX trades at


[16-Oct-20 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr vDEX allows to obtain the capitalized value and also rights to the actual revshares, but all the mechanics on how to actually get the revshares are NOT finalized yet. nowhere close, as it is a very complex issue


[16-Oct-20 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
you will need to wait for an announcement from the atomicDEX team for the details and it wont be in. the very short term.


[16-Oct-20 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
in any case, we still need to wait for the VRSC hardfork to enable defi, do the migration,  get the liquidity pool going.


[16-Oct-20 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
there is an atomicDEX buyback for those that dont want to wait


[16-Oct-20 01:15 PM] ejuliano#8606
thanks james for clearing that up, i understand now


[16-Oct-20 01:17 PM] t_dan#3334
Since the total vDEX supply of only 2 million or less is quite small in comparison to other assets like VRSC or KMD VRSC (40-100 times more) ‚Äì will the exchange ratio of vDEX as being part of bigger liquidity pools be directly determined by the pool supply ratios instead of a more or less "best guess" value (as it is now)?


[16-Oct-20 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
you have it backwards


[16-Oct-20 01:18 PM] Nxtlevel#2303
A question here will Vdex require , kyc ? or adex or both ?


[16-Oct-20 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
whatever value the vDEX has, arbitrage will move the price. to that value


[16-Oct-20 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
vDEX is a fully decentralized coin/token on VRSC blockchain


[16-Oct-20 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure how KYC can be added to it


[16-Oct-20 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
my understanding is that atomicDEX will be able to be configured for what set of regulations you. want to follow,  ie. US, EU, turkey, unregulated and it will connect to the appropriate dex network. assume. that each of these networks will be mostly isolated from each other


[16-Oct-20 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
it would take someone that is running nodes in two (or more) jurisdictions to bridge orders across them


[16-Oct-20 01:21 PM] Nxtlevel#2303

So a reserve currency of kmd, plus reserve currency of vDEX, plus reserve currency of Verus could be combined in a liquidity pool and create a fractional currency named jl777stashNuggets?

[17-Oct-20 11:40 PM] AkiraX#8269
can you explain?


[18-Oct-20 12:05 AM] CHMEX#0686
if you are the owner of Supernet or hodl coins and you want to sell them there is a big enough buy wall on atomicdex to sell your coins. if you want to keep your coins you don't have to do anything. if you want to buy coins you can buy it on atomicdex

How and when will the assets receive 'dividends' has not been finalized (or at least released). Likely won't be until Verus releases a mainnet version of 'reserve currencies' functionality. Planned by the end of (this) year.

[21-Oct-20 03:21 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Say you were to use a chain to do part tracking where every process is a wallet as well as the product that's being processed. The processes would initiate transactions against the product to show steps being completed. On this same chain would you be able to use the KV functionality to store public/priv addresses for product serial numbers? Obviously they would have passphrases protecting their value(privkey) whereas the public address would be the key. Perhaps a CC that produces a key value as it generates a new wallet(S/N) and then stores it in the chain to be accessible by someone with the passphrase. So if needed you could access the send side of the products wallet and perform possibly a repair or send back a transaction that does was done incorrectly.


[21-Oct-20 03:23 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I.E. adding another processed item to an assembly then removing it and adding a different one due to the processed item being defective?


[21-Oct-20 03:24 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@jl777c


[21-Oct-20 03:32 PM] actionslacks#4072
I was toying with a similar idea. the privkey could be like the warranty card and serial number all in one and represented by a qr code on the product.


[21-Oct-20 03:32 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Well ideally you wouldnt want the customer to be able to access any wallets on your chain


[21-Oct-20 03:33 PM] actionslacks#4072
the blockchain network would be contained in the manufacturing facility


[21-Oct-20 03:33 PM] BlackJesus#6161
That's why I'm toying with the idea of using keyvalue to generate wallets with their priv keys hidden in plain sight by anyone with the ability to access them with the passphrase.


[21-Oct-20 03:34 PM] BlackJesus#6161
I would like the blockchain to still be online for easy horziontal scalability


[21-Oct-20 03:34 PM] BlackJesus#6161
a far reach project would be developing a GUI for customers to see only what you want them to see in your process.


[21-Oct-20 03:35 PM] BlackJesus#6161
send in a return. We provide you with a GUI that where you enter your S/N(publicwallet) you can view into our chain and see how it's being processed.


[21-Oct-20 03:35 PM] BlackJesus#6161
because we designed the GUI you would only get what we want you to see.


[21-Oct-20 03:37 PM] BlackJesus#6161
basically a stripped down version of the manufacturing facilities GUI


[21-Oct-20 03:37 PM] BlackJesus#6161
less control more viewing


[21-Oct-20 03:39 PM] actionslacks#4072
I see


[21-Oct-20 03:40 PM] actionslacks#4072
so how would you process rma's?


[21-Oct-20 03:40 PM] BlackJesus#6161
with DPoW we can take intranets onto the net.


[21-Oct-20 03:40 PM] BlackJesus#6161
RMA's would come in and immediately be scanned(a transaction would process on the S/N upon return) and begin the rma process(anotherwallet)


[21-Oct-20 03:40 PM] actionslacks#4072
an agent would verify the owner of the product?


[21-Oct-20 03:40 PM] BlackJesus#6161
that transaction would force the product to go through some other processes before it can leave again.


[21-Oct-20 03:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
or end up in used stock.


[21-Oct-20 03:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
we sell direct. As products leave we know who has what serial number.


[21-Oct-20 03:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
So if it comes back from someone else we know they sold it to someone else?


[21-Oct-20 03:42 PM] BlackJesus#6161
or one of our dealers sold it to them, because that S/N was in a dealers stock


[21-Oct-20 03:43 PM] actionslacks#4072
I like the idea of inspection equipment being able to verify transactions only if the product meets specs, and recording the measurements to the chain.


[21-Oct-20 03:44 PM] BlackJesus#6161
thats a long stretch goal. Automation is my industry and I have a very deep understanding of PLC's and verification system they use when processing parts in machines.


[21-Oct-20 03:44 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Eventually the processes would be automated and the machine would check the wallet via public blockchain for a myriad of processes before it even ran.


[21-Oct-20 03:46 PM] actionslacks#4072
billion dollar software suite, open sourced?


[21-Oct-20 03:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
i.e. "Rejected your missing process '','',''." or it would run if all processes were found in the initial search.


[21-Oct-20 03:46 PM] BlackJesus#6161
wouldn't be open sourced. but the network would inherently live on the web and be easily expandable


[21-Oct-20 03:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
buy another factory. Put another node and GUI's that interact with it in the facility


[21-Oct-20 03:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
the node will reach consensus and now both factories are connected innately


[21-Oct-20 03:47 PM] BlackJesus#6161
the wallet naming schema is going to be a monster though


[21-Oct-20 03:48 PM] BlackJesus#6161
will be ineligible without our GUI.


[21-Oct-20 03:48 PM] actionslacks#4072
start getting rmas? check the gui, it's all there. no finger pointing.


[21-Oct-20 03:48 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Exactly


[21-Oct-20 03:48 PM] BlackJesus#6161
and if you can sit KV inside the same chain that tracks the processes transactions


[21-Oct-20 03:48 PM] BlackJesus#6161
you only need 1 chain


[21-Oct-20 03:49 PM] actionslacks#4072
yeah, thats a software company bro. I'm speaking your language


[21-Oct-20 03:50 PM] actionslacks#4072
iso certs would be a cinch


[21-Oct-20 03:52 PM] actionslacks#4072
if they audit you for ISO compliance documentation, you just ask how much paper you need to buy.


[21-Oct-20 03:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
which iso certs are you referring to?


[21-Oct-20 03:53 PM] BlackJesus#6161
9001?


[21-Oct-20 03:55 PM] actionslacks#4072
yep, blockchain QMS i think is what we're talking about


[21-Oct-20 03:56 PM] actionslacks#4072
in jl's channel üòÖ


[21-Oct-20 04:04 PM] actionslacks#4072
I don't deal with warranties in my industry, I just know from doing product support that warranty fraud is a problem and not having to answer phones because the customer could concievably watch the diagnosis/repair process on a block explorer would be cool.

the "orange" are final products.


[21-Oct-20 06:35 PM] Mylo#8306
they are wallets.


[21-Oct-20 06:35 PM] Mylo#8306
they receive transactions that make up their parts.


[21-Oct-20 06:35 PM] Mylo#8306
the pubkey is the serial number (or r-address)


[21-Oct-20 06:36 PM] Mylo#8306
these can be created by 1 full node in the organization.


[21-Oct-20 06:36 PM] Mylo#8306
take "some data" -> signmessage = creates random data, verifiable by org key.


[21-Oct-20 06:36 PM] Mylo#8306
this creates a passphrase for each wallet (part or final product)


[21-Oct-20 06:36 PM] Mylo#8306
use coin for verifiability/timestamping as it sends to the different wallets.


[21-Oct-20 06:37 PM] Mylo#8306
can use electrum/spv wallets for all the wallets


[21-Oct-20 06:37 PM] Mylo#8306
you can use kv for sharing data between partners and dexp2p for files


[21-Oct-20 06:38 PM] Mylo#8306
for things like "production dates" etc.   send COIN 0.20201022, 1.20201022, 2.20201022, ....20.20201022


[21-Oct-20 06:38 PM] Mylo#8306
have some convention programmed into your "middleware"


[21-Oct-20 06:39 PM] Mylo#8306
use a chain with -ac_pubkey so all COIN go to a wallet you control.


[21-Oct-20 06:39 PM] Mylo#8306
it is then "controlled" COIN distribution, even if public miners come to your chain, all rewards go to that -ac_pubkey


[21-Oct-20 06:40 PM] Mylo#8306
use -ac_staked, for pos chain - all controlled within your organization


[21-Oct-20 06:41 PM] actionslacks#4072
so the amount of coin transferred is what you extrapolate the production dates from? wow this is cool. thanks


[21-Oct-20 06:42 PM] Mylo#8306
yes, from a wallet designated as a "production date" wallet.


[21-Oct-20 06:42 PM] actionslacks#4072
slick


[21-Oct-20 06:42 PM] Mylo#8306
any funds received from this address as the sender, is a date amount.


[21-Oct-20 06:43 PM] Mylo#8306
blockchain is used solely for timestamping, value-less coins


[21-Oct-20 06:43 PM] Mylo#8306
very very powerful and very easy to extrapolate reporting data


[21-Oct-20 06:44 PM] Mylo#8306
e.g., how many parts were made on 2020/10/01?   look at the wallet tx with outgoing values of 0.20201001


[21-Oct-20 06:44 PM] Mylo#8306
which parts were made on 2020/10/01, those wallets that received coins of that value.


[21-Oct-20 06:44 PM] actionslacks#4072
Or your wallet balance is your serial number. that's elegant.


[21-Oct-20 06:45 PM] Mylo#8306
combination of a centralized DB and blockchain for provenance.


[21-Oct-20 06:45 PM] Mylo#8306
> Or your wallet balance is your serial number. that's elegant.
@actionslacks hehe.. yes.  thanks.  it was a good üí° aha moment, made everythign so easy


[21-Oct-20 06:46 PM] Mylo#8306
if you are familiar with object oriented programming, and how everythign is an object, then remove that complexity for blockchain.


[21-Oct-20 06:46 PM] Mylo#8306
everything is a wallet.


[21-Oct-20 06:46 PM] Mylo#8306
simple.


[21-Oct-20 06:47 PM] Mylo#8306
we will launch in january, there is open source strategy.

@Mylo

So this is basically generating wallets from a daemon directly that all can be opened with it's passcode, But wouldn't you still need the private key to sign transactions for it?

@grewalsatinder go code does the same.

javascript from pbca's agamalib does the same.

there is a python library that _nearly_ does it, (it's not iguana compatible yet)

i use the php from python subprocess atm

the reason i use python is because of using electrum client (without connection to electrum server) to sign tx for offline wallets

there is a docker image available.  then all your images can be saved into github in text form for version control and tweaking.

I can‚Äôt understand why we have CRYPTO, SUPERNET and DEX. Why is there a need for three coins?


[26-Oct-20 10:30 PM] jl777c#5810
DEX came after SUPERNET, supernet helped incubate DEX.


[26-Oct-20 10:31 PM] jl777c#5810
historically, the ownership of SUPERNET and DEX and CRYPTO are separate, merging them would require more funds than SUPERNET has. if you want to donate the funds required for a 100% buyback, then we could do it

Well, I do not get it. SUPERNET could have help to develop DEX without the need of creating a new coin. SUPERNET would be much more ‚Äúsuper‚Äù if this coin would benefit their holder of all rewards, the Komodo universe offers.

[26-Oct-20 10:41 PM] jl777c#5810
if SUPERNET ended up just owning each project it created, then it wouldnt be an incubator, but a conglomerate. however, the purpose of SuperNET was not to be a conglomerate. It has a 6 year history, which in crypto is essentially forever. you cant change the history just to make it more convenient for people arriving later


[26-Oct-20 10:42 PM] jl777c#5810
additionally there are regulatory issues with coins that get revshares, so splitting out the revshare aspects is essential to keeping KMD free from entanglements.


[26-Oct-20 10:43 PM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr things are a lot more complex than most people assume,  so things end up a bit more complicated than pure convenience would dictate

Thank you for this explanation jl777. Very much appreciate!

I have different thoughts regarding splitting out the revshares into DEX but SUPERNET instead. KMD would be clean regarding regulatory but SUPERNET would have collected all the revshares.

But as you already answered me, history can not be set back and the migration costs money. Both parts are plausible. I would rather lose some money now (for migration to one coin) and hold only one strong ecosystem coin. But this is only my view. Again thanks! This clears things up for me. üòä

maybe to non-technical people, things should be as easy as flipping a switch and magically everything works, without any bugs. the reality is that if there is any bug, or bad design, then real people lose real money. so we are taking the long view and taking the time needed to get all the tech working flawlessly


[26-Oct-20 11:02 PM] jl777c#5810
still, we are deploying and running the cutting edge tech in the field, so its not like it is just stuck in some theoretical lab without any real world feedback


[26-Oct-20 11:04 PM] jl777c#5810
also, anything that helps the ecosystem, helps KMD. so assetchains gaining value helps KMD. there is only a loose coupling though. as each project is independent from KMD. my assessment is that if there was a KMD tax, very few real projects would build on komodo.

{Reactions}

[26-Oct-20 11:05 PM] jl777c#5810
a high tax rate on paper looks like it brings in more tax revenues, but if the taxbase is mobile, then having less revenues is the more likely outcome. with most all of crypto value not being actual revenues, but usage,  reputation, and intangibles, it is not so crazy an approach


[26-Oct-20 11:07 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, there will be people who dont have my background and experience who will disagree, and that is fine, but it wont change my mind. that being said, it isnt my mind that needs to be changed, as KMD is now fully grown up with its own team that has funding for years (decades) to come. so feel free to lobby the komodo team for whatever things you think will add value to it that isnt the cutting edge tech that we are already working on

the tech is in the source code, can be enabled whenever it is decided it is ready to be


[26-Oct-20 11:10 PM] jl777c#5810
and NOTHING prevents others from building on komodo, look at VRSC and MCL. they were started years ago, this proves that other projects can build using komodo tech


[26-Oct-20 11:16 PM] jl777c#5810
but making real tech takes years, it is not about copy pasting some smartcontract, changing a few things and hoping it doesnt break. that seems to be par for the course for many of the "successful" projects. it is just accidents waiting. to happen, as we see with the regular reports of millions lost there, tens of millions lost, etc

yes, more project oriented teams. the research and proof of concepts, they are done, "just" needs to be productized. if we had $100 million in funds like some other projects, we could just hire a bunch of devs and claim lots of "adoption", when similar to pay for play marketing, once the funding is stopped how much is left


[27-Oct-20 02:47 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I think I understand the game better today than yesterday - I think a team will form soon fast around my recent concept --- and then I will use this template to create more teams... I do understand, except for the founders rewards and all that. The business side is the other side of teaching technology to all of these amazing and intelligent humans. With developers there needs to be the CTO and someone that knows how to split the pie. Maybe focusing on team incubations would be a great step forward. We KNOW the tech is incredible. We don't necessarily know how to build a team in the open source world. A guide book would be great.

All the apparent power players that are center stage atm are really giants on clay feet because they are under extreme pressure to make profit fast.
While this appears to be the only way forward, in the long run most of them will fail because they are in a one-way cul-de-sac.
There is no lateralism for them.
Contrast this to decentralized leaderless movements, that grow slower, but are mroe resilient- this concept predates even the Bitcoin White Paper:

@jansako 1) Learn the building blocks, the docs are the starting point.  The CC modules either used in combinations to create a use case or as a template for custom work.  2)  Before the flop, you play the player and the position not the hand.  If a business is interested in blockchain, you find out where they are at.   Why do they want to use blockchain? Do they need a blockchain?  Do they have a team? How self-starting are they? How regulated is what they want to do and are do they have what is required to do it?  Is it fundraised or self-funded? What timeframe are they looking for turnaround.   From that you can tell how serious they are.  Then you listen to what they are looking for,   there is not many prepackaged solutions outside of DPoW and Atomicdex integrations,  so its not like oh we can do this usecase, pay us for it,  and most likely will require custom work.   At this time, if they dont have their own developers  we have limited/no capacity in that respect.   Assuming a time comes when we do,  you take their idea and build it out mentally from modules.   Someone who wants to build a trading card game on blockchain, you know will need tokensCC, gatewaysCC etc.   Then present them with a viable path forward.  Most likely they will not know much about blockchain so even things like appropriate consensus mechanism and other details will have to be considered. You have the process backwards.   People with purse strings have an idea they want built out,  we are not pitching ideas to be funded.  If their idea is practical and they have solid resources, preferably tech resources, then bizdev lays an outline of what needs done and collaborates with devs to get some ballpark estimates on time, cost, and manpower.  If we come to an agreement,   work happens ( which for real projects is a multiyear thing ).James mentioned a couple use cases in general, a data feed marketplace, token marketplace,  others like onchain kyc service,  gambling can be done

@polycryptoblog thanks for the writeup, this is a great starter info for anyone wanting to get into blockchain biz-dev! 
I am in a bit of a different place. I will try not to hog the channel. :-)

My premise: Komodo develops tech to solve real life problems.

My question to you team: What are those problems and how does the tech solve them?

My job: To evaluate if these problems exist in my industry and if the tech from KMD would be beneficial.

The rest of the stuff leading all the way to the final product we have done many times before. I believe once you are able to communicate with 'problem solvers' (that is what I consider myself to be), this is a great way to adoption.

Also a reaction:
_"You have the process backwards.   People with purse strings have an idea they want built out,  we are not pitching ideas to be funded."_

I think those are two parallel groups. The customers I deal with have issues that prevent them from making more money. They are looking for solutions (NOT ideas!) that will let them execute their projects faster/more efficiently/etc. because that will make them more money.
The company I work for develops these solutions.


[28-Oct-20 05:26 AM] Mylo#8306
There's plenty of combinations and permutations of problems & solutions.

One I encountered was offline wallet signing and key generation.  This was achieved with community scripts in PHP and python using electrum client.

There are limited docs for this, but it is key to a p2p solution.

Also, using a block explorer and it's API are critical parts for achieving a solution and integrating web components for reporting (provenance).

Understanding how these systems work is key to scalability, testability, sovereignty in building a p2p solution.

[28-Oct-20 06:51 AM] alkimi#1111
it's like I'm doing a jigsaw puzzle except half of the pieces are circles, I can't even guess where they fit in

I've managed to build the research branch of komodo, and it runs, it appears to be syncing the blocks, and the "name" of whatever it is that is indicated as having a "name" when I run './komodo-cli getinfo' is "KMD"...
I don't know if I've just built a node, or a ham sandwich. I don't know if it is capable of notarizing 'stuff', or if it will even serve any function if I just let it run as-is?  I don't know if I need to have this thing can, as-is, connect to Pirate, Verus, Hush, my left foot, or the Akoshic Records?
I guess it's the data transport layer I'm mostly confused about, and maybe the protocols and roles that exist in the ecosystem. Chains within chains is definitely tripping me up a bit too


[28-Oct-20 07:00 AM] lightspeed393#5403
@alkimi the name field is there because smartchains use the same daemon, with just different starting paramaters. Most smartchains can be launched with just `komodod -ac_name=PIRATE -rest_of_ac_params` except for ones like Verus which have forked and added their own changes to the daemon. 

`Chains within chains is definitely tripping me up a bit too` technically these other chains aren't *within* the komodo chain. They still have their own blockchain, the data directory for these chains can be found at `.komodo/COIN`, they just share the daemon that runs the chains.

rum 

[28-Oct-20 07:28 AM] alkimi#1111
if they're the same daemon, can one instance of it function as a node on both KMD and Pirate chain at the same time? Or is it even possible to have one build that can be on either one, but only one at a time? Or would I have to hard-reset the daemon, change the nodes in the .conf file, and/or re-sync the entire blockchain to switch between them?


[28-Oct-20 07:32 AM] lightspeed393#5403
Yes, they can all run at the same time from the same komodo daemon, given your machine's resources. Each coin has it's own `coin.conf` file in it's respective data directory. Fire up another chain and you'll see what I mean. This file contains the startup params for other ecosystem coins: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/blob/master/src/assetchains.old


[28-Oct-20 07:33 AM] lightspeed393#5403
once another chain is started, you can interact with it from `komodo-cli -ac_name=COIN getinfo`

@alkimi just to be clear... the daemon can be launched multiple times in a single OS with many different parameters... but each coin MUST have a running daemon to be active. The same CLI can then talk to them all using the same set of commands

they'll each have to sync their individual blocks tho right? I can't expect the Pirate chain to already be up-to-date just because KMD is right?


[28-Oct-20 01:17 PM] lightspeed393#5403
exactly, they are all independent blockchains so PIRATE chain will still need to sync from scratch even though KMD is synced.

on balance volume. basically shows accumulation when it goes up. and with it kmd has been almost whole bear market under accumulation. checked both bittrex and binance chart on tradingview.  its creates bullish divergence when price is going down and obv is going up but that to happen this long is making me think are tradingview charts correct? if it is then big player is playing this market really heavily on his/her favor.

[06-Nov-20 07:14 AM] bishop#9773
There is zero chance in the next few elections for blockchain voting.... while it would solve transparency by being able to independently verify votes, ensure your vote goes to who you want it to and establish clear cutoffs for ballot casts, TPTB are unlikely to want to give up much of the control


[06-Nov-20 07:34 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Once the complete voting technology is enabled (see earlier posts from Mike about that), it will need the apps to be developed and a voting-procedure needs to be in place, before it can be used. It is likely to be implemented on a small-scale at first (as pilot or testcase) and from there it can scale up.

you can spin up a voting chain for each election, people would register their pubkey. 1 coin sent to their taddr so it can be verified that all registered voters got a voting coin. then (automatically) shield the coin and vote using zfunds. the candidates then just sweep the zfunds to a taddr. blockexplorer + richlist would automatically provide all the transparency needed, while still providing privacy for the actual vote.

of course, such a system would never be adopted by those that dont want one vote for each person as that really removes the ability to create votes

Even better would be to disclose the viewing-key of the z-address directly after the voting is concluded. This eliminates possible tampering of votes, being sent to a different candidate in the sweep.

@Evitor we have tested vDEX and liquidity pools on the testnet, so as soon as the defi mainnet is live, we will create the live liquidity pool. to get the vDEX, you will just need to send (burn) your existing DEX (and other revshare assetchains) and in return the vDEX will be sent


[07-Nov-20 12:47 AM] jl777c#5810
once you have the vDEX token, just use the Verus GUI to use the liquidity pool.

it should really be quite a simple process, just waiting for defi mainnet

It also has an added bonus: people can verify their own vote TXID on the address they sent their vote to, which makes it all transparent and tamperproof after disclosing.

[07-Nov-20 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, maybe some of the tech i made wont be used, but i think a decent amount of it will, its just that we would need half a dozen dedicated teams to fully utilize all the tech (just read jl777.com) and that isnt practical without a giant budget which we dont have

One way to look at it is that the tech you made requires a little extra handholding for people to use. Junior developers need to be cultivated.

making a 100% verifiable and 100% private election is not so hard using taddr/zaddr


[15-Nov-20 11:18 PM] jl777c#5810
registration via a "faucet" type of mechanism that links pubkey to ID (the ID needs to be externally validated). then the user has 1 coin they send via zaddr to whoever they want to vote for.
explorer nodes then have the viewkey for each candidate and simply tallies all the coins received and displays a richlist. the one with the most, wins


[15-Nov-20 11:18 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as you dont broadcast the exact moment you send in your zvote, it gets mixed in with all the other votes so it remains private.


[15-Nov-20 11:19 PM] jl777c#5810
all can verify that each ID that registered received a voting token, really using a faucet mechanism the only question is if a specific ID is valid and did they get more than one faucet. this can be verified as all this is in fully transparent taddr.


[15-Nov-20 11:21 PM] jl777c#5810
With the above, there is no more question if anybody that shouldnt have voted voted, nor whether if your vote was counted or not as the txid for each vote received by a candidate can be (and should be) available and you can verify your txid is on the list


[15-Nov-20 11:21 PM] jl777c#5810
fully decentralized voting


[15-Nov-20 11:22 PM] jl777c#5810
to make this easy to use via mobile app is what is needed. also, would be good to constrain the voting zaddr tx to be exactly 1 coin, that avoids the fractional vote issue. but this is an easy to add constraint, it seems the only core change that would be needed


[15-Nov-20 11:24 PM] jl777c#5810
also, a seperate blockchain would be created for each city/region whatever voting area is a single area. that allows it to scale up to whatever number of voters. of course, when a larger election across multiple voting areas are needed, there will need to be explorers that add up the rich lists from each voting area. this is again, fully verifiable and transparent and a matter to do addition


[15-Nov-20 11:26 PM] jl777c#5810
on a technical difficulty scale, this is a 1 out of 10, ie. very easy to do. so it seems the reason it isnt done is due to lack of demand for a fully transparent and private election system. that makes it impossible for people to change votes, etc. so has little value to those that like to do such things


[15-Nov-20 11:27 PM] jl777c#5810
for people who dont have smart phones, standard voting booths can be adapted to use this system on the backend, so really there is no excuse to not have 100% clean elections

The only thing I miss in this is locking in a constraint for the start/end time for voting. When a vote is cast before the end time? Was that when it was submitted to the memory pool?
What if the chains memory pool as at maximum capacity when the vote closes and votes do not get mined in before the vote closes?
Solving this into on-chain logic will avoid any discussion on whether or not a vote was cast before closing, thus being valid / invalid.


[15-Nov-20 11:36 PM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Of course start and end dates can be programmed into the app, but it will not remove the discussion. What if my devices time is seconds/minutes behind actual time? People will question every vote cast near the end for validity.
Possibly publishing a tombstone on chain, disallowing apps to submit any new transactions could do that, but it still relies on the app, not the chain (rogue apps don't need to obey the tombstone).


[15-Nov-20 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
publishing the viewkey will remove the privacy, so the additional step is for each candidate to sweep the funds to their taddr. as far as deadline, just specify a specific blockheight


[15-Nov-20 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
if the funds dont arrive by that blockheight in the candidates taddr, then it is invalid


[15-Nov-20 11:42 PM] jl777c#5810
up to each candidate to sweep in a timely fashion and also for voters to not procrastinate until last minute


[15-Nov-20 11:43 PM] jl777c#5810
each blockchains tx capacity vs pending votes can be tracked and indeed it is important to calibrate things so people dont get disenfranchised due to vote stuck in mempool. i think by having 2x to 5x the blockchain capacity vs expected votes would solve this problem.

also, there is no downside to allow early voting, so there can be a week ahead of time where people are voting. there is 100% chain of custody and transparency to what happened to each vote. i guess knowing that your vote txid was confirmed is enough to know your vote got to the correct zaddr


[15-Nov-20 11:46 PM] jl777c#5810
if you procrastinate your vote till the last hour, the odds of there not being enough time will increase, so dont do that.


[15-Nov-20 11:48 PM] jl777c#5810
to avoid miners trying to strand votes, all major candidates should be mining. though with the zaddr votes, it wont be clear which txids a specific candidate would want to suppress, so maybe it isnt much of an issue. only if it is clearly known that the procrastination votes are skewed toward one candidate would a hashing wars scenario make sense


[15-Nov-20 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
to avoid this issue, these could be made into staking chains where the staking nodes are prevented from moving their coins (to enforce this would require another small core change), but really if the main staking node coins get moved, it can just be declared an invalid election and whoever controlled those coins gets into big troubles and has to pay for all the costs of a doover

> publishing the viewkey will remove the privacy
afaik if the votes are being done **from** a z-address, there's no privacy removed, since you still cannot see where the votes are cast from. It does, however, enable every voter to check if his vote (TXID) ended up at the correct candidate and is counted

I do agree that the end limit as you suggest will work, it will however still leave room for discussion (that's not a blockchain thing, but a human trait). Clear, unambiguous rules ~~avoid~~ exclude that.


[16-Nov-20 12:22 AM] jl777c#5810
a clearly defined blocknumber removes all ambiguity


[16-Nov-20 12:24 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, adding a t->z on the user end and then voting from z -> z will allow viewkeys. but the user can see that their txid is on the blockchain even with simple t -> z voting, maybe to add privacy all votes should just go through a t -> z and z-> z voting. the viewkey can then be published or not.


[16-Nov-20 12:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i think with such a zvoting, the temptation to cheat gets basically removed as everybody will know that cheating would require breaking crypto algos with no known way to break them. all the major parties can create their own explorers for the tabulating, so either they all match or if they dont, the discrepancy can be sorted out objectively. using open source explorers, anybody could independently validate any election

[16-Nov-20 12:32 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe posting your name and address publicly as a voter is not anything that is private anyway?


[16-Nov-20 12:32 AM] jl777c#5810

mixing up voting addresses in the app, defining a cut-off block that is communicated differently, that sort of thing. It can be proven, but you still have to trust the organizing body to do it right. Standard auditing still applies to the registration, organizing and execution process.

[16-Nov-20 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the voting client can randomly delay broadcasting the tx to minimize the correlation, but with the level of machine learning AI that is out there, it is a losing battle to protect privacy of normal people that dont do anything to protect their privacy and go out of their way to lose all their privacy


[16-Nov-20 01:00 AM] jl777c#5810
i think if each candidate is able to personally verify that all the votes they got were swept to their taddr, that solves all the cases other than where a candidate is actually an imposter for the other side. but in that case, then regardless of who wins, it doesnt matter. so not sure this case matters


[16-Nov-20 01:02 AM] jansako#3330
If I may add a non-technical POW. The biggest hurdle here IMO would be the actual voter implementation. It is a psychology issue, not a technical one. Right now most of the voters would understand 0 of what was said above, while they would understand 'I put this here paper into an envelope and someone will open it and count.' 
The solution would likely be what was said earlier, introduce the concept on low-level non-regulated elections and let it grow.


[16-Nov-20 01:04 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as experts from all the major candidates agree that it is a verifiable system, that is what is important

Another way to circumvent traceability that is to airdrop the voting tokens directly to the registered voters private addresses, so no analysis can be made when the voting process started. It raises the question though how to audit that process, since there will be no way to track if only registered voters got a token, other than checking the database used for the airdrop and the airdrop process itself.


[16-Nov-20 01:04 AM] jl777c#5810
no need for all voters to understand, only that people they trust will vouch for it


[16-Nov-20 01:04 AM] jl777c#5810
airdrop is nonauditable and a non-starter


[16-Nov-20 01:05 AM] jansako#3330
What you do not want is the 'experts' from two sides trying to present the case of how the other side cheated to a panel of voters (or whoever) that have no clue as to what the heck are they all talking about. 
'Clear and transparent' per jl777 understanding is definitely not the same level as your average voter, not sure even for a Mensa president election:-)

[16-Nov-20 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i think most people will be able to understand that they just need to compare the totals in the candidates addresses


[16-Nov-20 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
the backend process will be fully open source and then anybody in the community can find out whatever they want to

the problem right now is that it is impossible for anybody, regardless of how smart they are, to validate anything about the election with so much trust built into the process


[16-Nov-20 01:11 AM] jl777c#5810
changing that so that anybody of reasonable intelligence can for themselves audit the process seems quite a bit better


[16-Nov-20 01:11 AM] jl777c#5810
now, maybe for ussa a tweak to the voting process could be made where you can simply buy 1 vote for 1 USD

How would you solve the ability of someone to ask someone else to vote for them? As in if the whole fam hand over their smartphones to the kid that is the only one who understands how to use these?

in person voting

I understand OpSec is the answer, but the avg voter has again no idea what that is


[16-Nov-20 01:12 AM] jl777c#5810
it still must be part of the process


[16-Nov-20 01:12 AM] jl777c#5810
for people who dont have the ability to run an app on a smart phone


[16-Nov-20 01:13 AM] jl777c#5810
just make the in person process do all the things the smart phone app does


[16-Nov-20 01:13 AM] jl777c#5810
not hard


[16-Nov-20 01:14 AM] jansako#3330
but the in-person is an option right, not a 'must', like now?


[16-Nov-20 01:14 AM] jansako#3330
So all of the above still comes to play


[16-Nov-20 01:14 AM] jl777c#5810
the in person systems are integrated into the identical zvoting


[16-Nov-20 01:15 AM] jansako#3330
If in-person is a must, then it would be a great stepping stone to 'just' use on-chain voting as a back-end to election


[16-Nov-20 01:15 AM] jl777c#5810
and you can have partisans helping you vote, just pick your own party rep to help you vote


[16-Nov-20 01:15 AM] jansako#3330
Isn't that illegal? to have another person helping you vote? Pretty sure it is, at least in my country


[16-Nov-20 01:15 AM] jl777c#5810
it wont matter who is helping you vote as all is auditable


[16-Nov-20 01:16 AM] jansako#3330
Unless grandma comes out and says I told them to vote for X and they voted for Z!


[16-Nov-20 01:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i would imagine many people would need help in voting via electronic system


[16-Nov-20 01:16 AM] jl777c#5810
but in this case, each voter gets a "i voted" txid


[16-Nov-20 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
which can then be used to verify if it confirmed on chain


[16-Nov-20 01:17 AM] jansako#3330
Notwithstanding that there must not be another person to see HOW you vote. I don't care but (right now) the law does so 'in-person' help is out


[16-Nov-20 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we just need to make the voting app so easy to use, non technical people can do it


[16-Nov-20 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
and the "help" would be limited to a mock vote on testnet


[16-Nov-20 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are unable to figure out how to vote, then you cant vote


[16-Nov-20 01:18 AM] jansako#3330
Yes, and voting machines are meant to be easy to use & mostly are working. Over time I think it will become more and more a moot point


[16-Nov-20 01:19 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe just make the voting machine front end connect to a zvoting backend


[16-Nov-20 01:19 AM] jansako#3330
"if you are unable to figure out how to vote, then you cant vote" this is a major NO-NO!


[16-Nov-20 01:19 AM] jl777c#5810

that is why is suggested to bypass this fuzzy process and go straight to a system where you can buy votes directly from the blockchain


[16-Nov-20 01:25 AM] jl777c#5810
this would then go a long way toward subsidizing development of an independently funded voting systems


[16-Nov-20 01:26 AM] jl777c#5810
and like jansako said, having a system very similar to existing system has higher chance of adoption


[16-Nov-20 01:26 AM] barv#0867

You realize if you allow direct selling of votes then the candidate with the most $ always* wins?

people with no stake in the system should not get to vote. thats why decentralized voting works for NN. If you only allowed people who paid taxes to vote you would have no issues.


[16-Nov-20 03:47 AM] jl777c#5810
best that people get the phone apps from sources they trust, ie. from the websites of their preferred candidate


[16-Nov-20 03:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the question of who is able to vote is outside the scope of the blockchain


[16-Nov-20 03:50 AM] blubbi#0643
still if apps secure, wouldnt there be a possibility of integrate backdoors by manufactory of hardware


[16-Nov-20 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as you verify the txid represents the vote you want to make and that txid confirms, then it will show that your vote is counted


[16-Nov-20 03:53 AM] jl777c#5810
a compromised device would be able to compromise your privacy


[16-Nov-20 03:53 AM] jl777c#5810
or prevent you from submitting a vote, but that is detectable


[16-Nov-20 03:55 AM] jl777c#5810
there will always be some level of vulnerability, but what is described is orders of magnitude better than what passes for election infrastructure


[16-Nov-20 03:55 AM] jl777c#5810
the smaller countries that can do personally verified manual votes have much more secure elections


[16-Nov-20 03:55 AM] jl777c#5810
the zvoting will get close to that level


[16-Nov-20 03:56 AM] blubbi#0643
if the device doing the vote in the last seconds, from probably non-voters, nobody would verfiy or complain


[16-Nov-20 03:56 AM] jl777c#5810
why would you say that???


[16-Nov-20 03:57 AM] jl777c#5810
the entire point is that all votes are auditable, by anybody


[16-Nov-20 03:57 AM] jl777c#5810
non-voters would have had to obtain voting coin improperly, since all issuing of coins is transparent, this can be found


[16-Nov-20 03:57 AM] blubbi#0643
if dont care about my vote, or forget about, i wont take a look into the app if my vote is still there


[16-Nov-20 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
and certainly if such illegal votes are found, i would imagine that someone would complain


[16-Nov-20 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
you might not care, but the app can easily check that your txid was confirmed as soon as it was sent


[16-Nov-20 03:59 AM] jl777c#5810
of course if you dont care about your vote to make sure you were online to even submit the vote, then basically that means you didnt vote. this system wont count votes from people that dont bother to vote


[16-Nov-20 03:59 AM] jl777c#5810
i suggest that is a good thing


[16-Nov-20 04:01 AM] jl777c#5810
the voting software can be validated to be working properly, hashes of the binaries posted, said hashes compared before installing. that assures non-compromised software is running


[16-Nov-20 04:02 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as compromised hardware, that is indeed a bit more difficult, but the app can validate the raw transaction to make sure it is the proper encoding of the desired vote. with that validation and checking the txid, whatever compromise the hardware has would be rendered ineffective in stopping or changing the vote


[16-Nov-20 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
also, such validation can be made semi-automatic in the software


[16-Nov-20 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
all the user would have to do is make sure that the displayed vote matches what they selected


[16-Nov-20 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
and we already made sure the software was a non-compromised one with the matching hash


[16-Nov-20 04:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i think you missed the point that as soon as the txid is confirmed, your vote is counted


[16-Nov-20 04:10 AM] blubbi#0643
i guess with the software theres ways to verify, but what about the hardware, aslong as all chips, smartphone manufactored in only two countries there is the lack of security


[16-Nov-20 04:10 AM] blubbi#0643
and aslong as only non-voters are manipulated whos gonna verfiy and complain


[16-Nov-20 04:11 AM] blubbi#0643
im thinking about the  Crypto Ag and CIA Operation Minerva


[16-Nov-20 04:14 AM] jl777c#5810
i repeat, regardless of how compromised the hardware is, if the software validates the proper vote for txid and txid being confirmed, the compromised hardware didnt compromise the vote


[16-Nov-20 04:15 AM] jl777c#5810
you can run software on compromised hardware and detect if it tries to change what the software is submitting.


[16-Nov-20 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, if the compromised phone broadcasts a cognitive override and makes the user hallucinate that the software recorded things properly, when it didnt, then it can compromise the vote. luckily we are not aware of any phone hack that allows cognitive overrides


[16-Nov-20 04:27 AM] blubbi#0643
cant a compromised hardware broadcast the software vote, without knowledge of the user

yes, but it can be detected and the user can complain


[16-Nov-20 04:27 AM] jl777c#5810
but we assume the software was checked


[16-Nov-20 04:28 AM] blubbi#0643
but if there is no monitoring user, thinking about non-voters


[16-Nov-20 04:28 AM] jl777c#5810
concerned voters can just input their txid into any explorer


[16-Nov-20 04:29 AM] jl777c#5810
unconcerned voters that dont bother to do this and run compromised hardware that somehow overrides a vote, yes that will go undetected

yet this system is still a million times better

Compromised hardware would have to be designed and fabricated *after* the software is finalized. If not it would not likely to function, since the final product can change. If that prerequisite is met than it would be *possible*, yet not likely. Furthermore this kind of tampering would be detected (by people voting late, but not being able to because their vote is already cast) and the supply chain can be traced to the culprit initiating this.


[16-Nov-20 04:33 AM] jl777c#5810
the key is to give the user a txid of a confirmed vote and then to validate that on the blockchain

Here are my opinions about elections and voting systems. Voting or general elections by central governments are not profitable for BlockChainers at all. Those One Law For All institutions make elections once every several years and after that they do not care about opinions of public at all. But it is very important and also profitable for BlockChain communities. Actually there can be continuous events for handling voting and decisions inside communities in daily activities.

Maybe create more representatives so they are closer to their constituents. instead of 1 person representing 500k how about 1 person represents 5-10k


[17-Nov-20 07:56 AM] BlackJesus#6161
use the blockchain to elect that person


[17-Nov-20 07:56 AM] BlackJesus#6161
then his account becomes active to vote on issues as they arise


[17-Nov-20 07:58 AM] BlackJesus#6161
put everything to a vote and representatives are responsible for being current on issues and representing his constituency as well as voting whenever issues are pushed to a vote.


[17-Nov-20 07:59 AM] BlackJesus#6161
when the numbers become too big, it's like controlling a legion... Casualties are expected and you can become numb to them. Atleast food for thought.


[17-Nov-20 09:00 AM] lightspeed393#5403
@BlackJesus I agree with you that blockchain technology is definitly the way forward for voting. You got me thinking though, if we got to the point of everyone voting on all issues as they arise, what is the point of the elected representative anymore? Or at least smaller ones on the local levels. The way things work now, in a sense, is we vote for a representative who represents our interests on these matters as they arise. This way allows for them to choose no matter the opinion of voters, for good and bad. Good because compromises can be made between the opposing views. Bad because we don't have a true say on every issue. My worry is that if we all voted yes/no on every issue, it would just cause more divide as only 1 side is ever *winning* rather than encouraging people to work together. Representatives also make it so that all people do not need to pay as close attention to every matter and have an educated decision. If we think people that are manipulated by media and other factors now are bad, think about the potential downfall if everyone was voting on everything. I do think people need to be more engaged and educated on everyday political decisions but to what extent is it beneficial?


[17-Nov-20 09:02 AM] BlackJesus#6161
That's why I had the idea of still retaining the representatives it does us no good to all be 100% informed it needs to be delegated, but at a maintainable level to where there isn't a disconnect which exists now.


[17-Nov-20 09:05 AM] lightspeed393#5403
I'm just thinking out loud, I also think they'd still be necessary, I'm just questioning to what degree. I guess in maybe an electoral college type of way.. where our votes really just show the representative the true numbers but still leave the decision to them.


[17-Nov-20 10:56 AM] jansako#3330
"My worry is that if we all voted yes/no on every issue, it would just cause more divide as only 1 side is ever winning rather than encouraging people to work together." This here is the main issue. If we take a position on a proposal based on which side it came from, the we already lost. This POW is where mainstream media (drama = eyballs = ad revenue) is pushing us towards. I wish there was an easier solution other than constantly raising the education, understanding and 'caring' level of the average voter...


[17-Nov-20 10:59 AM] jansako#3330
You could also turn the argument around, and expect the 'proposer' to put forward proposals that appeal to more people than just their base. That way it is not 'one side always wins', cause it will be a compromise proposal to begin with. But that would mean we expect them to care for more than just their base. Too naive, I know!

blockchain voting is the future one way or another guys, maybe with a layered proxy/delegation system so ppl can vote if they're engaged enough to pass their vote to trusted friend/leader automatically if they miss a vote, all systems will be exploited to some degree but more transparency and engaged population the better


hey @jl777c i've been researching kmd/antara as basis for migrating my project to its own chain, its pretty impressive system u've all built, is there an example of the white label wallet & dex l can look at?
would a customised dex automatically share order books with atomic dex?
also any potential problems to have a chain 100% POS with 100% pre-mine? 
and how difficult to add an extra rule for block creation where a custom data field is required attached to each block that a consensus of stakers have to agree upon?
Thanks!


[17-Nov-20 02:21 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Collider  1) Atomicdex desktop 2) make sure you have enough utxos staking so you don‚Äôt freeze the chain 3)  would require custom work not sure how much


[17-Nov-20 02:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Depends on how you customize the DEX if it shares orderbooks


[17-Nov-20 06:53 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@Collider if it is 100% premined why do you need staking?

ideally, you want your project to be able to perpetuate miners/stakers interest via it's own merit. application and interpretation. premines are pretty notorious for a reason. blockchain devs are either philosophically inclined or very well paid.

[17-Nov-20 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810
changing consensus rules is always a bit tricky, but what you describe certainly can be done. the DTO requires specific data to be there before a block is valid, so you can model it after that


[18-Nov-20 12:07 AM] Collider#6160
thanks for the input guys, my project is https://cryptocollider.com (trading arena game), the idea being to decentralise collider coin and its functions one step at a time, beginning with creation of a native chain which embeds each block with a single game's input & output data which is agreed upon by a consensus of collider coin holders/game watchers (equivalent to miners but the reward for block creation is the finalisation/confirmation of the games which produce fees for the collider coin holders in each of the different coins played and allows for the next game to be played)

distribution of collider coin from the 'pre-mine' account also happens via swapping for points earnt for playing and confirming games, so while all collider coin need to exist from the beginning and i could use pre-mine option for that, its actually only the cc earnt through playing & confirming games that will be in-circulation and tradable through dex or cex although on-chain enforcement of those rules can come at a later step

does that make sense?


[18-Nov-20 12:10 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, this is similar in structure to the ROGUE chain that was setup. the premine was locked and released as people earned ingame gold

not sure if you are able to (or want to) prevent automated bots from playing and getting coins. ultimately that is probably the hardest issue to deal with, though at first there wont be any bots available for a new game, so it is just something to have in mind for the future


[18-Nov-20 12:38 AM] jl777c#5810
also if the mining reward is small enough relative to the locked coins, then you can make it PoW and avoid all the PoS issues


[18-Nov-20 12:40 AM] jl777c#5810
like a 0.1 block reward, would be 144 coins per day, 144000 coins every 1000 days. if the locked coins are 144 million, the dilution from mining is literally a rounding error, even after years


[18-Nov-20 12:44 AM] Collider#6160
thanks again i'll do more reading and come back with a more detailed plan/questions, will be huge steps forward for my game(s) and fortunately the trading arena is designed with bots in-mind kinda like how cant avoid bots in traditional trading

thats a good point on POW vs POS as well, so there will be security benefit from running as POW instead of POS? isnt there security benefit from POS as the locked coins (and almost all unlocked coins) are held by known good actor?


[18-Nov-20 12:47 AM] jl777c#5810
despite what PoS advocates claim, pure PoW is still the best consensus mechanism with smallest attack surface. and locked coins dont add any security, so only the coins that are freely available are staking... which can easily lead to slow block production. if you went 100% PoW but add aPoW (and eventually dPoW), then it will allow CPU to mine the chain, even in presence of on/off ASIC miners


[18-Nov-20 12:48 AM] jl777c#5810
once your chain is up and running, i can offer a pro bono dPoW for it as this would be the first production PoG chain


[18-Nov-20 12:49 AM] jl777c#5810
with PoS you need to be very precise during the initial blocks to prevent it from stalling, or worse being dominated from a few (or single) staker who ends up with more and more of the supply. these issues can be avoided with careful planning, but it requires the careful planning.


[18-Nov-20 12:49 AM] jl777c#5810
with PoW, just launch it and it takes care of itself


[18-Nov-20 12:50 AM] jl777c#5810
do it with a large premine relative to block reward to make it not a meaningful percentage. then lock the funds with a few hundred utxos to allow parallel claiming of the locked funds


[18-Nov-20 12:56 AM] Collider#6160
thats interesting maybe a short pow block time could solve problem of the ordering of inputs from multiple players but how would it be protected from miner roll back/reordering of the game inputs so bad miner could control order of the 'throws' (inputs) and thus control game outcome?


[18-Nov-20 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
regardless of who controls block production, if the gameplay is affected by the blocks, that is a vulnerability that exists


[18-Nov-20 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to design it so that the gameplay is not dependent on block production


[18-Nov-20 01:00 AM] jl777c#5810
one way is to use realtime offchain transactions with observer nodes that record the packets. my posts above go into such things, best to understand it first


[18-Nov-20 01:02 AM] jl777c#5810
also with dPoW, once notarized, reorgs are not possible. but there will be a latency for this, i assume gameplay needs to have low latency, which means an offchain p2p network (maybe -dexp2p can be used) to coordinate the gameplay and only confirmed (and attested to) results go into transactions, which can then be mined out of order without any harm


[18-Nov-20 01:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if a once per minute RNG is sufficient, you can use the DTO that puts the NIST random number beacon in each block


[18-Nov-20 01:04 AM] jl777c#5810
combining that with synchronized clocks, a hash chain can be used to create arbitrary number of RNG in between the beacon values. this externalizes all the RNG to an external and verifiable source


[18-Nov-20 01:04 AM] jl777c#5810
and would be nearly impossible to modify as it would require changing values in the NIST RNG beacon


[18-Nov-20 01:07 AM] jl777c#5810
depending on how many random numbers you need per minute (blocktime), you can define the RNG for a specific millisecond to be HASH(N,NIST,GAME) where N is the millisecond number, NIST is the RNG beacon, GAME is the hash specific to a game, game/player, whatever the resolution is needed ingame. so each millisecond (microsecond) there is a specific random number that can be used, where all nodes will arrive at the same value. it can also be game turn id (that is MUCH easier than time synced)

i couldnt find the rules for your game on the website, if you post url i can look at it and make more specific recommendations. it seems like it can be made into a turn based game but not sure what latency is required. it could just be a matter for each player adding their own hash to make it impossible for the next player to predict the RNG value. not sure

ur right only linked from inside the game


[18-Nov-20 01:42 AM] Collider#6160
each player takes turns but they dont have to be alternate, and there could be any number of players
game could be 1 player with 45 throws or 10 players with 45 throws, throw has trajectory data and weight based on value, they all combine then in shared physics environment and result is deterministic based on the same input always same result
each throw could change all result so while is possible to predict outcome based on current input, it changes more quickly as throws become more popular/competitive, it would be interesting to see what happens if it gets busy enough for ppl to develop bots for it


[18-Nov-20 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
seems you will need an offchain p2p network to timestamp the various throws, with observer nodes


[19-Nov-20 12:57 AM] Collider#6160
yes i think the observer node part (which i've used term 'confirmers') is what i have built currently, that all players are validating the results based on common set of inputs/throws & shared physics, but then a server is responsible for a lot still, i'm thinking steps towards full decentralisation would be...

1. start notarising game input & outputs into a smart chain that has collider coin as its native token
2. start using the off-chain or on-chain system for transparently ordering the inputs/throws & other rules like points rewards (currently done server-side) 
3. use system modeled on gateway/proxy coins or dex-like liquidity pools to enable control of multi-chain transactions (game inputs & outputs) in on-chain space that maintains complete user control of throw/input funds and verifiable outputs 
4. implement collider coin based governance rules so the entire system can be maintained/updated by its users

i know thats all quite a mission but i'm hoping no1 can be achievable fairly soon and charting out the full plan so based on ur input it can be refined and any steps taken now like in creating the smart chain will ensure its easily up-gradable to accommodate the full plan

the various games CC simply locked funds in a specific address and the game validation rules controlled their release. it seems your 3. above is overly complex and not needed to achieve its goal


[19-Nov-20 02:14 AM] jl777c#5810
2. seems to be the critical part that the rest will revolve around. tricky but doable is my feeling about that one


[19-Nov-20 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
4. can be a stake weighted voting done by tokens CC issued and airdropped to everyone. getsnapshot creates a handy list of all addresses with funds, so parse the JSON and tokensend proportional voting tokens to the getsnapshot list. then people simple send their token to the desired outcome. tally the winner and implement the change


[19-Nov-20 02:17 AM] jl777c#5810
1. seems to be a matter of putting game data in opreturns, maybe with signatures from observers. if the observers are stake weighted, then that will prevent fake observers with the tradeoff that people with the coins have more power to observe (and potentially cheat)


[19-Nov-20 02:18 AM] jl777c#5810
though if they have a large stake, then cheating is counterproductive, so it should be ok

[19-Nov-20 04:00 AM] jl777c#5810
do you use floating point in the game calculations? if so, they could create consensus problems. a way to be able to keep using floating point is for the observer nodes to validate it and have the consensus based on the observer nodes and not the floating point calcs. however that would create another trust point... so best if the game calcs can be done without consensus problems


[19-Nov-20 05:31 AM] Collider#6160
yeh the game physics is using floating point and im not sure how or if that could be changed but i kinda always expected those nodes, that are essentially players & collider coin holders, being responsible for the consensus

Is there a way to conduct decentralised airdrops to everybody holding a coin/token?
Something that works like this:
People utilise a service using a coin. A percentage of the service cost is then taken out (presumably sent to an address or a global CC address) and airdropped to the coin holders every x amount of blocks/time.


[21-Nov-20 08:19 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I see how this could be done if a centralised node was to manage the airdrop address and manually do it. But is there a trustless way of having this occur?


[21-Nov-20 08:19 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Maybe a CC that any funds that go into the globalCC address are automatically sent to all addresses as a portion of your holdings, every x block?


[21-Nov-20 08:22 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Or could this be done with paymentsCC?

@NutellaLicka payments CC needs more testing, and such a case seems a good test for it


[22-Nov-20 04:26 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The problem i see is that payments requires a set allocation to a set number of addresses for that payment plan. To change the allocation and addresses requires a new payment plan, which is a manual task and centralised to whoever creates it.

In a decentralised version, the snapshot would automatically occur, and every address would receive their payment amount (of whatever funds are in the global address) based on the % of coins that address holds. This would occur on a set schedule, say per N blocks.


[22-Nov-20 04:28 AM] jl777c#5810
custom code would be required for custom behavior


[22-Nov-20 04:38 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Makes sense. I will add it to the future plans list.

I think decentralised organisations could benefit from such a feature. Or any chain that wanted the profits that are generate from the coins usage, to go to the holders of the coin.


[22-Nov-20 04:44 AM] jl777c#5810

Arent the economics of burning coins different to spreading the funds to holders though. 
A big factor being mental as people know they're directly receiving a benefit. A dividend is easier for people to quantify and put value to rather than burning and working out how much the deflation has affected their holdings.
Another being the deflationary aspect of burning. I guess for a coin it isnt such a big deal because they are divisible down to a satoshi. But im also thinking for tokens, and they don't have that luxury unless you create a shit tonne at the start.

Also, thinking about how this feature would be used in a decentralised network, the psychological affect would be compounded even more so because the cost of using the service/network would be increasing as you burnt coins. So not only would the cost of use increase, but you wouldn't immediately see the effect the burning would have on your funds worth. 

For example:
A decentralised utilities network (very basically). Coin X represents ownership of the entire utilities network. Customer A changes to this utilities network for their electricity. They use electricity and get sent a 500 Coin X bill, they have to purchase the coin to pay for their bill. They buy 1000 Coin X and pay their 500 Coin X bill. Because they now hold 500 Coin X, they are paid a dividend of N based on their holdings divided by the total amount of coins. Customer B, C & D also had to pay bills, so customer A got a percentage of the profit from their bills too.

If you were to burn the profits (or percentage of), Customer A would not see any immediate return from their holdings (without doing the maths and working out their value increased), they would also notice their electricity bill start to increase over time as the burns occur.


[23-Nov-20 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but on a percentage of coin supply owned, there is a gain that should be the same. maybe it is a matter of the GUI displaying the percentage of total coinsupply that you have in addition to the coins

Hello my team and I are trying to architect a project that is based on komodo. What is the best way to architect the communication between our application and komodo? We are thinking of potentially using a nodejs server for our platform and then making AWS lambda calls C++/C for the komodo blockchain


[23-Nov-20 05:19 AM] DigitalDan#5742

[23-Nov-20 05:34 AM] Mylo#8306
lambda would work no problem with RPC (nodejs, python, serverless framework). you will need to have rpcallowip in the configs for komodod to work.  we used lamdba/dynamodb for syncing between 100s of blockchains, but only so we could "dos" lambda for when to begin the transaction blasting.

not enough info.
in the project i'm working on, each organization has a node, and then there is a "public data" node (which is centralized access to the data).  all of them tied to the application by RPC calls, or offline wallets (sign & broadcast tx via explorer).

[23-Nov-20 03:04 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Indeed. Thinking about wide scale adoption, if people don't understand something, or find it hard to use, then they are less likely to use it. The GUI suggestion may provide the people with enough information, but I'd say the value of having a set coin supply, with incoming payments that are easy to understand and use would have value in and of itself. So the effect can be achieve through coin burn, but would require a custom antara module or changing of the payments module to be done in the way I described.

it makes kmd better as a currency because it's not deflationary... although it's still arguably an arbitrary inflation rate that may be less (or more) than demand for inflation. maybe that doesn't matter if interest-based kmd loans aren't a thing.  Plus  Marmara chain might have it handled nicely with the on-demand credit creation


[25-Nov-20 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it is to make sure there are incentives to be notary nodes. 1 KMD per block is very very low inflation rate. we probably dont go over 200 million KMD for some decades and after that it goes up by 0.25% per year and shrinking as a percentage

But I think searching is a good avenue for it.  I mean blockchain network to me at least is like a CDN . Now with the avenue several projects including ourselves are going with multichain architecture.  Needed information could be stored on another chain,  basically the AI could find best search method to access the information.   Based on query to obtain a match .  Now we know blockchain is not efficient for storing large amounts of data so that data would have to be highly compressed to compensate which means there is a computational cost to checking.  So using ai to figure out least amount of search would be greatly beneficial .   @grewalsatinder  sorry just did a dive into this lately and wanted to chime in

i could make a blockchain that used improvement of the best AI models as mining. that would then create a "proof of better AI model" consensus. as far as using blockchain in conjunction with AI (a very broad question), probably good to understand that the blockchain is good for determining the single version of history, in spite of having parties that dont trust each other. AI is good for... well, seems whatever requires normal intelligence, lets say decision making. so to combine them is to have an immutable history of decisions made.

@jl777c what you think of proof of work consensus model where miners have reputation score what in lowest state wont allow finding more than two blocks in row and after that network is requiring other miners to continue on that? also miners would gain reputarion score by being miners in past that have finded blocks. idea is to prevent 51% attack by relying that miners has being useful for network in past and is gaining network trust in case of forks.


[01-Dec-20 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
it can be implemented, but probably wont achieve the desired effect. it would make the attacker have to mine normally before conducting the attack.


[01-Dec-20 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
remember an attacker can just make several "good reputation" pubkeys and when the chain is rewritten it will rewrite it with a longer chain composed of the good reputation pubkeys and then others on top of that. you didnt specify if the reputation allows to solve blocks with a lower diff, that might make it that much harder but over time seems to give a bigger and bigger advantage to long term miners making it much harder for new miners


[01-Dec-20 07:26 AM] Mylo#8306

komodo is on the leading edge of INTEROPERABILITY in the crypto world
this has long time been your vision, you've seen this and been working on this for years...
making interoperability is so difficult, is that what founds the vision of  multichain architecture, which also handles SCALABILITY?
i think dPOW is already using the principle of interoperability, just on a more crude level, is there any truth to that?
what does interoperable look like to you in 5, 10 years?  where will it go beyond wrapping tokens & using them on other chains? (non-custodial atomic swaps is a huge advancement yet to be adopted, so perhaps that's what is in store for the next 5 years) 
Komodo offers a blockchain architecture with easy interoperability & independence & tons of features to add/subtract... which other blockchains have you seen are on this leading edge with komodo?

notarizations also allow creation of trustless bridges by enabling merkle proofs of any transaction on any chain, regardless of what chain you are on. this tech has been in place for a couple years now, but we havent been able to productize it yet. maybe it will take a few more years to get it so we can seamlessly use multichains. since the fundamentals work, it is matter of the time consuming engineering of the finished product

the re-engineering will need to be more than just wallets, everything from the core, wallets to explorers and anything that uses it, so yes it will indeed take 5+ years for all of that to be upgraded. good news is that with nSPV it can all be done in a superlite mode too

We are building our 'Final Fantasy' wallet from scratch so this can be easily accomplished since our PROD team from Russia is wicked good LOL - just need another UI module in our app

locked funds using CC wont be spendable via normal pubkeys, which atomicDEX uses

nSPV is so fascinating to me... dpow, nspv, merkle of merkle of merkle - they're layers of abstraction... they act with a meta property... like taking it to the next order of magnitude;
what a cool result --> superlight clients


[09-Dec-20 02:03 PM] ejuliano#8606
what do you mean about seamlessly use multichains? could you elaborate a bit?  i think i understand what you mean about notarizations allowing trustless bridges by capturing merkle proofs... probably i just don't quite understand where this all leads, I need some context.  I mean what does using multichains in this sense, look like in the cryptocurrency blockchain future?

Burning & minting a utxo between chains. It is "burn protocol" back in AWS scaling days in 2018.

The utxo back then was the traditional utxo of value, but nowadays devs like dimxy have enabled tokenCC utxo to be burned and minted to new chain.

That is approximate info, needs confirmation, elaboration.


[09-Dec-20 11:15 PM] jl777c#5810
@ejuliano if you can verify a txid from the raw transaction (and raw transaction allows you to verify all details about the transaction) and you can verify that the txid is "included" in a specific merkle root and you can also prove that that merkleroot is "contained" in a specific notarized MoM (merkle of merkle roots), then you can prove any transaction on any chain that is notarized on any other chainn


[09-Dec-20 11:15 PM] jl777c#5810
what a specific transaction represents is totally open ended


[09-Dec-20 11:16 PM] jl777c#5810
which means there is a way to trustlessly prove any transaction on any notarized chain, where transactions can have payments, data,  contracts, etc


[09-Dec-20 11:17 PM] jl777c#5810
a single usecase for this is the burn protocol, where you burn coins on one chain and then prove it on another chain, which in turn "imports" the coins (equivalent to what was burned)


[09-Dec-20 11:18 PM] jl777c#5810
how many usecases are there? it is like asking how many types of data there,  how many algorithms are there


[09-Dec-20 11:18 PM] jl777c#5810
basically anything can be blockchained (even proof of gameplay level of things) and using a superlite node be able to validate it

That‚Äôs the idea, to open up token to coin / token to token trading across multiple chains.   Lumens may require something like the monero style solution.  Tezos I believe is being worked on

@mike n. Tron briefly commented on this during the stress test (see Atomicdex stress test channel, around 5:49am Sunday) If I understood correctly, it‚Äôs just a matter of adding the right config presently (so it should work?) but he suggested that ideally there would be a direct implementation of Raven into atomicdex to avoid having to configure each one.

[29-Dec-20 11:56 AM] tolken#2655
Ahh, got it. Largely comes down to money. I believe the strategy, as mentioned by others, is to push AtomicDex to completion and gain some traction there, attract some attention and hopefully some goodwill. Talent attracts talent and while we have some great talent here, it isn‚Äôt widely obvious without considerable investigation. Having a successful product usable, like Atomicdex could go a long way to expose the kind of energy behind the KMD ecosystem. Unfortunately getting developers isn‚Äôt use a matter of waving a big fat check in the air and hoping one will bite. It‚Äôs far more successful if there‚Äôs strong buzz about a project, undeniable progress. Big companies benefit from hiring simply because people want to be part of success, not just the paycheck.  The paycheck locks them in, but it‚Äôs largely the brand and ideas that bring them to the hiring table. KMD unfortunately doesn‚Äôt enjoy that brand recognition yet, but hopefully it will continue to build on its momentum.

@tolken  it really is a chicken and the egg type of situation. Need more $ to get more devs, but can't get more $ cause of the low price which limits the dev resources which is hurting the price

Video streaming would be great, but a distraction unless we have resources to do it. It‚Äôs an end-user product that perhaps KMD can eventually do a proof of concept, unless you have a visionary/proficient team on it, could be another distraction. Do it well, or don‚Äôt do it. For whatever reason, Adex was selected as the most likely project to be completed, as for how it directly benefits KMD, that‚Äôs hard to quantify. Without some great marketing to tie KMD to Atomicdex, I‚Äôm not sure how many people will care. That said, if I had limited resources and I saw AtomicDex as something that could be achieved within a short time frame, I think it‚Äôs a very smart decision to focus and get it done, otherwise spend perhaps 5 more years trying to get it working and perhaps no one will care. Getting a working end-user product is very important to perception of a project‚Äôs health. MM2 is very sexy in that respect and I suspect will continue to be adopted by many. It‚Äôs truly time for marketing to yell from the the rooftop what has been achieved. Contrast that with when BarterDex was here, it just wasn‚Äôt ready for the masses and would have just frustrated most users.


[29-Dec-20 12:44 PM] tolken#2655
As for telling people what plans are - KMD has done this well about a couple years ago - the roadmap for the dex was pretty damn spot on and they have delivered in virtually every way. To be quite honest though, my perception of the ‚Äòplan‚Äô is quite muddled right now. It feels as if KMD has ground to a halt this past year (again, I‚Äôm talking perception, not necessarily reality) I plan to dig deep into CCs in the next couple months to see what I can do with KMD. We need more high-level examples of what KMD can do (perhaps like videostreaming, gaming) that people can try for themselves on the website, I hope to try and help in that respect.

Just a question..
 wouldn't a 50%attack - even when not-successful - be a danger to a dex trx in two chains ?  
So when organized well, a group could set up a big dex transaction and get a real incoming on one chain and a fake counter-part on the other chain, that is corrected and erased in the next block.. ?


[29-Dec-20 01:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Why incorporate a dex in there and not just scan an easily atackable chain for large tx‚Äôes?


[29-Dec-20 03:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@klein592  that is why it is recommended to wait for dpow confs,  even though it takes longer for chains that have them enabled.   for chains that dont you have to rely on their confirms and some sense of whether the economic value of the swap that you are doing is worth attacking.   Attack would have to be successful to undo the tx, atomic swaps have steps that are confirmed before they proceed to the next

@hastrup once you cashout HODL, you have cashed out. if we do sell some more SF, then the buyback price might be increased, but it is very very slow to sell so i wouldnt count on it

we have been trying to sell it for longer than that


[30-Dec-20 01:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the revenues from it are just some small amount of SF, so there is not much demand for them

If native mode seems to be the best way to be legally compliant but large blockchain size is a deterrent to easy functionality. Then why not cap blockchain size at (100 mb for this discussion)? Using kmd interoperability and momom then why not just create a new chain every 100 mb? Wouldn't you only need the most recent chain or worst case scenario, download another 100mb chain?

nSPV would be a hybrid option to bootstrap: only download the needed blocks between notarizations in which your wallet has transactions. The wallet could purge unneeded notarized periods in which no transactions are done to any of the wallet addresses.
(I believe that's what PIRATE does with their lite wallet)

I have a couple of questions. Background: My team and I are building an application where the transaction part of it is decentralized. Essentially the users will purchase X stable coin (need  recommendation for X) with FIAT, another crypto, etc... Then the user will have this stablecoin as their "in-game currency" for our application. The users will be able to wager this in-game currency against each other . 

Questions : 1) What is the best stablecoin to use for the above use case? Things to consider are: need to be easily purchased with Credit card, debit, bank , have low fees, and reputable 2) How do we store this "in-game currency" which equates to stablecoin X on our own smartchain - is this possible?


[03-Jan-21 08:21 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
1) There will be a stablecoin that will be coming out this year that will fit your requirements better than any existent one.   First should practice and get familiar with the mechanisms and tools that you will be using 2)  A module like CC Pegs could do that . https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/pegs.html#introduction.   As I mentioned in our call you will probably face more difficulty in the legal end of things than the tech.

[04-Jan-21 11:10 AM] DigitalDan#5742
That makes sense that there will be a legal hurdle. However, what would be a stavlecoin we can achieve the rest of the functionality with. If our application just allows users to hold that stablecoin and wager it against eachother would it still constitute as an in game currency...

This rumors has to be wrong. I asked JL777 two months ago why there are that many coins except KMD.

His answer was because of regulations. - To keep KMD from rewards to stay compliant. So my assumption is, the DEX coin will stay for the reward stream.

Here are some of the last quotes that speak about dex assets ```all that is happening at this step is DEX (and others) are being. converted to vDEX so we can. use the verus liquidity pool

@Deleted User 
There's more announcements to come over DEX assets and revenue sharing assets.  We don't have the information right now, what I can tell you is that it's been made clear by JL777 that those involved in those assets are not going to be abandoned.  What their future looks like as far as implementation is unclear, and being aggressively explored.```


[04-Jan-21 01:34 PM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
```We will most certainly move forward with https://discord.com/channels/412898016371015680/705374203972419616/763173585002168360 - it will remove conflict of interests and a lot of the legal certainty on the KMD side. But this also means that the DEX/revsshare asset holders are left out in the rain until "someone" launches a legal entity around this to legalise the security token and structure, handle KYC with investors, comply with AML for the everyday operations and so on. These parties are going to rely on this future entity to build a product which generates revenues - I believe it is clear we can not handle this part nor get involved in it.```


[04-Jan-21 01:36 PM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
As far as revenue, I'd image fees are kept in a series of addresses, ie: litecoin address for litecoin fees, Verus address for Verus fees, rick address for rick fees


[04-Jan-21 02:22 PM] ‚çπŸ°…ë…ó¬° ÇŸ°…ë ã üïä#4437
Yes, and i would like to know its total value in Dollar of all this addresses. Isn't there a chart or dashboard for the (total) fees in dollar?

As I understood it, after the magical amount of 1 million in Dollar has been reached, the DEX holder will be rewarded in KMD.

Do I misunderstand something?

well thought out especially being able to modularize the different functionalities into different chains. multichain is indeed a good way. the one issue of trustlessly having one chain use another chain will require dealing with merkleproofs, but that is becoming a standard sort of thing to do so should pose too many issues. dealing with the realtime observing of the game data likely will be the trickiest to solve. feel free to bounce questions about this, i am intrigued by collider

[06-Jan-21 06:39 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Developers can develop as they see fit,  there is a difference between developing code to do something and doing it as a business ,  something like a gateway has costs behind it that have to be recouped somewhere, and when you start making money as a business, especially a financial business you run into regulatory issues that if you don‚Äôt figure out will catch up and lead to fines or jail time.  We only hear about the high profile cases in crypto media but if your bored sometime take a look at sec‚Äôs  crypto case settlements , there is a lot of them


[06-Jan-21 06:39 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

[06-Jan-21 06:52 PM] Komodefi#5638
uniswap is apparently untouchable by regulators for some reason. arbitraging their regulatory vacuum may be a bet worth making if you know you have funds to cover the legal cost. SEC judgements are public information that could be referenced to calculate the worst case cost scenario. I don't know how frequently jail time is doled out but it seems rare, anecdotally. It seems like the team is pretty good at staying out of jail so far üôè

If there are legal issues in creating the KMD version of USDT, then creating the KMD version of ETH and BTC should be no problem. They are both digital currencies.

what is the advantage of atomicdex now that verus defi is in the works? It seems like verus defi trades are faster and big fees would only be paid once to enter the vPegged coin (eth to veth, etc)


[09-Jan-21 12:49 PM] bishop#9773
Likely placing buy and sell prices for the coins you hold and allowing a counterparty to interact with it compared to Verus where you are interacting with a pool of liquidity, similar to Uniswap.


[09-Jan-21 12:55 PM] jspook16#3059
can you help me see the advantage in that? If I set my prices higher than the liq pool, I dont see a reason for a counterparty to interact with me. If I set my prices lower than the liq pool, I myself am better off interacting with the liq pool.

Liquidity multiplication on Dex (use the same funds to put orders across different pairs
Security - your keys, your coins, not dependent on gateways
More pairs (at least at the start I would imagine)

Auto-trading tools, if they ever get released üôÇ


[09-Jan-21 01:22 PM] jspook16#3059
I thought the intent of liquidity multiplier was to create additional liquidity as a benefit for the taker (yeah some benefit for the maker in the the order may get filled from any of the placed orders). It doesnt sound like liquidity would be an issue on verus defi so to me its liq multiplication is not really an advantage. Security yes but that seems like a trade off for faster trades (losing control of your assets while in the gateway). More pairs... yes thats an advantage now but the low liquidity on atomicdex seems to nullify that. Auto trading tools ... seems like something that can also be created for verus defi. Im not being negative, I just want to try and picture how atomicdex and verus defi can both exist and succeed.

Apples vs oranges. Order book system vs liquidity pools. Each will have ideal scenarios. I don't think they will ever compete, just compliment.


[09-Jan-21 02:06 PM] jspook16#3059
Perhaps thats what Im asking. What are these ideal scenarios where a typical user would rather interface with atomicdex than verus defi

We have both in the KMD ecosystem. Just need someone smart to link them together somehow?


[09-Jan-21 02:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Where settlement speed is prioritized .   When they don‚Äôt want to port high value coins on to an obscure chain.   When they don‚Äôt want forced to purchase a third party coin to do a trade.  Major difference:  with Atomicdex  every single utxo on every supported chain ( and accounts on nonutxo chains ) is instantly available to trade as long as you have the key.  There is a deposit time on Verus to get the tokenized form of the external coin.

Why @AtomicDEX 
VS liquidity pool #DeFi?

If settlement speed is prioritized.

If you don‚Äôt want 
to port high value coins
or buy a third party coin.

An order book system
means utxo instantly available 
because you control keys. 

No deposit time
to get tokenized forms of coin.

A Verus DeFi trade could go from ETH -> ( LP vETH-vDAI-vBTC-VRSC) ->DAI. all from one smart contract contract so to the user they would potentially see a cheaper trade fee, and doubt they care it hops chains. 
Re security :When someone converts to a Verus LP they have complete security as the LP is on chain decentralised, say VRSC ->(LP: vDEX-VRSC-vKMD) pool its totally on chain. I do see a trust in centralised entities that provide a service e.g. if someone made a non-bridged pegged vKMD - KMD 1:1 coin by using the Verus minting and burning token features. but thats the same with all fiat pegged coins now.


[10-Jan-21 12:53 AM] Monkins#5278
*In the case of chain to chain interoperability with pegged tokens that will be made fully decentralised or by a provider. with all miners and stakers incentivised to validate bridges for the former.

i know rules did come to ask question tho üòâ

hey JL i've made a basic list/plan for starting the collider coin migration just thought I'd see if you had any comments/suggestions...

Phase 1 - Collider Coin Main Chain
    1. Start main Collider Coin chain
    2. Recieve Initial Supply
    3. Create addresses for non-circ supply accounts and transfer clc into them (chose clc as the name/ticker to avoid confusion with already used cc abbreviation)
    4. Give launch command to active players (with mining pool ready)
    5. Watch working for 3-4 days
    6. Create explorer
    7. Announce command to boarder community
    8. Integrate clc deposit withdrawals from game app 
    9. Add wallet with instructions to git
    10. Add collider to atomicDex

Phase 2 - Decentralise Custody
Phase 3 - Decentralise Rules

will start planning detail of phase 2 & 3 as we get closer to them, i do expect it get exponentially more difficult but with some help ü§û will be able to get there

Hi, been in with kmd since ico and not selling for a long time! I am a real supporter of what you stand for! /// Question : As kmd secures its blockchain via the bitcoin hashrate, is it also possible for you to secure it via other blockchains at the same time, making it even more secure? in theory if one day bitcoins blockchain wont be as secure because of lower hashrate? so then there are many backups. thanks, looking forward to 2021  with kmd üòÑ

This post is really irrelevant. Most of Komodo's projects are open-source and therefore you have the possibility to check yourself the progress of a roadmap or of a project just by looking on GitHub, you have a page to see the statistics of each project - This year we pushed AtomicDEX to beta, being only two active developers (desktop), that's over 5000 commits for the desktop version - People are talking but the code shows the truth. It's distressing to see this kind of post by what it shows your inability to see the quality of a project - honestly I'm not sure Komodo needs people like you in the community who are constantly dragging them down without seeing the progress of the projects. 

I also invite you to read the text in the box at the top of this channel that you did not even respect, if you have questions about core tech then please ask your questions otherwise you have to know that @jl777c replies from time to time in other channels.

@Mark81 supernet purchased a large amount of KMD, it also did a large scale buyback of DEX assets that are currently in a different address, will be consolidated in the future. 

notarization funds are secure, steps are being taken to split the funds into different cold wallets, also some internal transfers are made as relates to the dex asset. more details on that will be announced in the future

can you tell how much there is left btc still from ico? with this current price rise in btc usd future looks good and secure for team able to boost effectively development what ever it needs to get things done. also once btc is significantly higher it starts effectively affect also crypto asset income from dpow notarization and thats revenue usage as buyback kmd to its holders.

@Mark81 as i have been saying the komodo development is funded for the long term. approx half the initial ICO BTC are still left even after 5 years or so and in USD terms there is over 10x from what was originally raised. this proves the long term effective management of funds. that being said, we cant just start spending money on this that or the other. all expenses must continue to be carefully managed. we are in a marathon and we are funded for the entire marathon.

In a marathon race, one of the leading groups wins the game. Subgroups end the game with subgroups to the end. komodo before a few years group belongs to the middle, but so far down into subgroups in the marathon race.

So, the effect of efficiently managing the budget of project is actually increaseing the available funding supply for future development and marketing funds as time passes by, along with the stronger technology advancements to kmd core technology. That's much of unheard in any other project, at least to my knowledge. üòé


[29-Jan-21 02:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if if taking a littral sports person's percpective of marathon race, it's correct use of the energy to save for the whole journy and pushing the hardest and best in last laps or before finish line. The difference is that there is no finish line in software development. So, switching this context to business, the business continuty means, there has to be revenue generating methods evolved while perserving as much budget funds possible. And as I see the core tech evolving and I see it's very much possible and pretty much on track with budget, tech advancements, available funding for long term, and pushing the fast gear when all things are set in place for marketing hard.

[03-Feb-21 05:27 PM] Regnar#6164
@Alright mentioned something in #ü§ù‚îÇdex-desktop about routing payments through KMD for low liquidity pairs using market makers to set up these transactions, eg. Someone tries to swap coin A for C (low liquidity) but there is liquidity for A to B and also liquidity for B to C. So someone could automate linking these so there will always be liquidity in A/C so long as there is liquidity in A/B and B/C. Assuming coin B in this example is KMD (most popular base pair) this could work.

In thinking about this I thought of another way that I think might work but I don't know enough about how atomic swaps work (what info is being exchanged, what is, isn't allowed etc) which I thought I could ask here. Let me lay out what I was thinking.


[03-Feb-21 05:28 PM] Regnar#6164
```
-Alice has DOGE and some KMD (in her wallet) and she wants LTC, but doesn't have enough KMD for LTC (Or just wants to swap DOGE/LTC) but there isn't a DOGE/LTC market liquid enough.
-There is however an open KMD order for DOGE and an open LTC order for KMD (Because KMD pairs are most common)
-Bob has LTC and wants KMD, he doesn't want DOGE.
-Alice selects the "AtomicDEX instant liquidity" feature.
-She sends a taker payment with her DOGE to the open KMD/DOGE order, at the same time sending a KMD taker payment to Bobs open KMD/LTC order.
-The KMD/DOGE Maker sends the maker payment and locks it awaiting Alices Taker Payment. Bob does the same, sending LTC to a HTLC awaiting Alice's Taker payment in KMD (She doesn't have enough KMD yet)
-Alice lets Bob's Maker payment sit in the HTLC while she finishes her DOGE/KMD Swap.
-When she receives the KMD, she immediately sends the KMD as the Taker Payment to Bob's HTLC.
-Bob sees the Taker payment for his LTC, and spends Alice's Taker payment
-Alice sees Bob revealed the secret to the HTLC and Spends Bob's LTC to herself

End result: Alice sells DOGE for KMD to a 3rd party while initiating a KMD/LTC swap. Bob sells his LTC for KMD to Alice. Alice has LTC, Bob has KMD. 
```

So my question @jl777c, is this even possible? 
Can the DEX fee and the following payments be spent from different addresses?
Would it be possible to "hijack" that payment? (someone sends to Bobs HTLC to finish the trade)

[04-Feb-21 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
@Regnar a marketmaker can be tracking the effective price from liquidity pools and use that to arbitrage, bascially the same logic as bridging CEX to atomicDEX


[04-Feb-21 05:32 AM] Regnar#6164
Right, I get that there are makers acting as arbitragers between pairs I think this could remove the need for 3rd parties acting as arbitragers by making the taker their own "arbitrager"
The takers own client software finds these routes of equal(ish) value on their own, and initiating two separate swaps simultaneously. The first set of DEX fees on two different swaps initiates the two swaps, and then focuses on one to obtain the funds needed to complete the other swap.


[04-Feb-21 05:34 AM] Regnar#6164
there would still obviously need to be makers on the opposite end of both these swaps, and there would need to be at least the equivalent value of each coins liquidity available.

I'll move this to a comment on the Github link above. Thanks


[04-Feb-21 03:47 PM] Monkins#5278
Verus is having multiple nested transactions in a sendcurrency api call. So if you wanted to swap VRSC through Verus currencies via 3 different liquidy pools in one transaction you can.  The verus bridge model is also an adaptable solution that you could link kmd to vrsc to and have the option in atomic dex to route through verus if the prices/liquidty  is move favorable


[04-Feb-21 03:55 PM] Monkins#5278
I dont know if this is possible but could you invoke the sencurrency transaction in a KMD -> VRSC atomic swap so it initiates the VRSC to be converted to a LP token through its LP's so the user didn't have to do it in 2 stages?


[04-Feb-21 07:24 PM] mike n.#2937
Code is being written to fork the code to enable this.  Just a heads up, it would be really really great if when Ravencoin tokens/assets are enabled on Atomic Dex that there be a media viewing window for the ipfs data attached to assets


[05-Feb-21 06:55 AM] Alright#0419
I am watching out for it @mike n. . I do think it would be beneficial as there aren't really any markets for the assets yet, yes?

@polycryptoblog their assets validation code basically sidesteps the script interpreter and is validated further down the line


[05-Feb-21 06:58 AM] Alright#0419
it makes it incompatible with most script, and they must either hardcode every script they want to make compatible or introduce asset validation into the script interpretor so OP_RVN_ASSET(or a new one) can be used in arbitrary scripts

Right now there is a major pain point in the Ethereum ecosystem because gas fees are astronomical. How difficult would it be for a major Ethereum based project to transfer to the Komodo ecosystem? For example, a ERC-20  token that is Top 100 or 200 by market cap.


[05-Feb-21 04:19 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Very easy, you could use the dex and host a 1:1 swap granted all the token holder would have to pay gas fees for this conversion which is likely $20+ right now.


[05-Feb-21 04:41 PM] jvr#6773
Is there any official documentation on this that we can present to core developers of these projects? This could be by far the most effective way to grow Komodo ecosystem.

if we look at the trading behavior, as alright said, we can id the addresses that "most probably used AtomicDEX" on any blockchain. but, if the user doesn't make atomicswaps and only uses the wallet functionality, there is no way to say if an address was created on AtomicDEX

[11-Feb-21 07:33 AM] jspook16#3059
I think DEX will existin....at least for a while. To go KYC (kdex) you would have to go form vDEX to kDEX i think. But imagine most of the volume will be in vDEX since it can be part of the verus liq pools @Patrick Crypto The small details havent been worked out as far as I know @polycryptoblog

Thanks. Any bullet points for an idiot what some of the benefits of vdex might be?


[11-Feb-21 07:43 AM] jspook16#3059
Verus Liq Pools (when they become available). vDEX price should be close to kDEX (but i would say original DEX should also be close to ). Since there wont be many security trading platforms for kDEX, I would say vDEX would be the unoffical way to trade it. AND (im just spit balling) it could go over the value of kDEX depending on the volume atomicdex gets. People that are willing to KYC would pay a premium to get the dexfees long term perhaps

once you go vDEX you dont go back. It also consolidates all of the dexfee tokens (like jumblr, etc) to one asset, vDEX

@jl777c is there any value in reallocating some of the assets held within KMD to hold ETH and run a KMD backed Beacon validation node? Since aDEX has everything needed to use ERC20 tokens, and VRSC is working out how to bridge their tools, it stands to reason there would be a lot of benefit to this being in the KMD ecosystem.

[18-Feb-21 11:16 AM] daemonfox#6136
For RFOX?

i think it runs a contract that fetches the snapshot data from RFOX, so they can put whatever amounts


[18-Feb-21 11:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just will leave this here...


[18-Feb-21 11:17 AM] daemonfox#6136
Sounds like Benny needs to be served papers


[18-Feb-21 11:18 AM] daemonfox#6136
If he removed data fromt he snapshot, he took a malicious act excluding them


[18-Feb-21 11:18 AM] daemonfox#6136
Thats premeditated


[18-Feb-21 11:21 AM] ca333#0333
i very well expected it from benny and in fact predicted it - I warned everyone ref this rat


[18-Feb-21 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is totally intentional on his part. if someone wants to do a legal thing against RFOX on behalf of SuperNET, i can fund some reasonable costs for it.


[18-Feb-21 11:24 AM] SHossain#0007
there were some talks from community members few months back and benny came in to refute them


[18-Feb-21 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it is really as simple as he is not honoring the snapshot


[18-Feb-21 11:25 AM] SHossain#0007
i don't remember who were those members exactly now


[18-Feb-21 11:25 AM] ca333#0333
He should be thanking you on his knees - without you and without you pulling me back from him they would be nothing today.


[18-Feb-21 11:25 AM] ca333#0333
I will initiate appropriate procedures against him - including legal steps. Have contacts in Vietnam.

@Bitcoin Benny why are you not honoring the snapshot?

@RFOX_GAMES So it turns out that Bitcoin Benny is dishonest person to those that helped get Red Fox up and starting in beginning. jl777 as Supernet founder has lost over 100BTC during first years of RFOX by giving funding to project. @AlexSaundersAU  beware of Benny.

We knew Komodo would play an integral part in developing key components to this game and many other products along the way, which is why we created the Komodo Development Allocation of RFOX, which is 10% of the total supply.

@ca333 that is good to hear

not just integral part - to be honest we built 100% of RFOX. If not us they would be nothing - I mean this literally.

@PTYX had doubts about benny back in 2018

Yeah I remember that

But hindsight 2020


[18-Feb-21 11:53 AM] LocoMB#8593
prly simply because the K64 roach was so much more blatant of a scammer?
I remember how he shot back against benny, and some of it sounded only half far fecthed- but then K64 went doen and suddenly benny was squeaky clean


[18-Feb-21 11:55 AM] hastrup#8742
Are you suggesting that they work together.?


[18-Feb-21 11:55 AM] LocoMB#8593
no, only that Benny is way slicker, and came out of that cleaner than he should have


[18-Feb-21 11:55 AM] hastrup#8742
Ok


[18-Feb-21 11:56 AM] ca333#0333
yes correct


[18-Feb-21 11:57 AM] ca333#0333
but others were in the same boat - and today they behave as nothing happened. Will not call them out (yet)


[18-Feb-21 11:59 AM] PTYX#6840
Yeah, i remember. I posted it in internal channels. That was one of the reasons i left the team to work on chainzilla for some time.

yep, i remember. we also talked in DM too


[18-Feb-21 12:00 PM] PTYX#6840
He also didn't do a damn thing for Komodo as the marketing manager. That was aggravating.


[18-Feb-21 12:00 PM] PTYX#6840
I honestly can't believe he left out the supernet address when he did the migration

I believe he will come up with excuses and he will try to make it right - but nonetheless he destroyed everything. Now maybe he can save bit of his project. But likely won't save his career or reputation - this chance is lost.


[18-Feb-21 12:05 PM] jansako#3330
If he can pull out 'just' 10% of current marketcap, he may not care about a further career... not saying that would be easy but he could try to take that route...


[18-Feb-21 12:07 PM] PTYX#6840
He bought a media company in Myanmar


[18-Feb-21 12:07 PM] PTYX#6840
Probably has money coming out of his ears


[18-Feb-21 12:07 PM] PTYX#6840
What pisses me off is him not honoring the swap for the supernet RFOX holdings


[18-Feb-21 12:07 PM] PTYX#6840
The rest is whatever, he needs to honor the swap.


[18-Feb-21 12:07 PM] PTYX#6840
That's the least he can do.


[18-Feb-21 12:08 PM] VJ#1796
What was the reason why?


[18-Feb-21 12:08 PM] PTYX#6840
Because they felt like it apparently


[18-Feb-21 12:09 PM] ca333#0333
i am certain he went this route, not a question of 'if' anymore - look at chart and market. Consider KMD and RFOX supporters making up big % of the buys - and consider 'them' controlling most/all of tokens. 2+2 = 4 -1 = 3 , quick maths.


[18-Feb-21 12:09 PM] VJ#1796
We should make this public across their socials, every media post, seo the crap out of the Benny scam page.

[18-Feb-21 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
and it didnt work


[18-Feb-21 12:37 PM] ca333#0333
Beside all this things he owes me big amount from past project agreement - very big amount


[18-Feb-21 12:37 PM] PTYX#6840
maybe the verus team can also answer why the swap worked for some and other it didn't


[18-Feb-21 12:37 PM] PTYX#6840
doesn't seem fair


[18-Feb-21 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
RFOX team controlled what addresses were allowed to swap


[18-Feb-21 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
probably any address with a small amount was allowed, any address with big amount blocked


[18-Feb-21 12:38 PM] VJ#1796
We need a infographic with this info on there.


[18-Feb-21 12:38 PM] PTYX#6840
so they basically blacklisted supernet holdings and verus also went with it


[18-Feb-21 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810

I'd love to answer that, but I'm not up to speed on what was actually built into the wallet to enable the swap. I'll inform with the wallet devs.


[18-Feb-21 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
10% was vested over time

keep in mind these are 35 million of the original RFOX, which are 350 million of the new RFOX

jeezus, total supply is 1,312,000,760


[18-Feb-21 12:42 PM] VJ#1796
So total at the end would have been 50M or 500M of the new one?


[18-Feb-21 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt matter what the total would be at the end. the important thing is there are 35 million original RFOX that were not honored in the swap to the new RFOX chain


[18-Feb-21 12:44 PM] VJ#1796
So Benny owes the team & SN holders 350M rfox or $35Million in USD.


[18-Feb-21 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
it is split between the komodo team, SuperNET and myself personally


[18-Feb-21 12:45 PM] VJ#1796
Why not go after the other 3% as well?


[18-Feb-21 12:46 PM] VJ#1796
Snapshot is easy to explain but if the end goal is for him to pay, ask for the full amount.


[18-Feb-21 12:47 PM] jl777c#5810
just collect what is owed based on snapshot, that avoids all the issues about whatever reasons for continuing or not continuing to work with RFOX

They can pretend that it is a bug, fix it, give back the coins and save reputation and lawers costs.

they would need to issue like 25% of new coins if they don't have them available in supply to pay back what is owed

1.3B ... 5B ... anyway, it is good that they seem to have enough new coins

@ca333 you say we build up rfox for 100% and all the money came from komodo/supernet or jl777? So in fact redfox it is legally ours or not?

I personally issued warnings ref. K64 and their scam party - i was called out a mafia kingping and Sam said i cut off peoples limbs when he noticed I knew everything about their scam. Still have not forgotten what old "supporters" and other community members did. 

All this scams hurted a big percent of the community factor - to be honest the K64 scam hurted the KMD<->NL_Crypto relationship which never returned back to what it was as it made many look stupid - very stupid.

@PTYX Assuming max supply on the contract is 2B.
https://dexstats.info/richlist.php?asset=RFOX
First address is probably the unsold amount/unallocated.

59.4% + 7% from jl777 = 1.65B

@VJ we have no affiliation with them. it was well-contained work that they asked for urgent help with in exchange for donating funds to the foundation for community support of Verus. The Foundation donation was in exchange for developers creating ETH contracts that could launch an ERC20 currency from a snapshot with specific requirements and a wallet update to be able to claim an ERC20 currency, based on data populated by them, from an R-address. All of that was pretty straightforward and worked without issues from a technical perspective, and they were supposed to provide first line support, which is all that's needed. They deployed the contracts themselves and populated all data, including lists, snapshots, etc. to the contracts. I am sorry to hear about this.

As I read the message from Mike, RFOX supplied the snapshot data. You can hardly expect anyone to check every address.
As far as I can tell (and I did  support a lot of end-users with swapping, despite the fact that RFOX would do that) Verus supplied the technical means to swap and RFOX the rest

Also looking for it. Not on their website


[18-Feb-21 02:13 PM] SHossain#0007
it appears all their website is built with the same company which also built the KMD website back in 2018 and the guy rage quit after he didn't win a Notary Node in election.

Guys I‚Äôm sorry I‚Äôm a big support of Kmd and a huge holder still but it seems that the opportunity to get this out should have been months ago after the swap no ?

[18-Feb-21 02:48 PM] VJ#1796
Does anyone have a copy of the Snapshot? Or if there is a rfox rich list or transaction list for the contract to move tokens to the individual accounts? @PTYX it could be he has redirected the supernet wallets into a different eth account that they control.


[18-Feb-21 02:49 PM] PTYX#6840
no i don't. i asked mike from verus some info because i was wondering if rfox did a whitelist of addresses but he says that he basically handed it over, they did the snapshot and apparently decided who got the new rfox tokens.


[18-Feb-21 02:50 PM] PTYX#6840
which is pretty bad because he basically used verus tech to bootstrap his eth migration and "forgot" to include supernet who is a major supporter of verus


[18-Feb-21 02:52 PM] Chadwinc#0075
If he maliciously ‚Äòforgot‚Äô to add the Supernet account then we definitely need all the evidence we can get to make that public.

you can see here: https://rfox.kmdexplorer.io/address/RMU5LJT4ro9omU561qJ1pBtuzZNaAbrBQx

he excluded these addresses from the ETH swap

why is that rfox not migrated over to ETH? that's the question benny needs to answer

@PTYX can we find the ETH transfers for the snapshot?


[18-Feb-21 02:55 PM] PTYX#6840
we would need to dig through it on their contract address


[18-Feb-21 02:55 PM] PTYX#6840
but it's all there. when they emitted the coins, the distribution, etc


[18-Feb-21 02:56 PM] VJ#1796
Yeah I think that will give us a clue.


[18-Feb-21 02:56 PM] VJ#1796
If they sent it to a different ETH address, that is a smoking gun.

Considering this channel is already way off topic, I‚Äôm going to pile on while it‚Äôs all Lord of the Flies in here.  Do we know what other addresses were ommited? I know he culled off lower than a certain amount as a criteria. It would be interesting to have that very specific list. Would also be good to have MikeT of VERUS weigh in since he facilitated this - not saying it was his responsibility to verify, but he might have a thought or two on the subject to lend credibility. The RFOX channel is in denial that their leader is being accused of a crime and aren‚Äôt thinking straight at the moment, need a better way to make the case/give credibility to Komodo team.


[18-Feb-21 04:17 PM] PTYX#6840
I asked the Mike from Verus and he says that the addresses used for the swap were converted from the original Komodo R addresses to ETH, this was his reply


[18-Feb-21 04:17 PM] PTYX#6840
```it was done with the same address as both R and ETH, so they deployed the contracts, then loaded the snapshot and whatever other ETH addresses they chose to load with their emission schedule, and once they finalize the contract, no one can change the data and that's where the coins go. So, the contract accepts loading into one list, expected to be the snapshot, that would issue claim coins to anyone who could provide that their ETH address was the same private key as the R-address in the list. Then there is another list with just ETH addresses. All entries (or most, can't remember) have block heights for the coins to be valid. They deployed the code once we tested it was all working on Rinkeby and then they populated all the lists.

the contract function is expecting a tuple


[18-Feb-21 05:10 PM] webworker01#3884
so i think the hex data needs to be decoded another level


[18-Feb-21 05:11 PM] webworker01#3884
```js
    function setRAccountBalances(SetRBalance[] memory balances) public onlyOwner{
        require(_finalizeImport == false,
            "Action cannot be taken after import has been finalized");
        for (uint i=0; i < balances.length; i++){
            setRAccountBalance(balances[i].account,balances[i].balances);
        }
    }```


[18-Feb-21 05:11 PM] webworker01#3884
yeah i don't see my eth address in there


[18-Feb-21 05:12 PM] webworker01#3884
so it has at least 2 values encoded inside the data column, `account` and `balance`


[18-Feb-21 05:14 PM] webworker01#3884
`bytes20` is probably the key, trying to work that out

Its silly to think how they think that they can just get away with it, i mean this one is pretty blatantly obvious now

And then the sad thing is they can probably get away with it


[18-Feb-21 06:14 PM] PTYX#6840
Sure, they can get away with it but they'll always have to sleep with a worry about what might happen. That's why you never screw anyone over. At least for me, my piece of mind is worth more. Karma is a bitch.


[18-Feb-21 06:14 PM] PTYX#6840
to be very honest with you, with all the good things happening in Komodo right now, this is a huge distraction. We shouldn't even have to waste time on trash like Benny

I wonder if its the same for benny as for sam, keeping the fancy lifestyle going as long as possible, being the important man

These are special kinds of people lol


[18-Feb-21 06:19 PM] PTYX#6840
I met benny in person a few times and he didn't have a clue about anything other than talking out of his elbows.


[18-Feb-21 06:19 PM] PTYX#6840
He's a good talker.


[18-Feb-21 06:19 PM] PTYX#6840
I remember sitting in a room listening to him talk about a plan for Komodo and i was like WTF is he talking about. I brought it up a few times internally, i even left the team for a while because I couldn't stand him.


[18-Feb-21 06:20 PM] Meyse#0952
Met him a few times myself, last time in fucking vietnam that was so ridiculous


[18-Feb-21 06:20 PM] Meyse#0952
Haha yes i remember him saying he slept only 2 hours a night

And maybe he keeps his community believing in him like that


[18-Feb-21 06:41 PM] Meyse#0952
So you gotta go at the people close to him, make them lose their believe in him

The problem is though when the people close to him are vested financially to redfox coin, they might keep up the charade for a long time

definitely, it's not in their best interest

Here is the thing that makes 0 sense, why would you want to do it? There is no upsides here?

They could have just done some sneaky thing by giving themselves some of the unused coins and most probably would not have noticed anything.


[18-Feb-21 06:57 PM] PTYX#6840
what i'm more amazed about is how they used verus. i can see them Fing us over if benny felt badly against Komodo, but why rope verus into it?


[18-Feb-21 06:57 PM] VJ#1796
But to take away from the people that helped to make your success that is just stupid and hoping it won't bite you on your ass? Now he and the project has a target on its back from now till the end of time.


[18-Feb-21 06:57 PM] Meyse#0952
I think its just benny totally detaching from komodo, let the storm come, and try to start over with a newly build community


[18-Feb-21 06:57 PM] PTYX#6840
like...benny thought noone would find out or bring it up?


[18-Feb-21 06:58 PM] PTYX#6840
i doubt it's his team, it's most likely decisions that he's made


[18-Feb-21 06:59 PM] PTYX#6840
well, he's done it. regardless of what may come he's made off with millions


[18-Feb-21 07:00 PM] PTYX#6840
and now we know for a fact he doesn't care or plans to make it right

Alex Saunders is an honest operator, if he becomes aware of what happened, he will realise his vouching for redfox to guys like Novagratz will do serious damage to his credibility, that's a possible way to pressure Benny into honouring the swap


[18-Feb-21 07:37 PM] PTYX#6840
and if he does want to go the legal route, it will be done. on top of that, it's illegal to issue cryptocurrencies in vietnam.


[18-Feb-21 07:38 PM] 9oklp#8901
If Alex Saunders distanced himself from redfox, it would hurt Benny a lot

this is par for the course in crypto. I would not doubt that who ever is behind the current pump in rfox is sitting on the supernet and jl's bags.


[18-Feb-21 07:39 PM] Mark81#4505
@PTYX This part intrest me most. So check out that when doing ground work for legal case.

yeah, we will begin doing the research and we'll get someone on the ground.


[18-Feb-21 07:40 PM] PTYX#6840
I think the priority is not to distract from our day to day though. I know it's difficult when something is so personal, basically someone stealing from us, but we have to remove emotions from it as mucha as possible and keep focused on Komodo.

The ETH move made no sense from a tech perspective

```The SBV further announced that issuing, providing, or using cryptocurrency would be subject to an administrative penalty of from 150 to 200 million VND and could also trigger criminal liability. According to the amended criminal code, issuance, provision, or use of cryptocurrency that causes harm to other people (including enterprises) from between 100 to 300 million VND will result in a criminal fine of between 50 to 300 million VND or imprisonment for six months to three years. This strict regime of prohibition entered effect on 1 January 2018. Cryptocurrency in Vietnam was dead.```

During snapshot, Benny did not give the 350M coins to these 3 wallets.

i need to just know what bytes20 is lol


[18-Feb-21 08:36 PM] webworker01#3884
or the library i found wants a certain data structure passed into it so it can decode the data the right way


[18-Feb-21 08:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
It might not decode that data into an ETH address...


[18-Feb-21 08:37 PM] webworker01#3884
it should contain an address and a balance at least


[18-Feb-21 08:37 PM] daemonfox#6136
The VRSc wallet has the privkey... and could pass the derived ETH addy to the swap contract, data could be only Raddresses

read the readme on that repo, but gist of it is the transaction pass in data to this function 
https://github.com/webworker01/decoderfox/blob/main/contract.sol#L885
you can see it has at least `balances.account` and `balances.balances` in the data


[18-Feb-21 08:40 PM] webworker01#3884
`balances.account` is probably raddress or the converted eth address


[18-Feb-21 08:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
But what does it need to validate? Nothing on ETH side, just RFOX in and pass the addy


[18-Feb-21 08:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
and the ETH gas fee


[18-Feb-21 08:40 PM] webworker01#3884
i'm just trying to get the snapshot data


[18-Feb-21 08:41 PM] webworker01#3884
not justify why they coded it this way


[18-Feb-21 08:41 PM] webworker01#3884
Snapshot should be all of these: https://github.com/webworker01/decoderfox/blob/main/balances.js

Yeah, they went from sub 1mil to 100mil+ marketcap where the team had most of the supply. That was my criticism when they claimed moving to ethereum for the liquidity. Was just a way to dump on the suckers there. Had discussion with benny about that in the rfox channel but he said it was fud etc.

@Cryptotwiggy @Regnar__ @Crypto_Mark81 @RFOX_GAMES @AlexSaundersAU Should be very easy to prove where the new airdropped tokens went to then? If they held the coins pre-snapshot date, there should be an ERC20 address with the same amount of coins x100 post-snapshot, no?

Ok inability to claim when you are eligable can only mean two things: - bug in the claiming process/contract which should and can be fixed.
- malicious intent where the intentionally made you unable to claim.

don't expect  the KOGS team or mods to address issues of RFOX. many many people on the Kogs discord doesn't even care about the rfox token. 
take this up with Benny personally or use the Rfox telegram.

I've been following the discussion on their telegram group. Benny simply does not comment on this even when asked about eth addresses and sort of sidesteps the whole thing. The telegram community obciously reacts as you could expect, they go to protective mode, which is understandable cause of their investments and label this as fud. I am pretty much convinced at this point that the whole thing is scam. Anyways it is clear that the snapshot 1.) has not been respected and 2.) benny has no intention of doing so or 3.) even comment on this. The only reference he made was legal actions, which I highly doubt at this point they are capable of. However, protecting the good things going on with Komodo and reputation of Komodo and related projects I feel this should not be escalated into twitter wars or desperate attempts on their telegram group. IMO the best way is to 1.) create declaration together with Verus on what has happened and publish it without personal tweets n stuff 2.) Start legal actions 3.) maybe get some publicity (for example youtube, someone who likes to dig deep on dirtbag projects) 4.) Other actions. Point being distancing the komodo and verus project from the bloodbath, which could get messy

But meanwhile I'll observing, eyes on their group. But basically I mean this war should not be done on twitter and their turf (telegram group) and not trying to make this tribal war - these can be easily controlled and benny can just ignore them, not comment / label them as fud. The battle should be done on higher and lower levels, in other words formal declaration from not one but TWO teams together what has happened, legal actions and referring to lower level battle, pressure on personal level on benny (there seems to be enough dirt and scams he has been involved before)

if you are involved with SN or KMD it mean you are affected as the funds stolen would be project funds used to fuel the project evolution. In this case you can personally make a report for the crime. This will be a help to us. We involve lawyers in Vietnam and reporting the crime locally - still collecting all data required.

If you want to help and are affected please report Ben Fairbank and his Company RFOX for the fraudulent activities - Vietnam is harsh with fraudsters.

I am happy to buy up to 20 SN, 1 for each person in Vietnam that then goes on to report this theft to local authorities.

We give them the SN, now they are affected by this theft etc.

If donating kmd is the best use of community time (excluding dev lawyers) Then I propose raising money through fun discord games. We can make it so 77.7% of the pool goes to supernet, remaining percent goes to winner. I propose making the 7th of every month game day, discord bot lotto, blackjack, etc @Jcharming

Komodo platform seems to have become a playground for crooks. 
I think this is the reality of open source. 
If it's cheap and easy to get, it's not worth it.
all projects want to get on the ETH and Polkadot Binance chains. 
It's because people gather there.

Seems Rfox allocated a new treasury fund at the time of the Eth migration worth 350,000,000 RFOX or the same amount that Supernet would be owed at the 1:10 old to new ratio. Must have foreplanned it, I think.

Where IDO on the face of it is a great IDEA however after you have done a IDO on atomicdex your trading price will not show. You will need to trade on another DEX like uniswap to achieve this, this seams like a problem needing a solution or am I missing something.


[20-Feb-21 12:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Atomicdex info can be imported into coin price aggregator sites.  It‚Äôs a low priority item


[20-Feb-21 12:36 PM] Roger#1320
But the price of your new IDO token will only display "there is no chart data for this ticker yet" is this correct?


[20-Feb-21 12:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
If it‚Äôs a new coin and hasn‚Äôt been traded obviously it‚Äôs not going to have any trade data


[20-Feb-21 12:41 PM] Roger#1320
But even if it trades on Atomicdex it will never show


[20-Feb-21 12:42 PM] Roger#1320
as to show on atomixdex the info comes from https://www.coingecko.com/ and they do not use atomixdex to collect info

If IDO was available on uniswap, once completed and coin starts trading you can submit it to https://www.coingecko.com/ and your price will show in atomicdex. However if you do an IDO on atomicdex the price  will never appear on atomicdex.  Thats a problem I believe.  I am just pointing this out to see if there is a soloution

your missing the point


[20-Feb-21 12:51 PM] Roger#1320
All ecr-20 token on atomicdex need to trade on another dex to get there price to display on atomicdex


[20-Feb-21 12:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
They can submit their coin to sites like normal.  This isn‚Äôt Ethereum where all coins are automatically known because they are on one chain,  these are independent chains.


[20-Feb-21 12:56 PM] Roger#1320
Ok so can you send me a link or info to show how Atomicdex info can be imported into coingeko ?


[20-Feb-21 12:59 PM] lightspeed393#5403
@Roger for your coin to display chart data on AtomicDEX your coin will need to be added on coingecko. To be added on coingecko, you will need to be added to another exchange that they track. Everything will still work the same without the price chart.


[20-Feb-21 01:00 PM] Roger#1320
I understand all this


[20-Feb-21 01:00 PM] lightspeed393#5403
atomicDEX isn't tracked by coingecko


[20-Feb-21 01:00 PM] lightspeed393#5403
so your last question about how to get atomicdex info imported to coingecko has no solution


[20-Feb-21 01:01 PM] lightspeed393#5403
they must track atomicDEX themselves for them to get atomicDEX trade data.


[20-Feb-21 01:01 PM] Roger#1320
I am just pointing out what I believe is something that may prevent new token using atomicdex for a IDO


[20-Feb-21 01:03 PM] Roger#1320
I was informed  during the week that atomicdex has switch from https://coinpaprika.com/ to  https://www.coingecko.com/ for trading info, is this correct?

Hello, a few years ago there was a migration from NXT....but I just imported my seed into AtomicDex and I am not seeing any of my assets (e.g. supernet, jumblr, etc)


[20-Feb-21 09:50 PM] PTYX#6840
you might need to use the Verus wallet which accepts the old seeds. Is it a 24 word seed?


[20-Feb-21 09:50 PM] PTYX#6840
actually I think that AtomicDEX allows you to use custom seeds too, i'm just not sure if the derivation path is the same.


[20-Feb-21 09:58 PM] üí™‚ûïüò∂ (omar)#9443
Yes it's a 24 word seed


[20-Feb-21 09:58 PM] Slyris#2880
You can use custom seed checkbox


[20-Feb-21 09:59 PM] Slyris#2880
in atomicdex


[20-Feb-21 09:59 PM] üí™‚ûïüò∂ (omar)#9443
I was able to login and enable all assets but everything reads 0


[20-Feb-21 09:59 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but did you choose custom seed or not when restoring


[20-Feb-21 09:59 PM] üí™‚ûïüò∂ (omar)#9443
I don't know

[20-Feb-21 10:01 PM] üí™‚ûïüò∂ (omar)#9443
still reads 0


[20-Feb-21 10:02 PM] üí™‚ûïüò∂ (omar)#9443
it also says "failed to enable THC"


[20-Feb-21 10:03 PM] üí™‚ûïüò∂ (omar)#9443
Should I also post this in "#ü§ù‚îÇgeneral-support"?

[20-Feb-21 10:04 PM] Slyris#2880

Is there more info on this? So basically all legacy assets will be converted to one asset (vDEX)?


[21-Feb-21 12:13 PM] jspook16#3059
@üí™‚ûïüò∂ (omar) There are members from the team currently hashing out the details. But all of the legacy assets are planned to be converted to vDEX. At which point holders can either keep their assets in vDEX (which will not get dex fee payouts) or convert to the KYC asset, kDEX, which will get the dex payouts


[21-Feb-21 12:37 PM] üí™‚ûïüò∂ (omar)#9443
Okay very helpful...do you know what the current fully diluted market cap (ballpark) of vDEX (or all combined legacy assets) is currently based on the buyback prices?


[21-Feb-21 12:59 PM] jspook16#3059
I do not know


[21-Feb-21 01:07 PM] üí™‚ûïüò∂ (omar)#9443
okay thank you


[21-Feb-21 01:16 PM] actionslacks#4072
It's a pretty involved calculation as to what each asset price is set at in kmd. jl is taking some time right now but will probably able to specify exactly why the evaluations are what they are in the near future. glad you got your coin, and welcome back.

Your vDEX will always be worth the same amount of kDEX, so in turn be the same value as kDEX... you just wont earn any DEX proceeds until you make the KYC one way swap to kDEX

@jl777c is the coding ingeneous and a great innovator. But beyond that, he is the person attracting us to Komodo through his Declaration of independence stated here https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1372879.0. Otherwise, we would be still trying to seek solutions to the complex problems in Marmara somewhere else.

thanks for the support! been offline dealing with some real world issues unrelated to this. it is easily proven the snapshot data does not contain the three addresses: https://github.com/webworker01/decoderfox/blob/main/output.txt

if needed we can calculate the ETH addresses from the pubkeys from those addresses.

We went further, got it out on twitter and got the WAX/KOGS contract dev to see the facts, though they still seemed to focus on the wrong things. The snapshot was before these three addresses got coins sent, and the single key of 35M RFOX that these three address received their funds from is the real missing address in the RFOX token swap contract. 

Address of the 35M presnapshot showing on 10-10 they moved: https://rfox.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RGmQVJvYTsWAxE6KjgCenFYmyVhkAgsZmC

@daemonfox69 @Jacobstoon @bennydoda01 @hackenclub Both TXs happened after the snapshot taken on the 9th of October. As you can see from the transaction you posted above. So the question would be, why where they moved after the snapshot in the first place?

they never stated any specific blockheight for the snapshot. but this simplifies the omission to a single address https://rfox.explorer.dexstats.info/address/RGmQVJvYTsWAxE6KjgCenFYmyVhkAgsZmC

which also is not in the snapshot, so they stole those coins instead of coins from the three other addresses

actually their announcements said that the snapshot was after the transactions, but i guess it was before? regardless they are stealing 35 million original RFOX coins

There are no Komodo tokens. Only blockchain coins. Komodo is not a token on any other blockchain, it is an independent blockchain of its own. If you want to get/buy KMD, buy from market/exchanges.

Hey @jl777c just thought i'd drop in to give u an update on progress at Collider...
I've completed Phase 1 so now CLC chain is up and running, previous tokens migrated over and integrated into the game and atomicDex ü•≥ 
I've also updated game to v1.7.1 which includes a number of recommendations from the KMD team and is prepped for larger player numbers and also the addition of a number of KMD community project coins (that will be fully integrated soon)
Then next up is trying to increase player numbers a bit and get ready for some bigger marketing events ü§û 
And working on next version 1.8 that will include full plans for v2 / phase2 that is the really big step when full decentralisation of user coin custody will be implemented, will probably need some help with that u'll probable be seeing lot more of me by then, can't wait to reach that stage thanks ahead of time for all ur and the teams assistance!

hi @jl777c happy weather changing seasonal day, hope it was grande

more importantly:
Q: the comment section had this interesting comment. i didn't read the code & was hoping you could magically skim it and see something in it you've seen before in c.
https://it.slashdot.org/story/21/04/05/0215257/why-ibm-is-pushing-fully-homomorphic-encryption
it is from 2012, and the wikipedia article on homomorphic encryption has 1st gen, 2nd gen (which is around 2012), up to last year 4th gen..

is homomorphic encryption getting exciting/useful/accessible/affordable/mature/safe?

Thanks, let me try to unwrap your explanation so I can make sure I understand it.  SUPERNET (as written in Dog Latin) so should be in English, Super-Net, meaning one word indicated by the hyphen, I am lead to believe. Anyway Super-Net has a number of KMD coins that also have Notary Node Votes for 2021 attributed to them.  If I hold Super-Net then I can DM @SHossain to get a share of these vote because I also own a share of the KMD held within Super-Net?

@Mylo the big issue with homomorphic encryption is that the operations you can do at the fundamental level are similar to bitwise operations. to create useful algos out of bitwise operations (one bit at a time) will take a lot of layers, which will slow it down and make it bloat. over time, we should see higher and higher level abstractions that can use homomorphism, but even getting to a C compiler level seems a ways away. i guess assembler level will be the first major milestone, but not familiar with any toolkit that even allows that. then again, it is a fast evolving field so we can expect such to arise at any moment

if i put a DEX  buy order at 1 KMD, would you say it's jl777 who is putting down the price?


[08-Apr-21 09:03 AM] SHossain#0007
while his LP node is not online and someone wants to buy at 5 KMD each, you accuse him of doing that. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è


[08-Apr-21 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
price of KMD against basically every normal benchmark has gone up dramatically, even against BTC


[08-Apr-21 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX is not having KMD in its valuation, so if KMD doubles in value the price denominated in KMD going down by 50% and basically nothing has changed


[08-Apr-21 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD denominated in gold or silver is also up dramatically


[08-Apr-21 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
when your divisor goes up in value, the numerator comes down to keep things in balance


[08-Apr-21 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, if you dont like the buyback price, nobody forces you to sell


[08-Apr-21 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont remember selling DEX at 15 KMD when KMD was at $10.


[08-Apr-21 09:25 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, not sure why you are complaining so much. the 15 KMD buyback price was there for over 6 months and KMD price in sats quadrupled while BTC price in fiat or gold also quadrupled

some people were even buying above your price


[08-Apr-21 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
SUPERNET buyback is still in place. but DEX and related ones need to be changed due to the recent market massive changes. when things change massively, things are forced to change


[08-Apr-21 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
based on all this complaining, i will be suspending the DEX and related buybacks until further notice. i did it as a helpful service for people and to be attacked over doing this... it is better to just stop it


[08-Apr-21 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
when vDEX comes out, people can migrate to that and use the verus liquidity pools and the price will be whatever the price is from the open market. i certainly dont have any obligation to prop up the price based on a price that was set before an order of magnitude change

If THC wanted to use radio tech for wifi like what helium(hnt) is doing, for transmitting data in the fields and houses for the farmers, could this be done though a smart contract?

```In version 0.9 of the Bitcoin Core client, a compromise was reached with the introduction of the OP_RETURN operator. OP_RETURN allows developers to add 40 bytes of nonpayment data to a transaction output. However, unlike the use of ‚Äúfake‚Äù UTXO, the OP_RETURN operator creates an explicitly provably unspendable output, which does not need to be stored in the UTXO set. OP_RETURN outputs are recorded on the blockchain, so they consume disk space and contribute to the increase in the blockchain‚Äôs size, but they are not stored in the UTXO set and therefore do not bloat the UTXO memory pool and burden full nodes with the cost of more expensive RAM.``` mastering Bitcoin book

Let me reword. When using the tokencreate.cc to make a NFT, there is a name and description field and you can also add data field. Where is this info stored, does it bloat the utxo set? In theory is it possible to embed a picture file (not just a link) in the NFT or span the information over several NFT? Is there a reason to not do this?

The next method was to attach data  using a UTXO that cannot be spent, using the destination bitcoin address as a free-form 20-byte field. . This bloats the utxo mem pool and forces nodes to forever keep it in ram.

```https://blog.bsv.sh/the-prunability-and-non-permanency-of-your-data-the-case-of-op_return/

In order to store more data than just a small "Hello world!" string, the following additional opcodes that push data on stack can be used:

OP_PUSHDATA1 - Pushes up to 255 bytes.
OP_PUSHDATA2 - Pushed up to 65,535 bytes.
OP_PUSHDATA4 - Pushes up to 4,294,967,295 bytes ~ 4 Gigabytes.

PUSHDATA opcodes - https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Constants
Similarly, if I wish to store a picture with a good level of permanency guaranteed, I could broadcast the following UTXO:

OP_PUSHDATA2 MY_CAT_PICTURE_DATA OP_DROP OP_DUP OP_HASH160 6cd91d791372e0b0660dea04e8dd84fc65c2c289 OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
Where MY_CAT_PICTURE_DATA is the raw data of my cat picture.

The beauty of using OP_CHECKSIG lies in the fact that those scripts are spendable. Another interesting advantage is that transactions that use this opcode can also be spent at any time by the recipient. The recipient could be an application or a user that could spend the data when he/she/it decides to unlock the coins and therefore spend the UTXO, so nodes operators are informed that the transaction output (and therefore the data) is now prunable.```

litecoin blocktime is faster and the blocks are empty, so it will create much faster finalization. also having the largest hashrate for its hashalgo, it is also quite secure from 51% attack.
@sidhujag a good point and maybe in the following years we can switch from LTC to SYS, but for the initial switch, i think people can understand LTC much easier than SYS. one step at a time

when the BTC fees go crazy as they do, it also disrupts things a bit, we can handle it but it is much cleaner to get confirmed notarizations every 2.5 minutes. since LTC blocks are less than 10% full, we dont expect any fee wars or mempool clogging.


[13-Apr-21 09:00 AM] jl777c#5810
in BTC it gets to where in some cases atomicDEX swaps time out and fail due to the BTC slowness and mempool problems and these are all factors that dont even take into account the cost

notarizations will be final on average in about 2.5 minutes, this alone more than compensates for the less security of LTC vs BTC, since a lot of people start doing swaps without notarizations since it takes too long for a notarization


[13-Apr-21 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810

I'm looking for the tweet but Charlie Lee admitted that LTC Devs controls 90% of LTC Pools (that is not the case with BTC Pools that are not controlled by BTC Devs), did you consider this as a possible threat for dPoW ? LTC Pools may be less decentralized than BTC. Hopefully, LTC Devs are good guys I'd say (no history of bad actions in LTC)

[13-Apr-21 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
@phm87 it seems the worst the pool operators can do is a censorship attack, so that would make it behave similar to when BTC mempool is backup, eg. a lot of times.


[13-Apr-21 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the LTC algo is totally different than BTC SHA256, forget the exact ratio, but each LTC hash is many many BTC hashes


[13-Apr-21 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
with 10% non-compromised nodes, then we get a 25 minute confirmation time, even if the 90% do a sustained censorship attack, forever. basically BTC performs almost as bad as LTC would under extreme attack scenario


[13-Apr-21 10:48 AM] phm87#7395
From my point of view, we need a coin first on its ASIC hashrate algo (or quasi-ASIC for Ethereum) so LTC is a good choice. ETC would be a bad choice.
LTC is a copy of BTC techwize but it doesn't matter for dPoW as long as LTC is first on its mining algo

[13-Apr-21 10:52 AM] phm87#7395
as I read the code in stratum and saw on zpool, if a BTC block could be found, all merged mined coins on sha256 will pop a block


[13-Apr-21 10:53 AM] phm87#7395

[13-Apr-21 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is unclear if merge mined coin can be used without any new attack vectors. since the cost for LTC notarization is minimal, cost reduction from LTC is not an issue at all. and being the dominant coin for a specific algo is what matters


[13-Apr-21 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810

Too right! The crypto ecosystem should really be interoperable across the grid. Hmm, so natural choice, eh? It's just a bit surprising to hear LTC, which I think is great since LTC hasn't really made any kind of big moves, like BTC/ETH in terms of currency moves. For me, I'm more into the functionalities of a crypto, hence, functionality tokens are way more interesting than currency tokens, in terms of seeing how the crypto market builds its network as the next gen of the global financial system. Oh, I digress!! Pardon me! Anyway, congrats and well done on executing your latest NN S5 with LTC!

I'm not sure how the VRSC bridge to ETH works, but could those same cross chain notarizations be leveraged into an ETH based dPow?


[14-Apr-21 06:55 AM] Doink#4797
@jl777c we're you involved in the decision to change dPoW notarization to LTC instead of BTC? Any chance Komodo can still support both, in case people prefer the higher security of BTC, and are willing to pay more for that increased security? Otherwise, LTC notarizations should be sufficient for most small PoW projects

@Tylor zkFS when verus liquidity pools are actually live, the DEX buyback will resume at the then current market price, subject to adjustment as the market values change. the DEX buyback was active for something like 6 months and millions of KMD worth purchased. with the extreme volatility in KMD/BTC price the DEX buyback is paused and now the VRSC testnet is soon, we just need to wait for it to go mainnet and the liquidity pool to be setup. i never guaranteed a permanent price guarantee. that is impossible for obvious reasons. i did buy back literally millions of KMD worth, but there is a limit to the amount of KMD for the buyback.

Two little questions :
- are you involved in the Tokel project. And if yes, in what ways ? 
- do you have anything to say in the ways the $millions saved from the dpow network switching will be spend? In your opinion what will be the better use ? (Devs to make GUI from the tech you developed for the Komodo blockchain? Devs to implement new tech? Dev to launch new projects showcasing the KMD platform possibilities ? No time dev but something else ? Etc...)

i have been an advisor for TOKEL, also i put in some funds, but that is not to mean as an investment, but it seems a good ecosystem project to support. of course, that is not to say it wont become a very good investment


[15-Apr-21 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
other than the technical benefits of switching to LTC, of course it frees up the BTC, so the team will have funding for many more years, if not decades depending on price trajectory of BTC. also, team is already generating revenues so its not that there was a large burn rate.


[15-Apr-21 01:50 AM] jl777c#5810

Is there a reason why you buy back so much DEX Assets? You think holding Dex will be a good decision? What you expect will be future earnings per dex? For example by the end of year...what did you excpect how high will the montly earning per dex? Or in other words...what do you think...how much will be the daily volume on adex,dogedex.... all dex of which dexholder benefit?


[15-Apr-21 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i fully expect that DEX will achieve a higher price, a webdex people can use from a browser that supports atomic swaps and zatomic swaps. it wont take much daily volumes to generate that much in revshares (compared to the overall crypto marketcap)

[15-Apr-21 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
but i do remind that i recommended to purchase ARRR when it was 0.03 KMD, using the KMD rewards to purchase ARRR over the years, you would now have more than 1:1 ARRR for each KMD


[15-Apr-21 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i also recommended to purchase VRSC


[15-Apr-21 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
when you have the realistic prospect of qualitatively higher marketcap, then the exact price is not so important. it does take years for the price to catch up though


[15-Apr-21 03:10 AM] jl777c#5810
using the KMD rewards to purchase promising coins, it automatically makes you cost average over time

For monthly earnings $5 per dex,  what's the volume over atomicdex supposed to be?


[15-Apr-21 03:37 AM] CHMEX#0686
+-60m a day


[15-Apr-21 03:44 AM] Walter83#3669
Thats not much to be honest


[15-Apr-21 03:47 AM] Walter83#3669
But i think 60m a day is not correct....you need a volume of 260m per day to earn 5$ per dex per month


[15-Apr-21 03:48 AM] Walter83#3669
260.000.000/777 (fees)


[15-Apr-21 03:49 AM] Walter83#3669
/ 1.000.000 (amount of dex)


[15-Apr-21 03:50 AM] Walter83#3669
*0.5 (dex holder get 50% of fee)


[15-Apr-21 03:50 AM] Walter83#3669
Than we have 0,167$ per day


[15-Apr-21 03:51 AM] Walter83#3669
And 5$ per month


[15-Apr-21 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
260 million per day, but that would be a revshare rate more than 15KMD per year, which would be worth a lot more than 15KMD onetime cost. this is why i am optimistic about DEX value


[15-Apr-21 03:55 AM] CHMEX#0686
There are now only 450k dex or so rest was burned

i dont want to say there wont be a deadline, since it seems people will hold me to every specific detail without applying common sense. so certainly in 50 years, the deadline will be passed and i dont want people to think they can wait until 2100 to convert

[15-Apr-21 07:45 AM] PTYX#6840
Hummingbot isn't accepting any new integrations for 1.5 months. So we have that long to do the integration, make the PR to their git, and they will put us next in line when they start accepting new integrations. If you have those funds for a bounty, let's coordinate because they definitely do help.


[15-Apr-21 08:03 AM] phm87#7395
We discussed in the past integration of adex into ccxt, it can bring more usage (trading bots, arb bots), volumes and more exposure


[15-Apr-21 08:05 AM] SHossain#0007
OctoBot is more open in this sense. You can always develop new `tentacles`  and use it. Recently they added a feature `GridTradingMode` which made my KMD marketmaker bot more stable in Binance.

one idea being thrown around was to create automatic trading scripts that someone could run and let people deposit funds into, then they get rewards distributed based on returns and their liquidity contribution. sort of like an AMM but for AtomicDEX

it would but  i guess no more trust than using an AMM and being exposed to hacks, rugpulls, and impermanent loss


[15-Apr-21 08:19 AM] PTYX#6840
someone would need to launch a company and setup this sort of service. the compnay gets a percentage of the profits and does the custody of funds. users just plug liquidity in and get rewards back.

I envisioned a portal that shows different strats. arbitrage, scalping, etc. the user picks their favourite, they deposit funds that are locked for an x amount of time, they get rewards paid out and can move the original funds when their lockup time if complete.


[15-Apr-21 08:22 AM] PTYX#6840

i actually think a service like this would incentivize liquidity. the reason why adex has low liqudity is 1. it's hard to do, and 2. there's no clear reward for the LP


[15-Apr-21 08:28 AM] PTYX#6840
the common everyday LP has no idea or how to arbitrage. in regards to the difficulty, it's so hard to run an LP that I can't do it and I'm a halfway technical person.

remember a few years ago when i said to buy ARRR with your 5% rewards? congratulations to all that listened as you would now have something like 30 KMD worth of ARRR from the 5% rewards. most people think the 5% of KMD is just 5% of KMD, but really it also gives you first access to the other ecosystem projects. in this case the 5% ended up being 1000% per year

then remember when i started recommending verus? it is now knocking on the door of the top 100 coins (https://coinmarketcap.com/coins/) that would make it the third coin in the ecosystem to be in the top 100 at the same time. it could also be that SUPERNET would be in the top 100 also, along with DEX, but they are more tokens than a proper cryptocoin (not surprising considering their origin).

anyway, for all the doubters, we now have seen a massive increase in KMD liquidity and price, explosion in ARRR valuation to becoming a viable contender for the top privacy coin spot, VRSC emerging as the ultimate defi coin (among a lot of other things). In the long run, the tech does win over the hype. in fact the best tech is able to generate and sustain the best hype for all the peoples that think that only marketing matters. just watch as ARRR eats into XMR marketshare

it is similar here. as all the millionaire pirates get accustomed to their new position, they will look about and the first things they will see are the other ecosystem coins. but this will take time as a large number of pirates came from the vigilantes and then the WSB types who care nothing about the history of ARRR. However, once they are pirates, they will certainly learn their roots and if there is a big difference between ARRR and KMD, it will be like arbitrage. the ratio will shrink


[26-Apr-21 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
one thing i was worried about was if it was possible for an ecosystem coin to far exceed KMD valuation. in the NXT world, all the tokens were capped by the NXT marketcap. ARRR proves that it is indeed a totally independent chain and with a much simpler value proposition which is completely implemented, the marketing of it was able to be much more effective. to those who say komodo has no marketing, they will have to explain how ARRR has so much marketing, ARRR is from the komodo

remember when i said i still had some unfinished work to do, namely to help ARRR, VRSC and CHIPS. Making good progress with ARRR and VRSC has been pretty independent for a couple years now, so that leaves CHIPS. as you know the CHIPS has been in development forever, literally 6 years if i remember right. and it is about to have a working multiplayer demo. i did come up with a pretty nice new tech idea to really help CHIPS, but that is not yet, so i wont say much about it for now


[26-Apr-21 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i will say that if you are able to get CHIPS now, using the 5% rewards, probably not a bad idea. the problem is that we dont know what its price is.


[26-Apr-21 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
```We need to do a bit of price discovery since CHIPS hasnt really traded in a long time. I will put up 1000 ARRR for auction. post your bid in CHIPS in the chips trading channel. min price of 1:1, meaning if you are willing to swap CHIPS 1:1 with ARRR and nobody outbids you, then you will get 1000 ARRR for 1000 CHIPS.
auction will last until next Monday```

with the beginning of the decline of BTC, the entire crypto space will be open to a revaluation of what is important. recently the BTC chain became totally broken for notarizations. mempool was so big, new notarizations didnt even make it into the mempool. the foresight of @ca333 to prepare LTC as the chain to notarize to paid off as @Alright was able to help the notaries to migrate to LTC. on-the-fly! this was a behind the scenes heroic effort and the only people that even noticed were those whose exchange deposits were not noticed or atomic swaps not completed.

when BTC refused to increase blocksize and shift to become purely a store of value, it lost a big part of its usefulness. still it is everywhere and useful due to all the integrations that it has, however when the txfee is $50 or more and takes maybe days to confirm... well how is that any different than a bank wire? and if BTC is only as good as doing a bank wire and it is become all corporate, maybe it is more similar to XRP in category now?

when komodo ecosystem works on a specific goal, it keeps at it until it has the absolute best tech, then keeps on improving it, then at some point the marketing sort of takes care of itself as the world is watching crypto and there are influencers like the vigilantes who will buy a big stake and then start helping others to make big gains. isnt this a much more efficient way to market something that paying 1 BTC for a cointelegraph "article" that people forget about in a day or two

with LTC we get much faster notarization times. using the BTC it was less secure since a lot of people disabled it. what good is a seatbelt that you dont use??? so on paper BTC is the highest security chain, except you cant actually use it for anything other than buying yachts and mansions. with LTC the blocks are only 5% used, so there is plenty of room and from a security standpoint it is actually about the same as BTC was in 2016. basically very secure, but not being congested and expensive, the notarizations will work much better and everybody can wear the seatbelt of notarizations

[26-Apr-21 08:29 AM] Sdunbar#5064
If I do, I bet it's like 2 of them lol


[26-Apr-21 08:33 AM] Sdunbar#5064
found it.


[26-Apr-21 08:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
For chips I think some big whales need to start selling cheaper tbh


[26-Apr-21 08:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
even if they think their chips are worth 100$ a piece


[26-Apr-21 08:33 AM] Sdunbar#5064
What's going price?


[26-Apr-21 08:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Their coins are worthless if only 100 people hold 90% of the circulating supply (not sure if that is the number, but as a figure of speech)


[26-Apr-21 08:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
you need smaller holders as well to be able to buy cheap in the hope of doing a 10x or whatever


[26-Apr-21 08:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As those are the guys pulling in others


[26-Apr-21 08:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and not whales sitting on stacks of coins


[26-Apr-21 08:58 AM] jorian#4555
I agree. I think it will happen when a product is ready


[26-Apr-21 08:58 AM] jorian#4555
Or near ready, beta ready


[26-Apr-21 08:58 AM] cipi#4502
better than doing 10x once is to do 2x 100 times üôÇ ... on AtomicDEX, through buying and selling
my CHIPS are gone, i had them in orderbook... now there is only a big buy order for same price
would be good to add https://coinpaprika.com/coin/chips-chips/ to https://coinpaprika.com/exchanges/atomicdex/, so that this trades are visible, together with their price


[26-Apr-21 09:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
then it will definitely not happen :p


[26-Apr-21 09:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
whales even less incentivized to let the chips go 'cheaply'


[26-Apr-21 09:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
not it is valued at 2kmd/chips according to cheapest sell on adex?


[26-Apr-21 09:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so thats like 50million mcap with no viable product yet


[26-Apr-21 09:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
completely mined


[26-Apr-21 09:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
an no liquidity


[26-Apr-21 09:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
that's not something any other whale or retail investor is going to look at and think


[26-Apr-21 09:12 AM] Cryptoon#3362
'well that's something I want to spend 1000 EUR or 100k EUR on..."

just saying üôÇ


[26-Apr-21 09:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
part of the reason ARRR did such a big runup was because many whales were selling from 2000 sat all the way up to 30k sats


[26-Apr-21 09:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
giving others the chance to actually buy 'cheap'

[26-Apr-21 09:15 AM] hastrup#8742
Is see


[26-Apr-21 09:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362
completely mined at this stage is in many people's eyes the same as fully premined before there is even a viable product, no?


[26-Apr-21 09:15 AM] hastrup#8742
You are right on that few own alot of chips compared to arrr.

üò¨


[26-Apr-21 09:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
top 20 holds 80% of supply üôÇ


[26-Apr-21 09:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
at first glance


[26-Apr-21 09:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Radical proposal and a lot of people are not going to like it (actually only the whales might not like it):
Switch to new chain or hardfork existing chain, increase supply to something like 100M, treat the first 20M mined as premine for the early supporters to keep the chain running etc, use the remaining 80M as incentive to onboard new miners/followers. Miners are incentivised to sell a bit to cover mining costs boom setting the price for the premine.


[26-Apr-21 09:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
With the MVP coming out for the poker client 200M fully diluted valuation might not be crazy giving it a price of 1 chips = 1 kmd ish, but that price will also attract miners and other players


[26-Apr-21 09:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
or even better, the miners are the players running a PoS node


[26-Apr-21 09:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
thus being incentivized to play as they get rewards (rakeback ish like on normal pokersites)


[26-Apr-21 09:25 AM] hastrup#8742
Supernet holds the most funds maybe when it lunch all the ones with a verus I'd could get some for playing? Idk it does not seams fair to me that the ones that already have invested in it to get there stach deluted?


[26-Apr-21 09:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
They dont see it diluted immediately, as the rest is not mined immediately


[26-Apr-21 09:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
it's a catch 22 problem, where no new investors will come as the price is too high and nobody is selling and nobody likes the prospect of top20 owning 80% of supply. But with price too low also no investors want to sell


[26-Apr-21 09:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so no new investors and no liquidity


[26-Apr-21 09:27 AM] hastrup#8742
Then it should be put into a vote for the owners


[26-Apr-21 09:27 AM] hastrup#8742
1 vote for each chip


[26-Apr-21 09:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
again, havent thought it through at all, just a first thought that comes to mind


[26-Apr-21 09:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but seems like it's somewhat of an issue (for me at least)


[26-Apr-21 09:32 AM] daemonfox#6136
Check the tech and journey of CHIPS evolving here... no need to dillute it holders did the work to lay this foundation.


[26-Apr-21 09:32 AM] daemonfox#6136
What other chains you know had a working Lightening implementation?


[26-Apr-21 09:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but if you think they dillute then you assume that the remaining x % of mineable supply is instantly mined


[26-Apr-21 09:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
but if you make it a slow one


[26-Apr-21 09:33 AM] daemonfox#6136
its not meant to be mined


[26-Apr-21 09:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
also what is the point of being a chips whale if there is zero liquidity


[26-Apr-21 09:33 AM] daemonfox#6136
Its to run the poker games


[26-Apr-21 09:33 AM] daemonfox#6136
there will be liquidity


[26-Apr-21 09:33 AM] daemonfox#6136
the GUI just is not out there yet for production use


[26-Apr-21 09:33 AM] daemonfox#6136
only CLI users and the team of testers have that now


[26-Apr-21 09:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
do you think early apple investors feel bad that they are dilluted after 30 years?


[26-Apr-21 09:34 AM] daemonfox#6136
and how old is CHIPS?


[26-Apr-21 09:34 AM] Cryptoon#3362
ohno I first had 5% of apple, and now I only have 0,01% of a multi trillion dollar company


[26-Apr-21 09:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
anyway, think about it, I dont think such a move will take value away from early investors, on the contrary!


[26-Apr-21 09:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think it will help push price higher faster


[26-Apr-21 09:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
look at what happened to ARRR price when liquidity was available üôÇ


[26-Apr-21 09:36 AM] daemonfox#6136
ARRR has a built in value proposition in production


[26-Apr-21 09:36 AM] daemonfox#6136
CHIPS is in startup mode


[26-Apr-21 09:37 AM] daemonfox#6136
This is what JL meant with his remarks to PIRATE marketing itself... it was prod ready to the public to provide its service: z-transactions.


[26-Apr-21 09:39 AM] daemonfox#6136
Also, before aPoW was implemented, CHIPS had to move like any other equihashcoin, ASICs, for blockrewards of 0.0001 up until aPoW.


[26-Apr-21 09:39 AM] daemonfox#6136
There has already been a long standing set of paid up front resources that went into every CHIP

https://medium.com/@jameslee777/tokenomics-are-for-tokens-not-for-coins-3f262d0aa4b3

So if there is no value from having these coins, why do they have any value at all? The answer is the network effect. The more people that have a coin, the more that coin is worth due to the N*N effect of having more users.

Intrinsic, $ based value does not have to be the sole motivator of a blockchain


[26-Apr-21 09:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
with chip being 1$ those resources have paid themselves 100x


[26-Apr-21 09:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so kind of a moot argument


[26-Apr-21 09:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
anyway, it doesnt really matter, just trying to give an outside view/opinion on how a non-chips holder would look at these things


[26-Apr-21 09:41 AM] daemonfox#6136
I mean...


[26-Apr-21 09:41 AM] daemonfox#6136
are you a Vegas chips holder?


[26-Apr-21 09:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
it being de-facto 100% pre mined before there is a viable product doesnt look enticing to me


[26-Apr-21 09:41 AM] daemonfox#6136
and is it the same thing that you cant get them any other way exceppt $1:$1


[26-Apr-21 09:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
that is a stable coin, if you just mean casino chips


[26-Apr-21 09:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so not really comparable


[26-Apr-21 09:42 AM] daemonfox#6136
but just as not comparable to a singular store of value


[26-Apr-21 09:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
as I assume you hope your chips are worth 100$ each along the line


[26-Apr-21 09:42 AM] daemonfox#6136

[26-Apr-21 09:43 AM] daemonfox#6136
their $ value is meaningless int he grandscheme... i have many friends who play online poker... I want them to play this at launch and secured funds for them at a low rate.

gambling never is until youre hooked


[26-Apr-21 09:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362

CLC is not notarized yet, so does not enjoy the faster confirmations. MCL being a staked chain may have odd blocktimes.

There is some history with CHIPS that you are forgetting. There was a market for chips. It has been on a few different CEX for a while. But due to lack of product and marketing those markets died off. We even lost the CMC pricing. This essentially trapped CHIPS holders years ago. We were told that there wouldn't be any marketing. CHIPS market ground to a halt. So to understand where we are now, CHIPS hodlers, have been waiting for product and marketing launch. The lack of liquidity and concentration of funds is the result, not because CHIPS hodlers are being greedy. @Cryptoon


[26-Apr-21 10:53 AM] daemonfox#6136
Which personifies the fact that maerketing != development of a maturing technology. CHIPS wont need to be marketed when it becomes apparent it is a unicorn of decentralized table making with provable outcomes.


[26-Apr-21 11:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Again, i‚Äôm not saying they are greedy, hell i can perfectly imagine that even current prices are low when taken into account possible futures


[26-Apr-21 11:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But selling a bit ‚Äòlow‚Äô to attract more investors may be the kickstarter on route to a 100$ chip üôÇ

CHIPS emission will be honored. period. end of discussion on that.

üëÜü•≥ü•≥ü•≥


[26-Apr-21 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
if the CHIPS whales want to make it into a top 100 coin, they will need to donate/sell reasonably enough to create a vibrant community. if they hold onto all the supply, clearly it wont get anywhere close to the top 100.


[26-Apr-21 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i am sure there will be a price that will convince the CHIPS OG to sell. in todays market what should the marketcap be for a coin that has integrated realtime decentralized poker? clearly it is worth a lot more than a dollar. however, until it has a strong community and active users, deployed tech, it wouldnt be worth $50 (price for billion+ marketcap). that being said, the price in todays market can go a bit crazy, but if it does we assume it will correct back down.


[26-Apr-21 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
we are using an auction price to find the floor price and once that is known we can then do more price discovery to establish a fair price, which would be a price that gives liquidity at good profits for the multiyear hodlers, and also gives the buyers a good chance at making significant gains.


[26-Apr-21 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
somewhere between $1 and $50, needs to give enough potential gains to the buyers while at the same time be enough to allow the long term CHIPS whales to cashout a bit to recover what they put in. maybe it is the sqrt of 50?


[26-Apr-21 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
we can use atomicDEX for additional price discovery so put your bids and asks there and when we can see where the price settles, i will organize an IDO where we would make a significant amount of CHIPS available at a fixed price


[26-Apr-21 12:41 PM] jl777c#5810
```on the issue of PANGEA and BET assetchains. it is clear that it is just another layer of complexity and it is better to simplify. CHIPS is what will have value from the betting and poker, so i will be sunsetting both PANGEA and BET assetchains. There will be a 1:1 buyback with CHIPS.
```


[26-Apr-21 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
what this means is that each PANGEA will have the same value as BET, which will have the same value as CHIPS. will be setting up a 1:1 swap on atomicDEX


[26-Apr-21 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
and that leaves the CRYPTO assetchain, which will also be effectively sunsetted as now we have switched to LTC notarizations, it will take decades to build up to the million usd worth. its value is just not worth much without the BTC notarizations. There will be one last distribution after all the BTC has been converted, but after that CRYPTO will have minimal value. i guess in the event LTC goes to $10,000+ it could end up generating revshares again, but best to not count on it

i believe that brings all the assetchains other than SUPERNET to closure and many will live on through vDEX. SUPERNET will continue to help ecosystem projects with seed financing and maybe the occasional good idea or two.

So no more revshare for penga and bet?


[26-Apr-21 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
they become CHIPS


[26-Apr-21 12:57 PM] hastrup#8742
Will chip do revshare?


[26-Apr-21 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
which will be a top 100 coin, so this is a good outcome


[26-Apr-21 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
no revshare, just growing value


[26-Apr-21 12:57 PM] hastrup#8742
Who get the fee?


[26-Apr-21 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
miners, dealers, team fund, up to CHIPS team


[26-Apr-21 01:02 PM] hastrup#8742
But 1 chip for 1 pengea thats not much compared to if chips will be 100 coin that's alot alot of fees pengea will be missing.


[26-Apr-21 01:04 PM] hastrup#8742
1 kmd is not 1 dex


[26-Apr-21 01:04 PM] hastrup#8742
So 1 chip should not be 1 pengea


[26-Apr-21 01:05 PM] hastrup#8742
It's effectively doing the same for each coin


[26-Apr-21 01:07 PM] hastrup#8742
Is it the difference in marketscap?


[26-Apr-21 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
the BET and PANGEA marketcap have 10x less potential than CHIPS, if not 100x


[26-Apr-21 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
getting a full CHIPS for each of them is me being VERY generous. if you dont like this, then i can just not do anything and then BET and PANGEA wont have much revshares, no liquidity and basically be worth pennies. is that what you prefer?


[26-Apr-21 01:10 PM] hastrup#8742
I'm i understanding it wrong here. Pengea gets fee from each hand dealt?

like dex is getting for each order confirmed


[26-Apr-21 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but this revshare can now be moved to CHIPS


[26-Apr-21 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
so owning CHIPS you can get the pangea revshares


[26-Apr-21 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea why you are complaining


[26-Apr-21 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
this makes pangea, bet and chips all the same, so much easier to solve what is best allocation of the rake

he is looking for passive income


[26-Apr-21 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
and it boosts the value of chips


[26-Apr-21 01:12 PM] hastrup#8742
@jansako like we all do lol


[26-Apr-21 01:12 PM] jansako#3330
that was not criticism


[26-Apr-21 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if chips community decides to allocate revshares to chips hodlers


[26-Apr-21 01:13 PM] hastrup#8742
That will dilute 1m to 21m


[26-Apr-21 01:13 PM] hastrup#8742
So one pangea is 21 chips


[26-Apr-21 01:13 PM] hastrup#8742
Plus bet ofc


[26-Apr-21 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
you are wrong


[26-Apr-21 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
the total games of poker played has nothing to do with the coin supply


[26-Apr-21 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
i will be funding the CHIPS needed for the buyback


[26-Apr-21 01:14 PM] hastrup#8742
What the coin supply for pengea and bet?


[26-Apr-21 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt matter


[26-Apr-21 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS never had claims on the revshare, you understand this?


[26-Apr-21 01:15 PM] hastrup#8742
Apparently not


[26-Apr-21 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
and now all the revshare claims are being transfered into CHIPS


[26-Apr-21 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS becomes the combined (CHIPS + PANGEA + BET)


[26-Apr-21 01:15 PM] hastrup#8742
Do you know the intentions of chips?


[26-Apr-21 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
do you trust my judgement about coins, market capitalization, revshares and crypto in general?


[26-Apr-21 01:15 PM] hastrup#8742
Ofc I do


[26-Apr-21 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
i created CHIPS


[26-Apr-21 01:16 PM] hastrup#8742
Aways


[26-Apr-21 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
i fully understand it


[26-Apr-21 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
trust me, this is a very good deal for BET and PANGEA


[26-Apr-21 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
and it also helps CHIPS


[26-Apr-21 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
which BET and PANGEA become equivalent to, granted there is dilution, but as you see with ARRR, you need critical mass to get the massive 100x gains


[26-Apr-21 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
without piggybacking onto CHIPS, there is no way a revshare coin will achieve the critical mass


[26-Apr-21 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
existing structure is way too complicated and nobody understands it


[26-Apr-21 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
being simple helps sell it

[26-Apr-21 01:20 PM] hastrup#8742
Is your argument. by giving chips out to pengea and bet that will give more chips into ppl hands. Then more will use it also gets it simpler


[26-Apr-21 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it streamlines CHIPS, makes it possible to explain it clearly, yes it also helps distribution! which as it stands is horrible and must be fixed


[26-Apr-21 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
CHIPS is the perfect name for what it is and it will dominate the decentralized gaming, if we can fix the structural problems. primarily the distribution, secondarily the complexity of the pangea/bet/chips relationship


[26-Apr-21 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
by the time you finish explain how it all connects and works, well, probably the new person is confused and a confused person doesnt buy


[26-Apr-21 01:24 PM] hastrup#8742
But one chips each tbh I feel abit cheated here. But you set the price not me. I get its complicated my girlfriend is like a wall when I try to explain some of it. But the ball is in the chips corner now they decide if there is any revshare in chips.


[26-Apr-21 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i am confident that the value 1 CHIPS will grow much faster and higher than the value of BET or PANGEA

this was proposed in 2019 (by me) and rejected by community unfortunately.


[26-Apr-21 07:59 PM] Mylo#8306
the benefit of the rejection was that the solution for cpu mining a fully mined chain was implemented in chips, after it came out of kmd tech (aPoW)


[26-Apr-21 08:15 PM] Mylo#8306
CHIPS will flourish - a lot. it's tech is "here now" (but in reality, soon, sometime this year, like adex)

i have been chatting with someone that owns a gambling license and the costs involved in setting up a bonafide company to run dealer tables and claim the rake is not out of the question of setting up.
the opportunity for the KMD ecosystem through 2021 is enormous, and has changed a lot since the nxt days.

i am not soliciting for any contribution or advice atm, but will present what i can offer/facilitate later in the year

when i was a kmd team member, i had expressed how much the older assets were holding kmd back, and these buy backs jl777 is offering is great for the whole ecosystem!
hats off to everyone who has stuck around, change is sometimes a hard pill to swallow - lettting go of old expectations in the shift to where crypto is now compared to then is part of the journey.

This is why i grabbed some CHIPS a while back. Friends in Texas work a Poker room, and have been looking for ways that made sense to be able to continue using their license through COVID. Had this been ready last year, problem solved, but even now, anyone paying attention can see the CHIPS value proposition if they grasp the underlying tech involved and what it means.

In a way the investors then, will have less risk because they will invest in sort of a mature project. Existing investors should also be able to cashout a part for reasonable returns while freeing up liquidity for a run up.

CC can be used only on transparent tx so CC won't work on ARRR (except maybe for notaries with crazy limitations)

realistically speaking, there's no big apetite for private NFTs. the idea of an NFT is to show it off somehow.


[27-Apr-21 07:56 AM] PTYX#6840
i just saw that Binance is issuing their own NFT platform and also a few others are launching opensea-analogues on BSC. https://nftb.io/. I honestly don't think that Tokel should compete with these platforms that already have an advantage. Tokel should work similar to an aggregator where it's pulling NFTs from multiple platforms and allows non-EVM chains to issue their own. There's a huge market for it. Older blockchain platforms can issue NFTs through tokel without having to revamp their whole stack.


[27-Apr-21 07:57 AM] PTYX#6840
Low fees, ease of use, and cross-blockchain NFTs i think will be a winner for tokel.

selling whole or fractional real estate through NFTs or any digital form usually falls under security regulations to some degree or another.

If you have the public address you can check your coins from the explorer - and then you can check that your privatekey matches with the public key.

@daemonfox how to use multiple seed and private keys from paper wallet


[06-May-21 02:30 PM] plazma#1625
in DEX


[06-May-21 02:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
multiple profiles


[06-May-21 02:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
DEX is a single addy at a time


[06-May-21 02:30 PM] daemonfox#6136
So link 1 eaxch to a profile, log out and in


[06-May-21 02:30 PM] plazma#1625
no custom multiple profile ??


[06-May-21 02:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
not in a single UI...


[06-May-21 02:31 PM] plazma#1625
for better coin management


[06-May-21 02:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
When you launch a profile, it is tied to one seed


[06-May-21 02:31 PM] plazma#1625
dam


[06-May-21 02:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
its not bad though


[06-May-21 02:31 PM] plazma#1625
its look like lot of work


[06-May-21 02:31 PM] daemonfox#6136
I use several profiles... its decently quick to swap between


[06-May-21 02:31 PM] plazma#1625
nice


[06-May-21 02:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
setup takes a bit, but usage once set is simple


[06-May-21 02:32 PM] plazma#1625
is setup hard


[06-May-21 02:32 PM] plazma#1625
will there be tutorial


[06-May-21 02:32 PM] plazma#1625
?


[06-May-21 02:32 PM] daemonfox#6136
no... just gottas do one profile, one key at a time, log out, make a new one


[06-May-21 02:32 PM] plazma#1625
ok


[06-May-21 02:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
Just click the box for custom seed, and use your WIF for the next address you own


[06-May-21 02:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
name them each something that makes sense to you


[06-May-21 02:33 PM] plazma#1625
some coins i have seed and some only private keys


[06-May-21 02:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
both work


[06-May-21 02:33 PM] daemonfox#6136
Custom seed takes seed phrase and WIF key


[06-May-21 02:34 PM] plazma#1625
but some coin like bitcoin and bitcoin cash use multiple address with each payment


[06-May-21 02:34 PM] plazma#1625
some have dust


[06-May-21 02:35 PM] plazma#1625
so its will be nice to have swap abilities with multiple address with funds


[06-May-21 02:36 PM] plazma#1625
thanks anyway will wait for pirateDEX


[06-May-21 02:40 PM] daemonfox#6136
in aDEX and MM2 everything points back to your single key... change going to a change address is just default behavior of Bitcoin and the like...  with DEX, change is always sent back to the same address.


[06-May-21 02:41 PM] plazma#1625
yea

Hey @jl777c 

Cosmos has in development a feature where staking rewards that have not been claimed yet, are able to be used in derivative trading.

Any plans/ideas/thoughts on enabling this on kmd awards?


[14-May-21 05:46 AM] Mylo#8306
Also, hopefully you know something here jl777 or community friends know some info about PoS chains interoperability with cosmos ibc? Eg polkadot theoretically being able to.

Would like to know if kmd pos chains or pow/pos chains would theoretically be capable?


[14-May-21 12:07 PM] Doink#4797
Hey @jl777c 

What projects are considered the biggest competitors to Komodo? It's hard to pick, but it seems like $SOL is the closest, maybe $RUNE - any others? I'd like to do a direct comparison to show how undervalued $KMD is


[14-May-21 06:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I would consider polkadot and cosmos as similar tech features as kmd.

Yeah it's also what BSC, Solana, and Polka did. The advantage is the amount of resources available for solidity. Imagine a solidity environment that uses KMD as gas.

It comes down to usability. There's more solidity devs in this space than CC devs. There might be 10 CC devs whereas there's thousands of solidity developers. If we had an EVM or something that could port a solidity contract we could attract more people to actually use and build on our tech. That doesn't mean we need to get rid of anything unique to Komodo, simply adding to the stack will make the ecosystem more attractive.

Being a "me too" platform is not a reason to use komodo. But like @PTYX indicated, to capture market share you need to meet certain criteria, like ease of use for developers.

Ideally komodo can do smart contracts with cc or solidity, has LPs, and $kmd has token rewards / more benefits for using it in the ecosystem.


[16-May-21 08:14 AM] ejuliano#8606
will zatomic swaps brings an even bigger wave of awareness and adoption ??  significant enough to flip the "mainstream" narrative more strongly?  zatomics are such a high level use-case (not to say atomic swaps themselves are not high level use case, but why does the "industry" of crypto gives it so little attention unless the spotlight "teams & projects" backed by big money start?  i'm thinking of who was it ...thor rune eric voorhees?  anyway that situation comes to mind about claiming atomic swaps;

and the public of crypto "users" themselves are not "using" their "crypto" in that way, because the interoperability stage is not yet upon us.  Ethereum chain makes crypto become "crypto", and there is the benefit & the harm of it, so not judging here, but in too many minds, cross-chain is just an ethereum thing.  With clones and "bridges" to get into cheaper models like BSC, and centralized multisig custodial models for layer solutions ...
holding on to a dead horse floating down the river?  maybe the river is headed to the same destination eventually anyway.  Verus helps largely with that.  Entirely, I dare say!

when will non-vc matter again, or is that time passed?

i figure "real" crypto is immune to "mainstream" mindset, but, is it so powerful that it can even defeat mainstream mindset, through the paradigm shifts it forces?  (i saw a relevant buckminster fuller quote about that earlier today)

I think to PTXYs point, being able to run Solidity, would be attractive to many. Whether it‚Äôs the right strategy, I don‚Äôt know (doesn‚Äôt seem easy to implement) but to me it would be more like Mac adding boot camp. It isn‚Äôt Apple admitting Windows is better, but an acknowledgment that not everyone is ready or able to start over and give up all their old software that only works on Windows. It‚Äôs a gateway, to facilitate a smoother transition.


[17-May-21 03:36 AM] Nev#5914
It could also be a gateway for the undesirable to practice their solidity on new projects with fresh victims but perhaps that's just negative of me.


[17-May-21 03:37 AM] Nev#5914
As well as many new eyes to see undesirable code or shenanigans.

[17-May-21 05:11 AM] PTYX#6840
Any young ecosystem is ripe for exploits, scams, etc. We've seen that much with BSC. However, we've also seen BSC bootstrap an entire ecosystem with solidity in less than a year. Uniswap like exchanges, loans, nfts, wallets, gaming, gambling, and all sorts of other services by just supporting solidity.


[17-May-21 05:13 AM] PTYX#6840
How long would that take to build from scratch? If we do manage to build it, who will use it? To me, adding support for solidity isn't about throwing away any unique Komodo features but adding more appeal so that developers can do things themselves. With CC and most of our tech there's handholding and that takes bandwidth away from the team. Implementation would take time but i can imagine a solidity EVM on KMD that uses KMD as gas.


[17-May-21 08:00 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987

I can't help it, but most devs I know rather not use windows to develop on, but MacOS or Linux.
Just leaving it out there for your own interpretation, without providing mine.

Funny thing is 90% users (my number) would rather use Windows... so there is that. Ultimately the users pay for the devs' time.

I think what he means is that the bulk of users (for what ever reason) use microsoft windows. Similarly the bulk of smart contracts that exist use solidity. Regardless of whether windows and solidity are garage or not is unimportant. The important part is that is where the users are. And for this conversation, if we want to attract more smart contract developers then we need a solidity EVM.

Is it possible for komodo ecosystem to switch from dpow to pos or

[23-May-21 03:02 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So the current build instructions/scripts won't work?


[23-May-21 03:11 AM] CHMEX#0686
when installing just run

./zcutil/fetch-params-alt.sh
instead of
zcutil/fetch-params.sh


[23-May-21 04:02 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That also did not work for me


[23-May-21 04:22 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

[23-May-21 04:22 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
until they rename it again


[23-May-21 04:27 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the scripts in zcutil could use a rewrite anyway, the sh script is needlessly complicated and should be more like the bat (which would only require 1 line to be changed to fix this)


[23-May-21 04:28 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/blob/master/zcutil/fetch-params.bat#L9> is simple enough to change to include `.deprecated-sworn-elves` into the url


[23-May-21 04:30 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
or just change the "alt" thing to be *the* thing and be done with it


[23-May-21 07:02 AM] gcharang#6833
what error did you see when using the alt version?


[23-May-21 07:53 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah this is what I did, but when you try and build komodo, it doesn't recognise the new param name and says you don't have them downloaded. So I also had to change the name in the .zcash-params (I think that's what its called) folder for komodo to build


[23-May-21 07:55 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Apologies I didn't save it, basically when I tried to fetch params and alt params, it said it could download the sprout keys. Once I did what I mentioned above, I then tried to build komodo but it did not recognise the new name of the sprout params and said I needed to download them


[23-May-21 07:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> it doesn't recognise the new param name
hence the `>` part above, that downloads and saves as the "normal" name
the win edit would be
` .\wget64.exe --progress=dot:giga --continue --retry-connrefused --waitretry=3 --timeout=30 https://z.cash/downloads/sprout-proving.key.deprecated-sworn-elves -O "%APPDATA%"\ZcashParams\sprout-proving.key`


[23-May-21 07:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
this saves it locally as `sprout-proving.key` which is what the daemon is looking for


[23-May-21 08:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it could be called `zjkdhfjshdardkjfnh489354zdsfvx84`  online and the daemon will always look for `sprout-proving.key` as local filename

[23-May-21 09:30 AM] gcharang#6833
you can try deleting the `~/.zcash-params` dir and then running just the `fetch-params-alt` script


[23-May-21 09:31 AM] gcharang#6833
running the `fetch-params` script in between when it doesn't work could cause issues as it can leave a partially downloaded file in the dir

I think its a good idea to rename our dpow to something "better" likeI RPA (Recycled Proof Algorithm) , RPM (Recycled Proof Method), PoRA (Proof of Recycled Algorithm), PoRM (Proof of Recycled Method), ...

Why i think so? The future is green and kmd used a green method which is unique. So we need an unique word for it. When people read dpow they  connect it with environmentally unfriendly PoW.

what do you think about this?

.@Komodo's dPoW is recycling ‚ôªÔ∏è for mining.

By notorizing to a chain with a very high hash rate, Komodo "recycles" the mining output to secure $kmd and other smartchains.

Making it one of the most secure blockchains with very low environmental impact.

writing custom consensus code is not easy, and certainly not anything a copy paster should be doing. we already are able to make basically whatever custom consensus we need.  and so can anybody else that builds on what we do, eg. verus

The custom consensus is truly exceptional and you and the team should be applauded for your achievements. I think me and others around here are in awe of this achievement and wish to tell the world so they can share in this. The issue that we see is the preference of our fellow man to gravitate towards the mobs solution. Maybe they are unaware of our solution? Maybe 100 other things. But from our limited point of view bridging the gap with a solidity EVM seemed like a good compromise. I don't see you imposing anything on anyone. You are trail blazing, it is inspirational.

What Do the Most Popular Ethereum Dapps Look Like?
```
1 IDEX (Decentralized Exchange)
2 ForkDelta (Decentralized Exchange)
3 HyperDragons (Game)
4 Blockchain Cuties (Game)
5 Etheremon (Game)
6 EtherDice (Gambling)
7 Kyber (Decentralized Exchange)
8 CryptoAssault (Game)
9 CryptoKitties (Game)
10 Good Luck Casino (Gambling)```

It seems james is right again. Just a cursory look at the list of most popular Eth dapps and Komodo ecosystem pretty much has it or can build it. We have a much better DEX. Chips and or cc for gambling. And rogue.cc, tetris.cc, and the slyris game engine as game dapps examples. Tokel and space for nft and tokens. Verus for defi, ID, and more.  nSPV for unlimited scaling. And pirate for ultimate privacy.

When looked at it from this angle Komodo cc already is doing everything solidity can do and maybe more.

You are wrong, you can put sifchain in the same garbage as thorchain, and chainflip, those are AMM with CLPs, depending on nodes, and censorship:

https://sifchain.finance/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/sif_tokenomics_latex.pdf
https://chainflip.io/learn
https://docs.thorchain.org/frequently-asked-questions
https://docs.thorchain.org/how-it-works/governance

In short terms:

You have those project which require insane hardware to run their, nodes, on top of that they have only dozen of nodes up right now, and they can decide which coin is listed or not, they need to run full nodes for each blockchain they want to support, it's absolutely not scalable, mm2 require almost no hardware, can run everywhere: mobile,web,desktop and everyone is a node


[27-May-21 02:26 AM] giotti96#2039
Thor chian Is not scalable ? ahaja


[27-May-21 02:28 AM] Slyris#2880
I think you should read the requirements to run a node on Thorchain and their censorship


[27-May-21 02:28 AM] Slyris#2880
```
THORChain governance decides:
which assets are listed/delisted
which chains are listed/delisted
when the protocol gets upgraded
the economic limit ‚Äì how many nodes can participate
```

If you think this is decentralization, then you can go into this project blindfolded


[27-May-21 02:29 AM] Slyris#2880
```
Full nodes - for every chain that is supported by the network, each THORNode operator will run their own full node of each chain (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Binance, etc).
```

If you think this is scalable then you misunderstood their approach

[27-May-21 02:33 AM] Slyris#2880
Sorry but your first question was to bringing project that doesn't have the same philosophy of AtomicDEX and trying to convince us that sifchain or any thorchain approach would be good, we do not play in the same category - for the usage i strongly advice you to wait for WebDEX, then you will be able to compare both model yourself, you cannot just come here and say `i mean sifchain is a directive competitor of komodo now`, because it's simply false

but maybe atomic dex was the first ahaha


[27-May-21 02:35 AM] Slyris#2880
Lot of people claims lot of things, if you look at the chainflip doc it's the same story, what i can say it's that we do not play in the same category, and it's unfair to compare them with us, because we are still in Beta / BUIDL mode, a fair comparaison would be to wait official release (especially webdex)

At the end of the day, we will see which project is the most decentralized, and which one really brings something, with zatomic swaps and monero support in the future we will have a good advantage on our side

I can appreciate not wanting to be a "me too" platform. But, many developers are learning solidity to get into smart contract development. 

Theres a difference between creating something uniquely more capable and going against the market. I dont think adding solidity compatibility takes anything away from Komodo. It enhances it. At the very least it allows us to onboard skilled solidity developers more easily.


[27-May-21 09:45 AM] Slyris#2880
I'm not sure this is really the case, Solidity is what javascript is to the web, that doesn't mean it's the best way. Cardano does not force you to use Solidity to make smart contracts, With Solana you can write rust directly for the web assembly, same for polkadot, the truth is that smart contracts tend to become `wasm` compatible modules directly in the Web.

The new web standard is not javascript, but wasm, just like the new smart contract standard will not be solidity directly, but wasm modules that you can deploy on chain (polkadot substrate, solana tokens and sc) and so on

I myself as a developer look at the code of the EVM, it is really insufficient for the needs of the world of today and the decentralization of tomorrow, I think that it would be a bad idea to support something of so specific while wasm modules aim to run everywhere whether desktop or web, and it's agnostic, you can write a smart contract in whatever language you want and generate a wasm module

It's one thing to say it isn't the best or isn't the only language.

[27-May-21 10:01 AM] Slyris#2880
I think once we have a CC utxo rust/wasm library that allow you to compile into a wasm module that is compatible with our technology, any dev can use any langage and use wasmer to provider their wasm module

What you want is probably not Solidity support but high level library that allow you to create wasm compatible module with Komodo, that's being said

wasm allow you to use your favourite langage: go,rust,c,c++,python,javascript and so on

[27-May-21 10:43 AM] ca333#0333
yes, web-environment can be compared to the operating system of the future. Lots of usecases will run native in the web-browser as it makes tech truly platform agnostic. In such era even my TV or coffee-machine can run ADEX or any other software. It is one of many reasons why we picked this path and did this technology stack choice - and in few years you will see very few endusers still use Desktop PCs or Laptops and numbers be stagnating - unless you are a crypto-geek or core-dev or so won't use it. i.e. average person will run mobile or hybrid devices. Few years down the road will see 90% or more of global web-access happen through mobile end-devices. Many native (d)applications will migrate from native OS specific software to platform-agnostic and OS-independent web-application - WASM is likely just beginning of this shift. Really, imagine web-browser/environment to become OS environment of the future.

making solidity compatibility would be like making a MSDOS compatibility when windows is already out. if to base all decisions based on just market size at the moment, it is not always optimal.

I know tons of us have asked and gotten responses about Komodo and the EVM, solidity etc. Here is a good read of a project that seems to have done all the work to lift ETH functionality into a zk stack of automations. You can see everything done so far to accomplish that and it just shows how much work it's going to be to scale accessible ETH based solutions.

I feel like the internals matter less to the end users compared to the end result. Komodo doesn't intend to do things how other projects do, but there is no denying the end result products of the EVM are desired by the masses.

Komodo needs one major effort to gather major attention: a Custom Platform Composer with webhooks in the UI to link all of the docs and param  explanations on the website, a maintenance UI  that has menus and buttons for all functions not just wallet basics and a set of example guided deployments that show how to deploy the basics to achieves each specific end result product.

It feels like when most ask for more marketing, they might really mean they need better product definition and delivery. This may be why companies like MSFT still have an Azure blockchain offering that runs ETH powered products, because they SEE the end product working and can replicate it and automate deployment.

https://medium.com/matter-labs/zksync-2-0-hello-ethereum-ca48588de179

@jl777c#5810   Komodo doesn't need Solidity compat, but no one can deny the popularity of the end products. With so much BTC freed up, publishing and compiling comparative product offerings is something worth investing in for Season 5 and I'm curious what you think could or should be done to accomplish that.

Komodo will never be ETH and with this proposed tool set, Custom Consensus could be unleashed to a much broader audience and show how much Komodo can already do.

Sounds like...
What does it take to get a Komodo Virtual Machine, what would be a timeline for this, and is this planned or applicable to the current roadmap/focus? 
Can this be made functional though the AD?


[02-Jun-21 10:05 PM] Slyris#2880
Why everyone want a virtual machine instead of native wasm module... Virtualization have pity performance compared to blockchain that have native web assembly support, there is not only smart contract for AMM in the real world - the only reason why blockchain would like to use VM is from a business model, they can force gas fees cost for each VM operation, that doesn't make any sense, every single machine now support wasm not only the web


[03-Jun-21 12:41 AM] Exile13#4458
Either or. My terms may be incorrect, yet the end result is allocation of Komodo's full stack for public use of some sort, it would be cool if it was through the AtomicDEX gui somehow.

The devs reasoning of solidity VM vs wasm  is very solid for wasm. But for the sake of compromise, why can't we do both? Is there a reason that a compromise can't be made? Wasn't there a funding proposal for the BCH community where the costs were laid out? They then raised the funds. I get why our best devs architecturally don't want to do anything but wasm, and we shouldn't spend their time and effort on solidity VM. However let's compromise and layout a path for the features that several people would like to see. This can also be applied to features of the DEX that some of us would also like to see. Thank you for reading.

Hypothetical Project - SolidCoin

The main goals for this project would be to create a Solidity EVM that is useful for attracting Solidity developers, Solidity project migrations to komodo smart chains, and a kmd ecosystem bridge to ETH.

This is accomplished by incorporating wasm into a CC library making it the platform agnostic OS environment of the future. SolidCoin will utilize a high level library that will allow you to create wasm compatible modules with Komodo. The Solidity VM will be such a module.

SolidCoin will act as the fuel for the Solidity VM and wasm modules.

SolidCoin will create a CC utxo rust/wasm library that allows you to compile into a wasm module that is compatible with komodo technology, any dev can use any langage and use wasmer to provider their wasm module.

SolidCoin will utilize funds, in a similar mannor to Tokel, raised from an initial funders round to pay for development. Initial funders will get a portion of SolidCoin development premine equal to their donation percentage. Funds will be held via multisig by trusted community.

``` Solidity is what javascript is to the web, that doesn't mean it's the best way. Cardano does not force you to use Solidity to make smart contracts, With Solana you can write rust directly for the web assembly, same for polkadot, the truth is that smart contracts tend to become wasm compatible modules directly in the Web.

The new web standard is not javascript, but wasm, just like the new smart contract standard will not be solidity directly, but wasm modules that you can deploy on chain (polkadot substrate, solana tokens and sc) and so on -slyris```

```I myself as a developer look at the code of the EVM, it is really insufficient for the needs of the world of today and the decentralization of tomorrow, I think that it would be a bad idea to support something of so specific while wasm modules aim to run everywhere whether desktop or web, and it's agnostic, you can write a smart contract in whatever language you want and generate a wasm module.
What you want is probably komodo build something like: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm equivalent 

Btw with wasm and wasmer you can run any wasm module from all those programming langage: https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer

......

I think once we have a CC utxo rust/wasm library that allow you to compile into a wasm module that is compatible with our technology, any dev can use any langage and use wasmer to provider their wasm module

What you want is probably not Solidity support but high level library that allow you to create wasm compatible module with Komodo, that's being said

wasm allow you to use your favourite langage: go,rust,c,c++,python,javascript and so on

```yes, web-environment can be compared to the operating system of the future. Lots of usecases will run native in the web-browser as it makes tech truly platform agnostic. In such era even my TV or coffee-machine can run ADEX or any other software. It is one of many reasons why we picked this path and did this technology stack choice - and in few years you will see very few endusers still use Desktop PCs or Laptops and numbers be stagnating - unless you are a crypto-geek or core-dev or so won't use it. i.e. average person will run mobile or hybrid devices. Few years down the road will see 90% or more of global web-access happen through mobile end-devices. Many native (d)applications will migrate from native OS specific software to platform-agnostic and OS-independent web-application - WASM is likely just beginning of this shift. Really, imagine web-browser/environment to become OS environment of the future.

wasm cc or zksync cc, would certainly be good to have, but it is a big task and would require an entirely new project team to work on it in order not to derail the current projects. even assuming that this is all done, then how is it marketed? solidity devs would keep using solidity on ETH, BSC, half a dozen other chains. certainly if someone wants to manage all this, then it is possible, but who will do the fund raising, project staffing, project management, marketing, support, etc?

The efforts of Nutella are very impressive.  And his efforts serve to provide a template to be imitated.  Too bad we can't clone him. 

I can't answer the question of who will do the project management, staffing, funding, support. At this stage am just trying to see what type of interest is in something like this, maybe someone will step up? It would be great to have a guestimate of how much funds would be needed to hire a development team for wasm and then solidity.

dpow may move to something more like what orbs does, again idk.

the future is wasm stuff. in atomic dex (desktop) using nspv (ultra lightweight p2p client) for komodo dapps. the komodo dapps are the crypto conditions stuff. collaterlized stablecoins, game engine [1], and integration with other ecosystems (dual daemon & BEP20 ecosystem stuff)

1st priority is atomicdex doing amazing things across desktop, mobile & web. the web dex (with wasm) is when things get really exciting. everything else is a distraction at this stage. nft atomic swaps as well.

jl777.com has a brief overview of my accomplishments. duke makes many false claims, one claim is that he was able to extract information from the zero knowledge zksnarks, but he has no proof of this. zcash devs have all dismissed him. 

he also reuses code that @Forge wrote and claims that he wrote it. maybe he doesnt remember things properly, which is the most benign interpretation of his actions.

keep in mind he started calling everybody "government agents", including everybody on the HUSH team, who then all chose to leave. 

oh, he also claims to be a better dev than me, even though in my experience with having to spend many hours helping him, he was at the level of an advanced junior level dev.  even after all the years doing crypto, still not fully understanding things, but knowing enough to copy and modify existing code and able to make the simpler things.

i guess his is the second biggest betrayal that happened to me in crypto.

Yea I've seen it, to be fair, if I researched correctly that domain isn't their real website anymore, theirs is currently https://hush.is and the other I've sent before, the one you've sended was their old website that got in the hands of a former Hush member GillardH which also had a dispute with Duke Leto.

Why not use all fees to buy back DEX over a period of time at a set rate, then once all DEX have been bought back, they then just burn the KMD


[18-Jun-21 02:03 AM] Mylo#8306

b) but when all DEX have been bought back, what do the fees go to?

[18-Jun-21 02:17 AM] jansako#3330
IMO the concept of 'burning money' is a gimmick that people use when there are no actual use cases. Why would you burn something that is already valuable? Create scarcity by having a use for what you have, instead of artificially create less of what you have in order for the value to rise.


[18-Jun-21 02:21 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It's not a gimmick when there is a huge difference in legal requirements when you are paying dividends or revenue from a service to holders vice destroying part of the currency. Both increase the value of the coin the same amount. 

If the currency were to have a fixed supply, there may be issues when you have burnt a significant portion of the currency, but the burn would always be a factor to the remaining coins left. In the case where the supply isn't fixed, this would never be an issue.


[18-Jun-21 02:22 AM] jansako#3330
The legal requirements are an issue for the service, not KMD holders. For this purpose they are 2 distinct groups.


[18-Jun-21 02:23 AM] jansako#3330
Do DEX holders advocate for burning of the fees? They can just burn the fee after they received it...


[18-Jun-21 02:25 AM] jansako#3330
Using the DEX fees to cover the ongoing costs of compliance is a valid proposal though. Have not seen that posted yet.


[18-Jun-21 02:27 AM] jansako#3330
Personal opinion: Anyone wanting to burn Dex fees should first show proof of how they burned their own 5% reward.


[18-Jun-21 02:53 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The service should consider what options they have based on the outcome they want and the legal implications of doing so are. If I were considering options for value sharing with the least amount of legal shitshow, id consider a burn protocol. Im not stating that a burn is a perfect solution for DEX, as I have mentioned im not all over the specific situation.

Based on your comments in your personal opinion, I dont think you understand how a burn works and who it benefits.
Burning your 5% reward would benefit KMD holders as a whole, including yourself, as you'd be reducing the supply. You would be losing the amount of KMD you burnt, but increasing the value of the rest of the KMD you hold (and all the other KMD in existence).

Active user rewards has a specific use case. It creates coins and gives them to active users. If you were to burn these coins, it wouldn't change the value of peoples holdings, because the coins are being created, they are not already in existence, therefore the supply doesn't change (well it does, it would create them, then burn them, meaning the same supply). Also, a burn benefits every holder of the coin, not just the specific active users.


[18-Jun-21 04:17 AM] jansako#3330
I believe it was said over and over that having KMD used as a 'coin' (read: medium of exchange, increase tx numbers) is the main target here. Having the value increased is a result of reaching that main target. Burning coins does not contribute to higher usage or am I missing something? Again, burning coins creates artificial scarcity which may be good for 'investors' but now KMD is an 'investment vessel'? 
Yes, we all treat it as such, including myself but in my case that is mostly because I have not found any other use for it yet.
Which is what I see as KMD's biggest challenge as well.


[18-Jun-21 05:11 AM] cipi#4502
don't forget https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/715
this would benefit AtomicDEX traders (they pay less fees), DEX holders (fewer foreign coins to convert for the payout and fewer fees lost due to dead coins) and KMD holders (additional use case, increased demand)

Thats probably the biggest combo ask i would say since there is already a lift to vDEX and the following product for fee shares. That would give the perfect opportunity to embed voting AND activate low/no fee trading when holding X amount of DEX in the same wallet and elect fees to pay into the aDEX bucket instead of your own.


[18-Jun-21 05:25 AM] daemonfox#6136
I would GLADLY let DEX fees accrue to the product in exchange for low or no fee trades int he dEX


[18-Jun-21 05:28 AM] daemonfox#6136
i.e I put 100 DEX into my aDEX wallet, flip a switch saying my future accrued DEX payouts will go direct to the aDEX fund for dev etc, and poof, fees drop for all trades.


[18-Jun-21 05:31 AM] cipi#4502
afaik there is already a discount implemented for takers who use KMD to buy other coins and thus pay the takerfees in KMD too... the above issue, when implemented, will allow to pay this takerfee in KMD even if you actually use BTC to buy other coins... the big benefit in this case is that you save the network fees for sending takerfee in BTC, which is often very expensive

We must be close to a DEX now that can BTC BCH... KMD others... not only atomic swaps. which is a mixer in itself but through a jumbler. Or a time based release mass pool through Pirate, Hush, Cloak. Question is can i enter with ETH... Buy BTC... have it send to a Z.address to release on a time lock perhaps 1 hour to an outside address. Can i just tell the recipient here is 1BTC will be there by 2pm and no way to see where it came from... yet maybe get a nice receipt on return?

@jl777c or @ANybody who knows, with Komodo block chain being able to sporn side chains to cope with sudden transaction growth and already been tested to many thousands with expected capacity much bigger. Would it be safe to assume that really there are not enough people in the world to test it's full capacity if there is one at all or do you think that is pushing it a bit far? Thanks anyway.


[27-Jun-21 02:17 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
On question of scaling with needing to increase transactions on chain, it‚Äôs capacity on within single chain can be increased by block size increases (totally unnecessary right now), along with parallel chains running with same chain IDs. So there is no limit to kmd‚Äôs main chain scaling and it‚Äôs smart chain‚Äôs scaling too. Komodo smart chains can adapt the scaling parameters right now, and kmd mainnet can adapt if it will need it in future ever. This is not even a concern for kmd right now.

Yes, but TBD.

Dex holder get 50% of dex fees

So for 1.000.000 volume on adex dex holders get : 1.000.000/(777√ó2)= 643,5$

643,5$ for 1.000.000 dex assets...
If you have 2000 dex assets like me you get : (643,5$*2.000)/1.000.000=1,28$

hey james

re: the dexp2p data marketplace
in the current version, p2p parties can transact with a simple exchange of COIN <--> FILE (a coin for a file or stream as @SHossain  demonstrated)

i have a use case where a user wants to access the data that would be in the FILE if the file existed, however, the data cannot be stored in a file because there are too many combination of data retrieval to store as a file.  the data is stored in a database/api/graph.

what is the best way to offer access to this database/api/graph through the exchange with the COIN?

1. somehow create a file that has an API endpoint with 1-time-use access token, and then the "buyer" can use the url and access token in this file to get the data?
2. the dexp2p can connect directly to an external data source (instead of file)

an example:
a car has a VIN (id number on the chassis/car-body). the VIN has numerous parts for the car, including doors, radio, heater, gearbox etc.
a repairer & insurance agent wants to know details about the radio for this car, but not the other data, nor do we want them to have access to the rest of the car's data.
the repairer & insurance agent have COIN and want to get the radio serial number out of the dexp2p accessible external data source (which co-incidentally has been entered into a blockchain supply chain in it's own journey into the manufacturing process)

how to enable this data retrieval from external source using COIN?

maybe you can create a simple request protocol.
1) requestor uses dexp2p messages to define what details are wanted.
2) DB side verifies it is ok to offer such data and if so, generates (encrypted) data in a file and returns the filename to the requestor (along with price?)
3) if acceptable terms, requestor buys the generated file

something like that


[16-Jul-21 02:48 AM] jl777c#5810
basically make the api accessible via a special dexp2p message and plug into the sell file for COIN. since it would then be available to anybody, if it is sensitive info make sure to encrypt it to the requestors pubkey


[16-Jul-21 02:48 AM] jl777c#5810

dexp2p wont be able to scale up to having super large number of interconnected nodes, but as long as you can selectively connect to the service providers, it will make a nice convenient comms system


[16-Jul-21 03:16 AM] Mylo#8306
yeah doesn't need to be super large, thanks for that tid bit.
maybe the data providers can be limited to those "blessed" by industry consortia with a vested interest in a functioning data marketplace
functionally as a p2p comms system, it will be a good solution


[16-Jul-21 03:52 AM] jl777c#5810
sems the users would just choose which data providers they will connect to. the data publishers just need to post the ip address of their nodes


[16-Jul-21 03:58 AM] Mylo#8306
ok cool. we can do that p2p as well using KV (or oracle)

I thought of an inDEXing service that connects many DEXP2P networks and in my solution OrbitDB  was one answer. also as the leacher opens the DEXP2P network they then become a service node. If you category data into many networks then DEXP2P can scale up IMO

I want to enable cross chain behavior like this:

1. Hold 100KMD on kmd chain
2. On smart chain, same address can use create heirCC only if main kmd chain holds 100KMD

How can I do this?

Dual daemon? Cross chain proof? DT Oracle that writes into smartchain oraclesCC?

{Reactions}
shexy (2) 

[09-Sep-21 09:41 PM] Mylo#8306
HeirCC used as example.

Let's say it was RogueCC. In order to play a game, hold XXX coin in another chain at same raddress.


[09-Sep-21 10:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the smart chain would need to be modified to use merkleproofs from the KMD chain in its heirCC. depending on what you are doing, it might not be needed to put such crosschain logic into the consensus and rather can be done in a dapp at L2


[10-Sep-21 09:21 AM] Mylo#8306
Can do, but it wil be hosted service to send after confirming balance on main chain. Which is ok for first iteration/use case.

Deposit merkleproofs crosschain and faucetCC allow access to other smartchains, without 3rd party . Handy for the valueless coin dapps across smartchains.

This is more important to me, allowing me to separate chaindata, eg industry to industry in supply chain, or game like satoshi based checkers.

Thanks for response, i wont overthink it until its time to build decentralized part, next year.

I'm having a little trouble understanding the data formats for the oraclesdata.cc

I created an Oracle using 'L' and 
I followed the instructions
```
https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-api/oracles.html#oraclesdata```

and used this hex code  00000000ffffffff 
from the examples.
This gave me an output of 18446744069414584320 via oraclessamples call.

```./komodo-cli -ac_name=TOKEL oraclessamples 12d5c2d2be0c8f7678869df838a44608ce0697c5f578eb1e61ef179aefd0a02c RLBnUChtDD7WkG2YyBNs78ytRsLcxe6K4u 2
{
  "result": "success",
  "samples": [
    {
      "txid": "7916ee098f06e97fea2c7c1d447c9e716f28b43eae88d7c3418d39df3ff29450",
      "data": [
        "18446744069414584320"
      ]
    }
  ]
}```

I don't know how this number was calculated. I've tried it in different hex converters but have not gotten it.

Can anyone explain? And also provide some oracle acceptable samples that work with the below formats?

```
The various formats of data that can be registered for an oracle and their symbols are as follows:
    s -> char string; size < 256 bytes
    S -> char string; size < 65536 bytes
    d -> binary data; size < 256 bytes
    D -> binary data; size < 65536 bytes
    c -> 1 byte signed little endian number, 'C' if unsigned
    t -> 2 byte signed little endian number, 'T' if unsigned
    i -> 4 byte signed little endian number, 'I' if unsigned
    l -> 8 byte signed little endian number, 'L' if unsigned
    h -> 32 byte hash
```

you can trigger this code by this tui https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo-cctools-python/blob/master/oracles_cc_tui.py , not sure tho if it's fully compatible with current oraclesCC since not touched this code for a two years üôÇ

Hi jl, hope youre keeping hydrated and healthy.

Over how much time did you or your collaborators take to work out the tokenomics of kmd?
The assetchain revshares, why were they set at specific %?
Have you got any advice or references for tokenomics?

Next week I am going to start adding it to team meetings within our food project, and playing with spreadsheets.

Thanks


[23-Sep-21 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
assetchain revshares were based on historical amounts from NXT days


[23-Sep-21 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
probably it was one of the first things to have tokenomics, just used some common sense percentages

Hi @jl777c what are the technical obstacles to swap NFT atomic? Would it be difficult to allow this with an Antara setup? And how?


[23-Sep-21 06:44 PM] Mylo#8306
cool. ok.

what about KMD block reward 3KMD vs the initial premine, and the halving?
the 5% target for cutoff, is there some correlation/ratio between the original ICO investors and what the circulating supply was theoretically possible at block 7777777 for the 5% reward, and why 5% and not 7% or 12%?

did you play around with these figures to see if there was a certain sweet spot, or was a balance between what was attractive at the time of launch with what was available in 2016?

was it modelled from another coin or economy?

BTCD had 5% from staking, also 5% seems a reasonable inflation rate


[23-Sep-21 09:45 PM] jl777c#5810
then given that 50% would be premine, cutting off the 5% at 77777777 limits the supply to below 200 million


[23-Sep-21 09:46 PM] jl777c#5810

@cryptosammy the biggest hurdle seems to have compatible blockchains and also agreement that the swaps are honored by the community. i guess if it is burned on one chain and created on another, then people would agree that there is only one valid version of the NFT that is unspent


[24-Sep-21 01:54 AM] cryptosammy#3587
@jl777c what if the atomic swap support would exclusively smart chains based on Komodo made with Assets module? What would it take to accomplish this

thank you for reply


[24-Sep-21 02:18 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
There is a difference between atomic swaping an NFT/token and migrating an NFT/token to another chain. 
Alright is looking into token atomic swaps for Tokel platform use, but as with all things Tokel related, this will be open sourced and be usable by other Komodo ecosystem projects/smart chains.


[24-Sep-21 02:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
NFT/token migration is a whole different problem to atomic swapping tokens. As JL mentioned, the integrity of the ownership over the single token (non-fungible type) needs to be maintain by what is most likely a burn mechanism.


[24-Sep-21 02:20 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Atomic swaps requires changes to the token cryptoconditions transactions and associated opreturn data to allow for HTLC transactions


[24-Sep-21 02:26 AM] cryptosammy#3587
I love answers that boggle my mind. Token exchange does require a centralized solution now?


[24-Sep-21 02:27 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
No not at all, check out Tokel. We are using AssetCC as a decentralized on-chain trading mechanism for tokens <-> the TKL coin

Without getting too far off the topic of the channel, if you're interested in learning more about token technology that is being developed and improved on within the Komodo ecosystem, Tokel is where it is occuring. We are pushing all of our updates back into the Komodo repositories, and are working directly with the KMD team for development. I can definitely assist in this area.

@jl777c Hi jl, I am working on a simple game. I saw that you made a very complex game a while ago ( @‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª  pointed this out), so I thought I might ask you.

I think that a player with an "Avatar" token can help to authenticate a player. If you have one token that is tied to your R-address, in your wallet possession is a good starting point, is possible to create a kind of "secret" hash using this token that can validate that the person playing is in fact in possession of the token?


[30-Sep-21 12:43 AM] Mylo#8306
get this person to send a transaction to an authentication wallet.  when tx received from player, it logs the person in.


[30-Sep-21 12:45 AM] Mylo#8306
e.g. create a LOGIN coin with no value on a new chain. but it's an authentication coin to send tx to applications.


[30-Sep-21 12:45 AM] Mylo#8306
i was going to do this for a backgammon game in my _suite of simple games_


[30-Sep-21 12:47 AM] Mylo#8306
it is similar workflow to logging into desktop/browser discord (or binance) and using your mobile device to scan QR code


[30-Sep-21 12:47 AM] Mylo#8306
instead of LOGIN coin, you can use RICK or MORTY for testing the functionality


[30-Sep-21 12:47 AM] Mylo#8306
the beauty of multichain env with komodo tech is r-address is portable across chains


[30-Sep-21 12:57 AM] cryptosammy#3587
@Mylo sounds simple enough! I've seen signing of "messages" here and there, thats how i came to the secret hash idea. I thought it would be fun to be able to "trade" your player avatar too, like saying, when someone invested in play time


[30-Sep-21 12:57 AM] cryptosammy#3587
but if it is not possible the authentication wallet idea works


[30-Sep-21 12:57 AM] cryptosammy#3587
thanks!


[30-Sep-21 01:05 AM] Mylo#8306
the avatar is an NFT in #cc-rogue 
so yes you can sell your game character, if that's what you mean.
after you save your game, your player data is saved as NFT data.
which is sellable

@Mylo omg is this a RPC library?


[30-Sep-21 01:26 AM] Mylo#8306
this is the rpclib https://github.com/The-New-Fork/python-blocknotify/blob/master/lib/rpclib.py
originally written by @TonyL & @smkhound 
there is js rpcliib written by @gcharang 

the openfood.py is a bit higher level, does application-y stuff more useful to food transparency, but obviously a lot of it is re-usable for other quite low (but not as low as rpc calls) level stuff, e.g. chaining together a couple of rpc calls to create something of more utility.

this type of library (openfood) is what we are building for an application server for enterprise facing data.
when things are more settled, we will be converting these functions and chaining together of functions into crypto-conditions so more complex things can be done from a single rpc call, instead of having to chain together bunches of them.

@jl777c can you provide some insights when it comes to designing/developing a module or extend a module to trade a token vs token and preferably tokens vs token? 
- Lets say I have 100 wool tokens that I would like to trade against a sweater token? 
- Or have 10 spider venom tokens, 2 snake fang tokens and a wood token that together are tradeable against a "poisoned dart" token?

yeah, it doesn't necessary matter, but it would be nice to know what is necessary to setup to build with Windows 10 (like the instructions on Atomic DEX)

[15-Oct-21 05:11 AM] dimxy#2587
What AtomixDEX instructions, could you plz show me?
Building cryptoconditions is invoked from the build_win.sh in the root libnspv directory. Cryptoconditions is an add-on library used to create cryptoconditions (aka Antara) modules, a komodo tech for on-chain apps.

Just a thought: Is there a way to count those (maintenance) merges as just another shuffle of the transactions, which it sort of is, so the anon set continues to go up? Thus maintaining the general rule we've been advertising that every transaction increases the anonset.

on the topic of a thought on implimenting aPoW in future network upgrades, @ComputerGenie says this:
> aPoW incentivizes high bust mining, profit switching, leaving the chain stuck, and then coming back later when the diff drops
> in a valued chain with hash, it creates the problem it was meant to solve in lesser wanted chains

what I was actually looking for is how CC and Komodo looks like in architecture compared to Bitcoin.


[29-Nov-21 03:44 AM] cryptosammy#3587
I understood that between Bitcoin and Komodo there is Zcash, so I would expect some architecture additions because Bitcoin doesn't implement CC.

this essentially creates a "~~route~~pathway" for these types of transactions to be validated using cc code logic.


[29-Nov-21 03:57 AM] Mylo#8306
op codes are super low level.  something like hex on a wire, that indicates something to pass up the layers.
on of these layers is then the cc logic.


[29-Nov-21 03:59 AM] Mylo#8306
opcodes are not hex on a wire btw.

if there isn't - @jl777c in one of your interviews you mentioned that you first draw things out (or used to). Looking at the visual map of Bitcoin, which elements would be missing to get a "Komodo" map? I believe CC definitely needs to be in there somewhere or am I wrong?


[29-Nov-21 04:04 AM] cryptosammy#3587
i only understand that opcodes can contain arbitrary binary data and that they can be used to execute bitcoinscript (and I might even have that wrong)


[29-Nov-21 04:07 AM] Mylo#8306
opcodes are like calculator buttons for arithmetic.  + - * /
they are commands.

@Mylo if I get this right, the OP_CHECK_CRYPTOCONDITION allows you as a developer to create your custom consensus mechanism, like making hybrids? I was only aware of PoW and PoS, but after some research, I discovered there are plenty of them. Which means that when you pick Komodo, you are capable to even create your consensus technology and aren't restricted to PoW/PoS/PoA or whatever?


[29-Nov-21 03:22 PM] cryptosammy#3587
And when you "register" your Antara module with its EVAL_CODE, then that consensus model applies to that type of blockchain you create?

Not how consensus is reached, pow vs pos or any other, but the validation rules. Contracts are rules. Cc are rules.

How the validity of the rules is agreed across the network, this is the pow/pos ness. 

Cc are rules. Rules don't care about how they are implemented.

Further, Cc is an open standard. Cc does not rely on an algorithm implementation of any single kind. It is a specification. Algorithm agnostic, programming language agnostic, signature scheme agnostic.

Also on that diagram, the storage engine is larger in komodo. Block size.
And, a performance engine, that stores indexes of addresses, transactions, timestamps.
Without performance engine, no cc. It would be possible to make it impossible for the chain to be synced with cc and no performance engine.

Hi JL,
I am currently working on NFTs on Tokel Blockchain. Each NFT is unique. They are skulls that I bring to life. I also immortalized JL777 and used a humorous description. 
I hope it's ok. I would give you this NFT if you are at all interested. Otherwise, with your permission, I would auction this off at some point. https://explorer.tokel.io/tokens/779e21ec6457254e98bd7ff424df541e02782d801d673974b9e8f026aa4516f5/transactions

Hey James & community readers,

Is the PoS of kmd smartchains considered nakamoto consensus?


[09-Dec-21 01:25 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Nakamoto consensus is the network nodes agreeing on submitted blocks being valid.
PoS is a mechanisms to select which node is eligible to submit a block to the chain (Just as PoW is).


[09-Dec-21 06:24 AM] Mylo#8306
is verus PoS nakamoto consensus?
because PoS from BFT style consensus has proposers for blocks, which is the "leader" style, and leaders can be corrupted. thus, not nakamoto consensus


[09-Dec-21 06:26 AM] Mylo#8306
i know with smartchains, the PoS has the segids, 64 of them, and they go in a roundrobin for eligibility within a node. but that's as far as my understanding of it goes


[09-Dec-21 06:30 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
It is not `leader-style`. Proposed blocks (generally PoS blocks, but sometimes PoW blocks too) get orphaned, because a stronger solution is provided by another node. So Verus always follows the strongest solution, not necessarily the block that was first known to the network.


[09-Dec-21 06:32 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
The PoS part is defined by the staking difficulty, which is a governor to keep the PoS/PoW ratio at 50/50. The PoP paper on the Verus website can provide you with all the details you need (`https://verus.io/papers/VerusPoP.pdf`)

I am reviewing our code for DPoW, prior to submission to KMD team for their review.

I have included a 2 notarization window (25 blocks minimum each) for finality of blockchain history. I am seeing in KMD‚Äôs nSPV code (which I am porting to chips) that `notarisationdb` files are used to access notarizations. 

The NotarisationDB class includes mentions to `BackNotarisation`s. As these are never mentioned in Komodo‚Äôs Dpow header-only implementation for 3P 0.15 BTC-like chains‚Ä¶ I have two questions:

**1.)** Is a 2 notarization cycle considered final (for blockchain history to be set in stone) on most source chains for DPoW? Or just KMD->BTC/LTC?

**2.)** Is KMD the primary chain that considers the concept of ‚Äúback notarizations‚Äù in consensus? Do source chains or assetchains consider this data as well?

Implementation details can‚Äôt be known until arrrtomic is active. Also there is no promises from any dev teams it will be implemented. It‚Äôs just that the possibility of jumblr implementation is only after arrrtomic kind of swaps are possible.


[25-Dec-21 05:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Another way would be extending subatomic swaps. Proof of concept is there, just need some team to pick on it. But arrrtomic is much securer than subatomic for jumblr I would say.


[25-Dec-21 09:36 PM] jl777c#5810
@Biz dimxy is the one most familiar with nspv now. the concept of back notarizations is something  the dapps can look at, such as wallets. the main consensus uses the rule that notarized blocks cannot be reorganized and a notarization is a transaction. from the latter point, it could happen that a notarization tx that has not been notarized could potentially be reorganized out of the chain. and if that happens, that notarization would not be registered. once a notarization tx has itself been notarized then there are no edge cases that can remove that notarization.

[26-Dec-21 06:36 AM] Biz#0842
When I say notarization above, I am referring to a block with notarization transactions within it


[26-Dec-21 06:39 AM] Biz#0842
In blur‚Äôs consensus rules, as written, one notarizing block can be re-orged. Once a second one is seen, it is ‚Äúset in stone‚Äù and cannot be modified. This logic affects only blur, but I would like to mirror that which occurs in KMD


[26-Dec-21 06:42 AM] Biz#0842
So a 50 minute window (1 block per minute target) is the rough period over which blockchain history can be changed


[26-Dec-21 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i believe that is the same logic that the latest nspv changes have


[26-Dec-21 07:38 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
50 blocks is a hella reorg on any chain with spent value


[26-Dec-21 09:40 AM] Biz#0842
1 hr is a short time period over which to execute a 51% attack. Has less to do with spent value, more to do with feasibility of mounting an attack


[26-Dec-21 09:42 AM] Biz#0842
But, open to hear suggestions on how this could be further improved. Reason I am raising the subject


[26-Dec-21 09:47 AM] Biz#0842
I also added dpowconfs to blur, to help with risk mitigation in event of an attack taking place.


[26-Dec-21 09:48 AM] Biz#0842
So, none of those spent transactions would impact an exchange who chooses to enable this feature

Hi jl

I'm looking at rewardsCC and instead of locking coins of the (native) smartchain, locking tokenized coins of another smartchain (via gatewaysCC), to receive the native coin of the rewardsCC chain.

Eg
CHAIN1 coins distributed via rewardsCC of locked up tokenized CHAIN2.
CHAIN2 is tokenized onto CHAIN1 via gatewaysCC.

Is this going to be developable from modifying existing CCs?

The Secret Inside 777 #shorts
A handful of numbers have a very special property: you can add their digits together and divide the original number by their total without a remainder. And why does it matter? Well, in terms of mathematics, it's mostly a curiosity. Dattatreya Ramchandra (D. R.) Kaprekar saw these numbers as sparking joy in the mind, so he named them "Harshad" nu...

hey @jl777c hope ur well, i haven't posted an update in here in a while and although progress has been a little slower than expected we have made giant leap recently with the final stage testing on the major 1.8 update and the new website (can see at https://cryptocollider.com/beta which has download links for windows & linux of v1.8 included)
also the clc chain has had some stalling problems, and especially now 1.8 is ready and its time to make the upgrade to dPow (which i've been talking through with other team members) - one thing i came specially to ask though is in order to help with the stalling we'll also going to restart the chain with aPoW enabled (which I believe is simply adding the ac_adaptivepow=1 param) but i'm just curious what the other values for that param mean? like tokel uses =6 which i believe is also the default/off but do other number have any meaning?
thanks again, hope u like what we've done with 1.8, arb bot is on the way for 1.9 and then 2.0 the big full decentralisation update ü§û üôÇ

ac_adaptivepow=6 is a good parameter to use. other values can be used but end up triggering more often than it should. with a value of 6, it smooths things out more. keep in mind that it will be a hardforking change to activate aPow, so make it height activated automatically, instead of a command line parameter.

good to hear you have made the good progress!

[27-Jan-22 11:00 AM] daemonfox#6136
How would that be done without the command parameter launching this coin from public Komodo repos? Does a PR need to be approved into Komodo repo with the CLC defined apow activation height?


[27-Jan-22 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i assumed that there would be a separate fork to handle game consensus, so it would become a third party coin. if that is a wrong assumption, then it would be tricky to use the unmodified code to activate an apow hardfork.


[27-Jan-22 11:08 AM] Alright#0419
I could be wrong, but I think `ac_adaptivepow=1` and `ac_adaptivepow=6` function identically in all komodo branches but the `research` branch


[27-Jan-22 11:08 AM] Alright#0419
tokel effectively uses `ac_adaptivepow=1`


[27-Jan-22 11:12 AM] Alright#0419
Just looking at it now, I don't see how the actual value is used other than to check if it's equal to `2`. @phm87 mentioned this to me some months ago. I think we have an update to apow that never made it into production branches


[27-Jan-22 11:18 AM] phm87#7395
I agree but I forgot details. On chips, I used a Dev branch during development of apow before the different values of ac_adaptivepow but when I read the new code of apow for TKL, I had some remarks. I compared branches but my memory is failing. I remember to have discussed it in private with @NutellaLicka


[27-Jan-22 11:21 AM] daemonfox#6136
This is good. Those details and knowing current state of the parameter are important before Collider can proceed. An airdrop on the snapshots is already planned, so a hardfork to activate apow properly is not an issue it seems.


[27-Jan-22 11:37 AM] Collider#6160
yeh this is for the original CLC chain, not the game consensus chain that is not launched yet, so a fork & airdrop appears the easiest way to get apow activated, not too much trouble hopefully ü§û

[27-Jan-22 02:23 PM] daemonfox#6136
This might also be a good case for why current Verushash 2.2 should be updated into Komodo. A CPU only chain for all the backend mechanics would be very useful. But I am aware that consensus with monkins loops is a lot of code to audit and append.

This is from last time this was asked.``` Solidity is what javascript is to the web, that doesn't mean it's the best way. Cardano does not force you to use Solidity to make smart contracts, With Solana you can write rust directly for the web assembly, same for polkadot, the truth is that smart contracts tend to become wasm compatible modules directly in the Web.

The new web standard is not javascript, but wasm, just like the new smart contract standard will not be solidity directly, but wasm modules that you can deploy on chain (polkadot substrate, solana tokens and sc) and so on -slyris```

```I myself as a developer look at the code of the EVM, it is really insufficient for the needs of the world of today and the decentralization of tomorrow, I think that it would be a bad idea to support something of so specific while wasm modules aim to run everywhere whether desktop or web, and it's agnostic, you can write a smart contract in whatever language you want and generate a wasm module.
What you want is probably komodo build something like: https://github.com/CosmWasm/cosmwasm equivalent 

Btw with wasm and wasmer you can run any wasm module from all those programming langage: https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer

......

I think once we have a CC utxo rust/wasm library that allow you to compile into a wasm module that is compatible with our technology, any dev can use any langage and use wasmer to provider their wasm module

What you want is probably not Solidity support but high level library that allow you to create wasm compatible module with Komodo, that's being said

wasm allow you to use your favourite langage: go,rust,c,c++,python,javascript and so on

```yes, web-environment can be compared to the operating system of the future. Lots of usecases will run native in the web-browser as it makes tech truly platform agnostic. In such era even my TV or coffee-machine can run ADEX or any other software. It is one of many reasons why we picked this path and did this technology stack choice - and in few years you will see very few endusers still use Desktop PCs or Laptops and numbers be stagnating - unless you are a crypto-geek or core-dev or so won't use it. i.e. average person will run mobile or hybrid devices. Few years down the road will see 90% or more of global web-access happen through mobile end-devices. Many native (d)applications will migrate from native OS specific software to platform-agnostic and OS-independent web-application - WASM is likely just beginning of this shift. Really, imagine web-browser/environment to become OS environment of the future.

too general a question. L2 is basically anything that builds on top of L1 consensus ,right? doesnt that mean the L2 question is asking what is thought about dapps that are categorized as L2. so dapps with some sort of consensus at the dapp level?

I had written out a longer question but didn't want to bias your thoughts with how I posed it.

What are your thoughts on using layer 2 solutions to solve the blockchain trilemma instead of working on layer 1 solutions?


[14-Feb-22 07:37 PM] jl777c#5810
solving the trilemma seems to be at same order of difficulty level regardless of if it is at L1 or L2, but security of L2 will be significantly less. maybe you can create initial solution at L2 using faster development cycle and then migrate it to L1, so from a practical point of view it might make some sense, but ultimately it will need to be in L1 to have the maximum security. certainly relying on EVM for trilemma solution... that seems very risky due to the attack surface


[14-Feb-22 07:43 PM] jl777c#5810
even given the above, it will totally depend on the actual specific details. general statements will have specific exceptions and it is very possible that there is some L2 trilemma solution that does not have security problems, but until the specifics are demonstrated, it is just a theoretical possibility


[14-Feb-22 08:01 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Interesting. I suppose the benefit for using L2 solutions is that they are individually upgradable and have that faster dev cycle like you said, without having to upgrade/hardfork the L1 solution. I see a lot of buzz in the L2 space for scalability & off-chain processing to reduce gas and transaction fees. To me, L2 is not really 'blockchain' technology, rather just smart contract technology or protocol that leverages an underlying blockchain. It seems like everyone is all in on smart contracts as the holy grail of blockchain tech.


[14-Feb-22 08:14 PM] jl777c#5810
analogy would be operating system vs. applications, applications certainly solve a lot of problems


[14-Feb-22 08:18 PM] jl777c#5810
or maybe an os in firmware vs dynamically updatable software application


[14-Feb-22 08:20 PM] jl777c#5810
you certainly would not want to use the latter method for anything mission critical, though i guess that is changing nowadays... does not make it the correct way of doing things, ie. you shouldnt be updating on-the-fly things like control systems that would have a very large negative impact if there are bugs/attacks


[14-Feb-22 08:21 PM] Mylo#8306
this is by far the easiest way to test solutions for a normie developer. using app servers that simplify blockchain "stuff", so the utxo model is used to communicate as a protocol to the dapps that read the utxos.

this is who i have been developing at least. particularly with openfood, we can now track batches across suppliers by using some "neat tricks" with utxos and spending. like the simplicity of the marker pattern in CC dev, 

i am using the same methodology to test "game engines", and when there is some success, consider implementing them as CCs.


[14-Feb-22 08:21 PM] Mylo#8306
*how


[14-Feb-22 08:24 PM] Mylo#8306
yes. 'blockchain development' with L2 and dapps, is like web dev with web frameworks. the underlying http protocol has had v1 v1.1 v2, but it is not of the concern of the web developer.


[14-Feb-22 08:32 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Very interesting analogy that definitely resonates. How do you see this equivalent analogy in the Komodo smartchain space? Is there such a mechanism, or is it all updating the underlying blockchain?


[14-Feb-22 08:33 PM] jl777c#5810
within komodo, the full spectrum exists. clearly there is ability to change L1, but clearly dapps can be written to the komodo L1


[14-Feb-22 08:37 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Would dapps only get their 'decentralized' part from using the L1 functions of the blockchain, because there isn't a smart contract type ability?


[14-Feb-22 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
now you seem to be conflating decentralization with smart contracts?


[14-Feb-22 08:39 PM] jl777c#5810
clearly smart contracts can be centralized or decentralized


[14-Feb-22 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so not sure what you mean with your questions


[14-Feb-22 08:40 PM] jl777c#5810
you can make a decentralized (d)app, ie. torrents


[14-Feb-22 08:42 PM] jl777c#5810
decentralizaton is not intrinsic to blockchain, smart contracts, dapps, or software in general. it is something that can be achieved, and the blockchain mining process, especially via PoW is very good at creating a decentralized consensus. but you are asking questions that are very general for things where the answers are completely dependent on specific details

a wallet is a dapp, it reads utxos


[14-Feb-22 08:49 PM] Mylo#8306
if a utxo has a value of 0.0001 or 0.0002, in your non-wallet-dapp, this can be a flag to use different behaviour in your dapp.


[14-Feb-22 08:50 PM] Mylo#8306
e.g. 0.0001 turn left, 0.0002 turn right.


[14-Feb-22 08:50 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
ahh yes I am. I think trustless would be a better word I suppose? The smart contract being open source, on the blockchain for anyone to read and know that only what is written into the smart contract can happen (bugs and all).


[14-Feb-22 08:50 PM] Mylo#8306
it's poor man's L1 programming, but can easily be ported from dapp to L1 consensus with CC


[14-Feb-22 08:50 PM] NutellaLicka#4241

Maybe an example of my thinking would clear it up. 

How would one create a decentralized application where there is no trust required in the user to not alter the outcome of the application? If I create a dapp that has logic inbuilt into it and I open source it on github, how do I know the user won't change the variables I have coded into the dapp to adjust the outcome they may get?

good question. this is where a hybrid/hosted solution works imo. because the provider is in total control and can do their due diligence if a project is worth pursuing further.

there's no trust required from the providers point of view, they trust their code, their hosting etc. but from a users perspective, it's not so trustless.

it's part of the spectrum of decentralization and weighing it up against dev costs, project feasibility etc.


[14-Feb-22 08:56 PM] Mylo#8306
and this is a stepping stone for making stuff imo.


[14-Feb-22 08:57 PM] Mylo#8306
this is how i'm going about it


[14-Feb-22 08:59 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'd say this is where smart contracts fill the gap and enable truly decentralized applications. A dev could write code and know that the user can see it, audit it, use it, but not alter it.


[14-Feb-22 08:59 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm not sure if trustless is the right word here either


[14-Feb-22 09:01 PM] Mylo#8306
smart contract has an address, and this is what makes it work without altering it. "this is where it is published, send to here, it will do this".

you can make a "hosted dapp" with an address.
people interact with that address.
you use your hosted code (app server) to re-use the utxo of the user, into the way the application can understand it and it gets spent.
the user can see the spend and verify it.

similar outcome. different trust model.
but ultimately can be turned into trustless, verifiable, L1 consensus.


[14-Feb-22 09:02 PM] Mylo#8306
the utxo model is awesome for this.


[14-Feb-22 09:05 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yes there are multiple ways of doing it with a level of centralization like that, but I don't know how you would do it without adding that. I mean you can change the L1 consensus code, I know that. But not sure how else you would do it.


[14-Feb-22 09:09 PM] Mylo#8306
that's right. accept there is centralization in the product dev process.
it will either be with the L1 consensus coder(s), or the infrastructure providers (explorers, infura, moralis), or the dapp provider.
until there are users using it, imo it doesn't matter - as long as it is communicated that this is the roadmap towards decentralization. i think that's what cardano did too (or some other DAG).


[14-Feb-22 09:14 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I don't accept it is the only way. I think there are ways to avoid this without centralization or adding trusted gateways.

Problems & Decentralized/trustless solutions:
Code is centralized because 1 dev created it == Open source the code and allow peer review/audit & forking 

Infrastructure providers are centralized because they run servers to allow blockchain access == Use nSPV instead of SPV

dapp developers need to trust a user won't alter the code and generate a favourable, out of original code, outcome for themselves == Use a smart contract so the user can't.


[14-Feb-22 09:16 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Simple solutions are favourable, but changing consensus code isn't particularly simple, just to update a dapp.


[15-Feb-22 06:28 AM] daemonfox#6136
The ideas here combined would work well... the way you describe the UTXO amounts triggering specific special things is how low voltage electronics are programmed. A certain voltage means different things and causes other things to do work as needed depending on the various signals.


[15-Feb-22 06:29 AM] daemonfox#6136
One could contrive an entire set of instructions to perform based on a UTXO amount, and design an L2 app to prove it all out, then update that code into the L1 chain to make it decentralized and trustless.


[15-Feb-22 07:12 PM] Mylo#8306
Thanks for the analogue. Yes - it's low level terseness; wire protocols too.

Is there a way to pay someone a portion of mining rewards for running a full node? As in, the total amount of nodes online during each block receives their proportion of the mining rewards. ```https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-setup/antara-customizations.html#ac-script

ac_script
The ac_script parameter enables the ac_founders reward to be sent to a multi-signature address or any p2sh address. If this parameter is used, block 1 (the "premine") will be mined to the ac_script address.

ac_script should be set to the "hex" value of "scriptPubKey".

#Finding the scriptPubKey
To find the "scriptPubKey" value, first create a multi-signature address with the createmultisig command.
 ```
Maybe a new multisig is generated every x blocks made-up of full nodes addresses? But incentivizing full nodes by paying from founders reward is what I'm asking for? Is this possible? Can it be done?


[20-Feb-22 02:29 PM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
How to list what full nodes are online ? Ie: is there a way to determine what nodes are online for each new block?


[20-Feb-22 04:09 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think you could enforce it, but each miner could check for nodes being online and properly functioning and then make a coinbase that pays out to a list of such registered nodes. ipaddr <-> address needs to be known. this could be done without any consensus change, but it would be up to each miner to do this and nothing would prevent a miner from not paying out or just paying out to a list of his own addresses


[20-Feb-22 04:10 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe a way to enforce it is to reward nodes that do transactions. that could be enforced and would require a consensus change, and it would be possible. not sure it would be worth the effort though as it would incentivize spam transactions


[20-Feb-22 09:45 PM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Has it actually never occurred to anyone to pay full node operators? If there's a founders reward for dev purposes, surely there should be full node rewards.


[21-Feb-22 12:18 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
I recognize your motivation, however I have a few concerns:
- differentiation between publicly available (accepting inbound connections) nodes versus nodes that do not accept inbound connections (`-listen=0`, firewalled, nodes behind a NAT). Both categories have a different value to the network, but all help in the consensus.
- Privacy: connecting wallet addresses to IP addresses reveals more info about my location than I desire. The address balance and money flow is visible on the chain, also for parties that I do not want to reveal it to.
- equality: there's no consensus mechanism to reject blocks that do not distribute coinbase rewards.
- transaction size: putting in that many outputs in a single transaction will result in the transaction to exceed the maximum transaction size. For the recipient this many smal inputs will cause the same issues when transferring the amount out. Likely the transaction fees will eat up most of the reward value.
- output size: distributing a small percentage of the block reward to 4 figure number addresses, will effectively be a built-in dust attack.


[21-Feb-22 12:35 AM] jl777c#5810
you can reduce the size of coinbase by randomly selecting 16 outputs. each additional output would be relatively small. the probabilities of being selected could be weighted by what type of node it is. of course, the privacy issue seems unsolvable. another key point is that there does not seem to be much that is gained from all this complexity.  if the payout is too high, it will be attacked. if it is too low, then it wont provide much incentive.


[21-Feb-22 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
of course many chains have incentivized running nodes and they get a lot of nodes, until the incentives run out. so, yes, you can buy more fullnodes by diluting the coinbase. but what is actually gained from all this?

https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-setup/antara-customizations.html#ac-notarypay could be a ready option, though would only reward registered fullnodes when they participate in a notarisation.


[21-Feb-22 01:44 AM] Mylo#8306
better to build a project with DTOs that incentivize the miner of the price that is submitted into a block. doesn't exactly solve the "make kmd valuable again" directly or in the short term, but grows the network in potential/marketability etc. imo


[21-Feb-22 06:13 AM] Mylo#8306
The way dexp2p works, maybe holding kmd on a full node unlocks a new application sets for smartchains, $kmd as a router via notarization lookups across chain.

That may have been possible. But also in the update from 2.1 to 2.2 Mike patched some vulnerabilities That Monkins discovered, that would allow to share work between CPU and GPU, getting over 10x hashrate.
