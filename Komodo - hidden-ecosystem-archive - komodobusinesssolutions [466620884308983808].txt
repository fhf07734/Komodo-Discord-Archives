Making some moves, requested prepaid access clarification,  ( is a members credit which is put on a voucher, as found in existing barter networks, considered prepaid access)  Lazy FinCEN, responded to my clarification request with submit your question in writing and mail it to us for an administrative ruling.  I would like to get their confirmation in writing.  Conceivably a possible scenario exists.  If a member requests a barter exchange to issue his credit in the form of a voucher, and that member sells that credit.  Is the merchant a seller of prepaid access,  is the exchange a provider of prepaid access.  Credit by definition is not prepaid  .  However the merchant is  selling that credit.  Is the merchant independently liable for sales of gift vouchers or does the exchange ,  which serves as a third party record keeper only, and issues said vouchers to the merchants at the merchants request,  held liable as well.  Existing barter networks use this mechanism to deal with non businesses , so I think it's ok but then again from what I've seen of their operations,  they may not be up to date on rules that have changed in the past couple years or so.

In other news ,   Warehouse deal got sweeter.  2 other Komodo supporters, the warehouse owner and an anonymous whale are combining forces.  Rent to be based off percentage of miners occupying the site .  So if I have 50% of the miners I pay 1500 a month for rent.   Currently warehouse is being fixed up and we are starting to get the two main components ready,  electrical and airflow/ventilation.   In a couple weeks exterior repairs will be done then we will bust out the the fans and electrical.  Move in date set for September 1st.  Maybe in a little bit before hand .  Also have deal worked out so that from my estimated electric consumption and rent will be paid for some months in advance.    Going to announce collateralized  private loan request to team soon.  Have over 1MH already however would like to fill the space up more ,   Not to mention I think I can return their investment quickly with funds being spent all on miners and accessories and my other miners contributing to the payback.

Update: Work is continuing along at the warehouse,  moving closer to electrical and fan install .  The owner is going all out on the roof and has bought a heat reflecting sealant for the roof which should help keep costs done.Good news is that we have managed to squeeze out a quote for kWh from a broker at 5 cents for guaranteed 1 million kWh / year consumption.   As the site gets bigger we can get that number lower.    Here are some pics of the progress.

@sergipcm  Mainly Equihash algo coins  to begin with ,   Additionally have some Cryptonight and Bytom miners.   In the next few months looking at other miners as well mainly BTC/LTC  but also a couple of the smaller algorithms, decred/sia/X11 and variants  maybe even a gpu rig or two budget depending

Between the three of us at the warehouse we are just a bit under 5 MSol .   After ROI and filling bags a bit,  the miners will form the starting businesses of the barter network.  I am still trying to figure out what is the best way to go about it legally however


[16-Sep-18 04:45 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Everytime I think I got it I find some obscure law that nulls it .  There is the failsafe way of doing it, and that is essentially using it as a true ledger ( meaning users have to relay their transactions to the exchange rather than have the autonomy of sending it themselves ).   The issue becomes scaling the operation at that point,  cryptoconditions could help greatly with this.  Realistically though until our tech matures a bit on all fronts ,  will have to work it manually.


[16-Sep-18 09:55 PM] BlackJesus#6161
So you're going to mine to provide liquidity

[16-Sep-18 11:24 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
In short yes.  In a barter exchange goods and services are liquidity,  cryptocoins are just another good,  and it acts as like a tether without being a coin. The main value proposition of a barter exchange is as a credit network,  allowing small/new businesses and consumers to obtain a line of credit proportional to the demand for their goods and services as well as an exclusive channel for new customers.  For large companies and established businesses it provides a way of taking advantage of excess inventory and lulls in the workflow to pay for outofband essentials.  Since this is a credit network,  the creditworthiness of the participants has to be vetted or otherwise assured through collateral to provide a foundational surety of contract and minimum line of credit.  Komodo will have a preferred treatment of course as collateral,  with other self-generating coins accepted as well at a less favorable rate.  With this a feedback loop occurs:   Collateral generates coins which covers costs and provides goods to barter with.  Coins get exchanged for trade credit which then is used to get more self-generating coins (Komodo).     Regarding the credit generating process it is important to note that it is the participants of the network that generate the credit not the barter exchange itself,  the barter exchange is just the record keeper.   The power of issuance of credit is in the hands of the people.

I am wondering for large mining operations if someone ever looked into the option of recovering the heat from the miners to generate electricity?


[18-Sep-18 03:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I assume now the heat is just dispersed outside and not recovered in any way?

Thanks, just lucked into an awesome property owner whose interests align regarding mining üòâ. Unfortunately things are a little bit delayed,  power company taking forever on running the lines to the building as half their crew is down south repairing hurricane damage and miners being held up in china because of some mechanical issue  with ups.   But it's only a matter of time now. After the machines are set up and running the real work begins,  designing and building a barter exchange.

Thats quite the undertaking. Almost seems worthy of it's own kmd asset.

I've been going through all the other ecosystems channels and you're the only one with actual hardware and a facility


[21-Sep-18 01:50 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Can't do an asset unfortunately,  at least at this stage,  the strength of the barter exchange comes at the cost of user autonomy.    To be fair a lot of the ecosystem projects can be worked from a laptop anywhere they don't need a facility,  more of a blessing for them , less overhead more agility.  That is not to downplay properties advantages however

Let's say I make widgets. I've got a surplus, you give me crypto for my extra widgets?


[21-Sep-18 01:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
No, you would receive credits( which then you could use at another merchant to purchase crypto) The business model is based on fees and subscription.  The reason for going the barter exchange route is to avoid being a MSB. It helps to clarify a term.  A barter exchange is a third party record keeper of credit and debt.


[21-Sep-18 01:58 AM] actionslacks#4072

[21-Sep-18 02:04 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
the idea of what I am trying to do is solve the "medium of exchange" problem in our ecosystem.  Komodo serves really well as a store of value and unit of account, but because of that specifically the first part,  it becomes a shit medium of exchange.   Mutual Credit is an excellent medium of exchange but whose store of value function is null. Whether through inflation as in current fiat system or through demurrage which is what I'm going to try to do.

I'm sure that it will come in handy soon enough, an economy requires all sorts of trades ,  and  once things get a bit more progressed the goal would be to funnel work to you and others and keep the cycle going,  making our own cryptoeconomy.   Yes,  shipping is viable  if we ever needed work or the barter exchange was needed as escrow or something

sure, could be a use case test as well. we could make a an actual hardware "testnet." been working on some fairly esoteric heat sink designs for class D audio amps. I'm sure they would have applicable use cases for mining chips as well.

Lol,  well some reasons for that,  depending on resale value might not be worth putting too much extra effort into them.    A silencer box would be good thing to make I think for the at home miner , might be a cash cow there if you can figure how to do it well and cost effectively


[21-Sep-18 03:06 AM] actionslacks#4072
well I could go all the way down the rabbit hole of transistor efficiency related to heat dissipation in audio circuits but I'm not sure if the same applies to digital processing. we will just have to see how soon Moore's law creates a ceiling for us.

Basically to crack keys efficiently,  or try to at least.  At some point it will be more profitable or at least more attractive to crack a high coin amount wallet than to mine coin.   Now I know combinatorially it should be near impossible but with advances in computing and theory it might reach a day it would be worth a go for a large entity.

Hello @Fai ,You can talk to @PTYX  @siu @jorian  channels #chainmakers  #chainzilla  these people have already conducted dICO  or  are in process of and can advice you.


[24-Sep-18 01:04 AM] Fai#0350
Thanks @CHMEX. Hi @PTYX  @siu @jorian  

The problem is we see many blockchain smart contracts donate (or claim to) to charities with smart contract. But the downstream flow of the tokens is quite opaque and not as traceable.

I'm working on TreeLand. A Blockchain foundation which helps donors trace their donation to a specific tree using drones (proof of plant) powered by the blockchain. We want to introduce trust and transparency never seen before to the space. A world where honest tree planters get rewarded manifold to be able to multiply their good work.‚Ä®

The first eco-friendly crypto currency that supports cross-chain carbon offset. We want to connect with as many crypto currencies in current and other chains as possible so they too can become a green crypto-currency. And we can proof that with how many trees they planted and carbon offset

[24-Sep-18 06:57 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@Fai  yes @siu  or @PTYX  are the guys you need to talk to.   KBS is for a different aspect of business üëç

That sounds exactly like what Bosque Guardian is doing

Even the part about drone footage. @Fai how about instead working with Bosque Guardian to use the same Guardian Coin?


[24-Sep-18 07:06 AM] PTYX#6840
Is that something you are open to discuss?


[24-Sep-18 07:52 AM] Fai#0350
@PTYX Always open to a discussion. üòÉ I think from a vision and scope point of view we differ so TreeLand need to build our own network. Does Bosque Guardian have any ideas on collaboration?


[24-Sep-18 07:58 AM] PTYX#6840
As far as I know Bosque is just the first project of Guardian Coin. They want to apply the same model in other places. Currently they have acquired nearly 100 hectares of land. They are slowly acquiring all of the surrounding land that sits in the buffer zone. I think there are areas that can overlap and there could be some collaboration by both projects.


[24-Sep-18 07:59 AM] PTYX#6840
can you send us more information to hello@chainzilla.io and I we can schedule a meeting to talk about tokenization and the options Komodo offers


[24-Sep-18 08:28 AM] Fai#0350
Sounds good @PTYX. Will speak with my partners first tomorrow

lol I had to carry them ,  guy tried knocking real quick and running away but I was in ambush üôÇ. 25 z9 full size .  This week or next depending on power company will be a bit hectic.   I'll have to hook up 260ish miners.  But once that's out of the way, it's just chiseling away at the barter exchange between doing Komodo things.

Pretty much done except some cleanup and B3s ,  just waiting on a PDU and some cables.  The next batch of miners ( baikals and other cheap used ones ) are next and will be dripping in over the next couple months.  That should fill this place out electrically.  Then we have some empty houses to fill up before deciding to expand this site or try to find older industrial buildings on the cheap to tap their electric hookups.  Since the big part of the mining operation is done  keep an eye on for posts on the barter exchange coming up soon!

This looks like a cool project. What is your planned total hash rate? Are these personal, or for business purposes?


[07-Oct-18 06:10 AM] PTYX#6840
@polycryptoblog looking good


[07-Oct-18 06:11 AM] PTYX#6840
Are you securing the area? That's alot of equipment


[07-Oct-18 01:01 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@NutellaLicka   No planned total because what gets mined and how much of it can change pretty quickly,  for now mainly just focusing on equihash and playing it by ear,  picking up cheap miners for less popular algorithms and keeping an eye out for news ones as they debut. these are for business purposes,  they will be  producing coin as goods for barter in the exchange.   Coins are pretty liquid especially compared to direct double coincidence of wants typically required of barter.


[07-Oct-18 01:03 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@PTYX  yes,  all the doors have been replaced with steel ones,  the bay doors have been replaced and we have security cameras being installed this week.  Also have a fence surrounding the property
