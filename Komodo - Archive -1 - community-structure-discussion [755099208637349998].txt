**The Proposal**
```ml
This discussion taking place will be focusing on creating a better structure within our community. We will be looking at the kind of 'roles' that we can introduce into this community, as well as themes and conventions that could be used to create titles for these roles. Ultimately, the roles would be positions that offer individuals to have their voice heard and to push the organisation of the community to achieve greater goals.that can create opportunities for extra responsibilities, participation, and a functioning community of action.

Content (naming conventions, themes) is required to be community-sourced as it will bear their name. This will benefit us, we will feel a deeper connection to the community; 'homely'. For this, I am also looking for your thoughts and what you can share, Survey 2 will be accustomed to this and will be shared after this discussion upon the community structure (Survey 1) becomes 'exhausted'.
```
**What I'd like you to do**
```diff
+ Fill out this survey sometime during our discussion sprint over the next (X) days.
+ Bring ideas for 'naming' conventions for categories, channels, roles, and events that we all participate in as a community.
+ Join in the discussion with others and see what kinds of different themes we can come up with for the Komodo Community as a whole.
```
***With all of this in mind, let the discussion commence!***
Survey 1: <https://komodograndscheme.paperform.co/>

@here To kick things off, I think it would be a good idea to actually think about the possibility of a structure itself. I wonder if it is possible, and lucrative, to introduce a hierarchy into such a matured community as in Komodo‚Äôs - could there be something that can let us better ‚Äòsync‚Äô together? I'll leave this thought around for a while. Give the survey ago, sit around & lets have a chat!

> This discussion taking place will be focusing on creating a better structure within our community.

I want to expand on this a bit by explaining what our current structure looks like.

-> member (level 1)
-> community contributor (level 2)

How does one become a community contributor? There are no instructions, information, or pathway to get involved.
Who decides if someone becomes a community contributor? Me (pretty much)

I want to remove myself from this role as I see I am a bottleneck. We need a structure where the community can self-organize itself. We are here to support that.

The internal community doesn't have to be large. It can be a small group of people who want to contribute, get organized, and start community initiatives. 

@here Anyone interested should join this discussion and sign-up to become a contributor. Here's your chance to be a **founding member** of our new community structure.

depends what type of community is the goal.  i think on page 4 of that prezo, "communitiy of traders"  & "community of devs" etc.

atomic dex is v.cool.  but traders as a community, i don't think is a good target from experience of what traders are like.   community of swappers, sure.  but what do the swappers swap?

community of devs, devs are a hard community to sell to.


[25-Sep-20 08:09 AM] sakata#4279
Hey @Mylo thank you for your input! :)

So one thing to clarify with that is those topics serve merely as a theme. So this wouldn't be a separate community as such, but a subunit.

We aren't planning on 'segregating' but are trying to introduce some form of grouping.

In regard to the themes, these will be used as some form of common-ground between each subunit/group of our community.

Higher ranks & roles within the 'trading' subunit will bare titles relating to topics within finance.

The same goes for personal descriptors, accolades & potential terminology. Someone with serious traits might be tagged as a "Soros" - and the polar being tagged as a "printer".

On that point, we could have a film-based theme for a subunit. One could take the descriptor *Eddie* or *Dicaprio*, as well as *Scorsese* or *Tarantino*.

**The community's voice must be heard!**


[25-Sep-20 08:38 AM] sakata#4279
So, @Mylo would you be for or against the idea of creating subunits *based upon a theme*?

One idea is to introduce a "House" system as a naming/representation of a subunit (this is shown on slide 5). Some suggest its nice as it abstracts away any real characterisation and provides a single theme across all 'Houses' (environment is a good example). The different themes could then be introduced to each house, or across the community as a whole.

I can agree that a single community incorporating a "traders" theme could be detrimental.


[25-Sep-20 08:49 AM] Mylo#8306
neither.  abstain.
whatever structure is used, is moot if the kmd team is  passively supporting imo.  whatever the community goal is has to come from kmd team, and it needs to be championed by the team in unity.

if it's this swapping competition mentioned in another channel, then what is the goal?  100k swaps in a week?  1,000,000 swaps in 10 weeks?  Then that needs to be championed by the team so the community can achieve the goal, to help the marketing team put out +ve experiences from atomic swaps.

If that is the goal, then work out the structure.  but i would work on the structure in incremental steps.  there are 100 ppl here.  with a competition, maybe that number boosts to 3000.  and 50% will not come back after the first competition.  say 1x 100k swaps in a week, once per month.

for 100 regulars, 3k tourists, and then 1000 loitering ppl.  with a monthly comp, see how it goes.

as for community structure, i still  abstain üòÑ


[25-Sep-20 09:04 AM] sakata#4279
@Mylo thank you once again üòÑ 

From this I am deriving that it could be a bad idea to implement some form of subunits/grouping, so you are against any form of structure or *hierarchy*? If this is the case, how would you feel about titles/roles, accolades & personal descriptors? 

Hope I'm on the right track!


[25-Sep-20 10:20 AM] Jcharming#2693
I think it would be interesting to see different houses with channel structures beneath them.  
So like a 'developer' set of channels 
'commnuity'
'enterprise/business/enterpeneur'

The last one being for those that have ideas about projects they'd like to start

[25-Sep-20 12:12 PM] Jcharming#2693
I'm not entirely sure, off the cuff though I'd probably have them oragnized by language they are working in, or project style they are developing (modules, games, dex, proof of concept) and have a bounty board attached to them so junior devs can come in find projects they want to support and maybe get bounties on.  Or those that are just surfing them can look at projects based on languages they can already code in, or areas of interest like proof of concept or atomic swaps.

By project they are working on (experience & expertise), or ideas ppl belong to for open source community implementation (eg forum post with 20 comments, these ppl are making conversation), or by amount of sentiment ppl bring to discord with emoji reactions.

These can be represented by badges, and are easy to recognise.


[26-Sep-20 04:18 AM] sakata#4279
@Jcharming Those are some strong ideas. Do you think that accolades, or special titles, would benefit those who have claimed or contributed the bounties? 

Maybe we could have a bounty board added to one of the Komodo sites online.

@Mylo Precisely. How do you think we could implement some form of a system for the badges?

Would a discord bot cut it, or by using tags/roles within discord? I feel like using the discord role system could create a messy layout, and that a discord bot would only show what people have earned when called upon.


[26-Sep-20 06:45 AM] Mylo#8306
add a discord role for those that want to be part of this system. e.g. "Komodo Community".  Easily recognizable.

a bot, can then manage the titles & all other stuff you want.

the bot can report dailly to a community ANN channel or something, with the activity of that day/week/etc.  e.g.  @user#1234 earned "badge1"


[26-Sep-20 06:47 AM] Mylo#8306
anyone that wants to find out who community content creators are can ping the bot !communitycontent, and the bot can respond to this query in dm, the ppl with this badge.

Definitely need a badge for those that daily complain. Maybe call it the morale destroyer badge. And or a backseat driver badge. If any of these folks talked to their significant others like this, they'd be tossed out on their ass, but somehow it is acceptable to daily come to discord and use this community like a punching bag.

Getting an understanding about the underlying structure will help us to think of the other topics.

Background info: during the internship program we brainstormed a solution where we use a bot to structure our discord channels. It would work just like the language channels work at the moment.

-> newcomers see only few relevant channels
-> they can join new channels (in groups) based on their interest

With that in mind I would recommend we go with two level or three level structure. The key question(s) are how someone joins the next level. Overall, it would look something like this:

[28-Sep-20 03:26 AM] Audo#5667
At the moment I am leading towards the three level approach. Basically we would create a gated community.

I would work just like a gated/wallet neighborhood: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gated_community

Anyone can join, but they have to apply. If the resident causes trouble and doesn't respect the values of the gated community they will be kicked out. Outsiders can't see what's going on in the gated community, there's more privacy and security.

To manage this gated community we setup a team of community elders ‚Äì who have to 
 a) enjoy the trust and respoect of the "residents"
 b) maintain active status within our community
 c) accept the responsibilities that come with the position

Depends how much you are planning to "gatekeep" the community


[28-Sep-20 04:36 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Will newcomers see dev-oracles dev-marketmaker etc? will they see cc-channels?


[28-Sep-20 04:36 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Or are they limited to general and trading only?


[28-Sep-20 04:36 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
If limited, it may stop a lot of newcomers fully exploring what komodo has to offer


[28-Sep-20 04:36 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
and also may be only let into channels where theres constant fud or arguments and not where it matters (tech and development)


[28-Sep-20 04:38 AM] Crabby Paddy#6239
I understand the reasoning behind it, but personally cant see too much of a benefit from not keeping the discord open. If anything, have most channels open, but on the welcome page they can select their own roles
ie "Click Tick to view Development channels" "Click Tick to view CC channels" to reduce clutter slightly while still being accessible

@Audo Thank you for the submission! I really like the approach in terms of gatekeeping, it makes me visualise the Komodo community as a private estate; everyone who is part of the community is of value and should be protected from intruders.

I think that 3 levels of hierarchy for contribution and other factors seems like the way to go; 2 seems too little and 5 now seems too much.

Moving on from that, what does @everyone think of community roles - specific responsibilities being handed out on a permanent, or fixed term basis?

Has anyone got some ideas that we can introduce, some areas that could be in need for specific tasks? üçø

*Komodo community as a private estate*

this sounds like a terrible idea. just the opposite of open and decentralized as true open source movement. why the urge to build the walls? trolls?

there are always people who do nothing else, but complain. that is no reason to keep people out of the loop of what is going on in Komodo development.

one of the reasons i joined Komodo community way back, when BTCD was still a thing, was open discussions and the development openly as everyone could see what was going on.

seeing the magic of tech being developed is one strong point that Komodo has. i truly doubt that focusing on marketing fluff is going to work, when the target audience for Komod tech is (and probably for a long time will be) developers.

ok, the DEX is an exception, but that is just a small albeit important part.

If there is no incentive, no reason to take part in something bigger, then there is no reason to stop being a 'lurker' - forcing the community to have discussions that benefit everyone where people wish to sit on the sidelines instead of actively taking part.

"Proof of stake is decentralized" yet there is still an inner ring of staking pools and delegators, the only difference within a community is the will of good nature and the care for their peers IMO

I don't like 2 or 3 layer gate keeping community, as I quickly gone through it now, unless I missed something in my understanding. If channels are available like subscription to view update in that channels, it should be fine. If the channels are available only after some climbing to levels and only after that those channels are visible or invite only, I oppose this idea.
So mostly I agree with @crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy

there is already a lot of structure:

1. kmd senior team
2. kmd team
3. community

the active community is 30-100 people at the moment, 100+ if including ARRR, VRSC.

what is the plan when there are 1000 temporary users during an atomic dex marketing campaign (e.g. stress test).  they are going to be tempory, and maybe at best 5% stay (additional 50 ppl to community)

too much over thinking.
tip bot NFT is a good idea.  community atomic swap competition is a good idea.

Discussions can and would remain open even if we had a "private community".

> Please leave the channels open to all who joins.

All existing channels would remain accessible.


 I see many benefits for having a more private spaces that's behind a "registration":
 - we are able to create an initiation to welcome new members to our community
 - we will know each other better because everyone will get introduced
 - promotes a safe & productive environment for deeper discussions
 - to build a strong community we have to build personal relationships

How can we encourage persona relationship building on huge public channels? We need smaller groups where people can talk. We need focused discussions around initiatives.

I am sceptical that we can effectively get organized through large public channels.

I see this proposal as a way to bridge the gab between the official team and the public community.


[29-Sep-20 05:28 AM] Audo#5667
one example: Komodo internship program.

All the discussions have happened privately between our internship team. This allowed us to:

 - get to know each other and build a strong bond
 - get to the bottom of any topic and come up with solutions
 - work together towards a common goal as a team

Would this have happened if we tried to do it on a public setting? Would our interns been as willing to publicly state their opinions and thoughts if they knew _anyone_ could see them?

@og interns I am curious to hear your thoughts on this. What kind of things would you like to brainstorm publicly vs. semi-privately between known people? or does this make no difference to you? Share your personal opinion if you can, I would appreciate it üôÇ

@crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy 

i was going to say similarly, but you've said it well enough...
it's something important to understand about komodo...
please do not centralize or make things exclusive...
otherwise we will not be accessible...
people can always make their own private chatrooms if they want?
there needs to be a free flow of discussion through different channels

> 
@Audo   this internship program structuring was about getting down to business, this was a marketing team built from community resources (interns) specifically for the purpose of "business" so it makes sense that it be a closed channel...
developers probably have closed channels or meeting rooms or whatever...
that's perfectly well and good for planning & executing tasks on the business end of things...
and if community members decide to start a project together and want to create a locked channel for themselves, have at it, that's fine and good...

the concern at least from my perspective is that the general community doesn't need to be walled off, 
and, 
the general community should have access to as much information or places to ask questions and receive answers as is relevant to the nature and offerings of komodo platform and its ecosystem asset chains

@ejuliano 
I'm getting the impression this is kind of an open conversation about all aspects without necessarily any specific conclusions.


[29-Sep-20 09:43 AM] ejuliano#8606
oh...i thought the conclusion is to develop a hierarchy structure for the community (apart from the developers and other business team aspects)

> we are looking to install hierarchies within the community?
@ejuliano Despite everyone's disfavour of the *exclusive* (or *private* as a synonym) structure there is **already** a massive wall between the public community and community contributors - the bad factor that everyone is arguing against is already in place.


[29-Sep-20 09:44 AM] Jcharming#2693
I'm sure @sakata  can clarify, however as I understand it's more of an 'exploration' of this idea and others.  Maybe that looks like 'what do we think about heirachies?' maybe that means 'what do we think about roles'  maybe that means 'what do we think about onboadring new members and the channel structure here in the discord'?


[29-Sep-20 09:44 AM] Audo#5667
it's not as much about hierarchy but about aknowledgement that someone has made a contribution and spend time for the benefit of Komodo. It's basically how we use the "community contributor" tag right now. We would just make the structure more official and remove the bottleneck (me).


[29-Sep-20 09:45 AM] Audo#5667
but I appreciate all the feedback! It's good to understand the concerns so we can address those and also ensure that whatever the end proposal is will address those issues.

@sakata 
- what is the wall... a locked channel for community contributors?
or is there a different wall?
- seems reasonable, as long as anybody who wants to contribute to the community can do so, in which case they can be added to the contributors channel

@ejuliano Precisely, this proposal is no different, in terms of *privatisation*, than what we already have now. It is just adding some structure along with the implementation.

This is a great question and some great list items.  
Are those items what you do when you're here, or are they the list of items you think other people come here for? OR both?

@sakata that's all fine and good ... can you help me understand what you mean?  adding what sort of structure in addition to the structure that already is in place now?


[29-Sep-20 10:01 AM] Audo#5667
> @Audo  so along the lines of badges or colours for names or other recognitions?

Yeah, and those could share a private channel just like now.

The main quesiton I have posed many times (including for the interns) is: "Who decideds who gets a badge?" 

Solution today: centralized, chief community dictator Audo hands off badges and often doesn't notice many contributions

Proposd solution: decentralized way where trusted community memembers (elders) hand off badges in agreement.

So, I guess we could say I am proposing more structure to create more decentralization. I guess it's a bit counteintuitive, but to scale things up there has to be some structure. I don't see structure as a bad thing or as centralization necessarily.

It's very fashinating topic


[29-Sep-20 10:02 AM] ejuliano#8606
@Audo  i understand better now... adding extra private channels for people is fine, as long as what people have access to now doesn't change by getting restricted

@ejuliano  I agree but coming from being an outsider perspective a few months ago, I saw that there is a heavy amount of disorganization within the discord community. These issues are focused on engagement and communication. (Too many channels, no clear on boarding path to get more evolved and earn badges for contribution, lack of incentives for community members to stay and contribute).

On slide number 2 of https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1q-oN03xoZemQqHyXbpUxt5YbSaIP9wnBG3i26HmuU_8/edit?usp=sharing, there is an (overcomplicated) example of some tiers. *Each tier is just a reference to a higher form of responsibility, decided upon time committed to Komodo and accomplishments within the community.* No one calls the shots or has any real authority. 

We need this structure so we can be a community, not just 'do' community

I feel that though, before we release the forum, we need to enhance our KMD community structure. I think @sakata idea will really help structure our community that is efficient, organized and well, exciting!

A simple way to enhancing the community structure may be more interaction with developers and getting people to know who are the guys?most people to be honest dont even take a look at the mentions and tags including me,  those who look at them are mainly node operators or people who are associated with the ecosystem limited. as a user and an ex content writer I think interactions for the community to the ecosystem should be smart not hard , this goes for descriptions articles etc as well about the komodo ecosystem

Ok so if a developer creates something associated with the komodo ecosystem a subdomain or something like prpduct.kmdcommunity.com should be automatically developed for it what it does? Customize and highlight small and big projects making sure nothing is unseen or overseen how will people interact is via faq articles and on the home of the portal there can be sublink in a customized manner to much channels in discord often go unseen by most of the community a video maker can be hired specifically for making videos info about anything or innovation going inside the kmd ecosystem and can be paid through node operators contribution or however he/she can be incentivised, how it will impact the community is that people wont have to go on different channels or search everything can be categorized and weekly updates can be made on youtube and newspaper type blog the portal should be of a tumblr or reddit architecture and if possible users can signup throug discord dev id or anything easy for them. Rewards should be regular for people who get roles or anything of that order, trading and economic side of the komodo ecosystem should also be focussed as it brings a large number of members/users

Maybe a decentralized Jedi approach. Each master has a padawan, (maybe temporary) type of thing. A padawan newbie is looked after and helped by a Jedi. Jedi are overseen by the council. A padawan has to complete training (komodo learning path) before taking the Jedi test to advance.

I actually was thinking about something similar to what @‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª. Komodo core community team members (jr ambassadors) ? People who are excited about the Komodo project. 

Create an on-ramp for community members 

Develop a program / meeting / learn Komodo jr ambassador program. Core member/s of the Komodo team create a learn Komodo crash course which includes/ history / tech / development / governance/ this could act as the bridge to community members that want to be more involved. 

With the plan being that these jr ambassadors will be knowledgeable enough to represent the Komodo community and engage heavily on social media, crypto based podcast, and local crypto/blockchain meetups. 
The vast number of crypto based podcasts are smaller in nature and if we had a team of knowledge community members / jr ambassadors that could create engagement on a mass scale for the smaller market pods. These podcasters love it when community members reach out to them. It shows Initiative. I believe a big crossover exists in other topics for pods that are indirectly related to crypto that can be taken advantage of , gaming, finance, freedom and privacy, anarchist/libertarian, just to name a few genres. A successful jr ambassador program could create an environment where somewhere everyday is doing a pod promoting Komodo. Regardless if it gets 10, 100, or a 1000 views. We could create an environment where we are not only promoting but also networking and building future relationships. 

An ‚Äúofficially unofficial Komodo community‚Äù twitter handle could act as medium for community announcements and activities; with rewards in decimals of 333 and 777 (example winner 7.77, 77.7 .777)
Meme competition 
Bounty competition 
community spotlights on members in the community/ devs / admins

Monthly dev/team public zoom meetings to keep the core community updated.

Like right now in another thread we are discussing the use of a mascot. Which would be an amazing opportunity for people to have a Komodo mascot competition. Could easily have something like selecting the top 5, have the community vote for winner. With a bounty/reward going to the winner. It would help drive engagement within the community.

When working with uniswap and Augur.net it seems so simple yet it‚Äôs still so clunky and loaded with fees. If KMD team can release a similar online portal that functions like atomic DEX pro without the clunk and fees of these other decentralized atomic trading contracts every KMD HODLers investment thesis will pay off. What do we need to do to push these things into alpha and have them stress tested before volume starts to pick up across the board for crypto in 2021?

@Artist your main bounty is the writing about success bounty, exclusive to you.  find other people to make (1) & (2) happen, so you can write about it, so others can then know how to do it.   when others know how to do it, you will be busy with making graphics for NFTs.


[30-Sep-20 08:36 PM] Mylo#8306
that is the objective of my bounties.
for people to make NFT is v.easy.  50+ people in this discord can do it.
linking image to ipfs, requires a bit of extra work, but still 50+ people can do it
making a script in python (but i'll accept any language tbh), maybe 10 ppl in discord can do.  but the 500kmd writing about success of (1) & (2) has nothing to do with script bounty.

That is the goal.
This is also why there is _community organization push_ started imo.

The next stress test is sometime in the next 90 days.  And there needs to be some way to keep these stress-test users within kmd ecosystem.

[30-Sep-20 09:00 PM] Mylo#8306
@MorganJekyll @Artist , this man @grewalsatinder is building shurli app.  in #meshbits channel - that is a v.sweet gui to subatomic swaps (over the counter small increment/stream of swaps).  it requires a full node to run because it deals with private crypto as well.  adding NFT to this app is also possible, but not the current goal of the developer (satinder).

same with orderbook, https://orderbook.live - which is in a stalled beta phase (no dev because too busy & waiting for ADEX to be released) - to add NFT to it is not a hard thing to do.  i wrote about how to do it back in 2019 https://komodoplatform.com/tt2019-20-build-asset-exchange-token-dex-example/

on that blog post, it links to these other types of applications you mention @MorganJekyll  that were developed as proof of concept in synthetics & derivatives etc.

Okay sir

i co-wrote it with someone else.  the docker image to use now is better used from https://ikomodo.com/blockchain-dev-kit-electrum-dex-trading/  `docker run -i -t -v /home/${USER}/.zcash-params:/root/.zcash-params:ro --name bdk -p 127.0.0.1:8096:8096 coingateways/blockchain-starter-kit:5000f2a.3`  e.g. `coingateways/blockchain-starter-kit:5000f2a.3` which is at https://hub.docker.com/r/coingateways/blockchain-starter-kit/tags

Well cool can be done

[03-Oct-20 01:31 AM] Artist#0765
Can I develop the nft? @Mylo what do you think about it? Any guidance


[04-Oct-20 09:57 AM] Audo#5667
would be good to first confirm the test chains support NFT tech (if that's a CC)


[04-Oct-20 10:48 AM] Artist#0765
Right


[04-Oct-20 07:20 PM] Mylo#8306

@Artist i don't have time sorry.  ask others in the community to help if you need help.  i will re-check after lunch.

@Mylo there mate


[07-Oct-20 02:12 AM] Mylo#8306
@Artist got your latest email but have not read it.
the bounties are for community involvement. if you can make the tokens and/or find others to do so, and get ipfs linked for some data or image, then there _might_ be a little bit of bounty. 

but for ongoing community wanting designs of nft graphics, it needs people creating tokens.  currently, it does not look like that will happen.

i might make nft generator service, but this is not for another 2 months.

I tried to start the process by digging out of storage 2 old but I assumed working desktops. Both are experiencing video card issues. I ordered new cords and those didn't work. I tried to sync rick on my live linux Ubuntu laptop, but no luck it crashes. I've got instructions for getting rick synced, just haven't gotten working hardware yet. Not giving up yet but I'll admit, the whole ip ban in adex is demoralizing as hell


[07-Oct-20 08:17 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Another method is to setup an amazon vps, however I am still reading up on the process. Since I've never done it or set up a ssh key it is more complicated than just using a desktop cpu


[07-Oct-20 08:18 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Lol all this just to get access to rick cli.


[07-Oct-20 08:19 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Is there a method to access rick cli via AtomicDex or verus wallet?


[07-Oct-20 09:43 AM] gcharang#6833
> on my live linux Ubuntu laptop, but no luck it crashes
these are the system requirements:
```
64-bit Processor
Minimum 32GB HDD or SDD storage space
Minimum 4GB of free RAM (8GB+ recommended)
```
do your systems meet them?

digital ocean has excellent guides on setting up a new vps and ssh, ufw etc

[07-Oct-20 10:00 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Laptop is 3.8gb ram, however live linux loads everything into ram. And of course the software wasn't designed to be run this way. Verus wallet, and AtomicDex work great however as they use litemode.


[07-Oct-20 10:01 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
I was also unable to be successful changing the datadirectory for rick as I was hoping that would help install in live linux.


[07-Oct-20 10:02 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Yes, I have read through the digital ocean guides.


[07-Oct-20 10:04 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
I am planning on trying to setup a vps. It's just am unfamiliar with the process so things that are easy for regular users is new to me and I want to know I am doing all the steps correctly.


[07-Oct-20 10:06 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
The Komodo docs are excellent in regards to setting up komodo things however.


[07-Oct-20 10:12 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Downloading the zcash params works, but it really taxes the ram on livelinux. So I was just backing up the params from the hidden folder and then copy paste it back in on a reboot so as to have the ram fresh again. Basically absolutely the wrong way to run this software. It seemed to want to work though as when I go to sync rick I didn't immediately get an error, but it just freezes. Lol, I break stuff


[07-Oct-20 10:18 AM] gcharang#6833
> Komodo docs are excellent 
thanks that was a lot of work with contributions from many people

> I was also unable to be successful changing the datadirectory for rick
were you trying to point the data directory to some exotic location, like a network device

>  It's just am unfamiliar with the process so things that are easy for regular users is new to me and I want to know I am doing all the steps correctly
my advice is to just go for it. a VPS isn't fragile. you bork it, just click a button to get fresh install. you could even use bash scripts to speed up the process if you are feeling adventurous üòÑ

Let.me k.now @Mylo I hope we get rid of the differences conditions are peculiar now


[09-Oct-20 03:02 PM] sakata#4279
Thank you @everyone!

It came to a point during the discussion that the flow seemed to be better without my presence, and that all of your ideas were pouring out naturally

Now that the conversation has become tired, I will wrap up upon a majority of what I can deduce from your thoughts & opinions!

The proposal has some validity if it is implemented slowly, iteratively, with a strong focus on making sure that there is no real modification to the core of Komodo's community; the structure would not hold if there isn't any reason to do so - incentives are key. The aim is to avoid the blocking-off of newcomers from seeing content/ideas which could potentially bring them in as a dedicated member - while at the same time also providing private space for people to speak within the community but behind closed doors

It was mentioned about grouping of people based upon certain characteristics (such as 'traders') and how that can introduce a toxic theme, while at the same time it would also be benficial to have a good definition of groups. This should be achievable, given that we can ascertain the right content to derive themes from; good language choice could also avoid certain issues (instead of traders: swappers)

Communities that are objective, such as devs, may not benefit so much - this proposal might benefit general Komodo followers more; but devs themselves should be involved to some extent. Whichever route is chosen, the structure should be flexible & not defining

There was concern about the amount of members we will retain following the Dex release after the influx of newcomers, having a structure in place would assist the newcomers staying due to the fact that they won't feel lost; having some organisation in place will make them feel more at home instead of being part of a 'space'


[09-Oct-20 03:03 PM] sakata#4279
Expression was evident for the favour of a house system. This is an easily implementable format which doesn't necessarily create vastly-distinguishable groups, but still implements a form of identity that would be hard to discriminate against. Ultimately, the final idea would only contain a maximum of 3 levels, and the idea of the Komodo team being another tier would be wrong - they would be among us not 'with' us

Regarding this ordeal being overthought, the implementation is complex as the wager between what is achieved as well as abandoned is high with there being so many members that this would affect

To note some of the other things that were mentioned:
- NFTs / KMD Pok√©mon
- Workplaces (separate channels for entrepreneurs, enterprise & business)
- Community sentiment (badges & emojis)
- Roles for contribution
- Community management bot (daily reports, twitter/newsletter/forum-posts, ping for detail [knowledge & general info]
- Bounties for KMD NFT ideas (IPFS)
- Jedi structure
- 'Newspaper' themed site
- Search engine optimisation
- 'Smart' community interaction, not 'hard'
- Learning path badge
- Domains & content-resources given to new ecosystem projects
- Economic perspectives require more attention
- Game funnels (dev vs members)
- Newcomer initiation
- Current community solution is centralised

I am in talks frequently with Audo where we are discussing this proposal, and looking for the best way to kickstart all of these ideas. We are working towards getting the ball rolling by the end of Q4, lining the solutions up with releases and so forth. Just to emphasise, the movement is looking to keep the whole community included with the basis of these talks

[09-Oct-20 03:04 PM] sakata#4279
Another survey will be posted within the general chat tomorrow, this one is easy & not mind-numbing. The purpose is to collect thoughts & interests for the themes that we can utilise for titles, roles, badges & so on

Once again, thank you everyone - it has been a pleasure hearing all of your ideas!
