i did subatomic swaps back in 2015 or so using NXT, basic idea is similar to the LN submarine swaps, so it is a very good name for it as it is smaller granularity than atomic swaps and also relates to submarine swaps

the idea is you make cltv payment channels https://bitcoin.stackexchange.com/questions/48243/are-micropayment-channels-still-subject-to-malleability-after-bip65 for both sides of a trade, and then send a small fraction to the other side

Are Micropayment channels still subject to malleability after BIP65?
After BIP 65, are simple, unidirectional, MPC still subject to transaction malleability?

More specifically: 

Is the payee at risk because of malleability? If yes, how? (as far as I understood, the

[09-Feb-20 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
when the other side gets it, they send 2 small fractions (1 for what you sent and 1 more so they are now at risk 1 fraction)


[09-Feb-20 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
this is repeated until the entire amount is transferred. without a high speed reliable offchain network, this is not practical.


[09-Feb-20 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
do -dexp2p creates another usecase for a subatomic p2p network


[09-Feb-20 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
however if the user has to create a refund tx, wait for it to confirm or even be notarized for large amounts, really you are better off just doing a full atomic swap, so subatomic swaps are only for relatively small amounts

[09-Feb-20 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
also, it is more efficient to just do a full atomic swap than between 2 users


[09-Feb-20 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
so you might ask, when is a subatomic swap practical


[09-Feb-20 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it requires a hub


[09-Feb-20 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
a hub would post a message that it is a hub for a coin


[09-Feb-20 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the hub will also need to have liquid funds available for that coin and all other coins it supports, so some indication of how much it has available


[09-Feb-20 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
a user will need to be running both chains (i wont bother with lite nodes in the initial proof of concept)


[09-Feb-20 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
the usecase is a user that has X amount of coinX and wants to convert it to coinY, the hubs would specify the destination coins they support, separately from the source coins


[09-Feb-20 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
lets say the user has DOGE and wants to swap for KMD, he scans for a hub that accepts DOGE and does KMD as destination. user will then create a channel to the hub with all the DOGE he wants to swap. when the hub sees this (prompted by a message), the hub creates an approximately equivalent valued KMD channel (probably will need to err on the high side to make sure just one channel is enough). due to this capital requirement, the hubs coin availability will need to be updated as it uses it for various channels


[09-Feb-20 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
i think you can see how this will work


[09-Feb-20 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
alice and bob (both with channels to the same hub) post that they want to sell/buy DOGE for KMD and ordermatch, they can query the hub via DM if the other party has enough channel capacity, though this can be estimated from onchain activity, only the hub will know the current balance remaining. (lets ignore the privacy aspects for now)


[09-Feb-20 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
once both parties are satistifed with the price and that the other party has the funds, the subatomic swap is started:
alice pays hub some DOGE, hub pays bob some KMD
bob pays hub double the KMD, hub pays alice the KMD

now alice pays the DOGE to hub, which then pays bob the KMD
repeat until trade is done
hub collects a service fee


[09-Feb-20 11:05 AM] CHMEX#0686
That sounds very good and logical
Maybe a silly question but those channels work on all btc forks?


[09-Feb-20 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
for small value amounts, notarizations can even be skipped. for larger amounts notarizations would be needed to establish the channel. but the channel is established with the hub, say a daily time limit


[09-Feb-20 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
CLTV is needed, so any btc fork that supports atomicDEX will work

[09-Feb-20 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
once the channels are established with the hub, the time to do a submarine swap would be:
1. ordermatch time (using current orderbooks, this seems very fast)
2. due diligence phase (a few back and forth DM between alice and hub and bob and hub)
3. the subatomic swaps (resolution negotiated during due diligence phase)


[09-Feb-20 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
if the fractional amount transferred is 777, that requires 777 back and forth and that could take a minute?


[09-Feb-20 11:08 AM] jl777c#5810
but if 1% amounts can be done, then it is 102 total transfers (+/-), which should be 15 seconds range


[09-Feb-20 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i am just guessing on the elapsed time as it would depend on the ping times


[09-Feb-20 11:11 AM] CHMEX#0686
15-45 seconds would be an awesome user expierence


[09-Feb-20 11:12 AM] CHMEX#0686
And as you said only for small amounts big traders can wait for confirms on a full atomic swap


[09-Feb-20 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i think i will let the user set the acceptable risk level they want to take

{Reactions}
üëç (2) 

[09-Feb-20 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
so if they say $10 is ok to risk, then it could be all done in 3 seconds


[09-Feb-20 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
for a $10 trade


[09-Feb-20 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought you guys would like this idea. technically a hub will have custody of some funds, but the user agreement is based on the concept of donation. they start the transfer with a donation to the hub for facilitating the trade


[09-Feb-20 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
so it isnt their funds the hub is holding, its just a donation


[09-Feb-20 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
which the hub then sends onto the other node, but they also did a donation the other way. i think i can make it so that the hub is never in control of more than the donation amount at anytime. it will be hard for anybody to claim this is custodial


[09-Feb-20 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
it might have to slow down the swap by 2x to achieve this, so i guess that is another setting, if the hub is willing to be custodial for $10, but then again if it is stated that there is a $10 donation (risk level) to the hub, it would avoid this slowdown


[09-Feb-20 11:16 AM] jl777c#5810
so the size of the subatomic fractions will be based on the minimum of alice and bobs max exposure level and hubs custodial tolerance (can be zero)


[09-Feb-20 11:19 AM] SHossain#0007
very interesting idea indeed


[09-Feb-20 11:19 AM] CHMEX#0686
I really like the idea and I think users who teade those small amounts and complaain about the speed dont care that much about the possible risk


[09-Feb-20 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
to run a hub, you would need to run a set of coins, add a blocknotify, fund it with coins, configure subatomic dapp and run the DEX chain (which is what i am using for the subatomic) so the dexfee can also be paid


[09-Feb-20 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, this is designed for nearly instant trades using a hub for small amounts. not sure what the threshold should be...


[09-Feb-20 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess if you wait for a notarized channel create, then it can even be for very large amounts and the advantage is that once you open a channel with a hub, you can use part of it for one trade, the next part for another trade, ...


[09-Feb-20 11:20 AM] CHMEX#0686
I m happy to open a hub and 'risk' a few 1000kmd and other alts


[09-Feb-20 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the hub is never in a risk position


[09-Feb-20 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the hub might need to lock funds for a day and unwind it, i guess lose some txfees


[09-Feb-20 11:21 AM] CHMEX#0686
Nice


[09-Feb-20 11:22 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll open a hub too


[09-Feb-20 11:23 AM] SHossain#0007
is it better to have many small individual hubs or a big combined one?


[09-Feb-20 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
this should allow different hubs to become the goto hub for a trading pair, but rebalancing funds will be something that is needed to be done. if you achieve this with pass through orders to CEX, that would allow a lot more liquidity


[09-Feb-20 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i think having hubs that are for specific trading pairs is the way to go


[09-Feb-20 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
so it wont be anything to anything, but rather a set of hubs, one for each trading pair.

@SHossain I always think of lightning tech when I read something with "hubs" and swaps üòÑ


[09-Feb-20 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
in this mode, the hub will need to be trusted with the entire trade amount (by both sides)


[09-Feb-20 12:11 PM] SHossain#0007
@mrlynch to be honest i'd prefer to do it tomorrow. the kiddo is still not good. i had to take a nap in the afternoon. but, he is getting better.


[09-Feb-20 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess for ARRR it would be the only way it could be supported... must be within the max loss tolerance for both parties and the hubs custodial limit

i was thinking to setup ARRR and VRSC hub initially


[09-Feb-20 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
and actually, doing it based on simple payments would allow to solve most of the messaging issues first


[09-Feb-20 12:14 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, to support ARRR, i will do it that way. for most other coins, it would never use this mode, but it comes out of the iterative development, so why not


[09-Feb-20 12:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
awesome! üëç


[09-Feb-20 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
in that mode, the hub is basically the escrow for an OTC swap, just fully automated


[09-Feb-20 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is only as good as the reputation of whoever is running the node


[09-Feb-20 12:16 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so there'll be list of hubs, and with the hubs list, would it be possible to somehow show some sort of rating or their history of being good or bad etc?


[09-Feb-20 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
there will be handles, which i can enforce the pubkey in the release to prevent spoofing
but the idea is that this will be a trustless subatomic swap system, so there is no need for reputation


[09-Feb-20 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
only the OTC swap mode done for ARRR will have any need for this and that should just be based on public known people saying this is my subatomic pubkey, my handle is ...


[09-Feb-20 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
a hub will be pretty binary... it is either working or dead. we can certainly have people broadcast complaint messages about dead hubs, but someone would need to log that


[09-Feb-20 12:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay. then having a social sharing button would be cool thing if we can have üòâ


[09-Feb-20 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
you can do whatever you want as a caller of the protocol


[09-Feb-20 12:20 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
"come join my hub to make subatomic swaps of ARRR and KMD/BTC"


[09-Feb-20 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
the idea is to set a max limit you would trust a specific hub with, you can set that to a fractional amount, though that will make your trades go a lot slower


[09-Feb-20 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
probably each hub would track the total swaps they have done and prove it with a list of txids


[09-Feb-20 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
this is all outside the protocol level


[09-Feb-20 12:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree, but good to think of for later. thanks for clearing üôÇ


[09-Feb-20 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it is better to have a set of hubs that are long term community members


[09-Feb-20 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
then users can decide how much they are willing to risk based on who they are

[09-Feb-20 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
@Hollowman9000 thanks for your point about the silly ussa rules, i have a way to set it up so it is in safe harbor.
1. it is ok to trade crypto for yourself, this is not MSB
therefore it must be ok to enter into a purchase agreement for a specific crypto denominated in another crypto with another user

after alice and bob agree to swap 100 EURK for 100 KMD, they tell the hub about it (that should be ok) now the hub will do this:
a) buy from alice 1 EURK for 1 KMD
b) buy from bob 1 KMD for 1 EURK
notice both trades are for their own personal account and not taking custody of any funds
hub repeats this 100x


[09-Feb-20 12:39 PM] Hollowman9000#3344
Sounds like ‚Äúmoney transmitter‚Äù (USSA, MSB regs)


[09-Feb-20 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810

if LN are also going to use the similar LN hubs model and govt. regulations are making laws around those, and if ours is similar too, won't it apply to ours?
or this hub is totally different concept from those LN hubs. 
_I don't know about LN hubs. Just assuming stuff about those._

[09-Feb-20 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
does the hub actions in the above seem to be transmitting money or buying/selling for its own account. the actual buying price will be at a bit of a discount to make profits

[09-Feb-20 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as the hub is acting on its own behalf and trading, it is non custodial. it is basically arbitraging between alice and bob


[09-Feb-20 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
posting info about DEX trades is also allowed


[09-Feb-20 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810

[09-Feb-20 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
"Essentially, if a company does not have control of a user‚Äôs funds, and it never touches the user‚Äôs fund, then it does not fall under the ‚Äòmoney transmitter‚Äô rule and so can continue without compliance."
"Most retail crypto traders who trade virtual assets just for their own accounts and not on behalf of anyone else are investors and not money transmitters. (However, they may still fall under other guidelines such as for tracking capital gains and submitting to KYC (Know Your Customer regulations) on centralized crypto exchanges.)"


[09-Feb-20 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
but it seems ambiguous and conflicting. it will be safer if the hub nodes are always the bob nodes and they need to trade based on their own prices, so only the hubs would be making price quotes


[09-Feb-20 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
in this case, there is no third party, it is just a bunch if alice and bob swaps, where the hub is bob


[09-Feb-20 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
so all hubs need to become marketmakers


[09-Feb-20 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
i had forgotten how insane the ussa regs were


[09-Feb-20 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
so now, to do a swap you find a hub that supports the coin you want to sell as an input and the coin you want as an output. can probably even see the price before opening the channel. set the amount you trust the bob, and swap


[09-Feb-20 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
this does change the design a bit, but in a way it is better user experience as there is one less step of choosing a counterparty, the hub selection is selecting he counterparty too


[09-Feb-20 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
@cipi i assume you have the scripts to automatically post updated -dexp2p price quotes, with a specified margin? that would be an important part of running a bob node


[09-Feb-20 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
everybody that wants to run a hub, please post your handle and a dedicated pubkey you want to use for this, i will hardcode these into the subatomic file that will be loaded. this prevents spoofing of your handles


[09-Feb-20 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
also, with this model the OTC mode can become quite useful for all coins and there is no issue, its just that alice sends to bob first, so alice can do it with whatever risk level desired

oh, the bobs will be a permissioned network, so you need to register your pubkey before you can do any posting as a bob node

@grewalsatinder those 2 nodes are up. but, yes, not updated in the last few days

this isnt strictly needed due to the alice able to set risk tolerance, but i need the permissioned network for another usecase and it seems a good precaution to prevent people from connecting to unreliable bobs


[09-Feb-20 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
when there are complaints, i update the list of pubkeys, so as long as alice nodes are checking that daily and also for any messages about bad bobs, we should avoid most all the issues from having nonresponsive bob nodes

yes, this uses the -dexp2p protocol, which is only in my DEX branch for now

Application of FinCEN‚Äôs Regulations to Virtual Currency Mining Operati...


[09-Feb-20 10:02 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The guidance makes clear that an administrator or exchanger of convertible virtual currencies that (1) accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or (2) buys or sells convertible virtual currency in exchange for currency of legal tender or another convertible virtual currency for any reason (including when intermediating between a user and a seller of goods or services the user is purchasing on the user‚Äôs behalf) is a money transmitter under FinCEN's regulations, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person.7 The guidance also makes clear that ‚Äúa user who obtains convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods or services is not an MSB under FinCEN's regulations.‚Äù FinCEN understands your letter to amount to a request to elaborate on this last statement in the specific context of a user that obtains the convertible virtual currency Bitcoin by mining.

How a user obtains a virtual currency may be described using any number of other terms, such as ‚Äúearning,‚Äù ‚Äúharvesting,‚Äù ‚Äúmining,‚Äù ‚Äúcreating,‚Äù ‚Äúauto-generating,‚Äù ‚Äúmanufacturing,‚Äù or ‚Äúpurchasing,‚Äù depending on the details of the specific virtual currency model involved. The label applied to a particular process of obtaining a virtual currency is not material to the legal characterization under the BSA of the process or of the person engaging in the process to send that virtual currency or its equivalent value to any other person or place. What is material to the conclusion that a person is not an MSB is not the mechanism by which a person obtains the convertible virtual currency, but what the person uses the convertible virtual currency for, and for whose benefit.

```Intresting there was an conversation about faster swaps about 2 hours ago on telegram``` was just asking about this! I just stumbled across this channel, had a feeling jl777 already had this as part of the plan.


[12-Feb-20 05:02 AM] jl777c#5810 (pinned)
latest version has the messaging (without much error checks) for a subatomic swap. it wont actually send money, but you can see the messages going back and forth if you run both the alice and bob nodes. i wanted to document how to get the nodes setup and configured so people can start finding issues.

this is based on my DEX branch and i am using the DEX chain. run the -ac_name=DEX with additional parameters:
-ac_handle=xxx_bob (or xxx_alice) -pubkey=02/03.... (secp pubkey with privkey in the wallet) -recvZaddr=zs1.... (zaddr to receive PIRATE)

make sure to use different pubkeys and recvZaddr and handles on both your nodes!
once the DEX chain is running, then from the bob node you can issue bid and ask as follows:
bid: ./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX DEX_broadcast <recvZaddr> <priority> KMD PIRATE <01pubkey> $2 $1
ask: ./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX DEX_broadcast <recvaddr> <priority> PIRATE KMD <01pubkey> $1 $2
orderbook: ./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX DEX_orderbook 10 0 PIRATE KMD

for both bid and ask: ./bid or ./ask PIRATEvol KMDvol, so to get a 0.1 price:
./bid 1000 100
./ask 1000 100

remember the id from the bid, the alice node will need it. to start a bob loop that accepts PIRATE for KMD:
./subatomic PIRATE "" KMD
<i havent tested the other direction yet>

now that all that is running, you can finally start a subatomic swap on the alice node:
./subatomic PIRATE "" <bid id> <fill amount>
the fill amount is a floating point, must be less than the orderbook size. if all goes well, you should see a bunch of printouts on both sides, including some that show what amount it would have sent to the other node. keep in mind i only started this yesterday and it is already 600+ lines of code (vs. 150 for notarizer) so bugs are likely everywhere

[12-Feb-20 06:09 AM] SHossain#0007
your pubkey? `01a4cc8dc16e69dc8bb119f56f1cff2664a36cc93dcd0446c4036eea85971f3c1d`


[12-Feb-20 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i see one of your orders now


[12-Feb-20 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
was looking on wrong chain


[12-Feb-20 06:10 AM] SHossain#0007
nice


[12-Feb-20 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
the bid is the one that i tested, so you can run the bob node with the command above and on the alice node use 2477954816


[12-Feb-20 06:12 AM] SHossain#0007
i used this on alien node and got this
```
./subatomic PIRATE "" KMD
sh: 1: komodo-cli: not found
loadfile null size.(/tmp/notarizer_DEX_stats_____4054)
couldnt set pubkey for DEX
```


[12-Feb-20 06:12 AM] SHossain#0007
do i need to link my `komodo-cli` bin to `/usr/local/bin/` ?


[12-Feb-20 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[12-Feb-20 06:13 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. just a min


[12-Feb-20 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
same setup as for notarizer


[12-Feb-20 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
but blocknotify is not needed yet


[12-Feb-20 06:13 AM] SHossain#0007
aha...i compiled the `subatomic` bin only inside `komodo/src/` dir


[12-Feb-20 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
subatomic shouldnt be needed in the path, without blocknotify


[12-Feb-20 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
but subatomic needs komodo-cli in the path


[12-Feb-20 06:14 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. just a min


[12-Feb-20 06:15 AM] SHossain#0007
it seems i started the command in wrong node
```
./subatomic PIRATE "" KMD
start subatomic_loop iambob.1 KMD -> PIRATE, 0 0 0
```


[12-Feb-20 06:16 AM] SHossain#0007
it is alice node where i used it


[12-Feb-20 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
that is how to start a bob node


[12-Feb-20 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be running long term


[12-Feb-20 06:16 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks


[12-Feb-20 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
alice node just starts the swap and stops after its done. right now if any error, it will get stuck


[12-Feb-20 06:17 AM] SHossain#0007
cancelled that and started the command in bob node


[12-Feb-20 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the above is saying it is a bobloop that will accept PIRATE and send KMD


[12-Feb-20 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
to do the reverse you would do ./subatomic KMD "" PIRATE


[12-Feb-20 06:18 AM] SHossain#0007
so, bob node needs to run many of these subatomic commands for each pair


[12-Feb-20 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
one command for each direction for each pair


[12-Feb-20 06:18 AM] SHossain#0007
got it


[12-Feb-20 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it shouldnt use much resources so you should be able to run hundreds of them


[12-Feb-20 06:20 AM] SHossain#0007
it seems, we need screen / tmux or different ssh terminal for each subatomic instances


[12-Feb-20 06:20 AM] SHossain#0007
we can't run multiple in 1 terminal


[12-Feb-20 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
different screen for each node, correct


[12-Feb-20 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i just open a different ssh terminal for each node


[12-Feb-20 06:22 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. got 2 screen sessions for 2 iambob.1 loop of subatomic

that is where it would send actual funds out when i enable that

make sure it is the right amount going to the right address

`50.00000000 -> RQPZrM4yQaTZpEuoGmcGwzE4SaG2Tn9QiB, paymentid[0] 3337276896`
would that be in the stdout or in subatomic screen?


[12-Feb-20 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i added the coin name to that print


[12-Feb-20 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it was in the pastebin


[12-Feb-20 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be the two sides of the swap, so both the alice node and bob node will have it


[12-Feb-20 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
git pull and rebuild subatomic

yes

[12-Feb-20 06:48 AM] SHossain#0007
i didn't import them


[12-Feb-20 06:48 AM] SHossain#0007
the R address was imported


[12-Feb-20 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
only the zaddr that is on that nodes -recvZaddr=


[12-Feb-20 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
not for the other nodes, basically configuring it as if alice and bob are different people


[12-Feb-20 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
dont update for a bit, testing some new things. ok to keep testing with older version

yes, will import only the corresponding recvZaddr into the respective nodes

it is probably that ask direction doesnt work, for now just test bid direction and try to get it to send the funds more than once

i acutally had a swap with both sides getting paid, was a bid

DEX chain is running fine


[12-Feb-20 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
are you running both PIRATE and KMD?

no. i'm not running those chains

so, PIRATE and KMD native mode on both alice and bob node?

it is all new code, but yes a similar concept


[12-Feb-20 07:31 AM] jl777c#5810
also, this is the trivial OTC mode, so there are no actual microchannels being setup, but that is all that can be done with PIRATE anyway and it helps get most all the orderbook, messaging and state machine issues out of the way


[12-Feb-20 07:46 AM] SHossain#0007

these are not atomic swaps


[12-Feb-20 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
they are subatomic swaps

Are Micropayment channels still subject to malleability after BIP65?
After BIP 65, are simple, unidirectional, MPC still subject to transaction malleability?

More specifically: 

Is the payee at risk because of malleability? If yes, how? (as far as I understood, the

@SHossain its fixed, swaps should work now


[12-Feb-20 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder first let me explain what we have today


[12-Feb-20 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
are you familiar with OTC swap?


[12-Feb-20 08:04 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks. i'm syncing KMD and PIRATE in my bob node


[12-Feb-20 08:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
to do OTC swaps you have to give the txids to other party?
I have only vague idea of OTC swaps


[12-Feb-20 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
no, i mean you do a swap directly with someone


[12-Feb-20 08:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes


[12-Feb-20 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
lets say you sort of trust him, but not so much


[12-Feb-20 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
you have a price


[12-Feb-20 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
you agree to amount, but it is so small that worst case it wont bother you and you assume the other party wont put his reputation at risk over it


[12-Feb-20 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe $1


[12-Feb-20 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
so you send $1 worth of PIRATE


[12-Feb-20 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
and he sends $1 worth of KMD


[12-Feb-20 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
notice you trusted him with $1, so it isnt fully trustless


[12-Feb-20 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
now lets do a trade for $100 worth


[12-Feb-20 08:07 AM] jl777c#5810
but now you hesitate as maybe for $100 this guy would just take the money and not send it back


[12-Feb-20 08:08 AM] jl777c#5810
today, you would need to do 100 separate trades for $1 each and make sure each one is complete to do $100 worth. quite a hassle, but maybe it can be automated so not so bad, but the OTC method has much to be desired as each $1 swap is 2 transactions onchain, with the txfees and blockchain space


[12-Feb-20 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so, now that the OTC mode is working, the next step is to make channels. what that does is create a way to do N microtransactions with only 4 blockchain transactions. you can do 100 or 1000 or even more microtransactions between each other


[12-Feb-20 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so now, it definitely needs to be automated, but i send 1% in an offchain transaction


[12-Feb-20 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
you send me 1%


[12-Feb-20 08:09 AM] jl777c#5810
we repeat until one side stops or we reach 100% swapped


[12-Feb-20 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
the channels are closed and it becomes confirmed


[12-Feb-20 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
this is a direct p2p channel between the two parties, so you need to make a special deposit tx and have it confirm firm, maybe even wait for it to notarize if it is for a lot of money


[12-Feb-20 08:10 AM] jl777c#5810
once it is notarized, it can be done for larger amounts


[12-Feb-20 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
so the people running the bob nodes, they could decide to support many different coins. in this case alice can open a channel with X amount of funds. then she only has to wait for that to confirm (notarize) and then can do many different subatomic swaps (at speed) for all the different coins the bob has


[12-Feb-20 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
additionally, all the bobs could open channels between themselves to help them replenish inventory as the alice is buying up all of one coin.


[12-Feb-20 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
by having a network of bobs that are interconnected to each other, each bob would be able to rapidly replenish any coin that is low in inventory and all the alices that are connected to any bob would be able to do the shopping spree i explain above


[12-Feb-20 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
for smaller amounts, the subatomic swap is probably a lot faster than atomic swaps, and subatomics is not really for mobile, need to have full nodes. theoretically its possible but the bandwidth needed to do all the hundreds or thousands of swaps, it just isnt something i would want on a phone


[12-Feb-20 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
so for desktop users that want speed and can run full nodes, that is the usecase for subatomic swaps


[12-Feb-20 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe in time it can be ported to mobile, but that wont be me, so maybe it will take a year or more to get that working

i can get it to work with fullnodes, i think relatively quickly

@TonyL I guess starting a layout and a GUI to test and send messages using DEX_ API from GUI is starting point for any GUI for this.


[12-Feb-20 08:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll start making HTML Bootstrap Layout for node.js app.

[12-Feb-20 08:20 AM] TonyL#3577
what about the fees in subatomic swaps?


[12-Feb-20 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL the only difference to GUI between OTC mode and the real micropayments is that instead of the swap happening with a single tx, it will take N. so the real subatomics will have a progress percentage


[12-Feb-20 08:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, I had the same question next as @TonyL üòÑ


[12-Feb-20 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no fee to use dexp2p network


[12-Feb-20 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
you just send the rawtx to the other side and that proves the payment is made


[12-Feb-20 08:21 AM] SHossain#0007
standard network txfee applies for the txs. right?


[12-Feb-20 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
there will be 2 txfees for each side, one for the channel open and one for the close


[12-Feb-20 08:21 AM] TonyL#3577
but this way people can just use subatomic swaps instead of atomic if this tech will be good enough


[12-Feb-20 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
the bob nodes will need to act as market makers and be reliable and run full nodes


[12-Feb-20 08:22 AM] TonyL#3577
loss of one payment in a channel sounds much better for me than a loss of dex fee by taker (what happening quite often now)


[12-Feb-20 08:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
rawtx which is broadcasted on network?


[12-Feb-20 08:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or it's collected until 100% is collected and then broadcasted?


[12-Feb-20 08:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not broadcast until the end


[12-Feb-20 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL unless you are doing 777+ micropayments, one lost micropayment is more than dexfee


[12-Feb-20 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
also 777 payments back and forth will take a few minutes


[12-Feb-20 08:23 AM] TonyL#3577
thats fair point


[12-Feb-20 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
and for big amounts, you start increasing the trust needed, or having to go to thousands of payments, taking half an hour


[12-Feb-20 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
so for larger amounts, use atomic swap


[12-Feb-20 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
for smaller amounts use subatomics


[12-Feb-20 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
this has the advantage that it wont take that many bob nodes to have sufficient liquidity for all the small subatomics


[12-Feb-20 08:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
subatomics will be popular for PIRATE trades üòé 
so, it's already a big usecase I see.

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[12-Feb-20 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
plus there will be a subatomic dexfee built in


[12-Feb-20 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, the current code does NOT validate that the funds were actually transferred


[12-Feb-20 08:26 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so DEX revenue too! nice!


[12-Feb-20 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
so this is only for debug testing, GUI interfacing


[12-Feb-20 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it will likely take till next week to get the micropayments working as i need to do rawtransactions and they are always very painful


[12-Feb-20 08:27 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think it's sufficient, I'll start basic demo and testing level layout work.


[12-Feb-20 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the UX is basically, get a list of bobs, select one to open a channel with, then trade and at the end to close the channel


[12-Feb-20 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
for OTC mode, it is a bit different, i guess more, pick from orderbook and swap


[12-Feb-20 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess i can leave in OTC mode for all coins as it will be up to the alice nodes to decide how much they trust each bob


[12-Feb-20 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so i will work on adding validations next, to get it at least so the tx needs to be in mempool and be the correct amount


[12-Feb-20 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
at that point, it is likely usable for PIRATE by community members to be bobs


[12-Feb-20 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
but i worry that there are not so many bugs found...


[12-Feb-20 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain please write up install and operation instructions

[12-Feb-20 08:31 AM] mrlynch#5735
what can i do for testing?


[12-Feb-20 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
you can get a bob node setup for PIRATE <-> KMD swaps and make sure it works


[12-Feb-20 08:31 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. will write up one


[12-Feb-20 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
then when i add validation, it can be beta tested for small volumes in PIRATE community


[12-Feb-20 08:32 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
I just saw a tweet about a swap between Pirate and KMD... is subatomic as trustless as atomic swap?


[12-Feb-20 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[12-Feb-20 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to trust the bob, alice sends first

{Reactions}
üëç 

[12-Feb-20 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
so alice needs to make sure the bob is trustworthy for the trade amount


[12-Feb-20 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
the good part is that alice will be able to loop a bunch of small swaps


[12-Feb-20 08:33 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
So to try if bob is to be trusted?


[12-Feb-20 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
only known community members will be able to run bob nodes


[12-Feb-20 08:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for now will have the coins setup and start of those be left on users who can do .conf setup and start the coin from cli. I will not consider that to code in the app. I know it's too much for starting point. so, assuming the coins are setup, so, the steps are like:
- open app UI
- show list of bobs on screen
- select a bob, and open channel with this bob
- after channel open, show orderbook, buy and sell list table panes side by side
- and on this screen also have the usual put order form fields.


[12-Feb-20 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so you should be able to trade in $1 to $10 increments without any worries


[12-Feb-20 08:34 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
ok


[12-Feb-20 08:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'm unclear on the channel open part. I guess I need to test that too to have clarity and make mindmap on creating it's UI interface.


[12-Feb-20 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
you want to show orderbook first


[12-Feb-20 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
that will help select the bob


[12-Feb-20 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
likely you would want to select the bob that has the best price for what you are looking to sell/buy


[12-Feb-20 08:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess this process doesn't look standard as some online cryptocurrency exchange ü§î


[12-Feb-20 08:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
has to be thought out a bit different


[12-Feb-20 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
correct, do a DEX_list 0 0 handles


[12-Feb-20 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
that gets a list of the active bobs


[12-Feb-20 08:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was just going to ask the first command. thanks for clearing üòÖ üëç


[12-Feb-20 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
and people are trading directly with a specific bob


[12-Feb-20 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
as shossain found out, it is handy to be able to get inventory from existing bobs, so i want all the bobs to interconnect channels, that will allow all of them to automatically rebalance inventory and have good offers for the alices


[12-Feb-20 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
the bob that has the actual inventory will likely have the best price for a specific coin, but other bobs could buy from him at a bit of a markup and then offer it to their alices


[12-Feb-20 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
all the bobs will benefit with this built in inventory sharing


[12-Feb-20 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the reason is that alice needs to make a channel with each bob she wants to buy from


[12-Feb-20 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if we can make it so alice only has to make a single channel and then is indirectly connected to all bobs, that will be the best UX


[12-Feb-20 08:39 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
So, will this subatomic be the way that arrr will get implemented to atomicdex? can it be made to be trustless at some point?

i'll read again

so we can have some sort of insurance funds in case one of them runs off with your $1


[12-Feb-20 08:41 AM] jl777c#5810
it isnt 100% trustless, but the loss can be limited to $1 and the $1 can be covered by insurance


[12-Feb-20 08:41 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341

ok..

[12-Feb-20 08:43 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
sorry, i was typing that as you answered. so, i guess losing a dollar is not much, and prolly trying to make it fully atomic won't be woth the dollar

Is the payee at risk because of malleability? If yes, how? (as far as I understood, the

since the DEX chain params are slightly different for bob and alice and has the dexp2p peer, i didn't include the params in the requirements section. but, instead listed separately in the setup section for bob and alice

you couldnt do BTC swaps,but you could host a decent number of coins if you created enough swap space

it is mostly about running the coin daemons

if you can get more SSD space without much increase in cost, probably a good idea

yes i just wait 10 seconds, dont actually look at returned value


[12-Feb-20 12:44 PM] jl777c#5810
so depends on mempool propagation, which is super very slow compared to dexp2p

moment of truth


[12-Feb-20 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
if it prints non-zero txid, it has sent the funds


[12-Feb-20 12:45 PM] jl777c#5810
also, there is nothing special about PIRATE, any other assetchain should also work with current version, though i havent tested that

external coins probably wont work without some changes, so for now limit to coins that can be invoked via ./komodo-cli -ac_name=COIN, so all runtime forms and even VRSC and HUSH3 should work

i guess dont lose those logs and txids, its the first subatomic swap done by someone other than me


[12-Feb-20 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. putting them in the gist guide as proof


[12-Feb-20 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007
because, i set the ubuntu paste logs to expire after a day


[12-Feb-20 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess there are a few days of work to get logging, data persistence, proof of payment (for PIRATE!), so many small but important details needed


[12-Feb-20 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, all the non-orderbook messages are encrypted between alice and bob, you can verify this by looking at any of the intermediate ids on a different node


[12-Feb-20 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
some other things to test are making sure you cant specify more volume than the orderbook specifies


[12-Feb-20 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
and whatever other edge cases


[12-Feb-20 12:53 PM] SHossain#0007
would you limit order posting of coins more than the wallet actually has?


[12-Feb-20 12:54 PM] SHossain#0007

as i said, it is only 2 days old and i ignored such things, was hard enough to get it to swap


[12-Feb-20 12:55 PM] SHossain#0007
sure. i don't need it now


[12-Feb-20 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
i will of course need to add checks, probably during the order match


[12-Feb-20 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
so alice would need to make sure she can fill the order she says and bob needs to make sure there are enough funds on his side


[12-Feb-20 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
since partial fill is possible, i think its ok to allow unbacked orderbook entries. notice there are no utxos needed, it is balance based


[12-Feb-20 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
the orderbook entries are cancelled after an ordermatch, it is expected the bob node is running some sort of automated price quote script that will recreate new ones every minute or so


[12-Feb-20 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
it is really more an indication of how big an order a bob is willing to accept


[12-Feb-20 01:05 PM] TonyL#3577

`ok, i think you must have imported the privkey during the previous instance` so restart after import is needed?


[12-Feb-20 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, it should be in the instructions


[12-Feb-20 01:38 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. i'll add that in the instructions now


[12-Feb-20 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
you might be able to trade KMD for KMD, not sure if that is a bug or a feature

Feature


[12-Feb-20 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i think its a feature, someone can have a post JUMBLR KMD for sale at a premium


[12-Feb-20 01:40 PM] CHMEX#0686
Exaclty currently thats done OTC

Important: After you have completed importing your R and zs addr privkey into the daemon, restart the DEX chain with all the params like above.

Added this in **bold ** letters twice for bob and alice


[12-Feb-20 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so it seems it is basically working if you configure the node correctly, let me know which coins it works with, and if KMD <-> KMD swaps work


[12-Feb-20 01:42 PM] SHossain#0007

i would need to change it to use curl to issue rpc requests to make it wasm compatible (i think), but so far it is quite small


[12-Feb-20 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain i am a bit surprised it doesnt do double payments, but if you can kill one side after it sends payment but before close and then start it again, it probably will send a double payment. not sure


[12-Feb-20 02:30 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, this would be a good test. will test it for sure tomorrow


[12-Feb-20 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
i expect you will be able to, as there is no protection from it yet, but it is good to know how to confuse it so we can make sure the new version is immune

2 questions ---


[12-Feb-20 04:09 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
1. Farmer  has 1000 head of cattle up for sale and they all get graded slightly differnt..How to create a SKU for each head? would a wallet address need to be created?


[12-Feb-20 04:11 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
2. How does farmer buy/sell crypto easily these days? Coinbase?


[12-Feb-20 04:11 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
3 questions


[12-Feb-20 04:13 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
3. How does farmer trust to  put $3,000,000  in a coinbase account? are there APIs that can be connected to coinbase using this tech or similar?


[12-Feb-20 04:13 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
sorry  - that was 4


[12-Feb-20 04:44 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
---- i think i figured out half of that -- maybe--- transactions could be centralized and just recorded on the chain

is this channel about submarine swaps for KMD asset chains? what is the definition of a subatomic swap?


[12-Feb-20 06:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain maybe you can explain it to this poor old man


[12-Feb-20 06:59 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
ohhhh wow --- I think you can use the Paypal Payments API for this


[12-Feb-20 06:59 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
just  like the zTransaction


[12-Feb-20 07:07 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
5. can this be ported to nSPV or only full nodes foreveer?


[13-Feb-20 02:47 AM] SHossain#0007
@dukeleto start reading from here to get the idea https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/676136067262447633/677183171531374602

@Tylor zkFS for the answer to your #5 question: nSPV support is possible but not anytime soon, highly likely in the future

`handle` in the DEX_stats output is the value of `ac_handle` ?

[13-Feb-20 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain ok, new version should be much better at preventing double spends. it does require a copy of the subatomic.json file in the same directory as you run subatomic, so do a: ln cc/dapps/subatomic.json .


[13-Feb-20 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810

any reason `ac_handle` is used instead of just `-handle` ?
I thought any parameters that start with `-ac_` change the magic number and ports
but that didn't happen with `ac_handle`

btw, bob printouts stops there once he finishes his part of the swap. same happened on the previous swap.


[13-Feb-20 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
wait, so bob resumed a swap that was in the middle for one case and in another, bob sent before he received?


[13-Feb-20 05:46 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, bob sent the PIRATE before he received KMD


[13-Feb-20 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810

anyway, i updated to protect against this


[13-Feb-20 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
also it should verify that it has enough balance, alice does this before starting, bob does this before opening channel. he just sends a close message if he doesnt have enough funds


[13-Feb-20 05:48 AM] SHossain#0007
i did another test where alice cancelled (`CTRL+C`) after getting the approvalid and nothing happened (expected). no funds were sent from either side

sorry, the approvalid happened on  bob side


[13-Feb-20 05:49 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. will test the new version as soon as i get some food


[13-Feb-20 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain updated with a few more defenses and latest should be pretty solid. might even be good enough for a test deployment at low orderbooks sizes


[13-Feb-20 06:15 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. updating now


[13-Feb-20 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
if someone could make a DB out of all the orderbook entries, that will help


[13-Feb-20 06:15 AM] SHossain#0007
the last one shows nice `SWAP COMPLETE <<<<<<<<<<<` message


[13-Feb-20 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i removed a lot of the prints so it is easier to see what is happening


[13-Feb-20 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
no need to be nice to it anymore, it shouldnt let you steal funds. at worst, a payment would fail for whatever reason and things would get stuck


[13-Feb-20 06:17 AM] SHossain#0007
doing the first full swap. then, the next ones will be cancelling during swap


[13-Feb-20 06:17 AM] jl777c#5810
so i guess try to get it to double send and if you cant, then onto testing other ecosystem coins

yes, printouts are very less cluttered now


[13-Feb-20 06:27 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. found issue
cancelled alice and bob side after i initiated the swap after seeing the approvalid on both side.
alice didn't pay KMD. neither did bob (didn't send PIRATE)
i restarted subatomic loop on bob node and bob completed the transfer of PIRATE without receiving KMD

what is this id 2600852512, it show that bob received 0.01 KMD, likely from 2600852512


[13-Feb-20 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i will add the id to all the prints so we know what id it is processing

cool


[13-Feb-20 06:34 AM] SHossain#0007
id 2600852512 was an old swap


[13-Feb-20 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
ok,but it shows 0.01 KMD came in, so PIRATE was sent out


[13-Feb-20 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it processed that incoming txid twice?


[13-Feb-20 06:36 AM] SHossain#0007

bob shows SWAP COMPLETE <<<<<<<<<< faster than alice. alice needs to waits for the tx in mempool, thus takes slightly longer than bob


[13-Feb-20 06:49 AM] SHossain#0007
33 second is still good


[13-Feb-20 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, as far as bob is concerned, he is done after he sends it, but alice needs to receive it in mempool


[13-Feb-20 06:49 AM] jl777c#5810
before you test other coins, it is good to test 2 swaps at once

how many zutxo?


[13-Feb-20 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if only 1 then subatomic goes so fast you could have no funds available due to change


[13-Feb-20 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
best to have several zutxo to be able to handle parallel subatomics

z_listunspent is not showing anything. did another tx, let's see how many after the tx is confirmed

it's only 1 utxo bob has

that explains, at least we verified the early close works

can i use same alice for multiple order filling from single bob?

after sending PIRATE for the first swap, the funds were in unconfirmed state i believe


[13-Feb-20 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
like i said before, to do 2 swaps you need 2 zutxo


[13-Feb-20 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
to do 3 swaps, you need 3


[13-Feb-20 07:08 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[13-Feb-20 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
to do 4, you need 4


[13-Feb-20 07:09 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll send few more utxos there


[13-Feb-20 07:09 AM] jl777c#5810
this is not a problem with subatomic, but server setup


[13-Feb-20 07:10 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[13-Feb-20 07:10 AM] jl777c#5810
so it seems parallel swaps can work


[13-Feb-20 07:10 AM] jl777c#5810
on a single bob subatomic instance. of course different subatomics for different coin pairs can also go in parallel (but we do need to verify that too)


[13-Feb-20 07:14 AM] SHossain#0007
yep, will test these scenarios soon and will get back if i run into any issues


[13-Feb-20 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL i added a return code to the subatomic executable. it will return 0 only if the alice swap completed without error.
i think this will allow to do a shell script loop that iterates on calling the alice script, until it gets an error. after an error, if funds were sent and not received, then some sort of manual process to deal with the one missing payment (if the error happened after alice sent the payment). but this requires scanning the orderbook for orders that are big enough for the alice specified volume and for the right coin pair direction and price. are you able to make this subatomic loop?


[13-Feb-20 07:27 AM] TonyL#3577
this sounds very doable. I'm just not started yet to play with swaps it because feel not 100% good last few days. Will make prototype on weekend I hope

look for a big order for Pirate


[13-Feb-20 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not approved for big orders


[13-Feb-20 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the design is to use the mempool for OTC, serially, ie. a bunch of small orders

once i get the micropayment channels implemented, then it would be able to start a larger swap and complete it incrementally all using dexp2p messages


[13-Feb-20 09:55 AM] SHossain#0007
should work with HUSH3 as well. but, i got stuck at the first stage - compiling the daemon


[13-Feb-20 10:10 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. master branch of HUSH3 has that issue of not compiling. using tag `v3.3.1`


[13-Feb-20 10:25 AM] SHossain#0007
HUSH3 syncing last few months of blocks. will do a test once that is ready


[13-Feb-20 10:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain do I need the blocknotify for subatomic in .conf files?


[13-Feb-20 10:37 AM] SHossain#0007
no


[13-Feb-20 10:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
`blocknotify=subatomic PIRATE "" %s`


[13-Feb-20 10:37 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay

[13-Feb-20 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it shouldnt hurt to do it, but there is no point for blocknotify (yet)


[13-Feb-20 10:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
my previous settings had the blocknotify, so thought I just ask.


[13-Feb-20 10:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, I'll comment them.


[13-Feb-20 10:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain `ln cc/dapps/subatomic.json` is missing in guide


[13-Feb-20 10:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also, add the step to get `01` key.
`./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX DEX_stats`
copy the pubkey from JSON string `publishable_pubkey`.


[13-Feb-20 11:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

yes.. thanks. i missed to add the `ln` command. the `01` pubkey will be converted by the daemon automatically when you restart the daemon with normal 02/03 pubkey

i hit the limitation of single utxo for 2 swaps at the same time


[13-Feb-20 12:11 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes that makes sense


[13-Feb-20 12:11 PM] CHMEX#0686
I'm very happy how this works


[13-Feb-20 12:11 PM] CHMEX#0686

@grewalsatinder do you want any more swaps?


[13-Feb-20 12:14 PM] SHossain#0007
i need to make the `bid` side swaps to me make me money :abused:

what i was making with `ask`, it's being empty with current `bid` üòõ

[13-Feb-20 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
the first one that sets up automated bid/ask with a few percent spread will have an automatic money maker

@SHossain I'm curious: Does this always need to go through KMD, or would VRSC (zs-address) to PIRATE (zs-address) work as well?
```


[13-Feb-20 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
getting the alice node configured so the fullnodes are ready to go... that will be the challenge

i dont see any reason why a zaddr <-> zaddr swap wont work, please test with PIRATE <-> PIRATE orders


[13-Feb-20 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
cipi has the automated scripts already

@SHossain cool, let's do another swap

`4166974208` @grewalsatinder


[13-Feb-20 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
since this is all via mempool and unconfirmed tx, it seems there is no reason to make the micropayment channels. i think with each bob putting up a security deposit to set the size of trades alice can do that are insured, the trade sizes can be reasonable sizes. i can then post the size of the deposit so all the nodes can automatically calibrate the max order size. this usage of unconfirmed tx and deposit will solve the fast/small orders. however, all that run a bob node, you will need to be careful about a 51% double spend attack against the unconfirmed, so you need to set the orderbook size (sum of all open orders for a coin) to be at a level that you are comfortable with wont be double spend attacked


[13-Feb-20 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
with micropayment channels, a confirmation is required for both chains, then a bunch of back and forth that takes time, then a close channel and a bunch of complexity


[13-Feb-20 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
the mempool OTC is simple and fast and alice risk can be covered by deposits, bob side risk can be managed by orderbook sizes


[13-Feb-20 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess what i am asking is if we have bobs who will be willing to run nodes for users to trade against, even with the 51% attack risk

oh, i think you can run the DEX chain with -nSPV=1 that means you wont have to sync the blockchain

so alice just needs to have a full node for the coins that are traded, then configure DEX chain and then should be able to scan the orderbook, click and have a swap done in 30 seconds. if not, the worst is a one minute timeout or the bob doesnt return payment. in that case, i will have a way for alice to prove the payment was made and for bob to prove he made the payment, so it will be easy to arbitrate


[13-Feb-20 12:46 PM] SHossain#0007

here is my plan for disputed subatomics:
1. alice will need to show an order id and txid to prove she made the payment
2. bob will then need to show the corresponding txid for that orderid or make a manual payment
i will just log all transactions that are sent, so you can just search a text file to find any disputed order id. i think this is pretty simple and so far the failure rate is pretty low, so there shouldnt be much need for manual payments

the other good thing about the current subatomics is that it is all just normal transactions, no funds locked in p2sh, the payment is either made or not.

there is a 60 second timeout for checking, so if it takes longer for a tx to arrive in mempool, then it will end up with a dispute or in the case it is alice that gets it, then before making a dispute, just check the explorer to see if the txid came in after all

you would actually get a bit more privacy having someone else send to your zaddr than you sending to your own zaddr

if you look inside the ztx with z_viewtransaction, you will see the memo field encodes the orderbook id

yes. previously it was `beef`

there are many in that list. why does it show tagB as number?


[13-Feb-20 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, for tokens you will need to register a short name for the token, must be so that COIN.token_name will fit in 15 chars
once token_name is defined, then you can make orderbook entries so we get a human readable listing. each token_name will need to be unique for a specific coin, first registered gets the spot.

Just one question before I go to sleep¬®
you said
>>it is just the DEX chain that needs to be configured and using nSPV=1 mode, it should go very fast
so basically that works without downloading the whole chain for alice meaning a standalone app having subatomic compiled and a daemon in nSPV=1 running will make it very light weight and fast for normal users?


[13-Feb-20 01:06 PM] SHossain#0007

you can probably run nodes over tor, the dexp2p is using the DEX coin network, but really as long as you dont use handle and tweet your pubkey, how will anybody know who is trading under pubkey 01.....


[13-Feb-20 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
oh that makes me think,
@jl777c will subatomic swaps work on local IPv6 only address network??


[13-Feb-20 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I mean if the whole network is only running IPv6


[13-Feb-20 01:23 PM] SHossain#0007
TOR would be slower than VPN


[13-Feb-20 01:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It should as I understand


[13-Feb-20 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
does -addnode work with ipv6?


[13-Feb-20 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810

[13-Feb-20 01:24 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, then must be working


[13-Feb-20 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
so if you use a onetime pubkey over tor and only z <-> z swaps


[13-Feb-20 01:24 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems quite private and impractical for anybody but a global surveillance org to have any data to analyze


[13-Feb-20 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
everybody else wont see anything as the dexp2p purgetime is 1 hour


[13-Feb-20 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess someone can log all packets and store it...


[13-Feb-20 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
but the logs will show pubkey 01... did some z <-> z swaps and all the swap data is inside encrypted inbox comms


[13-Feb-20 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
so a permanent log of all packets, combined with QC and statistically correlating. i guess that would break the privacy

or $10 at a time, so for smaller trades but not crazy small. alice sends first. this allows supporting tokens, files and non-coins in general


[14-Feb-20 12:13 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain new release might work with zCOIN to indicate to use zaddr for that coin. just add a small z in front of coin name for the ./subatomic ... parameters and also in the orderbook. one, two or none of the coins should be able to have z, so test zBASE <-> REL, BASE <-> zREL and zBASE <-> zREL


[14-Feb-20 12:16 AM] jl777c#5810
it also creates a SUBATOMIC.incomplete file for alice and SUBATOMIC.proof file for bob, you need to force a failure to get the SUBATOMIC.incomplete file to update, plz verify it works with more than one time for each file.


[14-Feb-20 12:17 AM] jl777c#5810
i didnt test it much at all, so probably there are bugs with the above, but once it is done, i think there is enough for people to start trading as it is easy to track incomplete swaps and also prove that you sent out payment


[14-Feb-20 12:28 AM] jl777c#5810

i updated the internals to store the zaddr-ness of a coin on a per message basis. @SHossain please test parallel swaps using the same coin as taddr and zaddr at the same time on different swaps.
COIN
zCOIN
COIN.tagB

those are the three forms of coin names that will be supported. the COIN.tagB is defined in the "tokens" array in subatomic.json. you need to have {"COIN.tagB":"<tokenid>"} in the tokens array defined to be able to trade tokens. both alice and bob need the same COIN.tagB:<tokenid>. once this is done ,orderbooks can be created using COIN.tagB (of course best to use a more descriptive name than tagB and once i get the back end to handle the tokenbalance, tokentransfer, it should just work

i am sure there are bugs, dont have time to test all the cases, but i got a PIRATE for RICK.demo token completed. there is a RICK.demo defined in the latest subatomic.json, so you can just use that as the coin name. it automagically figures out it is a tokenid on the RICK chain and converts from token units to coin units (pretty sure this will have troubles), i only tried a 1:1 price, odds are at different prices, it will act wonky. there is some partial validation, but as long as alice is the one receiving the tokens even if it doesnt validate, you can verify manually


[14-Feb-20 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
put up some orders so you can buy the RICK.demo token


[14-Feb-20 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810

[14-Feb-20 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it is fast, wallet to wallet, which seems to be what is most important for people


[14-Feb-20 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
alice sends first


[14-Feb-20 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
if bob doesnt send, the insurance will cover it.


[14-Feb-20 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
easy to have proofs of oneway send (still need to add tag to opreturn) and proof of whether bob paid it or not


[14-Feb-20 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
so, put it together and users can get trades done in 30 seconds


[14-Feb-20 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
what is to not understand?


[14-Feb-20 08:36 AM] Alright#0419
you can do a normal atomic swap in 30 seconds if you aren't waiting for confs?


[14-Feb-20 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
with PIRATE?


[14-Feb-20 08:36 AM] Alright#0419
alice can just double spend?


[14-Feb-20 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
with tokens?


[14-Feb-20 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, bob needs to only have outstanding amounts for each coin, less than the 51% attack cost


[14-Feb-20 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so what is the cost to 51% attack PIRATE?


[14-Feb-20 08:37 AM] Alright#0419
I'll trade some DEX for PIRATE, any offers?


[14-Feb-20 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
for DEX you would need to wait for confirmations, actually notarization


[14-Feb-20 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you are dealing with faucet amounts


[14-Feb-20 08:38 AM] SHossain#0007
@Alright if you have your alice node setup and ready, let me know. i can put up some orders for you to test


[14-Feb-20 08:38 AM] Alright#0419
it's a joke, I was going to rob you :troll:


[14-Feb-20 08:39 AM] SHossain#0007
lol


[14-Feb-20 08:39 AM] SHossain#0007
i don't have DEX offers though


[14-Feb-20 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
we do need to estimate the 51% attack cost for each chain


[14-Feb-20 08:39 AM] Alright#0419
ok, PIRATE is a special case


[14-Feb-20 08:39 AM] SHossain#0007
i can do  KMD, PIRATE, VRSC


[14-Feb-20 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
and bob needs to make sure to stay below


[14-Feb-20 08:39 AM] Alright#0419
why would anyone do crypto/crypto for other coins?


[14-Feb-20 08:40 AM] Alright#0419
and not just a normal atomicswap with no conf wait


[14-Feb-20 08:40 AM] SHossain#0007
this is for smaller amounts and like OTC swap without middleman (escrow)


[14-Feb-20 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
zaddr, tokens


[14-Feb-20 08:41 AM] SHossain#0007
how may would bother opening an account in exchange to swap 10 KMD for 100 PIRATE?


[14-Feb-20 08:41 AM] SHossain#0007
or, think about small time miners with low hash rate. they probably mined a bit of something and want to exchange that to something else


[14-Feb-20 08:42 AM] Alright#0419
how is the insurance handled in the event alice paid bob and bob goes dark?


[14-Feb-20 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
swapping mining pool payouts is another usecase


[14-Feb-20 08:42 AM] SHossain#0007
and, you can't do swaps for PIRATE in atomicdex yet


[14-Feb-20 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
all the bobs are registered, so we dont expect any to go dark


[14-Feb-20 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
but if they do, alice shows proof of payment and if bob doesnt show his proof of payment, it would come from insurance fund


[14-Feb-20 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
the reason to not use 0 conf atomic swaps is the failure timeout, which is what, 4 hours?


[14-Feb-20 08:43 AM] Alright#0419
4 hours is arbitrary


[14-Feb-20 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
also, there are less transactions


[14-Feb-20 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it might be arbitrary, but any production setting will likely be something like that


[14-Feb-20 08:44 AM] Alright#0419
is just enough time to make sure alice would actually claim back her coins instead of bob ending up with both sets of coins


[14-Feb-20 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
even if it is an hour, that is one hour the funds are tied up


[14-Feb-20 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
with subatomic, longest is 1 minute


[14-Feb-20 08:44 AM] Alright#0419
adds trust :/


[14-Feb-20 08:44 AM] Alright#0419
and that's not inherently bad


[14-Feb-20 08:44 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, this is not trustless


[14-Feb-20 08:45 AM] Alright#0419
it's just we have something else that is trustless, why not build that out


[14-Feb-20 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
for the small amount, yes. dont trade above the bob insured amount


[14-Feb-20 08:45 AM] jl777c#5810
how?


[14-Feb-20 08:45 AM] SHossain#0007
OTC with escrow seems similar as well. both party needs to trust the escrow


[14-Feb-20 08:45 AM] Alright#0419
make locktime configurable, confs configurable


[14-Feb-20 08:45 AM] Alright#0419
again, PIRATE a special case


[14-Feb-20 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
subatomic was made for PIRATE


[14-Feb-20 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is a pretty special, special case


[14-Feb-20 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
even if it isnt used for any other coin, it has served its purpose


[14-Feb-20 08:46 AM] SHossain#0007
`again, PIRATE a special case`
same goes for PIRATE <> zVRSC


[14-Feb-20 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
also zCOIN can be swapped


[14-Feb-20 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
this cannot be done with atomic swaps


[14-Feb-20 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so subatomics fills a gap in atomic swap that it cant do, it also covers some overlapped cases and the user can choose which they prefer


[14-Feb-20 08:47 AM] Alright#0419
What was the thing assigned to joker last year? Wasn't that meant to be true z atomic swaps via viewing keys?


[14-Feb-20 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it requires adding taddr to chain for p2sh


[14-Feb-20 08:47 AM] Alright#0419
Ah


[14-Feb-20 08:48 AM] SHossain#0007
there is no timelock in this setup


[14-Feb-20 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
a tunable atomic swaps is a good idea and maybe with subatomics doing the very fast, the atomic swaps will do the fast or at least faster


[14-Feb-20 08:48 AM] Alright#0419
that's not a bad tradeoff honestly, it's leaking metadata either way, so allowing p2sh addresses on PIRATE isn't too bad


[14-Feb-20 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
but there are just cases that atomic swaps cant do


[14-Feb-20 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
also, i got tired of waiting for PIRATE atomic swaps


[14-Feb-20 08:49 AM] Alright#0419
I think it's pretty awesome for micropayments


[14-Feb-20 08:49 AM] Alright#0419
a standardized way to pay a few pennies at a time for arbitrary service


[14-Feb-20 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
now there is a practical solution for PIRATE swaps, and micropayments, delivery of data is a few functions away


[14-Feb-20 08:49 AM] Alright#0419
then a standard place to put the code to fulfill that service


[14-Feb-20 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
and the micropayments can be with zaddr


[14-Feb-20 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, so dont freak out over the taddr crypto to taddr crypto, that isnt its primary usecase, though smaller traders will use it for that


[14-Feb-20 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it does need to be with coins that have enough hashrate so that the double spend cost is higher than the trading amounts


[14-Feb-20 08:51 AM] Alright#0419
it's important that people using it understand the risks of double spends


[14-Feb-20 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
alice doesnt have to worry, the bobs do


[14-Feb-20 09:01 AM] SHossain#0007
setting up a KMD <> zVRSC swap


[14-Feb-20 09:14 AM] SHossain#0007
i was wondering if we use the ask script like this, why would we need to specify zCOIN?
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX DEX_broadcast zs1wq40g4wvrzc2eq9xw7wtstshgar68ash659eq20ellm5jeqsyfwe5qs3tex9l3mjnrj2yf34hw0 5 VRSC KMD 0133f63a3d4ae8db7e9efe8b8702e10ecc9ef44901dd2321c92132889bc6656b4e $1 $2
```


[14-Feb-20 09:22 AM] Alright#0419
is important that you don't reuse z addresses that are publicly known


[14-Feb-20 09:23 AM] SHossain#0007
alice will know bob's addresses (t or z) and bob will alice's


[14-Feb-20 09:24 AM] SHossain#0007
when bob posts an order he specifies the addresses for the specific swap like the above command


[14-Feb-20 09:25 AM] SHossain#0007
but, alice will not know of that until she starts swapping with the `id` that was posted by bob


[14-Feb-20 09:26 AM] SHossain#0007
forgot to stop rescan while i was using z_importkey in VRSC and now waiting for rescan to finish `2020-02-14 17:25:36 Still rescanning. At block 586824. Progress=0.724071`


[14-Feb-20 09:58 AM] SHossain#0007
done


[14-Feb-20 09:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
Is there an option to get all orders? 
currently    komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX DEX_orderbook 10 0 PIRATE KMD
base and rel has to be given.
For Reporting purposes it would be nice be able to get all the orderbooks. I would make it easier to display to the user which with something like

komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX DEX_orderbook 10 0 "" ""


[14-Feb-20 09:58 AM] CHMEX#0686
I guess the data is there in the RAM of the node and BASE / REL is just a filter

so you can find all the messages from a specific pubkey with "" "" 01pubkey


[14-Feb-20 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
filter it to just the ones with exact match, or anything in between


[14-Feb-20 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
by using the stopat field you can make a loop that only displays the new data, just store the id of the first returned value and pass that in the next time


[14-Feb-20 11:33 AM] jl777c#5810
all the indexing is done in realtime on-the-fly, even when doing thousands of messages per second, only RAM limited to the number of categories


[14-Feb-20 11:36 AM] CHMEX#0686
That sounds good and what I was looking for thank you!


[14-Feb-20 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
stopat value of 0 will return all the records in RAM, of course after the purgetime (one hour) a message is gone


[14-Feb-20 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX_broadcast combined with DEX_list allows to very easily create specific datasets, like handles, notarizations, COIN/height hashes, tokenid mappings. there are a few special tags, like "inbox" for tagA which will encrypt to the pubkey, if not to inbox, it will authenticate that it is from your pubkey. a bit quirky, but just how it evolved to meet what was needed

i assume swaps without z still work?


[14-Feb-20 11:53 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, swap without z working


[14-Feb-20 11:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i did have a lot of issues getting tokens working, and only in the bid direction as above. if the bid direction works for you, maybe the ask direction will also. didnt get a chance to test the zCOIN, i will debug it tomorrow, with more validation for the token swap


[14-Feb-20 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
also, please stop a swap and make alice get a timeout error and make sure it is logged in the SUBATOMIC.incomplete file


[14-Feb-20 11:58 AM] SHossain#0007
RICK should be ready soon. i already imported the privkey and remaining about 70k blocks


[14-Feb-20 11:58 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to do this at least 2 times to make sure it doesnt lose data


[14-Feb-20 11:59 AM] SHossain#0007
actually 60k blocks remaining


[14-Feb-20 11:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is that alice can just use the entries in this file to let bob know the funds were paid, but not returned. then by looking at explorers bob can confirm against his SUBATOMIC.proof file that he sent the return funds to alice. it should be pretty simple to determine if a swap was incomplete and whether it was properly paid or not


[14-Feb-20 12:03 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain please ask if you have any questions about adding a new token for swapping. both alice and bob nodes need to have the same entry in the subatomic.json file, the latest has a single line with the RICK.demo tokenid, but it is an array, can have as many as you want


[14-Feb-20 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i am most concerned about the 1 token being 0.00000001 coins, i had to multiply/divide by 100 million in various places and if i got it wrong, it will be off... by a factor of 100 million!


[14-Feb-20 12:04 PM] SHossain#0007
sure. will ask. i just need to get RICK.demo setup first and do couple of swaps


[14-Feb-20 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
also when the prices are not round numbers volA/volB, i think it will cause problems with a single satoshi swap due to rounding errors


[14-Feb-20 12:05 PM] SHossain#0007
in order to buy token, alice needs to use RICK as well. getting alice node ready too


[14-Feb-20 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
was happy to get the basics for token swapping done today, but even if it looks like it is working, tokens are using totally different code path for balance, sending, checking and validating


[14-Feb-20 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
tl:dr there should be more bugs for you to find, changing the meaning of the COIN to (COIN or zCOIN or COIN.tagB) was quite a big jump and basically the entire internals of the dapp had to change to be able to handle this. good thing though, as i realized if you had the same coin doing both taddr and zaddr at the same time, it would be random which address it would use, based on timing

yes, swapping XYZ for zaddr coin, then swapping it back or to another coin and it becomes very hard to link it, though if you are the only one doing such swaps, it can be linked

I'll give Go Language a try instead of Node.js in my stack of 
Golang + HTML + jQuery App

Since I have the golang library `kmdgo` already built, and have fair enough grasp on it, I'd like to give it at least one try yet again for making a desktop app.
I can also make a desktop app using this same Golang stack exactly as Node.js but with Golang.
Will give myself few days and if feel stuck again on it, then Node.js I can do already. üôÇ 

Will update here on Golang Alice UI side Web app this weekend.

save the proof for the token swap

just trying to understand


[14-Feb-20 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
the reason is that the first field is just data for the broadcast


[14-Feb-20 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it can be "beef"


[14-Feb-20 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
or "babadada"


[14-Feb-20 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
the orderbook uses the tagA/tagB


[14-Feb-20 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
notice the orderbook doesnt even look at the payload and it shouldnt that is dapp specific data


[14-Feb-20 01:26 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. will understand more when i test that out


[14-Feb-20 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it is just convention that i put the zaddr or taddr in the payload. it is convenient and authenticated


[14-Feb-20 01:28 PM] SHossain#0007
nice

[14-Feb-20 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
at least now you know how its supposed to work and can add new tokens in subatomic.json, make sure orderbook is sane with the bid and ask scripts, etc.

along with @CHMEX in the history for PIRATE <> PIRATE swap


[15-Feb-20 02:27 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain update with bugfix release:
1. ask direction for token swap should work (also bid should still work too)
2. zCOIN should work but zCOIN.token should give an error as tokens cant be to zaddr
3. plz make sure SUBATOMIC.incomplete has alicepayment txid and SUBATOMIC.proof has bobpayment txid
4. checks to make sure you have RICK coins to send RICK tokens
5. normal transfers should have the origid in the opreturn. this will allow proof that a specific payment was for a specific orderbook id. in zaddr, this is in the memo field, for taddr, it is in opreturn, skip the leading 0, the next 4 bytes are the big endian hex for the orderbook id.

in order to achieve 5, i realized there was no rpc way to easily send opreturn. so i added it to sendtoaddress! you will need to rebuild all taddr daemons to get this functionality (otherwise the swap will fail with an error on sendtoaddress). to be backward compatible, i added a new optional parameter that is the hexstring for the opreturn:
sendtoaddress <address> <amount> "" "" false "beefdada"
@TonyL @gcharang probably a good idea to document the opreturn capability for sendtoaddress, it will arrive in the next hardfork (or people can update earlier to get it)

[15-Feb-20 04:43 AM] jl777c#5810
i started working on external coins and figured it would be good to add CHIPS support, but i had to sync it on one node from scratch. so i decided to see if i could get the code working before the sync finished...
it seems i did, as i got a CHIPS <-> PIRATE swap to work, but cant fully verify until the sync finishes.

i updated subatomic.json with an array called "externalcoins", just add the name of the coin and the cli path. with that a new coin can be supported!

ok


[15-Feb-20 04:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i think VRSC doesnt have that, if this is confirmed, please let VRSC team know that subatomic transfers needs z_viewtransaction to support zVRSC

i changed it so printouts for swaps goes to stdout, what that means is bob (and alice) can ./subatomic .... > base_rel
for each different trading pair and have things at least organized by files


[15-Feb-20 05:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i verified a CHIPS swap


[15-Feb-20 05:08 AM] jl777c#5810
so BTC and BCH should also work, though using legacy addresses


[15-Feb-20 05:09 AM] SHossain#0007
cool


[15-Feb-20 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
one trick to use non-updated daemons is to define a chain as an "externalcoin" add "COIN":"komodo-cli -ac_name=COIN"


[15-Feb-20 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
in such a case it wont use the opreturn sendtoaddress

@TonyL @gcharang @Tylor zkFS i just sold copies of komodod for 1 PIRATE, using subatomic. i set it up so you can have a store for all your files.
1. in subatomic.json have a "files" array like:
"files":[ {"filename":"komodod","prices":[{"KMD":0.1}, {"PIRATE":1}]} ]
you can have as many files as you want, filenames must be less than 14chars. the prices are what you are charging, denominated in whatever coins you have in the list, even RICK.demo should work. basically you can sell any file for any supported coin, including zCOIN (if there are no bugs). each file will make a tagA that is ```#filename```

now having to launch a zillion ./subatomic processes to deal with each "trading" pair wouldnt be practical if you have a large number of files, so i added a wildcarding to the bob subatomic.
```./subatomic PIRATE "" '#allfiles'```
that will process all files in your subatomic.json array when sold for PIRATE. you still need to launch one subatomic per coin, but that shouldnt be so bad.

now these dont show up in the orderbook (not sure why) so you have to use DEX_list, which is a good idea anyway as it is pubkey specific. DEX_list 0 0 '#komodod' PIRATE <- get the first non-cancelled id and fill as normal:
./subatomic PIRATE "" <id> 1
and it should force bob to publish it and wait until alice has all the fragments

a few things, is there a centralized node that determines the result? how does the betting work if there is no counterparty?


[15-Feb-20 10:20 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280

[15-Feb-20 10:20 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Just like a regular website


[15-Feb-20 10:21 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Bob enters the results


[15-Feb-20 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
then it is easy for the determining who wins and i guess it can be like horse racing where the odds are changing as the bets come in


[15-Feb-20 10:21 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Yes


[15-Feb-20 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so regardless of the imbalance, there is always a payout


[15-Feb-20 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
that should be simple enough to do


[15-Feb-20 10:21 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Yes


[15-Feb-20 10:22 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I'll pitch it all in


[15-Feb-20 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
as the subatomic payments come in, the odds change and there can be a node that posts the latest odds


[15-Feb-20 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
just like at the horses, no guarantee that the odds wont change, until the window closes

[15-Feb-20 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the bets come in, odds updated in realtime


[15-Feb-20 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810

[15-Feb-20 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
horses "race"


[15-Feb-20 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the winning horse would then payout X% of total funds, prorated by how much a pubkey paid into that horses address


[15-Feb-20 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so each file could just be the name of the bet!

[15-Feb-20 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
for now these are paywalls, so a single person that pays for it, then everybody can get access to it


[15-Feb-20 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as the stablecoin doesnt do -ac_public=1, it will have zaddr


[15-Feb-20 10:28 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I'm throwing it all on the table.....anything is possible now


[15-Feb-20 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, now we have realtime payments, file sync, streaming, CC, yes, anything is indeed possible


[15-Feb-20 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
it took 5 days to get subatomic from concept to where it is now

[15-Feb-20 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
you can send a file to bob to store. he then adds it to his list


[15-Feb-20 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
whenever you want it, you pay him the price, he delivers it


[15-Feb-20 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it only exists for an hour


[15-Feb-20 10:32 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
So someone can get paid to share hard drive? And speed

I guess a dAPP could automate


[15-Feb-20 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i can make a decentralized storage, but it needs bobs to agree to store the data. shamir shard the data to N different bobs


[15-Feb-20 10:34 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I know this meeting will go well


[15-Feb-20 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
then whenever you need access to it, you pay M bobs to reconstruct the data. so nobody else can reconstruct the data


[15-Feb-20 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
but not sure the model is worth it for bobs...


[15-Feb-20 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you agree to access the data every so often


[15-Feb-20 10:34 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
They already sell something without the bells and whistles


[15-Feb-20 10:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and if you dont, he is free to delete it


[15-Feb-20 10:35 AM] jl777c#5810
then the bobs would get regular revenues from the data storage

it is a broadcast network. all nodes share the load to broadcast all packets to achieve broadcast status


[15-Feb-20 12:46 PM] jl777c#5810
each peer, should be participating roughly the same, i guess it is possible for a poorly connected node to not contribute much, but they will miss out on a lot of packets. so a node is motivated to get enough connections and in that case they would have some sort of balance between R.received and S.sent packets

there is no validations yet to check that pubkeys and params set correct, that balances are enough and etc. so it's almost as strict as CLI, but it's in todo list before give it to users

@jl777c would it be possible to see trade history with subatomic swaps?


[16-Feb-20 10:05 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
both own trade history and public trade history


[16-Feb-20 10:07 AM] CHMEX#0686
looks like we had the same thoughts It would be nice if subtomic once the trade is completed can send an event to the network. It would be purged after an hour but that is enough time to catch it

you mean have both alice and bob send a message to "tagA":"completed","tagB":<id>


[16-Feb-20 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
right where they print SWAP COMPLETE

that sounds good yes
and than we can catch those messages and if we find two messages with same tagB:id and from a differend node than it would mean completed


[16-Feb-20 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
you can cross reference the id to get the swap details


[16-Feb-20 10:14 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes


[16-Feb-20 10:15 AM] CHMEX#0686
id is enough


[16-Feb-20 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
in jl777 branch, alice and bob post to "completed", with the txid as the payload. alice posts to incomplete with her txid as payload


[16-Feb-20 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
this loses all semblance of privacy, but it isnt really very private as it is now anyway

it is untested, let me know if it works


[16-Feb-20 10:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
may be for private trades they can conditionally don't broadcast their trade completing info to public? 
If that's much of a privacy concern


[16-Feb-20 10:31 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will suppress it if your txid is for a zaddr

[16-Feb-20 04:09 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I dont think there is any competition at all - not even a close second place


[17-Feb-20 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i have tried, but could not solve the instant betting combined with blockchain enforced...
in the subatomic spirit, i am thinking we can make the games dependent on each specific bob to run the proper code. if they dont, then an alicebet might not be paid out even if it should win. however, i can add a verification so an evil bob can be detected. using this approach, we can get instant bets and instant payouts. by instant i mean subatomic speeds.


[17-Feb-20 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
what this means is that we cant call the subatomic betting as decentralized


[17-Feb-20 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
it is more an automated payment system


[17-Feb-20 06:37 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Hmmm - can bob take the bet and put it into p2sh address? Or Alice put it directly in the address? I was thinking bob would be the bookie -- sorta combination of atomic and subatomic -- I guess instant would need to be faster - proving the bet was placed 5 minutes after the event doesnt mean Alice was late.  I cant see the problem/code so I am just thinking of the safe and fair way- I was also thinking redundant Bob's could be "rented" or ran on willing nodes......3 -4  bobs could "notarize"?? Or create stability?? Evil Bob's will need a plan to handle in any event - and there are several reasons why a  DEX_killbob would need to be created...
As far as slot machines would work... I guess the cashier thing you created might work?  Atomic swap to use "houseCoin" - there has to be a solution out there - DEX_cashier?


[17-Feb-20 07:17 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I guess bookiebob or another Alice could "cover" the bet - meaning payout is guaranteed by either another Alice or the house - peep to peer betting would ne up for grabs on the order books- peerplays coin has an app called bookie


[17-Feb-20 07:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
when alice uses the subatomic command example `./subatomic PIRATE "" 2855700768 10`
which orderid is that from bob?

is that the orderid created with ask command or bid command?


[17-Feb-20 07:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
as per the example from github gist guide:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX DEX_orderbook 10 0 PIRATE KMD
./subatomic PIRATE "" 2855700768 10
```


[17-Feb-20 08:24 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I guess data storage contracts and monthly subscriptions would work in the same manner .... Atomic the contract subatomic the payment??? Ok - back to my day job


[17-Feb-20 08:41 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Cashier model works with a lot of contracts including shipping - preauthorize - then capture funds upon completion-- these compare to the "offline" swaps I was thinking -


[17-Feb-20 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder it can be either, but it needs to match that alice is paying with PIRATE

[17-Feb-20 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
@Tylor zkFS yes, there could be a set of independent observer nodes that act as the third signer in a 2 of 3 multisig, if both alice and bob sign, there is no need for the third. however, that requires normal tx and it is subject to 51% attacks. i want to at least protect from 51% attacks and also have it be instant


[17-Feb-20 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so the current plan is to use CC channels for alice to make payments to bob, bob then probably also opens a channel back and can payout to alice in realtime. i think it is just one packet from alice and a packet back from bob, so it could be done in 5 seconds to 10 seconds. that should be good for the instant feedback and it is protected by dPoW (when a real chain that is using dPoW is used)


[17-Feb-20 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
i plan to use the EURK stablecoin for the betting, so it is basically locked KMD that is being bet in realtime


[17-Feb-20 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
there was a lot of ways to do this, but the way i selected achieves three significant things in addition to achieving realtime betting. a) it also demonstrates CC channels, b) it creates pretty direct demand for KMD, c) creates a usecase for the stablecoin


[17-Feb-20 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
considering these three side benefits, i think overally it is the best, oh and did i mention after the channel creation, all the betting/payout will be in realtime

yes


[20-Feb-20 01:00 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
SHossains guide states:
`pubkey = is the pubkey of your KMD transparent (R) address. the privkey of that address needs to be imported in both KMD and DEX wallet`
I'm guessing this doesn't actually need to be in the DEX wallet then?


[20-Feb-20 01:02 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
He talks about:
`You need to get the 01 pubkey from the DEX chain startup standard outputs, known as stdout to use inside the following scripts.`
If we are using nSPV, where would we get this from?


[20-Feb-20 01:02 AM] gcharang#6833
it has to be
it is used to create `DEX_pubkey`

see the description of the pubkey33 argument in  <https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/dexp2p.html#dex-broadcast> dex-broadcast


[20-Feb-20 01:05 AM] gcharang#6833
I haven't used dexp2p + nspv yet, but I think you have to import the privkey to the wallet without nspv=1 and then restart the daemon with the corresponding -pubkey param and -nspv=1

It outputs a 01 pubkey there


[20-Feb-20 01:19 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, that is the pubkey relevant in all the dexp2p methods
it is a pubkey with different encoding and value but derived from the privkey of the pubkey used to start the daemon


[20-Feb-20 01:20 AM] jl777c#5810
but it will always generate a 01 pubkey, even if it has to make a session based keypair, so you need to make sure there are no error prints during startup


[20-Feb-20 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
if you launch with -handle then you can DEX_list 0 0 handles and see the payload to see what secp pubkey it has

Ah right, yeah I need to import prior to launching as gcharang said, my bad


[20-Feb-20 01:28 AM] jl777c#5810
and verify by doing:
```./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX DEX_list 0 0 handles```


[20-Feb-20 01:28 AM] jl777c#5810
you should see your handle listed with decrypted field being the right secp pubkey

@jl777c I publish a file using node1 using

then restart it, if I run the same command again, I get
```
{

what does that mean? I thought setting sliceid = 0 or leaving it empty just publishes the file normally


[20-Feb-20 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810
the DEX_publish cant find the id?


[20-Feb-20 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810
how many packets do you have


[20-Feb-20 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810
on a fresh restart you wont have any packets at first


[20-Feb-20 02:02 AM] jl777c#5810
after a while it should sync the VIP packets


[20-Feb-20 02:03 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX_publish is using priority 0 for the actual data, otherwise streaming was a problem


[20-Feb-20 02:04 AM] jl777c#5810
let me change that a bit


[20-Feb-20 02:05 AM] gcharang#6833
> after a while it should sync the VIP packets
got it. yes. that worked as you said. after a while DEX_publish worked as usual


[20-Feb-20 02:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i changed it so DEX_publish will use the passed in priority for the data packets, if you use vip level or more, it will automatically fetch all the blocks needed to reconstruct the file


[20-Feb-20 02:07 AM] gcharang#6833
got it.
can you explain the relevant parts of the stats output
```
"perfstats": "RAM.5 69a9d000 R.5 S.0 A.5 dup.0 | L.10 A.5 coll.0 | lag (0.0000 0.0000 0.0000) err.0 pend.0 T/F 0/0 | 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0  0/sec"
```


[20-Feb-20 02:08 AM] jl777c#5810
RAM.5 -> 5 messages in RAM


[20-Feb-20 02:09 AM] jl777c#5810
69a9d000 -> "checksum" of those 5 messages


[20-Feb-20 02:09 AM] jl777c#5810
R.5 S.0 A.5 dup.0 -> Received 5 messages, Sent 0 messages, Added 5 messages, dup.0 means 0 duplicate messages received


[20-Feb-20 02:10 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no right or wrong R and S values, but ideal is if every node has roughly the same R and S values, of course it is normal that some nodes do a lot more S than R, it is based on connectivity but also a bit random based on timing and which messages your peers already have


[20-Feb-20 02:10 AM] jl777c#5810
high duplicates is bad as it is a waste of precious bandwidth


[20-Feb-20 02:11 AM] jl777c#5810
L.10 A.5 coll.0 -> this is for internal tracking, unless the coll.0 number is some big number, nothing to worry about


[20-Feb-20 02:12 AM] jl777c#5810
lag (fast window, medium window, long window) is the average lag of the most recent 1000, 10000, 100000 messages


[20-Feb-20 02:12 AM] jl777c#5810
however the lag numbers will include lag from getting packets on startup if it is within one minute, so you might see a larger number if you are getting VIP packets from other nodes


[20-Feb-20 02:13 AM] jl777c#5810
err.0 means non-VIP packets received over one minute lag

Looks like I need may need to rebuild with your newer fixes JL. 
I've imported my privkey into the DEX chain(outputs `mine=true`), I then restart and run nSPV=1, but it then outputs `mine=false` on the same address.


[20-Feb-20 02:14 AM] jl777c#5810
it is not surprising it doesnt work without the latest fixes i made yesterday


[20-Feb-20 02:14 AM] jl777c#5810
pend.0 T/F 0/0 this is quite important! pend.nnnn of over 10000 means your node is lagging


[20-Feb-20 02:15 AM] jl777c#5810
T/F this is the status of messages purged, it is first "truncated" and then freed, but both numbers should be very close to each other and constantly growing. sort of a total messages processed if you include the RAM.nnn figure


[20-Feb-20 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
the last set of numbers is the total messages in RAM by priority, rightmost is 0 priority, leftmost is all with priority >= 13, and in between corresponds to the priority


[20-Feb-20 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
of course nn/sec is the number of messages per second since the last time the message was displayed


[20-Feb-20 02:18 AM] gcharang#6833
got it.thanks. 
the output I posted is from DEX_stats's response
in the daemon output, there is 
```
1020: del.0 00000000, RAM.5 69a9d000 R.5 ....
```
what do the values before `RAM` mean?


[20-Feb-20 02:19 AM] jl777c#5810
1020 is unixtimestamp % purgetime (one hour)


[20-Feb-20 02:19 AM] jl777c#5810
del.0 means 0 messages were purged


[20-Feb-20 02:19 AM] jl777c#5810
00000000 is the checksum of the deleted messages


[20-Feb-20 02:20 AM] jl777c#5810
due to performance reasons, only the messages deleted that second are displayed and not for the entire minute,

[20-Feb-20 02:21 AM] gcharang#6833
what info does the decrypted value of the locators datablob (tagA = file_name tagB = locators) contain?
<https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/zX9rmVSdTC/>


[20-Feb-20 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the id of all the messages that contain the data for the file/slice


[20-Feb-20 02:22 AM] jl777c#5810
first 8 bytes are the offset into the file


[20-Feb-20 02:26 AM] gcharang#6833
got it. when DEX_publish is issued, it broadcasts three types of datablobs
1) tagA == files , tagB == <file_name> - 1 datablob
2)  tagA == <file_name> , tagB == locators - 1 datablob
3) many datablobs with tagA == <file_name> , tagB == data

is this correct? or any other datablobs broadcasted?


[20-Feb-20 02:29 AM] jl777c#5810
for non-stream files, that is correct


[20-Feb-20 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
for stream files it is the same concept, but instead of locators it uses tagA:filename tagB:offset


[20-Feb-20 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
the decrypted data for both forms of locators is the sha256 of the filedata


[20-Feb-20 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810
and instead of "files"/fname, it publishes "slices"/fname with volA being the offset


[20-Feb-20 02:33 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, all this is quite specific to this implementation and many other implementations are possible, it is just using tagA/tagB to keep track of the state of the publish


[20-Feb-20 02:34 AM] gcharang#6833
got it.
there is no need for any user to manually broadcast a slice correct? Example:
```
./c1 DEX_publish roadmap2020.pdf 3 4
```
4 is the sliceid


[20-Feb-20 02:35 AM] jl777c#5810
depends on the user


[20-Feb-20 02:35 AM] jl777c#5810
define what this user wants to do, if he wants to broadcast a specific slice, it seems he would need to broadcast a specific slice


[20-Feb-20 02:36 AM] jl777c#5810
but if he just wants to stream a file, just use DEX_stream instead of DEX_publish


[20-Feb-20 02:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess you could manually do what DEX_stream does with a bunch of DEX_publish and other messages


[20-Feb-20 02:38 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, that is what I meant was:
as DEX_stream exists and makes use of the DEX_publish+sliceid, is there any reason a user would want to publish a specific slice?


[20-Feb-20 02:38 AM] jl777c#5810
only for debugging


[20-Feb-20 02:39 AM] jl777c#5810
or if a specific slice got purged, but it will be very difficult to manually do all the things needed for a proper stream

I mean dexp2p not subatomic


[20-Feb-20 03:18 AM] jl777c#5810
is what?


[20-Feb-20 03:18 AM] gcharang#6833
not exactly DC++ but somewhere between DC++ and ipmsg(if you know it)


[20-Feb-20 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
dexp2p is the core implementation of decentralized tagged messaging, with e2e encryption and even anonsend that broadcasts to all nodes with only the destination being able to decrypt and find out who the sender/message was


[20-Feb-20 03:19 AM] Oszy#5734
dc++ it was a p2p file sharing before torrent came along


[20-Feb-20 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
given this, any sort of dapp can be created very quickly, like notarizer, subatomic swaps, betdapp for realtime betting


[20-Feb-20 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810

{Reactions}
üî•

fair enough, got my answer üòÑ


[20-Feb-20 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
file streaming builds on the file sharing


[20-Feb-20 03:21 AM] jl777c#5810
but dexp2p is more like a decentralized tcp/ip where you can use pubkeys to authenticate and it is all automatically indexed


[20-Feb-20 03:21 AM] jl777c#5810
but i guess it is a broadcast protocol more than anything else


[20-Feb-20 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
with built in packet prioritization and spam resistance


[20-Feb-20 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
and there is no actual blockchain needed for dexp2p, but if you want to use blockchain data for your dapp, it is very easy to do as it is built into komodod


[20-Feb-20 03:23 AM] jl777c#5810
the blockchain p2p networking is used, along with its direct peer to peer communication


[20-Feb-20 03:23 AM] jl777c#5810
on top of that, all the dexp2p protocol is built among the subset of nodes for the coin with -dexp2p set


[20-Feb-20 03:24 AM] jl777c#5810
so the question is "what can you build with a decentralized broadcast network with automatic tagged indexes?"


[20-Feb-20 03:24 AM] jl777c#5810
decentralized discord almost comes automatically


[20-Feb-20 03:24 AM] jl777c#5810
can be used as the mempool for a high tps blockchain


[20-Feb-20 03:27 AM] jl777c#5810
realtime comms layer for any blockchain based dapp


[20-Feb-20 03:28 AM] jl777c#5810
with it, combined with the existing komodo tech, it seems hard to come up with a blockchain usecase that cant be done

@TonyL Successfully swapped KMD <> PIRATE, in both roles with Subatomic GUI.


[20-Feb-20 11:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Nice that swaps worked. I've made a patch to make it a little bit more user friendly: now it loading daemons list from assetchains.json and it's possible to start/stop daemon right from app


[20-Feb-20 11:36 AM] TonyL#3577
should be helpful for manual tests

Also now app save needed for swaps "special" settings to/from file (for now using only for "special" DEX chain start)

nice work!


[20-Feb-20 11:39 AM] CHMEX#0686
the pirate os people could add that to the distribution


[20-Feb-20 11:40 AM] TonyL#3577
thanks!


[20-Feb-20 11:40 AM] CHMEX#0686
and than it's very easy to buy


[20-Feb-20 11:42 AM] TonyL#3577
oh yep, need a little bit more polishing/testing and I can prepare binary which will be possible to bundle with komodod and subatomic bins


[20-Feb-20 11:43 AM] CHMEX#0686
very nice!


[20-Feb-20 11:44 AM] CHMEX#0686
might also work on windows right? it's Python?


[20-Feb-20 11:44 AM] TonyL#3577
yep it's python - will work on all platforms


[20-Feb-20 11:44 AM] CHMEX#0686
super


[20-Feb-20 11:45 AM] TonyL#3577
for now it's like a mockup with forms and buttons and a lot of output in console - needed design, validations and etc. if use it not as testing tool


[20-Feb-20 11:49 AM] jl777c#5810
current subatomic app likely wont work on windows, it needs to be ported to use curl or something that windows has

What is the timeout on these orders? Seems as though my order timed out

1 hour


[21-Feb-20 12:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is that you would run a script that updates the prices on a regular basis

cipi had such scripts, pretty sure it is in the pins


[21-Feb-20 12:57 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Makes sense, thanks. The price will be updated constantly based on the current price I suppose


[21-Feb-20 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, no need to worry about setting a low/high price and the market changes


[21-Feb-20 12:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but for something like CHIPS that has no market you can just do:
```while true
do
<submit bid/ask>
sleep 1800
done
```


[21-Feb-20 01:02 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Thanks. Any chance you have an alice node with CHIPS on it?
I don't have another server to set one up with

Yeah I'm not sure that'd work at all for CHIPS based on it not being on any exchanges now unfortunately

no

i had broken the code during betdapp coding


[21-Feb-20 01:36 AM] jl777c#5810
so you might need to update subatomic also

git pull


[21-Feb-20 01:38 AM] jl777c#5810

yes, alice side is a one shot and it wont do the same order twice

üéâ


[21-Feb-20 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, and you can just make a shell script to issue a new order every 5 minutes or so, you will have 12 orders pending, so it can support small volume swaps


[21-Feb-20 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
you need to run two bob instances


[21-Feb-20 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so if you redirect the output into > bids.log and > asks.log you can have a file record of all the comms


[21-Feb-20 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
./subatomic KMD "" CHIPS > asks.log &
./subatomic CHIPS "" KMD > bids.log &


[21-Feb-20 01:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and probably tonys gui can be used for non-windows swaps


[21-Feb-20 01:50 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah that's awesome. It looks as though it all went through smoothly

if you wouldn't redirect your stdout, we would have a bit more prints from bob

I'm just looking at the change from the transaction, it went to a CHIPS b*** address

[21-Feb-20 02:17 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The change from my swaps with JL also created new addresses in my KMD wallet


[21-Feb-20 02:17 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, this is an issue i pointed out many times.


[21-Feb-20 02:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just using komodo-cli and chips-cli


[21-Feb-20 02:17 AM] SHossain#0007
`chips-cli getnewaddress` check what it returns


[21-Feb-20 02:18 AM] jl777c#5810

`chips-cli getnewaddress "" "legacy"`


[21-Feb-20 02:20 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I guess unless I have a merge script going, it won't use that for swaps


[21-Feb-20 02:20 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there is a way to tell the chipsd to use legacy addresses


[21-Feb-20 02:20 AM] jl777c#5810
for change


[21-Feb-20 02:23 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I will set the `-pubkey=` param on deamon start, hopefully that'll stop the change addresses changing


[21-Feb-20 02:24 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, try that. but, can't guarantee


[21-Feb-20 02:24 AM] SHossain#0007
i started all my daemons with pubkey


[21-Feb-20 02:25 AM] SHossain#0007
but, it might work.


[21-Feb-20 02:25 AM] SHossain#0007
as it worked for my KMD https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/a0632693a8da82f7439f81abba58c1445f874b9d1089948c33a8af948d1a8bd4


[21-Feb-20 02:25 AM] SHossain#0007
change went to the pubkey addr from a change addr


[21-Feb-20 02:28 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD of course it will work, i dont think CHIPS has that feature


[21-Feb-20 02:30 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So we will need to merge funds back to the original address after a trade for CHIPS


[21-Feb-20 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
why?


[21-Feb-20 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
subatomic uses the wallet, so if the funds are in the wallet it will work


[21-Feb-20 02:31 AM] jl777c#5810
no need to fund any specific address


[21-Feb-20 02:31 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, subatomic uses any address with funds from the wallet


[21-Feb-20 02:32 AM] SHossain#0007
it will create change addrs and use them when necessary


[21-Feb-20 02:32 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ah rightio. I had assumed it would use the bob pubkey address specifically


[21-Feb-20 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it lets you sell files... which have no pubkeys


[21-Feb-20 02:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm setting up my scripts, then I'll do some more trading SHossain

[21-Feb-20 02:56 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
If a swap is attempted, is there any reason I should cancel this, or should I just let it timeout?


[21-Feb-20 02:58 AM] SHossain#0007
on bob node or alice node?


[21-Feb-20 02:59 AM] SHossain#0007
if for any error on alice node it hangs or doesn't proceed you can cancel it and post the output here from both nodes


[21-Feb-20 02:59 AM] SHossain#0007
printouts helps with troubleshooting


[21-Feb-20 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
the protocol is if a swap fails, then either it means alice didnt send payment and there is nothing to do


[21-Feb-20 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
or alice sent and bob didnt, in which case he should manually send to alice


[21-Feb-20 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
in SUBATOMIC.incomplete file on alice node is the proof of payment sent


[21-Feb-20 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
bob has SUBATOMIC.proof that can easily lookup the id being traded and prove if he paid or not (just look at blockchain)


[21-Feb-20 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
bob should keep the subatomic processes running

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[21-Feb-20 03:01 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, bob loop should be running


[21-Feb-20 03:02 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Okay. But if a swap fails, the offer ID will remain active until it times out, and people may try and use that offer in the mean time without knowing


[21-Feb-20 03:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so?


[21-Feb-20 03:03 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It won't be a problem as they could just use another offer ID


[21-Feb-20 03:03 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
If I've set it up with multiple as spoken about


[21-Feb-20 03:03 AM] jl777c#5810
bob wont respond with an approved message, but will just close

{Reactions}
üëç 

[21-Feb-20 03:03 AM] jl777c#5810
and once alice starts a swap for an id, she wont do it again

{Reactions}
üç¥ 

[21-Feb-20 03:03 AM] jl777c#5810
seems there is no problem here, just have multiple active orderbook entries


[21-Feb-20 03:04 AM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind that you are doing 0 conf swaps, so are subject to reorg attacks


[21-Feb-20 03:04 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah sounds fine. I'm just trying to understand how it would flow out. Worst case somebody fails all 12 orders on purpose and nobody can order for another 5 mins (until the new next order)


[21-Feb-20 03:04 AM] jl777c#5810
limit the size of the orders so that even with back to back to back orders, the cost of doing 51% attack is more than the value of pending coins


[21-Feb-20 03:08 AM] SHossain#0007
after one hour the failed swap id will be purged


[22-Feb-20 05:01 AM] SHossain#0007
@NutellaLicka's auto scripts seems working for CHIPS orders. got few of them completed successfully


[22-Feb-20 05:05 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL @Sir Seven i havent heard reports of (m)any bugs... is that due to there being no bugs, or testing is not completed yet?

a very good result, the fastest i have seen is 10 seconds, but that was between nodes on same network

15 seconds is the typical in that setting

there are about 10 messages back and forth, so 20 seconds means 2 seconds per message

I first had thought of localbitcoins.com design style, then I came across coinswitch, so this is inspired from there

does anyone know how to get BCH compiled from sourcecode?


[22-Feb-20 06:11 AM] SHossain#0007
i want to test KMD <> BCH


[22-Feb-20 06:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
must have some guides on bitcoin.com


[22-Feb-20 06:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
they have a forum too


[22-Feb-20 06:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or reddit


[22-Feb-20 06:12 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks. will keep looking


[22-Feb-20 06:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
should be the same as BTC, no?


[22-Feb-20 06:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yea, I thought so too


[22-Feb-20 06:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
is this the BCH repo ?
https://github.com/Bitcoin-ABC/bitcoin-abc


[22-Feb-20 06:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if so, I think it must compile like bitcoin-core @SHossain


[22-Feb-20 06:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, it's BCH

[24-Feb-20 08:02 AM] CHMEX#0686
Would it be a good idea to Whitelist the DEX fee address and maybe the Burn address for private only chains in the next hardfork? With that alice would be able to pay the DEX fee and people would be able to reduce the supply.


[24-Feb-20 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe burn address is good, but cant do DEX swap with zaddr


[24-Feb-20 08:12 AM] CHMEX#0686
So an alice selling PIRATE for anycoin will not have to pay any fee?


[24-Feb-20 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i am leaning toward subatomic being the free side of a fremium subatomic/atomic


[24-Feb-20 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
get people into the process with subatomic, but when they need to go bigger, they need to use atomic


[24-Feb-20 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
for PIRATE, since atomic wont be practical, this means PIRATE trades without anything but txfee

that's a nice strategy to think actually ü§î

why white list burn address?


[24-Feb-20 01:21 PM] CHMEX#0686
To burn funds maybe some project wants to buy back funds and reduce the supply.

no "got open request" on bob nodes?

let me get PIRATE daemons ready and do a swap

it is bit strange to be honest, since bob responded last night with same setup

i wonder what changed in my nodes


[25-Feb-20 05:01 AM] CrisF#3405
I really would like to help with this but tied up with something right now.  Could you please ping me when the BCH works üôè  (I'll check too)
If subatomic could work with SLP tokens (BCH) and I have something to show it would be **very** useful.

[25-Feb-20 05:05 AM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c i think its kinda connectivity issue or something like that

[25-Feb-20 05:14 AM] SHossain#0007
if you have PIRATE and KMD daemon ready, can you please try this swap? `./subatomic KMD "" 3542127584 0.01`


[25-Feb-20 05:15 AM] jl777c#5810
try it using a dedicated -dexp2p chain


[25-Feb-20 05:15 AM] jl777c#5810
to remove the connectivity issue, at least reduce it a lot


[25-Feb-20 05:16 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. will try that now


[25-Feb-20 05:35 AM] SHossain#0007
it's same with dedicated dexp2p chain


[25-Feb-20 05:38 AM] SHossain#0007
i wonder if my alice node has any issue

oh...wait

it's working with PIRATE now

yes, that's the invalid address message

[25-Feb-20 08:33 PM] Sir Seven#7158
Can't properly test token swaps.
1. Trying to swap token for coins / pay with token for files:
Using test tokens on MORTY chain.

added in subatomic.json
`{"MORTY.forswap":"9161e606a61e8352cc0e0283d61aa9c20d5bd00de0790f0cffdbc3090f143c58"}`

./subatomic MORTY.forswap "" <orderid> <amount>
`Error reading configuration file: Missing komodo.conf`
Also creates ~/.komodo/MORTY.forswap directory, looks like daemon incorrectly parses "COIN.tagB" or I'm missing something here.

2. Trying to swap COIN/zCOIN for token:
Problem happens on `tokentransfer` rpc.
When tying to send rawtransaction komodo daemon with like ~50% chanse crashes. During subatomic loop - crashes when Bob got Alice payment and should send tokens. Tokentransfer example and backtraces: https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/CGHNVmBrqS/


[25-Feb-20 09:16 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'm getting an error of 
```./bid.sh: fork: retry: Resource temporarily unavailable
/bin/sh: 1: Cannot fork```
Anybody seen these?


[25-Feb-20 09:19 PM] TonyL#3577
@NutellaLicka Do you have free RAM/swap? Also maybe you run out of max amount of started processes.
It looks like OS rather than subatomic problem


[25-Feb-20 09:19 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ah thank you! Yeah it seems I have an issue.


[26-Feb-20 12:26 AM] SHossain#0007
@Sir Seven for tokens you don't need data dir like `~/.komodo/MORTY.forswap`. tokens uses parent data dir which would be `~/.komodo/MORTY/`


[26-Feb-20 12:44 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a new bug after we got tokens working?


[26-Feb-20 12:50 AM] SHossain#0007
i saw same missing conf file message for BCH `Error reading configuration file: Missing komodo.conf`
then, i realised i didn't have the line for BCH in the subatomic.json


[26-Feb-20 12:50 AM] SHossain#0007
adding that line to the json file solved the issue for me


[26-Feb-20 12:50 AM] SHossain#0007
but, for token bid, it could be a bug


[26-Feb-20 12:57 AM] jl777c#5810
plz retest tokens


[26-Feb-20 12:59 AM] SHossain#0007
sure. will do

Looks like the problem reported initially there: https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/676136067262447633/682082752673480733


[29-Feb-20 05:48 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, i reproduced that


[29-Feb-20 05:49 AM] SHossain#0007
`Error reading configuration file: Missing komodo.conf` since `ask` also shows this and swap completes despite of the messages. it could be the satoshi balance for tokens what is making issue for the `bid` orders


[29-Feb-20 05:49 AM] SHossain#0007
`not enough balance RICK.demo 0.00000000 for 0.00000001`


[29-Feb-20 05:49 AM] SHossain#0007
that's just my guess.


[29-Feb-20 05:52 AM] SHossain#0007
while alice node creates `RICK.demo` data dir inside `.komodo` dir bob node doesn't


[29-Feb-20 06:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so both directions shows the error message, but ask direction works and bid direction doesnt?


[29-Feb-20 06:36 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, you are right


[29-Feb-20 06:51 AM] SHossain#0007
another small thing is alice node creating `RICK.demo` data dir while bob is not doing that


[29-Feb-20 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
the side that is sending the RICK.demo or receiving the RICK.demo is doing this?


[29-Feb-20 07:03 AM] SHossain#0007
let me check re-check on this


[29-Feb-20 07:05 AM] SHossain#0007
alice creates RICK.demo dir while filling up ask from bob


[29-Feb-20 07:06 AM] SHossain#0007
she is receiving the RICK.demo tokens


[29-Feb-20 07:06 AM] SHossain#0007
so, receiving side creates this


[29-Feb-20 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, will look at this later


[29-Feb-20 07:23 AM] SHossain#0007

setting up ZEC for subatomic testing


[01-Mar-20 10:14 AM] SHossain#0007
just only worried about the address format since they use `t`
but, zZEC should work

yes, anything that isnt Raddr wont work for now

a z-ZEC address to z-PIRATE subatomic will be so cool! :shexy:


[01-Mar-20 11:24 AM] SHossain#0007
yep. that's what i'm aiming for. zZEC <> PRIATE and KMD


[01-Mar-20 11:25 AM] SHossain#0007
since KMD R addresses already works and zs addresses for zCOIN, this should be working

I need to update my kmdgo package with new DEX_ API calls, and once that's done, I'll be able to continue with subatomic go web app.
already coded the coins details to load from API on it's dashboard.

CC @jl777c


[01-Mar-20 11:30 AM] CrisF#3405
I guess it wouldn't be any different than doing inter-coin z-txs.


[01-Mar-20 11:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Technically I think it will increase anonymity set ü§î


[01-Mar-20 11:31 AM] SHossain#0007
@CrisF if i'm correct, that should increase anonset on both sides. but, James is the best person to answer that


[01-Mar-20 11:31 AM] SHossain#0007
the more ztx on a chain, the more anonset


[01-Mar-20 11:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
didn't actually came that fact to my mind until Cris raised the question :abusedsmily: üòÉ


[01-Mar-20 11:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
That's a really amazing thing to consider for subatomic swaps


[01-Mar-20 11:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
a _**collective anonymity set**_ is huge factor and feature for subatomic swaps


[01-Mar-20 11:33 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, this was talked about in few places as i remember


[01-Mar-20 11:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that means ANY and ALL zk-SNARKs based blockchain will be sharing their anonymity set with each other.


[01-Mar-20 11:33 AM] SHossain#0007
PIRATE will benefit from this at a great scale


[01-Mar-20 11:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
true


[01-Mar-20 11:35 AM] CrisF#3405

üíØ 

[01-Mar-20 11:36 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, that is also true

A JUMBLR bot doing cross-coin trades would be interesting.

true üôÇ


[01-Mar-20 11:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
JUMBLR concentrated to PIRATE will also increase the value of PIRATE more.


[01-Mar-20 11:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Would other z-coins not need to go all Z-tx if this helped the anonset?


[01-Mar-20 11:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the lowest anonset coin Zcash will benefit from this tech indeed


[01-Mar-20 11:39 AM] CrisF#3405
I've been interested in how to implement JUMBLR again for a while.


[01-Mar-20 11:39 AM] CrisF#3405
HUSH too.


[01-Mar-20 11:39 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
as there'll be way from transacting value from in and out of something with more anon set coins in the ecosystem


[01-Mar-20 11:40 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
ALL zk-SNARKs family coins!


[01-Mar-20 11:49 AM] SHossain#0007
any coin that is public only, can swap with PIRATE and get bit of anonymity

the specific zaddr has funds. will send to taddr too


[02-Mar-20 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i added support for non-KMD coins to do taddr with a new -recvTaddr= parameter you can add to the -dexp2p chain launching. just put the address you want to trade from there, it doesnt have to correspond to the -pubkey=, but it needs to be in your wallet


[02-Mar-20 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
this should allow trading with BCH and ZEC

thanks @Nabob | $ARRR . the subatomic loop for bob example are here https://gist.github.com/himu007/add3181427bb53ab5dc5160537f0c238#start-the-subatomic-loop-in-bob-node


[03-Mar-20 03:49 AM] SHossain#0007
and the swap for alice here https://gist.github.com/himu007/add3181427bb53ab5dc5160537f0c238#start-the-subatomic-swaps


[03-Mar-20 03:49 AM] SHossain#0007
i'll add some more info to help make it easy to understand then


[03-Mar-20 03:50 AM] SHossain#0007
since bob nodes will be limited and approved, bob section is separate in the guide. same for alice


[03-Mar-20 03:50 AM] SHossain#0007
anyone can be alice


[03-Mar-20 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
the GUI will need to display whether a bob is registered or not


[03-Mar-20 04:19 AM] TonyL#3577
I can add some "verified" badge to the orders in POC if needed
should I match pubkey in order with keys from this file https://github.com/jl777/komodo/blob/DEX/src/cc/dapps/subatomic.json ?

```
what does its payload contain and what is stored in amountA and amountB ?


[09-Mar-20 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
each slice is 1MB, that requires 100x the 10000 byte data packet


[09-Mar-20 07:14 AM] jl777c#5810
that plus the two "directory" packets


[09-Mar-20 07:16 AM] gcharang#6833
ok, the datablob I posted is similar to the "files" datablob and its payload is the hash of the slice
and the other "directory" packet is like the "locators" datablob and contains all the ids of the datablobs that contain the actual data 
correct?
@jl777c


[09-Mar-20 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it is virtually the same as the normal file publish


[09-Mar-20 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
it just automatically publishes each slice as a separate "file"


[09-Mar-20 07:17 AM] gcharang#6833
got it


[09-Mar-20 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
amountB is therefore 100 sats for most of them


[09-Mar-20 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
amountA should be the starting offset of the slice

like `C:\Users\satinder\dexp2p` ?

@grewalsatinder 
not exactly. it first searches the location from which the komodo daemon was launched.
Example:
if you do something like
```
satinder@ubuntu:~/go/src/github.com/satindergrewal/kmdgo/examples/dex$~/komodo/src/komodod -ac_name=........
```
then the file will be searched first in `~/go/src/github.com/satindergrewal/kmdgo/examples/dex`

[12-Apr-20 02:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
just trying to note my steps to do the following:
1. Get orderbook - DEX_orderbook
2. Get `pubkey` - from asks/bids output from DEX_orderbook's output
3. Match `pubkey` from the orderbook with any `pubkey` in `subatomic.json`, and get it's associated `handle`
4. Process this information and send this processed info to my GUI app that I'm working on.


[12-Apr-20 02:59 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but in this matching steps, I realised the pubkey in orderbook and pubkey in subatomic.json is different.
I need help on any step in between which I need to do to match and get the conditional answers that I'm looking for üôÇ

[12-Apr-20 04:40 AM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder all handles for bob nodes are registered with both pubkeys, so do a DEXlist for handles and you can see how to map from 03 pubkey to 01 pubkey


[12-Apr-20 04:40 AM] jl777c#5810
of course if the node isnt running, it wont register it


[12-Apr-20 05:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Ok @jl777c üëçüëå
Will test next time sit on computer
Can you also plz help with DEX_list's handle command? üôÇ


[12-Apr-20 06:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I tried DEX_list for handles command just with assumption without knowing it's format

the other command is to show orders for specified coin

does the `handles` command show all bob/alices on the network broadcasting whatever order pairs?


[13-Apr-20 04:14 AM] SHossain#0007
`handles` should show all

if it shows all broadcasters it can see on the network, I guess it's what I'm looking for üôÇ


[13-Apr-20 04:16 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
to link the orderbook's pubkey to it's handle I'll -
- first need to issue this handles command
- get the data set of pubkey, decrypted pubkey, handle
- store this in temp dataset in memory for later use
- do orderbook command to get orders list
- match the senderpubkey with the data stored in the memory and show appropriate handles and push the processed data to the GUI

[13-Apr-20 04:19 AM] SHossain#0007
when subatomic development is finished, you will only have certain set of hardcoded pubkeys which are trusted. so, that can make GUI process easier as those wont change unless there is a request for change.


[13-Apr-20 04:19 AM] SHossain#0007
currently we are not using are final pubkeys for the subatomic


[13-Apr-20 04:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, aware of that part


[13-Apr-20 04:19 AM] SHossain#0007
PIRATE <> KMD orderbook entries will be visible


[13-Apr-20 04:20 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but other pubkeys and unregistered handles can still show up in the DEX_list, as I remember by convo with @jl777c


[13-Apr-20 04:20 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, those will also be visible


[13-Apr-20 04:20 AM] SHossain#0007
maybe GUI can use verified/trusted sign on the hardcoded ones


[13-Apr-20 04:21 AM] SHossain#0007

mostly depends on how many chains you will run. 8GB RAM (16GB recommended), 2-core CPU (4 core recommended), 40GB SSD (80GB/120GB recommended depending on your chain database size)


[13-Apr-20 06:05 AM] SHossain#0007

Will read more and see what to set up.


[13-Apr-20 09:54 AM] Regnar#6164
In the DEX-pro it might make sense to use subatomic swaps for trades below some arbitrary value. This would make smaller swaps instant, but larger value swaps would be performed with atomic swaps. This could be a feature added to the DEX GUI and not necessary change too much of the underlying code (I don't think) though it would have to be able to parse two separate orderbooks, one of atomic swaps, and another of subatomic, which might be difficult.


[13-Apr-20 09:56 AM] Regnar#6164
or if someone places an order below that value, the DEX could automatically post it as a subatomic trade, and if people try to purchase below a value amount it fulfills a subatomic trade. This way there wouldn't really be atomic swaps for pennies (or less than the needed tx fees) on the orderbook that traders try and fill with subatomic swaps.


[13-Apr-20 09:59 AM] Regnar#6164
Another option would be to treat subatomic swaps as an added on feature, in which holding KMD gives you access to. This would again likely be arbitrary and done at the GUI level since I don't believe KMD is actually needed for the subatomic swaps. It simply "Ungrays" a button in the DEX-pro GUI that performs subatomic or "Instant swaps"

[13-Apr-20 10:01 AM] Regnar#6164
This could have a pretty cool added benefit of giving some more value to KMD, and if the minimum amount of KMD they hold is above 10, they receive rewards as well. Could almost treat it as a double benefit for holding KMD. `"If you hold N amount of KMD in your AtomicDEX-Pro address, you have access to instant swaps, and will be able to claim 5.1% KMD rewards on your balance"`

Though I'm pretty sure subatomic only works with full nodes right now, but it is an interesting thought if nSPV support comes along for subatomic. Also adding subatomic pirate swaps with their lite wallet. Now I'm speaking above my knowledge base though üòÖ


[13-Apr-20 10:07 AM] CrisF#3405
Really like the idea of the addon feature!


[13-Apr-20 10:10 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea I generally agree that underlying functions shouldn't rely on KMD, because substitutes would simply come and replace Komodo in general. So add on features that are KMD powered are a good way of driving some value to KMD. You don't NEED it to trade so it is harder for substitutes to justify replacement, but it's a nice to have that some traders will take up.


[13-Apr-20 10:11 AM] SHossain#0007
`2 core 4gb server`
@CrisF this might be very low spec for subatomic swaps


[13-Apr-20 10:11 AM] SHossain#0007

[13-Apr-20 10:11 AM] Regnar#6164
also, knowing that substitutes may try to replace products that rely too heavily on a coin might work out for us as well as substitutes could fork AtomicDEX-pro, remove the KMD feature and revamp it as something else to a new audience. only furthering the liquidity pool for the more liquid pairs (KMD)


[13-Apr-20 10:14 AM] Regnar#6164
So having the ability to for "substitutes" to create competitive products that are in fact, not competition but are complimentary because they still use the underlying code and liquidity, is a plus. If KMD was required at the blockchain level to be used, then the "Substitute" products would actually be substitutes and replace Komodo


[13-Apr-20 10:26 AM] CrisF#3405
I'll set up another node too.


[13-Apr-20 12:25 PM] Regnar#6164
Another idea to drive value to KMD for AtomicDEX-Pro would be to also build in Netcoins or Bitpanda into the app as a fiat on ramp, so people can buy KMD directly with debit or credit cards. Having only KMD on ramp might give more liquidity to KMD pairs and run affiliate programs to generate some revenue that can go towards Komodo development costs etc.

[14-Apr-20 04:36 AM] gcharang#6833
AtomicDEX-pro is using SPV. thats because AtomicDEX-api is using SPV 
AtomicDEX-pro is a GUI interface for AtomicDEX-api(mm2)  with convenience features added


[14-Apr-20 04:50 AM] Regnar#6164
Got it, thanks.


[14-Apr-20 05:01 AM] Regnar#6164
Maybe I'll make a community poll in Telegram to see what things people are looking for in a desktop DEX.


[14-Apr-20 05:08 AM] Regnar#6164
Just some ideas (not saying we should try and add them all):
```candlestick charts (hard to do with low volume), 
orderbook volume graphs, 
instant swaps, 
order types (stop loss, limit, market), 
fiat on ramp (off ramp?), 
hardware wallet support (either for trading or just claiming?), 
trollboxes (are these still used/wanted?), 
API Key to Centralized exchanges, 
Market maker bot (with constant percent discount/premium adjustment), 
algorithm trading bots (helped beta test this a couple years ago <https://margin.de/>),
Newsfeeds,
Portfolio view (total value of portfolio),
Previous trades with Fiat values and dates exportable as CSV (For investors filing tax info),
Maybe a "trade competition" function, where users can broadcast their most profitable completed trades for N time period```


[14-Apr-20 05:11 AM] Regnar#6164
I think for low hanging fruit, the exporting trade history as CSV would be easiest haha


[14-Apr-20 05:17 AM] gcharang#6833
all good features to have @Regnar 
> candlestick charts (hard to do with low volume), orderbook volume graphs, order types (stop loss, limit, market), Newsfeeds,
> Portfolio view (total value of portfolio),
> Previous trades with Fiat values and dates exportable as CSV (For investors filing tax info)
> fiat on ramp (off ramp?), 
these will come in the near future I think

the rest, depends 
> instant swaps, 
if similar to 0-conf of barterdex, then it needs to come from mm2 else with subatomic

> trollboxes (are these still used/wanted?), 
should be possible with dexp2p

I think the features that come from dexp2p(subatomic/troll box) are going to come after that, if mm2 starts using dexp2p orderbooks
 
> API Key to Centralized exchanges, 
> Market maker bot (with constant percent discount/premium adjustment), 
> algorithm trading bots (helped beta test this a couple years ago <https://margin.de/>),
I think the current plan is to have a seperate app for that, but not 100% sure

> hardware wallet support (either for trading or just claiming?), 
for trading, the support needs to come from mm2 and I don't think it is a priority right now


[14-Apr-20 05:25 AM] Regnar#6164
another thought (and definitely a heavier lift) what about having the ability to install add-ons. I know it could be risking if people make bad ones, but it might open up more developer communities if people can download skins and themes (either by us, or 3rd parties) so they can change the look of the app (Exodus wallet I think still has multiple skins to choose from and it adds a flair of customization). But also add-ons like chrome extensions. could be things like trading bots, or "Watch only addresses" features, or any other little tweak people think the app needs but isn't in the pipeline for development

i don't think we need that image anymore as this just works much much better than early barterDEX days when we needed multiple utxos in different sizes


[23-Apr-20 06:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
true


[23-Apr-20 06:53 AM] SHossain#0007
btw, i guess as an enhancement, you can print the time when a swap starts and finishes and total time it took


[23-Apr-20 06:54 AM] SHossain#0007
it would be interesting to see


[23-Apr-20 06:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
try multiple swaps at the same time, by initialising them from different tabs or window of browser.


[23-Apr-20 06:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
in my test I did 2 - 3 simultaneous swaps with GUI and they worked perfectly fine


[23-Apr-20 06:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll code storing this log to a file tomorrow


[23-Apr-20 06:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and processing this log


[23-Apr-20 06:55 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks. no rush on that. just a wishlist :)
i did test simultaneous swaps with CLI. will try with the GUI too


[23-Apr-20 06:57 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

since it's in go code, it also must be faster than node.js based apps

[24-Apr-20 03:04 AM] SHossain#0007
there are times when a swap will not continue when the swap was already initiated and didn't continue. after that the ID will expire and will not continue with any swap.


[24-Apr-20 04:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
subatomic GUI looks pretty awesome!


[24-Apr-20 04:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain yes, it happened to me 2 - 3 times


[24-Apr-20 04:44 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I then cancel the go process (for now) and then it ends the subatomic command process


[24-Apr-20 04:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll put timeout in my go's command execution code


[24-Apr-20 04:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so if it doesn't continue for like 1.5 minutes, just end the process


[24-Apr-20 04:45 AM] SHossain#0007
there would be a `SUBATOMIC.incomplete` file inside src dir which includes more info


[24-Apr-20 04:45 AM] SHossain#0007
inside `~/komodo/src/` dir

hmm... okay, that's nice to know, coz I was losing that log unable to store it to the log file

if you have viewing key in HUSH3, it's fully supported

i already tested HUSH3 and that worked fine

my gist have the swap proofs


[24-Apr-20 06:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain since Hush is going full z2z, that means we must turn AtomicDEX off, so that means Subatomic z2z can be a replacement. Mostly we want to help make it usable for actual users, who already use AtomicDEX on mobile/etc


[24-Apr-20 06:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
it seems like the new subatomic GUI has come a long way to make it usable by "mere mortals" üôÇ


[24-Apr-20 06:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain our new gui wallet even supports exporting viewkeys now, so i guess that helps


[24-Apr-20 06:43 AM] SHossain#0007
we didn't find many critical bugs. you can help testing if you like. just need to setup a bob node and an alice node with the coin pair you want to test. only R address and zs addresses are currently supported. so, other BTC based coins with different address format will not work until the support for that is coded. 
my testing guide is here https://gist.github.com/himu007/add3181427bb53ab5dc5160537f0c238


[24-Apr-20 06:45 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, the GUI came a long way. for the last few weeks it went under development behind the scenes until enough was coded which works üôÇ


[24-Apr-20 06:47 AM] SHossain#0007
as long as you have viewing key in the daemon, z addrs are fully supported


[24-Apr-20 06:55 AM] SHossain#0007
there could still be bugs that we couldn't find.


[24-Apr-20 07:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain Hush is most interested in doing z2z swaps with Hush itself, and Pirate and any other zaddr coins that are supported. Hush is going full z2z (like pirate) in november, so we don't care about swapping with taddrs üôÇ


[24-Apr-20 07:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
we purely care about z2z subatomic swaps


[24-Apr-20 07:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain now that there is a desktop UI, what are the plans for a mobile GUI to subatomic swaps? That is what can "replace" the atomicdex mobile app in the minds of users. Will atomicdex app itself learn to subatomic swap? Or a new dedicated app?

[24-Apr-20 07:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
We go z2z in November, and we have to turn off AtomicDEX support for HUSH, no matter what. So we are looking at z2z subatomic swaps as a replacement for that


[24-Apr-20 07:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's not clear if subatomic features will go directly into the atomicdex mobile app


[24-Apr-20 07:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
but to users, that probably makes the most sense


[24-Apr-20 07:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain i will post your gist in Hush dev channel and see if we can get some people playing with it. I have been told I can only work on z2z transition or hushchat stuff üôÇ

@SHossain there is no nspv for zaddrs


[24-Apr-20 07:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain it seems that we could do a mobile gui if we have an rpc connection to a full node, such as in the Hush android wallet


[24-Apr-20 07:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
need to figure out how that talks to DEX, i guess it can use nspv to talk to DEX, but not Pirate or Hush


[24-Apr-20 07:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
but if you are running the Hush android app (which connects to a full node, it's not a lite wallet), then we a local Hush full node to do things with


[24-Apr-20 07:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
a subatomic GUI could be put into the Hush desktop wallet too, it seems


[24-Apr-20 07:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
it could use nspv to talk to DEX very efficiently and we already have a hush full node. what i don't know, is if we also need a full node for the other side, i.e. if we are doing a z2z swap HUSH<>Pirate, do I also need a Pirate full node, as Alice sending to Bob? Or can I get by with just inspecting DEX and Hush chains?


[24-Apr-20 07:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
@cipi might have some interesting ideas on this, it's breaking/bending some rules but we could have something here

You need to communicate with nodes via p2p protocol. I don‚Äôt think ‚ÄúnSPV support‚Äù really makes sense in this context


[24-Apr-20 07:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
what i am asking is this


[24-Apr-20 07:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
If i want to do z2z swap with Hush<>Pirate


[24-Apr-20 07:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
and I have nspv connection to DEX and full node RPC connection to HUSH, is that enough?


[24-Apr-20 07:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
Or do I also need a Pirate full node to see if the swap worked?


[24-Apr-20 07:29 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, that is enough


[24-Apr-20 07:29 AM] dukeleto#7326

i didn't test nodes with RPC connection only


[24-Apr-20 07:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
how can we be sure stuff happened on pirate chain, is there a way for Bob to scam us?


[24-Apr-20 07:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is what I am thinking, we maybe need pirate full node to verify something


[24-Apr-20 07:30 AM] SHossain#0007
all my testings were done with native chains. DEX chain itself can use nSPV without downloading database

`how can we be sure stuff happened on pirate chain, is there a way for Bob to scam us?`

subatomic is designed the way to be ok with "scams" in most of the cases

huge swap splitting onto small parts (like a 100$ value transfer to 100 1$ payments) - when you starting subatomic swap you're kinda accepting a risk of 1 payment losing in most of the cases. However some trusted/verified pubkeys badges are also possible to have

@cipi BUT, i bet we can use lightwalletd (like electrum for zaddrs) to maybe get around that


[24-Apr-20 07:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
we can likely get away with "listening" via lightwalletd, to see if the other side got stuff


[24-Apr-20 07:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
@cipi exactly which RPCs are needed by Alice to verify things on the Bob chain?


[24-Apr-20 07:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
sounds like we need to use a zaddr viewkey to make sure a tx arrived on the Pirate (bob) chain


[24-Apr-20 07:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
and we can do that via lightwalletd


[24-Apr-20 07:49 AM] cipi#4502
i haven't looked into the code, but i guess that getting information about a tx should be enough


[24-Apr-20 07:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
we can also send out funds via lightwalletd, i guess that is needed too

Answer to Wallet functionality in Subatomic Go app, in a conversation from Pirate discord:

>@mrlynch 
> maybe grewal can bundle komodod within the web server app (? i'm assuming it's running a local web srv) and have an extra tab to run coins
> commands can be issued to komodod via curl requests inside the app to stop the daemons upon exit

I'll not be re-making the wallets functionality which is already out there by others.
instead I'd request the wallets out there to have the ability to add extra parameters for DEX blockchain to make it connect to DEXP2P network.
I did go to making a wallet route when I first started EasyDEX project with Komodo in 2016.
That gave birth to Iguana Wallet which later evolved to Agama Wallet.
I had to go to that route in 2016, as there was no useful wallet back then.
Now there are enough Native wallets in my opinion.
for Alice side, I'll not be making wallets management functionality, at least for now.
but when I'll reach Bob's side of Subatomic Go app, which has to be solely web based app, then it makes sense to have wallet management functionality.
Will do when required, until then I need to focus only on Alice's side of Subatomic operations.

Hello smart people. 
I find the idea of subatomic swaps fascinating, but I'm wondering how the future outline for subatomic swaps and atomic swaps look like as, as far as I see, they tackle the same problem and have the same goal: allow (almost) trustless p2p/otc trades. 
Will they both coexist next to each other? Are the differences significant enough to justify the existence of both techs (considering split userbase etc.)? If so, what exactly are meaningful differences?
Two examples I see (correct me if I'm wrong), is that subatomic swaps allow partial filling of orders while atomic swaps do not, and atomic swaps are trustless while subatomic swaps are "only" heavily trust-reduced/risk-reduced.
Are there maybe differences regarding performance, simplicity of the tech, UX or regarding the potential amount of supported coins/protocols?

> Will they both coexist next to each other? Are the differences significant enough to justify the existence of both techs (considering split userbase etc.)? If so, what exactly are meaningful differences?

Yes, as per current protocol developments, both protocols can co-exist without any issue for long term. I beleive these both protocols, DEXP2P and MarketMaker version 2 (mm2) will both complement each other.

Subatomic swaps are originated after DEXP2P tech development done on Komodo's core daemon. The need for DEXP2P arised out of the necessasity, where MarketMaker v2 need more scalable and fastter messaging layer to communicate between it's network to negotiate and connect to trading parties who wants to trade a pair of coin, and every other node who wants to know what are the orders other nodes in the network are offering so they can initiate an trade with each other.

With MarketMaker I believe the messaging portocol was based on torrent, whereas in Komodo this messaging is built using libevent library.
Basically there are two different methods of communicating of computers over the connected network. torrent's method been good, but James found bitcoin's own code using libevent for communication is much superior and he worked more than a month on it to port that libevent based communication layer to create a new communication network. From around december 2019 to January 2020, he worked on creating, testing, improving DEXP2P technology, which basically starts a peer-to-peer network with just adding a parameter `-dexp2p=2` to an Antara Smart chain.


[26-Apr-20 02:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
From January 2020 onwards once this DEXP2P network layer creation technology solidified, James push this techonology to it's limit and test it further to make sure it can handle huge loads of network trafic in case it is used for AtomicDEX protocol's network, messaging and communication layer, where in a scenaior millions of users maight be using AtomicDEX protocol to make decentralised trading.

This testing from January 2020 to February 2020 gave us further advancements to DEXP2P where it was even possible to transmit live video feed over this peer-to-peer ntwork of equally high resolution and high-bandwidth rate as equally you see over YouTube or everywhere else with 1080p to 4k resolution video. Gigabytes of data can be transfered and over DEXP2P's broadcasting API calls to the subsribing users over a P2P network, on it's full capacity this load is divided between all nodes and every subscribing node is ensured to recieve the data even if they join the streaming video later. And this data is available to recieve by the participating nodes for aproximately an hour or so.

The testing of video streaming over DEXP2P made communication layer p2p network showcased how strong, tougher, resilient, scalable DEXP2P technology is, which as of today's date I guess no other peer-to-peer network is providing such functionality or feature.


[26-Apr-20 02:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The sole purpose of DEXP2P is to just create a sub-network of it's own just for communication between participating nodes.
It is not necessary to have this DEXP2P be connected with a blockchain or a cryptocurrency, but it is indeed possible to make the network communication work in a way that this communication messaging over DEXP2P can be used for wider spectrum of cases.

For example, it is possible to broadcast set of files over DEXP2P network over Subatomic configuration, for a set price. The Bob nodes can define these set of files with the price they are accepting to broadcast these files to the Alice nodes when accepting the negotiated price. This means the Subatomic CryptoConditions DApp already allows selling files over peer-to-peer network for a currency which is defined in "subatomic.json" settings by Bob nodes. And these files can be defined to be sold in multiple currencies at once.

So, all the above must clear to you the reasons:
- WHY DEXP2P came to exists: For faster, scalable communication medium for Marketmaker v2.
- WHAT it can do: With default set of messaging format, it can be used more than just a communication medium and be used for creating different level of P2P apps with a mesh of other existing CryptoConditions based DApps and/or creating an one for special purposes with specific usecase based on ideas an innovaitons from community developers.
- And WHAT it is capable of.


[26-Apr-20 02:58 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The differences if still not clearer, Subatomic is a DApp based on DEXP2P technology.
And AtomicDEX is an independent set of protocol with indepdendent codebase written in Rust language providing an API serving daemon called "MarketMaker" (mm2).

The Subatomic CryptoConditions DApp avoids blockchain based messaging and communication to negotiate, and instead uses DEXP2P based communication, resulting in a lot faster negotation between to trading parties. As a result this we get the following:

- Possible to trade micro transactions.
- Super Fast communication between trading nodes resulting very very fast trades.
- The trust factor moves from blockchain side communication to subatomic's protocol where you can trust and distrust the trader on network by identifing it with it's `pubkey` linked with the trades.
- Subatomic is ideally useful for small trades only. Example if you want to to trade $100, you must use small portion of the trades of this $100 on Subatomic swaps, since these are faster, and in any case the other party does not fullfil the other rest of the trades, you won't lose much of your capital in these trades. As of now it allows all these trades not simultaniously with any API, but this can be similated if you execute subatomic trades command yourself in multiple terminal tabs/windows. So, this feature can be customisably coded in GUI by the GUI developers.

On the other hand AtomicDEX gives the following:
- Allows trustless trades in all of it's process
- Allows big volume trades on all supported cryptocurrencies if offers to support (almost 99% of current market cryptocurrencies)

You can expect that some point in future AtomicDEX will adopt the DEXP2P networking layer to make even more slidified peer-to-peer communication in it's network, and that will help scaling AtomicDEX far byeond what it already can support scaling it.

> Will they both coexist next to each other? Are the differences significant enough to justify the existence of both techs (considering split userbase etc.)? If so, what exactly are meaningful differences?

Yes, as I see they will coexist to each other. Subatomic DApp based on DEXP2P technology itself creates another level of micro-transactions based swaps on this network which can swap new set of GUIs based on this DApp's API. And that's exactly what I'm trying to cover.

Because Subatomic relies for communication and negotiation based on DEXP2P instead of some parts of it being negotiated via blockchain it allows to trade with ANY bitcoin compatible blockchain. This has also allowed making a subatomic swap of Shielded transactions only blockchain (zk-SNARKS) with transparent transactions blockchain, like PIRATE and KMD. We have also tested pure PIRATE to PIRATE trades over the network as well. That means any blockchain over the network can also do trades purely between Shielded addresses, like for example PIRATE's shielded Address funds being traded with Veruscoin's shielded address funds. This means ANY zk-SNARK family blockchain can trade their funds with each other in pure shielded transaction zone. That is superb feature of Subatomic CryptoConditions DApp.


[26-Apr-20 03:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
But note that to allow trading of shielded addresses with other shielded address over the network that blockchain must have `zviewingkey` API coded in it. If I'm not mistaken with the required API. I guess it is some other API, may be @SHossain  can correct me with that API reference.

This must clear the main differences what Subatomic swaps can do, what AtomicDEX swaps so far can't do. Also must be clear how much the trust factor there is in Subatomic swaps vs the AtomicDEX's atomic swaps which are 100% trust-less, whereas with Subatomic swaps there is some level of trust which can be mitigated with only doing small trades or bigger ones based on the trust you put in specific known or unknown `pubkeys`.


[26-Apr-20 03:23 AM] SHossain#0007
Verus needs to implement zviewingkey for their shielded addresses to be working fine with subatomic. Until they do, ztx for Verus on subatomic is not fully supported. Transparent addresses works just fine.

> and atomic swaps are trust-less while subatomic swaps are "only" heavily trust-reduced/risk-reduced.

Yes, atomic swaps with AtomicDEX are 100% trust-less, but there is only a variable degree of trust with Subatomic swaps. The known `pubkeys` shows the known traders on the network with whom you can possibly put more trust and initiate bigger volume trade orders, based on your own discretion. And over time you can also note specific unknown set of `pubkeys` which you trust and add to your own list of trusted `pubkeys` which you can possibly trade variant of trade volumes. I see this exactly setup in a way where on LocalBitcoin.com I would add some traders on my trusted list after doing several trades of different volumes and remembering who to approach in case I later need to do large volume trades. In this case Subatomic swaps with Subatomic App work like an escrow free trades where Subatomic App performs the role of escrow doing subatomic swaps of set pair of coins.

> Are there maybe differences regarding performance, simplicity of the tech, UX or regarding the potential amount of supported coins/protocols?

the backend API for both MarketMaker v2 (mm2) and Subatomic DApp are different. Both has their own varience of differences, but even as a command line user I don't feel much of trouble using both of these APIs to perform swaps on each network. My experience is majorly with subatomic swaps instead of mm2 so I can confidenctly say it's too simple and much faster experience with subatomic swaps.

The GUI application puts a lot of work to make the process of both of these swaping/trading protocols as easy as much possible. That's why the end user will not feel too much of degree of difference in user experince. Different versions of mm2 based GUIs and subatomic based GUIs will have various level of differences in it's graphical application and user experiences. I'm very confident users will find more options and various level of easy to detailed experince with both set of protocol based Graphical Apps.


[26-Apr-20 03:48 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I must clear that AtomicDEX supports lite wallet based swaps using SPV protcol so far, where it is possible to use nSPV based atomic swaps with AtomicDEX too, just need to code that ability in the core API I believe, and then code that to GUI.

With Subatomic swaps the idea was to solidify the initial work to make it work, and take to to the stable state. That is why Subatomic swaps so far mainly support only Native mode based trading. It must be possible to add support of nSPV with subatomic swaps since both nSPV and subatomic CryptoConditions are built into Komodo's core codebase. But how much work it could be only core developers can explain. I just hope it wouldn't be huge work for some skilled core blockcain developer.

As I understand subatomic support all those cryptocurrencies are derived from BTC codebase, much like AtomicDEX supports various Bitcoin based cryptocurrencies.  But Subatomic supports doing the trades with shielded address right now, whereas this feature is yet to be expected from AtomicDEX soon someitme in future. I can't comment what level of technical hurdles there might be to support ETH and other non-bitcoin based cryptocurrencies with Subatomic swaps.

[26-Apr-20 04:02 AM] Diablo_#1391
Thanks for the great answers, they clear many questions about the technical side especially.
What I'm still not quite sure about is the view from a user-centric perspective. From the technical side one big advantage for subatomic swaps currently is the usage of DEXP2P as a much more efficient communication layer, but as you said it can (and likely will?) also be used for AtomicDEX once someone is willing to do the work, which makes the technical side again pretty close between subatomic and atomic swaps.
So what about the user view? What advantages or disadvantages do they have with both techs - once AtomicDEX also uses DEXP2P for communication? When would one prefer atomic swaps and when subatomic swaps?

As you say AtomicDEX supports trades of any size as there's simply no limitation for it. Subatomic swaps on the other hand work best for smaller trades as it is only trust-reduced - but is that really true? Can't subatomic swaps just split larger trades into more (sub)trades, meaning at any time of the process there's still only a small amount of money at risk? Or is there some technical or performance limitation which makes is infeasible to e.g. automatically split a $10k trade into 1000 $10 trades?


[26-Apr-20 04:12 AM] Diablo_#1391
To put it bluntly, I'm still having a hard time to see a good reason for both techs co-existing next to each other in the long run. Sure, currently the tech behind it differs to a larger degree (DEXP2P), but that's only a temporary state until AtomicDEX also moves to DEXP2P. Once that is done there are of course still some differences in the underlying tech, but they achieve almost the same for users with almost the same user experience and with almost the same limitations? Of course competition is never wrong, but doing so in the same ecosystem (KMD) is surprising to me.


[26-Apr-20 04:20 AM] jl777c#5810
atomic swaps will take more time, but is trustless


[26-Apr-20 04:21 AM] jl777c#5810
subatomic swaps are much faster (also non-coins can be swapped, like files), but requires trust or making it small enough in size


[26-Apr-20 04:21 AM] jl777c#5810
these are two almost totally independent cases, so not sure why you are surprised they are both being worked on


[26-Apr-20 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe in real world terms, it is like supporting both credit cards and bank wires

> So what about the user view? What advantages or disadvantages do they have with both techs - once AtomicDEX also uses DEXP2P for communication? When would one prefer atomic swaps and when subatomic swaps?
true, AtomicDEX can gradually make it possible to trade both subatomic + atomic swaps. But note that "Subatomic" is a CryptoConditions DApp.
AtomicDEX is based on `mm2` API, it is a separate daemon, separate codebase and logic of it's atomic swaps is different than subatomic swaps.
I see that subatomic swaps will be possible with `komodod` API.
So, you are basically pointing if a GUI can adopt both `mm2` API and `subatomic` API from `komodod`, which is true. It is possible.


[26-Apr-20 04:23 AM] jl777c#5810
bankwires take longer and dont require trusting the other party to not do a chargeback. credit cards are faster, but you do need to trust the other party wont do a chargeback. so if someone accepts bank wires, they shouldnt accept credit cards?

no, atomic swaps require confirmations or even notarizations


[26-Apr-20 04:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
with AtomicDEX the trade initiates with the blockchain based negotiation and including the secrete and redeem scripts.
This communication requires the blockchain confirmation time, which highly varies from blockchain to blockchain.


[26-Apr-20 04:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
BTC = 10 minute block
ETH = 10 to 2 second block?
KMD = 1 minute block

Right!

minutes, fractions of an hour, though if both parties are willing they can reduce the number of confirmations needed


[26-Apr-20 04:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

@jl777c does the splitting required for Bob side only or for Alice too?


[26-Apr-20 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
then when submitting a trade, the GUI could just trade in the max risk increment


[26-Apr-20 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
bob side should specify the max amount of trade, but that is automatically done when launching it


[26-Apr-20 04:31 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
when defining level of risk per pubkey, what do you mean?
means allowing certain % wise value to allow trade with that pubkey or a set amount per trade?


[26-Apr-20 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
if alice requests a smaller amount, bob will respond


[26-Apr-20 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it would need to be in the value of  KMD, otherwise you are requiring people to do percentages manually


[26-Apr-20 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
someone can say with a trusted pubkey, do up to 1000 KMD per subatomic, but only 1 KMD worth for an unknown

and with handles visible (even for non registered pubkeys) maybe there is a per pubkey limit


[26-Apr-20 04:33 AM] Diablo_#1391
I think some way to specify the max risk you want to take is crucial


[26-Apr-20 04:33 AM] jl777c#5810
so as a user is getting to know a bob node, he can specify larger amounts to do


[26-Apr-20 04:33 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

updated JSON example, I guess that suites the requirements


[26-Apr-20 04:39 AM] jl777c#5810
and then can assign a specific risk profile to a specific pubkey


[26-Apr-20 04:40 AM] jl777c#5810
i think that would make sense for most users. defining several risk levels (maybe three is enough) and then they can just specify which risk level for a specific pubkey


[26-Apr-20 04:40 AM] jl777c#5810
defaulting to the smallest for non-registered and the biggest for registered


[26-Apr-20 04:40 AM] jl777c#5810
then there wont need to be constant fiddling of max limits


[26-Apr-20 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
just maintain several risk profiles and then match up the pubkeys to one of the risk profiles


[26-Apr-20 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
change the details of one risk profile and all the pubkeys that are linked to that one, automatically change


[26-Apr-20 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810

Sooner or later some auto-pilot risk management could also be a good idea, since noobies likely don't want to understand (nor see) any of this. Something like starting with conservative default values and automatically increase the trustness of pubkeys you have traded successfully with, up to a maximum value.

you would only want to give higher limits than the minimum to pubkeys you actually know who it is, not in the KYC sense, but reputation wise.


[26-Apr-20 04:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
can have N number of risk profiles as James explained.
I'll try to start with 3 profiles:
- low risk = default for unregistered pubkeys
- medium risk = reserved to be selected and changed by the user
- high risk = default for registered pubkeys


[26-Apr-20 04:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so having default for registered and unregistered and a few more use defined risk profiles

I was also thinking more and I think I want subatomic functionality directly in our GUI Hush wallet


[26-Apr-20 05:00 AM] SHossain#0007
as soon as alice's payment is in mempool, bob sends funds


[26-Apr-20 05:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
so that a Hush user can subatomic swap with a Pirate user, directly in our GUI wallet


[26-Apr-20 05:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
if we can do DEX with nspv and Pirate with lightwalletd, it's viable


[26-Apr-20 05:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
Imagine Hush and Pirate users being able to swap with each other, in their own GUI wallets. Pirate could do it too, if they wanted. It would be the "mirror image"


[26-Apr-20 05:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@dukeleto I guess it'd be easy. starting DEX in nSPV mode with DEXP2P params
and adding pubkey to HUSH3 blockchain daemon start
and allowing the same with other coins the user wants to trade.


[26-Apr-20 05:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
they would have a Pirate full node, DEX nspv and Hush lightwalled


[26-Apr-20 05:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
adding pubkey


[26-Apr-20 05:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
adding pubkey like `hushd -pubkey=..` ?


[26-Apr-20 05:01 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes


[26-Apr-20 05:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
our GUI wallets would need to learn how to do that, but that is relatively easy


[26-Apr-20 05:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
check @SHossain 's gist guide


[26-Apr-20 05:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
why *exactly* is -pubkey needed? to prevent abuse or for reputation?


[26-Apr-20 05:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
lightwalletd and nspv have no concept of -pubkey, iirc


[26-Apr-20 05:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the orders broadcast with the DEX's subatomic API, `DEX_*` API calls use the pubkey defined in both chains.
DEX and the X chain which is being used to trade in selected pair.


[26-Apr-20 05:04 AM] SHossain#0007
without `-pubkey=xx` on DEX chain there will be different random DEX_pubkey generated on each start.


[26-Apr-20 05:04 AM] SHossain#0007
that will throw error that illegal pubkey in the stdout


[26-Apr-20 05:05 AM] SHossain#0007
also, if you use pubkey on KMD, HUSH, xxx coins, the remaining funds will be back to original address instead of going to a new change address, which some users finds confusing


[26-Apr-20 05:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes


[26-Apr-20 05:06 AM] SHossain#0007
a lot of end users doesn't have the idea of change address

{Reactions}
üëÜ 

[26-Apr-20 05:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
so -pubkey is really just acting as a wallet-wide change address


[26-Apr-20 05:06 AM] SHossain#0007
for the coins you want to swap


[26-Apr-20 05:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
since I plan to have a GUI interface to all this, I can force a user to set a change address or generate one for them


[26-Apr-20 05:06 AM] SHossain#0007
for DEX, it's needed


[26-Apr-20 05:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it kind makes native wallet user's life a lot easier using -pubkey

@grewalsatinder yes, but i have to add probably 500 lines of code to the gui wallet to learn how to manage -pubkey üòÖ

[26-Apr-20 05:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
also, been thinking, lightwalletd probably need to learn how to do z_viewtransaction


[26-Apr-20 05:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
that RPC is too new for it to have existed when lightwalletd was written


[26-Apr-20 05:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is a small bump


[26-Apr-20 05:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c can you foresee any catastrophic problems with trying to support a "hybrid subatomic swap" where Alice is a full node, Bob is lightwalletd and DEX is nspv, for a z2z swap between Hush<>Pirate and vice versa?


[26-Apr-20 05:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
the fact that the above is even possible is exciting


[26-Apr-20 05:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
we can assume that Alice sets -pubkey if she wants to swap, a GUI wallet can automate that


[26-Apr-20 05:17 AM] jl777c#5810
DEX being nspv is not an issue as really, the DEXP2P has nothing to do with ordinary things


[26-Apr-20 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
for lightwallet support, all the coin related calls (i think 4 of them) will need to be created.


[26-Apr-20 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i supported a data file into these 4 functions, so you can subatomic swap normal coins for release of a specfied file


[26-Apr-20 05:19 AM] jl777c#5810
considering a litewallet is much closer to a full wallet coin than a file, i dont see any issues other than having to implement it


[26-Apr-20 05:19 AM] jl777c#5810
code is not that complex, the top of the source file describes what needs to be changed and if you look at the code changes to support selling files, it shouldnt be too hard to make it for litewallets (or nSPV calls)

@jl777c do you have a suggestion for which repo+branch I should pull subatomic dapp code into Hush? Usually I use your repo and the `dev` or `master` branch, but my guess is the latest subatomic code may be on another branch


[26-Apr-20 05:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder @SHossain something we should keep in the back of our minds, if we want to support many other zaddr coins...


[26-Apr-20 05:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
Some coins change their zaddr prefix


[26-Apr-20 05:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
So Hush and Pirate both have exactly the same prefix, `zs1`, but for instance Ycash uses `ys1` and Arrow uses `as1`. Deep in the internals, we should not hardcode the prefix but let it be a "variable" in some sense, that can be set

@grewalsatinder ok. pulling from `jl777` branch is like riding a bull in a tornado üòÖ


[26-Apr-20 05:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
i have not seen it yet, but we should plan that some coins have a custom viewing key or privkey prefix as well


[26-Apr-20 05:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
just like base58 prefixes we list for coins, we should list the prefix of zaddr, viewkey and privkey for each coin. This flexibility costs us almost nothing now and will likely make life easier later on


[26-Apr-20 06:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
just like when iguana only supported 1 byte prefixes and adding support for HUSH required 2 byte prefixes, gosh that was an immense amount of work. Flexibility up-front has a lot of benefits


[26-Apr-20 06:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
also, the latest zcash has "full viewkey" support


[26-Apr-20 06:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
bidirectional viewkeys


[26-Apr-20 06:01 AM] SHossain#0007
apart from `R` and `zs` address, nothing else is currently supported


[26-Apr-20 06:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is what i am saying


[26-Apr-20 06:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
there must be code somewhere that verifies an address is "valid"


[26-Apr-20 06:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
one day, if we want to support other coins like Arrow or Ycash (maybe we don't), that stuff will depend on knowing the prefix for zaddrs on that coin


[26-Apr-20 06:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's nice that Pirate and Hush have exactly the same formats, it's a nice "simple" situation

for some strange reason there is an error that `komodo-cli: not found`


[27-Apr-20 12:27 AM] SHossain#0007
this is the first time this error generated


[27-Apr-20 12:27 AM] SHossain#0007
so, bob couldn't send the KMD


[27-Apr-20 12:28 AM] SHossain#0007
can you please try another swap?


[27-Apr-20 12:28 AM] SHossain#0007
komodo-cli is present and linked already

[27-Apr-20 12:45 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, still don't know what caused this issue. if it happens again, we need to investigate


[27-Apr-20 05:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
@SHossain potentially you might need to say `./komodo-cli` or specify a full path, not sure what code is calling that


[27-Apr-20 06:09 AM] SHossain#0007
no. you need `komodo-cli` in your path for subatomic loop


[27-Apr-20 06:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain another swap just stuck after sending PIRATE: 1929295840


[27-Apr-20 06:11 AM] SHossain#0007
@grewalsatinder same issue


[27-Apr-20 06:12 AM] SHossain#0007
@jl777c we are having an error that `komodo-cli` not found  during swap.

it's working üôÇ


[27-Apr-20 07:10 AM] SHossain#0007

very good! üôÇ


[27-Apr-20 07:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I need to fix some display info on completed swap in that table, and work on code to unstuck the stuck swap just in case.


[27-Apr-20 07:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will work on that tomorrow.


[27-Apr-20 07:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
or may be will keep doing some now


[27-Apr-20 07:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
adding explorer links to code now


[27-Apr-20 07:12 AM] SHossain#0007
i did a swap like yours (which failed on your side), it worked on my alice and bob


[27-Apr-20 07:12 AM] SHossain#0007
that stuck error is bugging me :abused:


[27-Apr-20 07:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
üòÖ yea, has to restart main.go to unstuck it, gonna add a timeout to subatomic execution time


[27-Apr-20 07:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
like if for 90 seconds there is no response, it will terminate the process and get back for next work.


[27-Apr-20 07:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
because after this single swap solidified, I can then work on making logic to make it process multiple swaps with single trade issue


[27-Apr-20 07:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
need to fix single trade to it's best state


[27-Apr-20 07:21 AM] SHossain#0007
can we please have a back button to go back to the orderbook page after a swap is completed for another one. since these swaps are in very small quantity, users might like to perform more swaps one after another. it would be easier on their end to just simply Click `Go Back` and proceed with another swap.


[27-Apr-20 07:22 AM] SHossain#0007
when they press go back, the `base/rel` coins can stay same as the swap completed. if needed users can change them as required


[27-Apr-20 07:23 AM] SHossain#0007
and probably do a `List Orders` call in the background, so, user gets fresh orders from the orderbook displayed in screen


[27-Apr-20 07:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, sure... give me few minutes


[27-Apr-20 07:27 AM] SHossain#0007

from alice side. a swap didn't start. bob doesn't know about his swap initiation


[27-Apr-20 07:42 AM] SHossain#0007
first time i got this


[27-Apr-20 07:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you have used that orderID already and do a refresh page on order init page, it tries to re-start the order again.
In that case it probably try to initiate the order with an orderid which is I guess already processed and may be got canceled ü§î


[27-Apr-20 07:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
that output is the same output I see for the case I just explained


[27-Apr-20 07:44 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks. all good now


[27-Apr-20 07:45 AM] SHossain#0007
now i remember that the swap wouldn't work with expired or used id :abused:


[27-Apr-20 07:50 AM] SHossain#0007
this GUI is very fast. no lag at all


[27-Apr-20 08:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@SHossain added explorer links to the code. You'll need to update you config.json with explorers JSON data set from sample config file.


[27-Apr-20 08:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
do go get command again and update the config file manually


[27-Apr-20 08:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
then start the main.go, and test a swap


[27-Apr-20 08:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
also hidden raw/json logs to show from GUI


[27-Apr-20 08:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and added back button in order init page

yes, I removed that raw data display from the GUI


[27-Apr-20 10:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
but those are there in the swaplogs directory with .log files


[27-Apr-20 10:12 AM] SHossain#0007
good idea


[27-Apr-20 10:12 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

only order progress page is auto-refreshing üôÇ


[27-Apr-20 10:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
ü§î on another thought I can actually implement auto-refresh of balances too, the same ways I filtered the subatomic stdout log to json output progress bar


[27-Apr-20 10:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I'll have to enhance my kmdgo library, to keep watch on debug.log files and trigger websocket to update balance üôÇ

Does it?
As I see Subatomic is an independent CC ü§î


[27-Apr-20 06:21 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
and Channels CC could be used later with it

@SHossain I see no orders from you mate


[27-Apr-20 09:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
trying to test command timeout


[27-Apr-20 09:03 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I took my laptop offline and placed my own orders, which showed in the orderbook list


[27-Apr-20 09:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
thought may be because I'm offline it will timeout, but the order just completed successfully with my own self üòÖ


[27-Apr-20 09:04 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c I guess there must be some condition which doesn't allow trading with own order üòÖ


[27-Apr-20 09:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can try doing that at GUI level, but I guess it should be in the API code level


[27-Apr-20 09:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
please let me know what's the best way to approach it in your view point.

@SHossain added command kill code logic. It will timeout command if it does not complete within 30 seconds, as per my current test code limit set.
will have this limit set to 90 seconds.

I see the order was going forward ü§î


[27-Apr-20 09:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
so may be I should increase the timeout limit


[27-Apr-20 09:32 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jl777c what should be the ideal timeout limit set if the trade gets stuck at some point?


[27-Apr-20 09:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for now I set it's timeout to 180 seconds... hope that's enough


[28-Apr-20 02:22 AM] SHossain#0007
I'm not sure about channelCC being used. Don't think so. subatomic uses `dexp2p` tech.
I'll test out new codes soon.

while doing that, i issued swap for the same id in another tab and i got this

Yep
That's the case


[28-Apr-20 06:41 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Once Bob order gets filled it goes away from order books


[28-Apr-20 06:41 AM] SHossain#0007
and, this below image shows `Swap Complete` in the progress bar status. Next stage it shows `Incoming COIN fully paid`. Could this be changed to something else? i.e.: **50% Completed** or similar. Because the final message is `Swap completed Successfully!`. showing swap complete twice could be confusing.

If you try same order id you get that error


[28-Apr-20 06:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
That is because I did not get answers to my questions I asked to James yesterday here.
I tagged him again waiting for what those log lines means, so that I can put meaningful status text.


[28-Apr-20 06:43 AM] SHossain#0007
`That's the case` & `If you try same order id you get that error`
for this, could we add another message that could make sense to end user?
```
{"state": "exit status 255"}
The order is already filled and no longer exist. Please hit the back button and select another order.

My server is slow arriving. Should I bother trying the 2 core 4GB that I have running KMD?  If not will try and set something up on what I've got.


[28-Apr-20 07:14 AM] SHossain#0007
RAM might be on the low side


[28-Apr-20 07:15 AM] SHossain#0007
but, you can try with lots of swap


[28-Apr-20 08:21 AM] Regnar#6164
So does subatomic use channels?


[28-Apr-20 08:26 AM] Regnar#6164
From my understanding if you were to do a subatomic swap of 10 KMD for 10 ARRR, you would send 1 KMD they would send 1 ARRR, you would see if they sent the 1 arrr and would then send the next 1 KMD. But this would be 10 different transactions on the blockchain. It looked like during the video, that it was as a single transaction. So I assumed it would be in some offchain channel?


[28-Apr-20 08:35 AM] SHossain#0007
10 KMD for 10 ARRR can be done in 1 transaction.
with verified bob nodes, alice can swap upto $1000 or 1000 KMD worth of swap at a time
with non-verified bob nodes, the limit might be $1 or 1 KMD


[28-Apr-20 08:36 AM] SHossain#0007
so, if an alice wants to swap with non-verified bob, for 10 KMD <> 10 ARRR, she has to initiate 10 swaps


[28-Apr-20 08:38 AM] Regnar#6164
okay so if you were doing $1001 of BTC to KMD. How would you reasonably split the swap?


[28-Apr-20 08:38 AM] Regnar#6164
I'd imagine transaction fee comes into account here


[28-Apr-20 08:54 AM] SHossain#0007
for BTC, use atomicDEX.


[28-Apr-20 08:54 AM] SHossain#0007
not supported in subatomic due to smaller swap sizes and high BTC fee


[28-Apr-20 08:54 AM] SHossain#0007
however, BCH will be supported in the future

in theory yes. but james needs to provide the support.

the above PIRATE <> zVRSC was a bid from bob's side
just issued an ask by bob and alice just filled it. so, both sides are working fine


[28-Apr-20 02:31 PM] SHossain#0007
the guide now been updated with full **zCOIN** reference for creating bid script, example after issuing bid, querying orderbook & filling up an order

@SHossain this error seems to be coming from the `subatomic` binary, and is related to the memory allocation for some event happening in subatomic's process:
https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/bad_alloc
I think @jl777c can look at that issue and see what's wrong that could be causing it.


[28-Apr-20 10:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i doubt subatomic is doing std::alloc calls


[28-Apr-20 10:45 PM] jl777c#5810
i believe slyris has refactored subatomic, but not sure of exact state


[28-Apr-20 10:46 PM] jl777c#5810
best to have a new dev to be fixing bugs to learn about the internals. there really isnt that much code


[28-Apr-20 10:47 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, and subatomic does not use channels CC, though it was coded to be able to use a pair of channels CC (one for each direction), it worked so well without channels, that it seemed fine without it

Subatomic swaps, as opposed to Atomic Swaps, are a process of swapping coins with a ‚Äúsemi-trusted‚Äù individual. Normally if you do an OTC trade with someone one of you has to send an amount and then the other does the same, this is risky, ...

@Diablo_  from your message on 26th april
`To put it bluntly, I'm still having a hard time to see a good reason for both techs co-existing next to each other in the long run`

imagine cash register tech.  one works over 5+mins & is completely trustless or the other works in <1 minute and is in-person.
the <1minute tech can exchange an invoice image for coin.
the other is private<->private

I'll get some rest then
turned out it was a lot changes just to enable z balance showing and then troubleshooting this zVRSC PIRATE trade, just because it did not finish till the end showing dpow_broadcast log from subatomic process

tried things at my end, then thought may be something could be wrong at your end

will try again after rest

did you try the zVRSC swaps manually via CLI?

swaps did complete, I only noticed none of the zVRSC swap gave dpow_broadcast

bob got those `dpow_broadcast` messages after each completed swap

Does anybody know if the trades being done on subatomicDEX will also create revenue for holders of the DEX coin, or only for the atomicDEX? I'm wondering if the collecting of fees is technically possible, especially with private transactions, direct payment channels etc.


[29-Apr-20 01:16 PM] Regnar#6164
It isn't going to DEX holders, but fees could probably be built into a different GUI if someone wanted to make one.


[29-Apr-20 01:17 PM] t_dan#3334
So there are no subatomic swap exchange fees like in atomic dex?


[29-Apr-20 01:17 PM] Regnar#6164
not that I know of no


[29-Apr-20 01:17 PM] Regnar#6164
but to be fair, the DEX fee for AtomicDEX is only like 1/777th of a trade


[29-Apr-20 01:18 PM] Regnar#6164
so like 0.12%


[29-Apr-20 01:27 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Only on one side too


[29-Apr-20 01:28 PM] t_dan#3334
Yes, the taker fee. It is also supposed to prevent spamming the system. Isn't something similar required or would make sense on subatomic?


[29-Apr-20 02:10 PM] hastrup#8742
maybe i dont understand thing completely, but would somthing like this be possible with subatomic? 
you have a website like shapeshift for subatomic you have a hardware wallet for priv keys. so you just trade through the browser.
And is it possible to open the website so evryone whit a server fast internet and a domian name can spin up a subatomic site. somthing like piratebay and there proxybay site. just for subatomic. proxytomic. is that just wishfull thinking?


[29-Apr-20 02:45 PM] Regnar#6164
Probably not super easy for hardware as you have to manually approve every transaction, which could be a lot depending on the swap.


[29-Apr-20 02:50 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. Demystify it as much as possible, is this accurate:

You find trading partners by looking at who has broadcast that they want to trade, with a pubkey for what they are trading for.

You tell them you accept, provide them a pubkey for the chain you are trading

You send part of the trade total to them, they watch the mempool for the transaction and send you one of their coins.

This repeat until the full amount is sent and received.

Komodod automates all this including the finding of peers?


[29-Apr-20 09:22 PM] hastrup#8742

subatomic has no fees other than blockchain transaction fees. it is part of a freemium model in combination with atomicDEX. start with small subatomic trades without any fees and that will feed into atomicDEX

atm, it's  1 "packet/utxo" of trade, (1 tx) of small value.  if someone wanted to transfer $1k, and do it in $5 packets, then this is where channelsCC would need to be used?


[29-Apr-20 11:41 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Nope, subatomic is faster even without that, but sure channel CC is possible. Read James's comments on channel CC earlier in chat.

yes understand it doesn't use it atm, but the original vision was to use it for a use case (maybe larger amounts), but seems unnecessary with atomicdex there.

@grewalsatinder makes a lot more sense to show Hush<>Pirate zswaps, Vrsc doesn't care about zaddrs and the way to "mature" VRSC is actually very bad for metadata leakage


[30-Apr-20 12:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
but I am just a broken record in here üòâ


[30-Apr-20 12:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
Swapping Pirate with zVRSC actually leaks metadata, because nobody uses zaddrs on VRSC, and that shielded pool is essentially worthless


[30-Apr-20 12:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
So you are leaking metadata about Pirate people onto the VRSC  blockchain


[30-Apr-20 12:45 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I leak data here give logs of my development
I don't care
Plz don't tag me for this again


[30-Apr-20 12:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
@grewalsatinder what can I tag you about?

seems a bit odd, but whatevs


[30-Apr-20 12:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
Advertising zswaps with VRSC is bizarre


[30-Apr-20 12:47 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Duke, have you tried swapping with Hush?


[30-Apr-20 12:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
but I don't run KMD marketing and that is feature, not a bug


[30-Apr-20 12:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka Hush has our own subatomic channel in our discord and we are building it into our native wallet


[30-Apr-20 12:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
i have not performed a subatomic swap yet. Hush is only interested in z2z swaps since we are going z2z in November


[30-Apr-20 12:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
z2z trading, and using VRSC is like, wow


[30-Apr-20 12:49 AM] SHossain#0007
z2z swaps been working for last 2 months


[30-Apr-20 12:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes


[30-Apr-20 12:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
We want my new idea


[30-Apr-20 12:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
"half full" z2z swaps


[30-Apr-20 12:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
Alice is full and Bob is lite. Hush is working on it


[30-Apr-20 12:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
We have at least 2 hush devs working on it, which are not me


[30-Apr-20 12:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am focused on our actual z2z transition code and hushchat


[30-Apr-20 12:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
so, we will have swaps with Pirate in our native wallet


[30-Apr-20 12:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
and our users will not need a Pirate full node


[30-Apr-20 12:50 AM] SHossain#0007
how bob using lite helps mass adoption?


[30-Apr-20 12:50 AM] SHossain#0007
it should be alice as alice will be the most number of users


[30-Apr-20 12:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
how does requiring people to run 2 full nodes solve anything?


[30-Apr-20 12:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
Nobody gonna do that, lol


[30-Apr-20 12:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's a step along the path, it's good for power users


[30-Apr-20 12:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
Avg people will never run 2 full nodes


[30-Apr-20 12:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
Alice must be full


[30-Apr-20 12:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
creating a ztx requires a full node


[30-Apr-20 12:51 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Proof of concept testing with any z coin is fine. You sound like you're upset that they didn't use hush. Why not help testing and use hush that way rather than expect people to use your product.


[30-Apr-20 12:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am saying that VRSC isn't z2z and you are confusing people, tainting Pirate with VRSC


[30-Apr-20 12:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
if you don't want that feedback, then don't take it

@moneystacks I noticed you mentioned subatomic swaps in the monthly update. May I suggest posting this tutorial link
 (Below) in there for people to use. I was able to follow it no dramas and it also has a shit tonne of data in there showing various firsts for subatomic swaps. SHossain has done a really nice job with it.

@SHossain Great looking GUI already! Just a UX suggestion: When selecting the coins to swap, I would prefer to swap from coin A (left menu) to coin B (right menu), and not vice versa. Compare it also to AtomicDEX: select coin to sell, then select coin to swap into. 
Second suggestion: I would get rid of the "List orders" button, and instantly refresh the order list according to any changes of any menu. The initial entries of both menus could be "Select coin...", and as long as two coins have not been selected yet, there won't be a list shown below.


[03-May-20 03:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
@t_dan can you share a screen shot for first one?


[03-May-20 03:13 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
thanks for suggestions üëç


[03-May-20 03:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I guess since it's showing which coin you are buying and which coin you selling, it doesn't matter which one is right or left


[03-May-20 03:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
for list orders I'll consider doing it üëç


[03-May-20 03:15 AM] t_dan#3334
My first suggestion was simply to flip the two menus. Please open AtomicDEX on your phone, go to the DEX tab, and there you'll see the first menu is "select coin to sell", and the second menu is "select coin to receive".


[03-May-20 03:16 AM] t_dan#3334
The logic being "I want to swap coin A to coin B".


[03-May-20 03:17 AM] t_dan#3334
And not: "I want to receive coin B by swapping coin A to it."


[03-May-20 03:19 AM] t_dan#3334
And my second suggestion would make the user experience more "snappy", because after making changes to a menu, and nothing happens, that feels a little strange, because usually making changes to menus will have an immediate effect.


[03-May-20 03:20 AM] t_dan#3334
Furthermore, changing a menu to a different coin, and still seeing an old list of a different coin causes an inconsistency between the selected and shown coins.


[03-May-20 03:20 AM] t_dan#3334
This confuses the user in the best case, and leads to wrong coins being swapped in the worst case.


[03-May-20 03:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
okay, made the first change already. üëç 
it's good to be consistent with AtomicDEX's design choice.
even though to me this change didn't made much difference.


[03-May-20 03:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
will make the second suggested change too. that's good one üëç

Another question: Is it possible to make the Subatomic Go a standalone app, and not something that requires Linux and preparation with many cryptic terminal commands and linking to the additional VerusDesktop Wallet as shown in Kaks' video? For the average user, it won't be usable like this. It would be good if we could download the app let's say for Windows, and it would set up a wallet automatically and offer the subatomic swap feature.


[03-May-20 04:10 AM] t_dan#3334
I know that this might sound infeasible or viewed too simplistic, but at the end of the day, we have to see things through an average, non-technical user's perspective.


[03-May-20 04:12 AM] gcharang#6833
> might sound infeasible
not infeasible. currently, the app is under testing and development. when it is "released", @grewalsatinder will surely make it seamless


[03-May-20 04:13 AM] t_dan#3334
great!


[03-May-20 04:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
correct @gcharang üôÇ 
@t_dan at this moment, to be honest I intentionally kept it the way it is.
I want more of the technical users to test this at the moment, and not have the pressure of every day users to push me to do UX level of tasks on this app.
My initial goal is to have a usable only application, with fair amount of UX as per to my little of abilities on UX end.
When the initial underlying functions are working to do all necessary calls and show the data in UI in some sensible way, then add artificial easiness where possible, including enhancing UX further.
In the end you will for sure get much streamlined user application usable by end users with as less of hassles as possible.

@jansako I see you you raised a genuine question in #üìà‚îÉtalk-trading channel regarding copyright material concerns with file sharing concept made with DEXP2P tech.
it wasn't initially the idea to create a file sharing concept application/protocol, but a scalable networking layer to share messaging between pure peer-to-peer nodes over the network.
DEXP2P's purpose is the most simplest. To share message with ALL Nodes over the network. Fast, efficient, and with all be scalable to expand p2p DApps further.
File sharing concept came out of testing and taking DEXP2P to it's somewhat extremes to check and see what limits DEXP2P's general messaging protocols can be expanded.
To my understanding the base fundamental concept works well. It is very much scalable and efficient on system and network resources.
How the material shared on this network is another level of puzzles that other technical experts and entrepreneurs can work on, using the tools such as DEXP2P created, tested, and provided with concept DApps by KMD.


[04-May-20 09:35 AM] jansako#3330
Thank you for responding @grewalsatinder ! I remember you were working on the messaging concept before. What you are saying makes total sense, as well as what Duke said. From the comments comments in the trade channel I was getting the impression that the development of the 'file-sharing' use case was much further than it really is. I am on the usage/biz-dev side of things so my thoughts always go to 'how is this better/easier/faster/less expensive' than the current solution' üôÇ


[04-May-20 09:47 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Better: No ( optional) entrusting files to a 3rd party.  Easier:  all forms of data can be sold in one application rather than over multiple aggregator middlemen Faster: faster ‚Äòcheckout‚Äò Less expensive:  sellers can easily receive greater compensation for their works while the client simultaneously can get the works cheaper.   This is a recent development,  no where near production  but it seems the core part of the operation works even now so probably can be quicker to get to market than most products go

I'm following the guide to test subatomic trades. But I seem to have trouble running three native chains at once. Either the dex chain or the kmd chain crashes consistently. The pirate chain chugs along just fine.  The vps is recently spun up for the sole purpose of subatomic, and meets or exceeds the recommended minimums. Any thoughts?

Compiled from dev branch from jl777 repo as described in guide


[04-May-20 08:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@allbits the usual crash of native daemon crashing is getting out of memory.


[04-May-20 08:30 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
For that you can look at 2 things and try to rectify:


[04-May-20 08:31 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
1. check how much RAM is in use when you run all your required full blockchain syncing native coin daemons. Keep an eye on the RAM and try to replicate the behaviour of seeing when the daemons crash. This will help you identify the exact cause. Mostly you'll see it happens when the RAM is getting high in use and there's little RAM left to swap the memory for taking bytes in and sending those out.


[04-May-20 08:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
2. In any case, if you even has a low RAM, you can still make things work a bit better with SWAP memory. Usually it's good idea to have "double" the size of SWAP memory of whatever your RAM is on your machine. Do that, and you'll see better performance from your machine.


[04-May-20 08:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hope this helps.


[04-May-20 08:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@jansako 
> I am on the usage/biz-dev side of things so my thoughts always go to 'how is this better/easier/faster/less expensive' than the current solution' üôÇ
@polycryptoblog 's explanation on better, easier, faster, less expensive is very accurate.
Here in Komodo Platform the developers are responsible of making the core technologies giving a platform and core level of APIs to technical entrepreneurs and developers. And business developers like you can help further the advancements by collaborating with the teams who wants to use this technology. Glad you exploring and asking further. üëç


[04-May-20 08:47 PM] allbits#5898
Thanks! That's helpful. I had all three chains syncing from scratch at the same time. Would it help to sync them one at a time?


[04-May-20 09:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, at the time of blockchain syncing, it takes a lot of bytes In/Out and once it's fully synced, that In/Out bytes are fairly less, and you get bit free RAM to use by other processes on the machine.


[04-May-20 09:13 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have a HP MicroServer at home which is of low end x86_64 processor, but also allows installing big RAM modules. 
So, I have AMD Opteron(tm) X3216 APU CPU with 32GB RAM on it.


[04-May-20 09:14 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if this machine can run multiple VMs + Coin daemons + other softwares at the same time, I'm pretty sure regular i5, i7 and such processors with good amount of RAM can subatomic setup.

[06-May-20 09:46 AM] SHossain#0007
this is interesting that both  node has handle of `alien_bob` but one is showing verified and another not. because they have different DEX_pubkey. the verified bob has the pubkey inside `subatomic.json` file which is authorized. so, with the verified seal, spoofing or phishing can be eliminated

16GB RAM seems enough for bob that is running KMD, PIRATE & DEX chain with subatomic loops for 2 pairs


[06-May-20 10:09 AM] SHossain#0007
and no SWAP


[06-May-20 10:12 AM] SHossain#0007
@allbits did you get a chance to complete your setup?


[06-May-20 10:21 AM] allbits#5898
Just checked now. Yes, I have three synced native chains. All I needed was to configure 8GB of swap space


[06-May-20 10:33 AM] SHossain#0007
cool


[06-May-20 10:33 AM] allbits#5898
Not seeing anything on orderbook for kmd pirate


[06-May-20 11:09 AM] SHossain#0007
there should be.


[06-May-20 11:10 AM] SHossain#0007
are you running DEX, KMD & PIRATE chain?


[06-May-20 11:10 AM] SHossain#0007
DEX chain needs additional param than normal start and the special `-addnode=` ip


[06-May-20 11:10 AM] SHossain#0007
it's available on my guide


[06-May-20 11:34 AM] SHossain#0007
```
./komodod -pubkey=038e61fbface549a850862f12ed99b7cbeef5c2bd2d8f1daddb34809416f0259e1 -ac_name=DEX -dexp2p=2 -ac_supply=999999 -addnode=136.243.58.134 -handle=alice -recvZaddr=zs1r3ptv82fn0yz6q47nwmgsak2dasl0v5zrprqu222f0r3mtc5p9202t82lt2vu4wmr386v2cx4tn &
```


[06-May-20 11:35 AM] SHossain#0007
you need to change `-pubkey=`, `-handle=` & `-recvZaddr=` with your own and leave other params as they are


[06-May-20 11:40 AM] allbits#5898
I'm afk right now but yes I thought I followed your guide regarding all that stuff. Will dig in when I get back

[06-May-20 01:16 PM] allbits#5898
ok I looked back at what I launched and believe that I followed directions properly, so not sure where to go from here


[06-May-20 01:18 PM] allbits#5898
Obviously I'm making a noob error, but don't know where


[06-May-20 01:20 PM] SHossain#0007
what is the output of below command?
```
./komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX DEX_stats
```


[06-May-20 01:28 PM] allbits#5898
Ok, I stopped the DEX chain and relaunched it with the exact same parameters and now I see order books :)


[06-May-20 01:30 PM] SHossain#0007
cool


[06-May-20 01:30 PM] SHossain#0007
you can now use the GUI to swap easily


[06-May-20 01:31 PM] SHossain#0007
https://github.com/satindergrewal/subatomicgo


[06-May-20 01:31 PM] SHossain#0007
instructions are in the repo


[06-May-20 01:31 PM] allbits#5898
I'm on vps, so command line only


[06-May-20 01:32 PM] SHossain#0007
oh...ok. you can use 
```
./subatomic <COIN_NAME> "" <ORDER_ID> <AMOUNT>
```


[06-May-20 01:33 PM] SHossain#0007
`./subatomic PIRATE "" 3359041536 0.1`


[06-May-20 01:33 PM] SHossain#0007
like this ^^


[06-May-20 01:33 PM] allbits#5898
Yes, I see that in the guide. In that case, is pirate the coin I'm trying to acquire, or to sell?


[06-May-20 01:33 PM] SHossain#0007
sell


[06-May-20 01:34 PM] SHossain#0007
use 0.1 coins or something in the beginning just to try out


[06-May-20 01:34 PM] allbits#5898
So if I'm looking at kmd pirate orderbook and wish to acquire pirate, I would use coin name KMD?


[06-May-20 01:35 PM] SHossain#0007
yes


[06-May-20 01:35 PM] SHossain#0007
if an order doesn't work like that, change the coin name


[06-May-20 01:35 PM] allbits#5898
Ok, a little note in the guide clarifying that might be helpful


[06-May-20 01:37 PM] allbits#5898
Ok, that command returned an error for me "couldn't set pubkey for DEX"


[06-May-20 01:39 PM] SHossain#0007
thanks, updated the guide.


[06-May-20 01:39 PM] SHossain#0007
do you have the privkey of R address and z address imported into the DEX chain?


[06-May-20 01:41 PM] SHossain#0007
and make sure that you started DEX chain with the pubkey of your R address


[06-May-20 01:41 PM] SHossain#0007
without that, you will get error


[06-May-20 01:42 PM] allbits#5898
Not sure what that means exactly.  I started with fresh wallets so didn't import anything. I used validateaddress to get a pubkey for R address on DEX chain. And I used the resulting pubkey when I launched the chain.


[06-May-20 01:43 PM] allbits#5898
I used z_getnewaddresss to get a z address and used that to launch the chain


[06-May-20 01:43 PM] SHossain#0007
the R address you generated inside DEX chain, did you import the key into KMD?


[06-May-20 01:43 PM] allbits#5898
No


[06-May-20 01:43 PM] SHossain#0007
you need the key in KMD


[06-May-20 01:43 PM] allbits#5898
Will do now


[06-May-20 01:44 PM] SHossain#0007
the zaddr you generated, did you import it into PIRATE?


[06-May-20 01:44 PM] SHossain#0007
and restart DEX chain again with the same param and pay attention on the startup outputs where it shows DEX pubkey is set


[06-May-20 01:45 PM] SHossain#0007
The Requirement section and Launch DEX chain section explains those


[06-May-20 01:47 PM] SHossain#0007
if you launch the DEX chain correctly, you will see output like this
```
DEX_pubkey.(0160e93c82dd76fb06dc391fc46a729cae7f17af93e1ad4d761c15c3546543e57b) sizeof DEX_globals 4059272
```


[06-May-20 01:48 PM] allbits#5898
Ok will do


[06-May-20 01:55 PM] SHossain#0007
you can also use the GUI inside your sever and bind the port in your local computer using SSH tunnel


[06-May-20 01:56 PM] SHossain#0007
or even directly using the `serverip:8080` port


[06-May-20 04:20 PM] allbits#5898
Ok, so I stopped DEX chain. On relaunch, got error - "error opening block database .. error in HDD data, might just need to update to latest, if that doesn't work, then you need to resync"


[06-May-20 06:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
@allbits that means your blockindex changed formats or is corrupt


[06-May-20 06:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
@allbits using -reindex will fix that


[06-May-20 06:59 PM] allbits#5898
Thank you. So I just add -reindex anywhere in the komodod command, or is there a specific place for it?


[06-May-20 06:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
anywhere on the komodod command line should work


[06-May-20 07:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
that error should not normally happen, it points to a larger problem


[06-May-20 07:00 PM] dukeleto#7326
if you had a coredump or crash, that can cause stuff like this


[06-May-20 07:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
it can happen if code is changing the block index format but i don't think anything in subatomic does that


[06-May-20 07:02 PM] allbits#5898
Hmmm. Don't you know that noobs are capable of all kinds of unpredictable mischief!?


[06-May-20 07:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
indeed üòÖ


[06-May-20 07:03 PM] allbits#5898
I'm not aware of any crash happening or coredump. Just a stop. Oh well

[07-May-20 09:30 AM] allbits#5898
So I did the importing of the privkeys on the applicable chains. Relaunched DEX, see the orderbooks, but still get the same error when trying to trade "couldn't set pubkey for DEX"


[07-May-20 09:51 AM] SHossain#0007
what is the exact start command of your DEX chain? please post here


[07-May-20 10:47 AM] allbits#5898

Sorry in advance for being such a sad noob - and thanks for your attention


[07-May-20 11:17 AM] Oszy#5734
Did you post it twice or do you start it like this?


[07-May-20 11:19 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. now i would like to know the R address that you used in both KMD and DEX chain


[07-May-20 11:20 AM] SHossain#0007
and if possible the output of `komodo-cli -ac_name=DEX validateaddress <that R address here>`


[07-May-20 11:20 AM] Oszy#5734
Also don't reindex every time you start


[07-May-20 11:20 AM] SHossain#0007
you can just simply post the command you used and the output


[07-May-20 11:20 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, that ^^ too


[07-May-20 11:21 AM] SHossain#0007
but, even with reindex, dexp2p should work as the chain doesn't need full sync


[07-May-20 11:29 AM] allbits#5898
Lol posted it twice. I don't reindex every time I start. But the currently active daemon was from that exact command


[07-May-20 11:30 AM] allbits#5898
./subatomic KMD "" 278152064 1.1

[07-May-20 11:31 AM] Oszy#5734
Did you link komodo-cli to usr/local/bin?


[07-May-20 11:32 AM] allbits#5898
no


[07-May-20 11:32 AM] SHossain#0007

Sorry if its off subject but has there been any consideration of swap compatibility and/or gateways between the more ERC-20 oriented liquidity pools that are the current darling gateways in the defi arena - ie Uniswap, Kyber, ... - not just ERC-20 

Also if there is a better place ask - just let me know  

Thx


[19-Jul-20 07:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Hey @Ian the existing subatomic implementation supports KMD and ecosystem addresses/transactions to do subatomic swaps.
As the design of subatomic swaps allows, it is possible to add almost any cryptocurrency to be supported, as long as someone able to code that support to subatomic code.

So far to my knowledge I have not see anyone else shown much of interest adding extra cryptocurrencies support to subatomic swaps and even use it.
I see it very interesting and another way to make swaps with PIRATE (ARRR) cryptocucurrency and wish to make it easily usable for myself and other users in ecosystem so I'm working on a GUI named Shurli, which will use this existing implementation subatomic swaps.

The existing implementation is written in C language, and I'm not so proficient in C to take that code further, but I do have some fine level of grasp in Go language, and understand the subatomic code to the extent where I can think of porting that C code logic to a Go language based subatomic code.
Doing this code port is not my priority at the moment, but whenever I'll try or attempt to make subatomic port to Go language, I'll do my best to improve/enhance the lacking parts of it with help of James and other devs in ecosystem.
I do have some ideas in mind which I'd like to see with subatomic swaps tech, but first I need to focus on Shurli, the GUI application to design and refine the UI/UX process using existing implementation and once I could achieve that task to some level, I'll try to work on porting the code to Go.
There is no set time line for the tasks I just explained, as this whole process is very much experimentation and using the stack of languages and toolkits which are pretty much alpha stage to build my application using that stack.


[19-Jul-20 07:25 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
So, with all the above explained, there are 2 ways support for ERC-20, Uniswap, Kyber etc etc can be added to subatomic swaps:
- Someone adds that ETH/ERC-20 support to existing subatomic C code
- I reach the point where I can attempt to port the code to go language and then I if I succeed in my attempt then extend it further by adding more cryptocurrencies support to it

Anon send does the same trick. 

In which method was jl777 able to buy komodod with pirate.  Was that to reveal a decryption key or to exchange subatomically node by node?

I think commercial order info on an exchange is better suited than datablob broadcast, even if encrypted (solely for corporate data policy).

Commercial partners can have their own p2p chain each and managed coin distribution in a multi chain solution.

just think of it as an automated escrow


[26-Jul-20 12:17 AM] Mylo#8306
"Commercial order" above refers to "purchase order", so it's just text/invoice data.

If they run the node on their own infrastructure and trade p2p w their partners, its self managed escrow I guess, if that's what you mean by automated.  Then yes.

For smaller suppliers a hosted offering does this automation.

Scope won't include this for v1 iteration, 99% likely. It's nice to know it exists for the far horizon goals.

[22-Aug-20 10:53 PM] jl777c#5810
there are three main parts to the solution
1) the liquidity chain which is a onetime creation but the inventory would need to be continually rebalanced. however, with the built in profit motive, once it gets rolling, it should be self-maintaining. @SHossain  is taking lead on this
2) GUI to make it easy to use, which i assume will be shurli so that is @grewalsatinder 
3) reliable and trustworthy subatomic bobs to do the ARRR <-> vARRR conversion. the more that we have the better overall privacy, so hopefully we can get half a dozen such nodes

once all this is put together, users would just need to specify how much and over what time period and over that time period KMD (or VRSC) is jumblred into a new set of addresses. timing analysis and knapsack analysis is prevented, and there will be very little slippage using the verus liquidity chain. from a practical point the slippage and not knowing what exchange rate you would get was one of the biggest issues. also the design eliminates any fees needed for JUMBLR, but it still gains in value as usage of this grows

this will be the first to combine defi liquidity conversion and privacy

the things that are at the border of transparent and zaddr are the vARRR <-> ARRR subatomic swaps, so that is what needs to be jumblred


[22-Aug-20 11:35 PM] jl777c#5810
all the rest other than the ARRR z2z are transparent, so nothing special needs to be done to them. however the end result should be fixed sized addresses of KMD, say 1000 or 10000 denomination. so the end result are a bunch of fresh KMD addresses, all with the same amounts. anything that is fractional is pushed through the system again to end up with the smaller denomination end result


[22-Aug-20 11:37 PM] jl777c#5810
this prevents correlation of the final destination. along the way timing analysis is prevented by all nodes synchronizing to every 10 ARRR blocks, but sometimes randomly deciding to do nothing. the longer time period you set, the more private it is as the effective anon set (total number of fixed sized destinations) is bigger the longer the timeframe is. we hope that the big whales would be doing this process over many months


[23-Aug-20 12:09 AM] jl777c#5810
the important thing to make sure is to prevent timing attack and knapsack attacks. those are very powerful ways to deanonymize. since we are staring with taddr and ending with taddr, both timing and knapsack analysis is possible, even though it went through the PIRATE anon set. the pirate anon set makes it so that if you avoid the timing and knapsack attacks, then it becomes very private


[23-Aug-20 12:12 AM] jl777c#5810
by not charging anything more than txfees, it becomes practical to iterate the process, so for fractional amounts at a bigger size, it can just be processed again with a smaller target size for the fraction. also, the fixed sized funds in the destination address can also be iterated, which means we can have continually looping funds, that are happening in addition to onetime processed, but no way to differentiate. to make this work, we will need hundreds or thousands of active jumblr happening at the same time. once we can establish that, then people that start, stop, wait for a while, resume, stop, wait, resume, ... their effective anon set becomes very large. of course the price risk of keeping it in ARRR increases, but if ARRR price is increasing, then this is not a bad thing


[23-Aug-20 12:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the design is a bit of overkill, but that is insurance against some assumption being violated. that being said, it wont matter if the vARRR and even the vARRR conversion to ARRR is done in bulk unique size. since there are taddr aspects to that anyway, not much is gained by making those fixed sizes.

JUMBLR is just part of the liquidity chain, not involved at all in the subatomic swaps


[23-Aug-20 12:20 AM] jl777c#5810
once vARRR is issued, it will be like a normal assetchain

[23-Aug-20 12:21 AM] jl777c#5810
to convert from the liquidity chain (VRSC-KMD-vARRR-JUMBLR) you will need to make special multichain conversion call, but that is just a rpc call to that chain. shossain will get the details on what exact commands to make

JUMBLR being part of the multichain liquidity pool will have the effect of JUMBLR price increasing as the amount of other coins in the liquidity pool increase. since JUMBLR coin is not part of the process, it will always be lagging the other coins in the liquidity pool. which means its price will be pushed up as other coins have their liquidity increased


[23-Aug-20 12:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I haven't tested VRSC chains yet. so these VRSC chains are similar to `komodod -ac_name=SOMECHAIN`? and the subatomic swap will treat it like an assetchain?


[23-Aug-20 12:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the vARRR chain will be a manual gateway chain so people send ARRR and get vARRR in return. vARRR will be an ordinary chain, with some specific set of parameters that shossain will make

Thinking out loud (_so excuse if this looks silly_):
This sounds like a decent amount of undertaking. Based on this assumption, we'd need to break this down like a project (_I'm not a project manager_) rather than organic (_somewhat haphazard_) development of a solution.

I need help in answering the following bits:

What: 
Using ARRR privacy to make an automated KMD mixer

Why:
Using ARRR privacy to create private amounts of a transparent currency

How: 
- Combine JUMBLR, subatomic, ARRR and VRSC liquidity chains into a KMD/VRSC mixer.
-  message.txt being the reference

What are the unknowns:
- reliable vARRR bob.

Stakeholders:
- Shossain
- grewalsatinder
- mrlynch


[23-Aug-20 12:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i will jump start the vARRR chain by manually issuing X amount, in exchange for having a matched amount of ARRR reserved to cover it


[23-Aug-20 12:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the I will swap this vARRR for ARRR from the vARRR subatomic bob operators

the KMD in fixed sized destination amounts wont be as private as ARRR, but it will be a lot more private than existing KMD and the KMD being a lot more liquid than ARRR gives value to the ARRR side too


[23-Aug-20 12:32 AM] jl777c#5810

[23-Aug-20 12:35 AM] jl777c#5810
subatomic swaps between vARRR and ARRR should work with existing codebase, needs to be verified to be 100% sure, but i dont see why any changes are needed


[23-Aug-20 12:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the GUI will need to make some liquidity chain calls, basically sending funds into it and taking funds out of it


[23-Aug-20 12:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

it is just a standalone chain, so should just work like any other standalone chain


[23-Aug-20 12:38 AM] jl777c#5810
ARRR has the best privacy and verus has the best blockchain enforced liquidity (better than uniswap), JUMBLR solves the timing/knapsack attacks, subatomic allows ARRR to be swapped for a transparent coin


[23-Aug-20 12:38 AM] jl777c#5810
this puts all four of those things together in an easy to use one click GUI


[23-Aug-20 12:39 AM] jl777c#5810
you should be able to say "jumblr X amount of KMD over N days" and then the GUI would use the various components to achieve this. if it is stopped, that is actually good from a randomization/delay standpoint. it will just resume when it is started again


[23-Aug-20 12:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the output would be "special" KMD addresses that have no history, with all of them having the identical amounts in them

instead of trading against an orderbook of orders, you trade with a blockchain liquidity pool


[23-Aug-20 12:43 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I have to read on uniswaps. to be honest I haven't explored uniswap etc at all.


[23-Aug-20 12:43 AM] jl777c#5810
so the price depends on the balance of the coins locked  in the liquidity pool


[23-Aug-20 12:43 AM] jl777c#5810
lets say there are 100 KMD and 1000 ARRR locked. then the conversion price would be 0.1KMD per ARRR


[23-Aug-20 12:44 AM] jl777c#5810
there are lots of details in the actual price setting, as it changes as people add/remove coins from the liquidity pool


[23-Aug-20 12:45 AM] jl777c#5810
however, if some whale puts in a LOT of KMD and ARRR at a fixed ratio, then the price will always be close to that ratio as long as the total net trades of any coin is small compared to the total locked in the liquidity pool


[23-Aug-20 12:45 AM] jl777c#5810
that will virtually eliminate price slippage over the time the jumblr is doing its thing


[23-Aug-20 12:46 AM] jl777c#5810
essentially you swap against the blockchain and not another trader


[23-Aug-20 12:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the issue with past designs of KMD -> ARRR -> <jumblr> -> KMD was that the conversion price would have to be done via atomic swaps, which required active bobs and an atomic swap process. the verus liquidity chain condenses that part to a single transfer that you can do from a single node


[23-Aug-20 12:49 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, this process can be used with any other coin that is supported by the liquidity chain, but with txfees being such a big issue, using KMD will cost contain the gas/txfee issue and nowadays KMD is trading 10 million+ USD, every day. so this becomes feasible


[23-Aug-20 12:50 AM] jl777c#5810
@grewalsatinder the destination addresses should be in a separate or at least segregated wallet so the user wont accidentally contaminate it with funds from other addresses. i think a good way is to just add some prefix/suffix to the main passphrase and use that to generate a set of destination addresses


[23-Aug-20 12:51 AM] jl777c#5810
that way, to access the funds, you need to log into a single such address and that means you can only spend funds in that address. that isolates the spending of the jumblr funds


[23-Aug-20 12:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so for N destination address, the GUI can calculate the address for 
"jumblr 0" + <main passphrase>
"jumblr 1" + <main passphrase>
....


[23-Aug-20 12:54 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, another clarification. the jumblr process should just work with all the zaddr funds in the jumblr zaddr. that way, people can just add ARRR directly to that address and bypass the converting KMD via the liquidity chain step. this will further enhance the jumblr anon set as now we dont even know that the output addresses are funded by KMD -> liquidity chain -> vARRR -> ARRR


[23-Aug-20 12:54 AM] jl777c#5810
it could have just been ARRR from whatever other source


[23-Aug-20 12:55 AM] jl777c#5810
this feature wont take any additional effort in the GUI, as you just use the total in the zaddr, and dont care where the ARRR came from


[23-Aug-20 12:55 AM] jl777c#5810
so using the backend half, it becomes a way to convert ARRR into fixed size KMD addresses without any other linkage

@jl777c will vARRR be only pegged to just ARRR ?


[23-Aug-20 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
vARRR is a proxy token for ARRR


[23-Aug-20 01:06 AM] jl777c#5810
as far as the jumblr process is concerned, it is equivalent in value to ARRR


[23-Aug-20 01:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
1. The point of needing reliable Bobs in subatomic swaps, is there any chance that Bobs could be of any issue in this whole architecture to track, analyse or de-anonymise the Jumblr transactions and funds for any crypto currencies jumblred through them?
2. the vARRR Proxy token is centrally issued by you? or is that a decentralised process? For me personally I have great trust in you so it isn't much of an issue if you centrally issue vARRR proxy token on VRSC chain, because I can have _trust_ on you for having the same amount of 1:1 (vARRR:ARRR). But for others, you think this could be a concerning point? Or may be I'm missing something because I yet to read and understand VRSC tech updates.


[23-Aug-20 01:16 AM] jl777c#5810
2. it will need to be centrally issued as ARRR is totally private, no way to do it any other way. it is basically like a CEX when you make a deposit. however if everybody treats vARRR as ARRR equivalent during the jumblr process, then that is what matters. eg. as long as the vARRR liquidity in the liquidity chain matches the ARRR value, it actually doesnt matter if the vARRR is not having 1:1 backing. of course it will.


[23-Aug-20 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
one point is that only the jumblr period is at risk, so if you do a short term jumblr, then the risk for default is minimized


[23-Aug-20 01:19 AM] jl777c#5810
if you use the same zaddr and ip address for all the subatomic swaps, then an evil bob could indeed monitor things deduce a fair amount. that is why we need as many bobs as practical and to randomize which ones are used, and i guess having multiple zaddr will be a very good thing


[23-Aug-20 01:19 AM] jl777c#5810
if the GUI can handle N different jumblr zaddr, that will allow a design resistant to evil bob


[23-Aug-20 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
if GUI can have multiple subatomic pubkeys that it randomly selects to a random bob, things get even harder. however, as long as there is no link between the source zaddr and dest zaddr, the bobs can only be guessing. but definitely will need to have at least two subatomic pubkeys, one for each direction. that will break the link that bobs can see. also using different ip address for each direction, would then remove ip address correlation from bob


[23-Aug-20 01:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
As per current design, the GUI only is helping defining the pubkey, t address, and z address for the DEXP2P chain, and executing the DEXP2P API and subatomic commands to to subatomic swaps.
From this latest description, I think it's not possible to just change the pubkey and other details for DEXP2P on the fly without shutting down the DEXP2P chain first and then restarting it with the new set again, and then proceeding with the further swaps.

and rotating through N different dexp2p pubkeys, one per startup seems to randomize the pubkey linkage


[23-Aug-20 01:42 AM] jl777c#5810
or maybe just make a new random pubkey with each time you start shurli. why to use the same dexp2p pubkey more than once?


[23-Aug-20 01:43 AM] jl777c#5810
a session based pubkey should be sufficient


[23-Aug-20 01:43 AM] SHossain#0007
having same pubkey for bob make sense in a way as they have to be verified by that pubkey. this is not required for alice

I was also thinking of handling the multiple Jumblr z address generated from a seed word.
as you explained, I can make a randomised N number and use that for a new session of DEXP2P settings set (pubkey, taddr, zaddr). example:
jumblr 234398 + <main passphrase>

and next startup use a different one. And save this 234398 number in an encrypted file which is encrypted using the <main passphrase>, which can be checked later to find which seed was used to make the swaps last time, and also to remember which passphrase has the funds in them.


[23-Aug-20 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, something like that that allows only the alice node to reconstruct

one change to reduce reliance on the centrally issued nature of vARRR is to do the vARRR -> ARRR conversion incrementally in smallish sizes, maybe the max 1000.0002 ARRR size. this is then done iteratively, interleaved with the other direction. that way, only a small percentage of funds is in vARRR form at any given time, though the time limitation reduces the jumblr anon set, so that is the downside of this. i guess it can be something the user decides, more privacy by converting to ARRR all at once. less risk relying on vARRR if the -> ARRR side is done incrementally

> @ns408 what: automated KMD mixer
@jl777c But on the other hand, here you summarize the system only as an "automated KMD mixer", and not anymore as an exchange.


[20-Sep-20 12:38 PM] t_dan#3334
So what role do the KMD, VRSC, JUMBLR and vARRR exactly play? Will I be only able to make anonymous my existing KMD coins? Or my VRSC coins? Or can I at the same time swap (against the liquidity pool) let's say KMD to VRSC, or KMD to ARRR, or VRSC to JUMBLR?


[20-Sep-20 12:41 PM] t_dan#3334
And if it's intended to not only be a mixer (unlike uniswap), but at the same time an exchange (like uniswap), then would it be able to support more coins other than the mentioned four coins in the liquidity pool / liquidity chain? What about other chains, that are not part of the Komodo ecosystem, like BTC, LTC, ETH etc.? Could they be included into the system / liquidity chain?


[20-Sep-20 12:45 PM] t_dan#3334
I'm thinking a "uniswap"-like exchange (with the liquidity pool that you trade against instead of an orderbook), but not limited to ETH, but cross-chain. Or is the exchange part of the laid out system limited to only KMD, VRSC, ARRR and JUMBLR?


[20-Sep-20 12:52 PM] t_dan#3334
In summary, I'm having a hard time understanding the combining of the "mixer" part and the "exchange" part. And also the exchange limitation to only four coins, unlike uniswap which supports many coins.


[20-Sep-20 08:06 PM] CyberTrucker#5260
If i understand it correctly, the mixer works with a time factor to spread out your transaction into numerous ones (making it harder to trace). The exchange part of it is that all these smaller transactions could be susceptible to slippage over time and would need bid/asks to be met. With the Verus liquidity pool model, you are trading against the blockchain, at an efficient price, and against a liquidity pool that is always there to fill your order.

any coin could be setup to be mixed. over time, the deposited amount is converted into N fixed sized outputs in fresh addresses


[21-Sep-20 02:00 AM] jl777c#5810
using an intermediate coin creates the risk of big slippage if you have to rely on finding a counterparty to the trade, so using the liquidity pool method, you will at least know the slippage will be within some (hopefully) reasonable range. spread out over long enough time, it has a cost averaging effect


[21-Sep-20 11:47 AM] t_dan#3334
> any coin could be setup to be mixed. over time, the deposited amount is converted into N fixed sized outputs in fresh addresses
@jl777c So is it mixing without exchanging (e.g. mix KMD, but still receive KMD)?
Or is it exchanging and mixing at the same time (e.g. sell KMD, receive "mixed" VRSC etc.)?

Jumblr is a process of exchanging and that makes the exchanged funds non-trackable

So you would Jumlr KMD for KMD .... but someone could set up a swap mechanism in the future... @t_dan - everything imaginable can be made possible with KMD it seems... the bigger the use case the faster it will get attention here....Except no one seems to care about Decentralized Distributed Web "everything" here ATM... Except for the fact that subatomic payments will be used to pay advertising videos and content providers.... looks like with zfunds that can be Jumblr 'd into several non traceable accounts......

Hi, just wanted to let you know that after installing Shurli v0.25, the orderbook suddenly shows entries. I didn't change anything else.


[25-Sep-20 01:26 AM] t_dan#3334
But only KMD/PIRATE, not KMD/VRSC or others. Maybe nobody created any orders for other pairs?

Thank you! The swap process itself is insanely fast and flawless! An awesome experience!
After understanding the app and the concept a little better, I have several improvement suggestions:


[25-Sep-20 01:28 AM] t_dan#3334
- An update of the README.md would be appreciated, since it still tells you to edit a config.json etc.


[25-Sep-20 01:28 AM] t_dan#3334
- Instead of showing the "address error" messages and having the user to press the "fix" button for each address, this procedure is irritating and should be done automatically. Since the system itself is complex enough, it's a good idea to remove or avoid any unnecessary element of additional complexity. As I understood it, Shurli generates its own seeds and addresses, stores them into the wallet.json, and then has to "register" those addresses into the komodo, pirate etc. wallets. Since this is not something optional, but very neccessary, it should be done automatically.


[25-Sep-20 01:29 AM] t_dan#3334
- What is the point of giving the user the possibility to enter different addresses or pubkeys in the Shurli settings when those would differ from the seeds and addresses in the wallet.json? In my opinion, there should not be an option to manually enter / change the addresses. Instead, it would make more sense to have a "show addresses" and "export seed" or "export private keys" feature, like normal wallets have. It's a little stretch for average users to retrieve the seeds etc. by finding a special "wallet.json" filein a special folder, instead of being able to export or show them directly from the GUI.


[25-Sep-20 01:29 AM] t_dan#3334
- One important feature request would be the encryption of the seeds and keys. Currently, they are stored as plain text in the wallet.json, which is not good practice and pretty dangerous. It should be encrypted by a user password, before they are even stored into a file.


[25-Sep-20 01:29 AM] t_dan#3334
- Since Shurli has full control over its generated seeds and addresses, it would also be able to offer regular wallet functionality. Currently, you need the external wallets to manually send or receive funds, but it would be nice to have a wallet tab directly within Shurli, so that no external wallets would be needed. Currently, you need to open KomodoOcean, PirateQT, and Shurli to have the wallets plus subatomic swaps. How about opening only one app, namely Shurli, to have wallet and swap functionality all in one app?


[25-Sep-20 01:35 AM] grewalsatinder#9653

agree to the most part of the suggestions that allowing the users to download the seed to a file etc.
I had in mind about allowing both options
- save/export seed to file
- print the seed/privkey etc, which allows them to print it as a paper wallet, with QR code etc. etc.

The requirement of editing and manually updating the set of addresses etc is because I'm invisioning the Shurli GUI from the point of view of JUMBLR application, where the user will has to manage not few but most probably 100s or 1000s of such pair of keys. Those pair of addresses can sure be derived from single seed, and could possibly be manually edited. I'll think of that process better when the right time will come, but for now for quick graphical interface I only allowed just the editing of existing config.json contents through settings page.

very much agree on this point too. I intend to use AES+GCM encryption to store the wallet.json file as encrypted file. But for this initial PoC I did not do too much of efforts on this part.

Also agree on all these points.
That too is due to the reason I wanted to solve the graphical interface design problem, that how I want to layout the interface and flow of user actions.
This type of subatomic swaps are not exactly the same as centralised exchanges, so I wanted to give a try to different type of trade approach than whatever EVERYBODY in the industry is using.
I took the inspiration from LocalBitcoins and CoinSwitch types of trading exchanges, which shows offers by traders in the form of classifieds etc. Or on CoinSwitch's view point in the form of showing which exchange is showing better price of deal for the trade amount user wants to exchange etc.
I thought focusing on figuring out this part first and see how people react to it could be good exploration, so I just give that a try.


[25-Sep-20 01:38 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I can sure work on full multi-currency wallet. I did that with Iguana Wallet, which then later re-branded to Agama Wallet, and I can do that sort of work again. But from my past experience I can tell it's too much time consuming if I just start with wallet management, and then get back to the subatomic trading ui interface part.
This time I totally skipped on managing the wallets part and only focused on the trading UI part, to give my self a little boost.
Also at the time I started Iguana Wallet in 2016, I was initially hired by jl777 to make a trading UI application for EasyDEX/InstantDEX, and I found there was no other wallet which was providing wallet functionality. So, I tried solving that before I solved the EasyDEX GUI, so at that time it was making sense to start right from the wallet functionality.
This time there are plenty of other options to take care of wallets, so to me it made sense to focus on trading part. That's the reason I did not chose to make inbuilt multi-currency wallet functionality coding first.
I sure intend to make multi-currency wallet in Shurli, coz that is indeed the need of it in such kind of application. Specially with the Bob side of application, where there will be a Market Maker who wants to manage all the funds remotely on a secure server, running Shurli-server. You can expect something on this part soon. I'm working on this already. üôÇ

@grewalsatinder Here's one more suggestion: In the wallet.json file, there is the generated seed (mnemonic phrase). From it, you'll also see the derived compressed and uncompressed private keys in wallet import format, the public key and the address. Then, there's the generated ZPrivateKey and the derived ZAddress for PirateChain.
Currently, the seed (mnemonic) and the ZPrivateKey seem to be unrelated, and thus for a complete backup of the Shurli wallets, you would need to backup both. My feature request would be to derive the ZPrivateKey also from the mnemonic seed, so that you would have a full Shurli backup only with the 24 seed words. This could be accomplished like this: Put the mnemonic through the same function that the seed-based PirateLite wallet uses. It is able to derive secret-extended-keys from a mnemonic, like HD wallets do. So instead of generating the Shurli ZPrivateKey independently of the 24 word seed, you could use the 24 word seed as the root even for the Pirate address.

You only need 24 word seed to restore both public and shielded address.

@mrlynch the current task that I'm working on is to make a gRPC feature in kmdgo package, which allows streaming of wallet transaction update everytime that wallet gets a new block from the network.
For that I could use go lib btcsuite's wire which checks on the network TPC messages, but I thought I just check on the debug.log with regex, so just made a test code to do that.
Next I'll make a gRPC test code to issue some commands like `getinfo`, `listtransactions` etc with the trigger pushed by this new block found notification.

One strange thing is that in the Shurli dashboard, the shielded ARRR balance is labelled zARRR, while the transparent ARRR balance is labelled ARRR. Since for normal users the ARRR is always shielded, it's a little confusing or inconsistent that in all PirateChain wallets such shielded balance is always referred to as "ARRR", while in Shurli, it is referred to as "zARRR".

[25-Sep-20 02:44 AM] t_dan#3334
@grewalsatinder And another feature request: In the trade tab, it would make sense to have a "sort by price" feature (maybe as default?), not only "sort by expiring soon / late". The reason being that you might get a bad price if you pick the order listed at the top. In other exchanges, you can always be sure to get the best price when you pick the order listed at the top. When sorting by "expiring", I found that the price can be bad at the top and better down the list.

It also needs grouping of orders based on the trader's -pubkey/handle.

Can making Bob pay a "long term" deposit of some sort make him more trusted? is there a way to add trust to bob? Trying to make DEXP2P "everything" work better with subatomics  "Bob the (Verus ID) Broker / Betting Bookie / Content Provider"  - with transaction times at 15-30 seconds this tech should be pushed to its max IMO @jl777c


[20-Oct-20 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
suree, bob can. make a deposit to act as collateral against bad. actions, but doing. that wouild require a trusted escrow


[20-Oct-20 06:34 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
trusted escrow would be made in a CC?


[20-Oct-20 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and then it becomes a lot more technical debt


[20-Oct-20 06:35 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
thats above me but I see the payment system a worth while thought


[20-Oct-20 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and not all chains are. able to do CC


[20-Oct-20 06:44 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
lets just use Shurli as a use case - Shuli "ID broker / Bet Dapp / Content Provider" if it works in Shurli - what am I missing ---- a bridge could be built if there was trust in bob


[20-Oct-20 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is that already trusted. community members would be the bob


[20-Oct-20 07:02 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
yep -- like ebay --- just needs a really good reputation system implemented --- verified deposits could be added later for larger purchases -- "3rd party Escrow provider" -- yeah -- start smashing those keys @grewalsatinder ---"Shurli" the new decentralized ebay of everything --- could even do the listings on DexP2P and require an AtomicSwap for purchase -- that actually solves it. See, talking out loud works for me


[20-Oct-20 07:05 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
its listing content on dexp2p and building roads to connect the dots - ipfs, MM2, subatomic payments,


[20-Oct-20 07:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
selling VerusID will be expensive including escrow, but sure trust factor can be solved if including a trusted escrow party.


[20-Oct-20 07:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't know how much updateidentity command costs


[20-Oct-20 07:07 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
you can just list the sale in dexp2p - eventually update identity wil be the price of the transaction


[20-Oct-20 07:07 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
the transaction can happen in mm2


[20-Oct-20 07:08 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
if this dapp plugs into Atomic Defi


[20-Oct-20 07:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
verusid is not a currency so that it can be transacted or sent in small chunks. it is 1 single command of updateidentity, and the first time buying it costs 80 VRSC or lower depending on if reference used or not.


[20-Oct-20 07:09 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the trustless solution should be waited to be implemented by verus itself.


[20-Oct-20 07:09 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280

i hear you -- this isnt just about Verus IDs


[20-Oct-20 07:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I was thinking of some kind of escrow app, where a list of escrow is shown, and if they are available online, they could be included to take part of the swap


[20-Oct-20 07:10 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
it will not be subatomic swaps, but it becomes an edited version of subatomic swaps


[20-Oct-20 07:11 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
a custom build of subatomic swaps


[20-Oct-20 07:12 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
right --- plus option of using regular mm2 for certain Crypto swaps


[20-Oct-20 07:12 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
including but not limited to VRSC IDs


[20-Oct-20 07:13 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
could be nike@ swaps


[20-Oct-20 07:13 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
they are not going to build a auction for IDs any time soon


[20-Oct-20 07:15 AM] Mylo#8306

[20-Oct-20 07:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
with escrow app, I think the process could be:
- trusted escrows list themselves or announce themselves on DEXP2P messages, with their pubkey/escrow_fee_percentage/handle
- users who want to trade verusID, select this escrow from the list, and put a trade offer with details such as VerusID/price/escrow_pubkey/their_own_pubkey/handle
- buyer who wants to buy verusID, selects the offer, and send the initiate request to the ID seller, if accepted, the swap is initialised
- buyer sends funds to escrow, seller waits for the funds confirmation with escrow
- seller does `updateidentity` command to escrow
- escrow confirms both funds are confirmed and ID is owned by escrow and shows `ismine` equivalent check
- keeps it's cut, and releases the funds to ID seller and executes the `updateidentity` to ID buyer.

a lot of technical detail is skipped in this quick detail, but I think it is possible using DEXP2P messaging.


[20-Oct-20 07:17 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the escrow has to push the `release` button manually to complete the trade


[20-Oct-20 07:18 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
and escrow's reputation can be counted by the percentage of fee they collected in their own pubkey linked address


[20-Oct-20 07:20 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
--- cool -- make a verus ID so I can invest when everything is live --- tired of sitting on the fringe


[20-Oct-20 07:23 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
`updateidentity` costs 0.0001 VRSC (normal transaction costs)


[20-Oct-20 07:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so, I think by the quick description this kind of DEXP2P escrow based verusID trading app is possible.


[20-Oct-20 07:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there must be some loose ends in this idea. May be @jl777c can point out


[20-Oct-20 07:36 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
you can host a website inside dexp2p or a link that goes to ipfs website @Mylo

I've realized explaining the entire system is the only way to get people to start working on the different parts - so Right now I'm just laying it out - Alice to inDEX  to adDEX and  Bob's content stored in IPFS searchable through  (file DEX / porn DEX / coin DEX Bookie DEX) dexP2P networks using the inDEX search engine.  -- All this using a skined version of Kodi Media Center which could be installed on TV boxes with IPFS hard drives and AmnesiaOS (yet to be created) - "trusted" subatomic payment system and trusted bobs are a necessity.  - ill keep drawing up the whole plan - but its pretty big considering it will take over the entire internet as we know it. @Mylo  a 7 tier "referral" program,  retail trade shows / fairs, and a 2 minute DRTV spot is how I plan to market it to general population. Free streamung TV and making referral revenue are the top sell points for general pop.  Ill keep laying it out. But if you have any questions, please ask.

> I've realized explaining the entire system is the only way to get people to start working on the different parts - so Right now I'm just laying it out - Alice to inDEX  to adDEX and  Bob's content stored in IPFS searchable through  (file DEX / porn DEX / coin DEX Bookie DEX) dexP2P networks using the inDEX search engine.  -- All this using a skined version of Kodi Media Center which could be installed on TV boxes with IPFS hard drives and AmnesiaOS (yet to be created) - "trusted" subatomic payment system and trusted bobs are a necessity.  - ill keep drawing up the whole plan - but its pretty big considering it will take over the entire internet as we know it. @Mylo  a 7 tier "referral" program,  retail trade shows / fairs, and a 2 minute DRTV spot is how I plan to market it to general population. Free streamung TV and making referral revenue are the top sell points for general pop.  Ill keep laying it out. But if you have any questions, please ask.
@Tylor zkFS  I glossed over this earlier but this is pretty fucking cool dude.

you will be able to stake with the device as well


[21-Oct-20 05:56 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
seeders and leachers just like torrents - but you get paid to seed and pay to leach


[21-Oct-20 05:56 PM] actionslacks#4072
is it open source? most tv's no longer have boxes here. a raspian build would be killer blockchain app. I don't know if it has the processing to handle it though.

[21-Oct-20 05:59 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
i wanted to port to android - but the tech isnt ready


[21-Oct-20 06:01 PM] actionslacks#4072
ha, yeah there it is, a whole piece of hardware I haven't even seen before


[21-Oct-20 06:02 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
dexp2p is tcp/Ip and nspv is not yet mobile ready


[21-Oct-20 06:03 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
so it phones will have to connect to home EdgeP2P server


[21-Oct-20 06:04 PM] actionslacks#4072
what is this edge p2p server? should i google this too?


[21-Oct-20 06:05 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
no- it is an edge computing device I branded last year to edgeP2P and now changing brand to inDEX


[21-Oct-20 06:06 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
alibaba has edge computing devices 4k that run linux


[21-Oct-20 06:07 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280

[21-Oct-20 06:07 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
there is a prebuilt kodi linux setup as well


[21-Oct-20 06:09 PM] actionslacks#4072

grandma aint buying storj


[21-Oct-20 08:27 PM] actionslacks#4072
well I wouldn't worry much about grandma at this stage. as long as any tech saavy person can do what they set out to do with it, this could be pretty revolutionary. I remember blowing my bud's minds with my shitty little raspi winamp/old school game rom playing raspi a few years back, It's easy to take for granted how bleeding edge and rapidly changing the stuff going on here is. htpc's are an exploding market, especially with the lockdowns and people needing cheap, quality home entertainment. If you buy a $50 box and let's say $5/month worth of crypto keeps you flush in entertainment, then you're pissing on a every streaming competitor in the market from a great height. The content creators get more of an equitable share, and the transaction bandwidth is provided for by a more equitable network. And you're not paying to have your data harvested by media moguls


[21-Oct-20 08:30 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
whats crazy is you can get 4-$500 retail if it is a PC and not just a android box - PLUS subscriptions to IPTV network - PLUS Ad revenue from adDEX or PPV on demand "content"

it's true, there's a strange, suspiciously unnatural army of people all over the country who think and live in a way that just shouldn't be possible for any rational human to accept, it's scary how much it seems like hypnosis or something.  I *guess* it's because of the weird origins of the colonies and how incredibly screwed up (and recent) the 'wild west' was, that's my rational explanation for half of us being totally twisted, but who knows.  It ain't me, babe.

Flow is in link above - I have to get the UI prototype done today - I think if I work on both at the same time ill be able to be more accurate  with things @‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª using Lucid for flow and marvel APP for UI I will post updated links today and add Shurli to the flow @grewalsatinder - first time using these apps so it is taking a few more minutes -- but I will get it  -- I think shurliCoin could be 3rd party  escrow if it is reserve coin backed by vUSD with a CC_Chain on Komodo??


[22-Oct-20 04:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there is no ShurliCoin


[22-Oct-20 04:49 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there is a DEXP2P layer asset chain, SHURLI0


[22-Oct-20 04:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
only used for creating DEXP2P network, and nothing for coin etc


[22-Oct-20 08:33 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Just got to figure out the escrow part for Bob - (Full trust) in Bob would be Shurli - (Some trust) would be 'Shuli + Escrow' - (No Trust) would be MM2, Depending on what is being traded - 'Shurli + Escrow' may not be used or needed often or at all -- need to think of things that transaction times need to be fast for larger amounts of coin or Items. (betting) ect -- i guess there is other ways like JL777 mentioned with CCs and oracles but that shit is above my head.

ad revs - streaming content - (micro payments) can be pushed through Shuli - or inside a Shurli type UI, adDEX  would have a list of ads you can place on your content and the highest payers would obviously be at the top of the list. For N amount of click throughs. Advertisers would select the inDEX sub categories that the wish to be a part of. DEXP2P networks (TVinDEX / XXXinDEX / CoinDEX) - to skip ads user would need to be seeders and miners ect to earn the revenue to pay the ad price preferred by Content provider.  - This would not require fully trusted Bobs -Users could also earn inDEX 'credits' by showing their titties or having referral income - getting the P2P- Device and or PC APP in their hands is priority #1 - Get Kodi UI loaded on top of PiriateOS and include Verusd / Komodod / MM2 / nSPV /-----storj??? / IPFS?? -- working on the prototype UI today

Came up with the userdata storage to be connected with the seed while testing BarterDEX in October of 17 -- why store swap history on local PC when we claim to keep privacy?? Most recently, why is user history on mobile different than PC? answer was then and now to save swap history in IPFS to be loaded when seed is loaded -- The use case wasn't big enough then or I guess or nobody heard me.  I then added concept USB AmnesiaOS from a tails fork  about the same time - then added DEXP2P and nSPV  for Movies and other decentralized content on kodi early this year .... its time to store user data on IPFS using the seed and its time to sell files / VerusIDs, ect using Shuri or similar UI.  Today - it is the time - please help me bring this project to fruition.


[22-Oct-20 07:31 PM] alkimi#1111
My thoughts immediately went to a stand-alone device as well. Although I doubt it's possible with something similar to the YubiKey devices, maybe a larger, battery-pack-sized device that can physically connect to another one and has a simple interface, perhaps nothing more than an LED matrix and a few indicator lights to indicate 'establishing link'...'sending'... etc.


[22-Oct-20 07:31 PM] alkimi#1111
but I would really like to see if it's possible to involve something like a yubikey


[22-Oct-20 07:33 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
"edge computing device" alibaba is where my R&D took me


[22-Oct-20 07:35 PM] alkimi#1111
maybe if a recipient is already known, and a payment amount is already determined, a tiny key like that could be configured to be a one-time transaction device that cannot be completed if it doesn't get to the right person, then the main wallet device could be either on kodi or whatever machine needs to keep that static memory


[22-Oct-20 07:35 PM] alkimi#1111
kept in a secure location


[22-Oct-20 07:36 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
but yubikey similar for the OS at a hotel or something super private -- Edward Snowden used/uses tails


[22-Oct-20 07:37 PM] alkimi#1111
well the yubikey has zero processing power but it can contain a key and can be signed by an NFC device with the proper key, I believe


[22-Oct-20 07:38 PM] alkimi#1111
but really I was hoping to create something custom that just uses the same tech


[22-Oct-20 07:38 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
transaction s can be stored on blockchain


[22-Oct-20 07:38 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280

[22-Oct-20 07:39 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
not seeing the use case


[22-Oct-20 07:39 PM] alkimi#1111
but then a  network connection is required to make the 'handoff'


[22-Oct-20 07:39 PM] alkimi#1111
what if someone could put a payment on a keychain and just give that to whomever


[22-Oct-20 07:39 PM] alkimi#1111
once it's signed and stored on the chain, the device can literally be burned


[22-Oct-20 07:40 PM] alkimi#1111
otherwise the transaction never even begins


[22-Oct-20 07:40 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
put half the keys in p2sh


[22-Oct-20 07:40 PM] alkimi#1111
yea, that sounds right


[22-Oct-20 07:40 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280

with timelocked funds


[22-Oct-20 07:41 PM] alkimi#1111
yea I believe the yubikey can store private keys that can never be retrieved from it


[22-Oct-20 07:42 PM] alkimi#1111
have to see how difficult it would be to replicate that tech


[22-Oct-20 07:42 PM] alkimi#1111

hopefully add a payload to a transaction and add a coin to prove the transaction happened on an exporer

and as you can see --- 1000000 spin offs can happen if Komodo Platform creates a Web3 interface --- i think my outline is basic enough


[23-Oct-20 09:44 AM] actionslacks#4072
Thats kind of the issue, it's a brilliant idea but as of yet all we have is an outline. The hardware is proprietary, and the interface still needs the middleware to talk to the apis. needs more meat on the bone.


[23-Oct-20 09:51 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I think if they integrate Web3 into AtomicDEX for orderbooks and history - I can then hire devs or partner with them to work on a specific project -- Or go to investors with a PoC and get funding for apps...


[23-Oct-20 09:53 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Komodo platform and the KMD coin will add many transactions with this

[23-Oct-20 09:57 AM] actionslacks#4072
the benefit to the ecosystem could be huge, that's a given. The proof of concept will be where the rubber hits the road. limiting the the product to one type of hardware makes it more cumbersome to decentralized development.

Is Shurli / subatomic swaps still a thing? Considering the current difficulty of selling ARRR over CEXes, it‚Äòs too bad that the already well-working Shurli is no available solution today. It looked very promising and was already working half a year ago, and im not sure why that path hasn‚Äôt been continued. Seems there is no subatomic swap software solution anymore or am I missing something?


[10-Apr-21 11:39 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I stopped working on Subatomic DEX software.
The existing proof of concept already provided the proof that it works and how to put it all together.
There was shown interest in PIRATE community to make a subatomic DEX under PIRATE's brand name, so I'd suggest to contact anyone who is doing that effort, if anyone still doing it. I am un-informed on any such actions if even done in open or secret etc.

I felt demotivated since even after half+ year only 2-3 people tested what I actually had built.
There was near to no interest in testing and giving feedback.

I am currently helping CHIPS project, and also on to my efforts for Shurli-Core framework's different parts. So, I'll only get back to any subatomic DEX types of applications using my Shurli-Core framework whenever I'll have it at some good stage.
There is not set date or timeline on that, as I'm working on these things slowly.


[10-Apr-21 11:46 PM] t_dan#3334
I might have been one of the few people to have tested it and given feedback. That‚Äôs really too bad because I thought such a killer technology would be in the best interest of the entire Komodo and Pirate community and beyond, because you could instantly swap basically anything with anything.


[10-Apr-21 11:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, you are one of them, thankfully üôÇ


[10-Apr-21 11:47 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I will be concentrating more on backend core framework and API side of things, hence putting my efforts on framework and API level of stuff.


[10-Apr-21 11:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Might possible I'll do something using libp2p instead of DEXP2P. But time will tell if I ever reach that point of making such application.


[10-Apr-21 11:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
But it's not happening soon enough from my side.


[10-Apr-21 11:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Since the Proof of Concept is out there, anyone can fork it or make progress further on it.


[10-Apr-21 11:48 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It is out there for months already!


[10-Apr-21 11:51 PM] t_dan#3334
I think the Komodo or Pirate teams should consider this and assign dev resources to it, the same way they assign dev resources to the development of AtomicDEX, Treasure Chest etc.


[10-Apr-21 11:51 PM] t_dan#3334
I mean consider it into their active planning and roadmapping


[10-Apr-21 11:52 PM] t_dan#3334
Maybe they don‚Äôt know it‚Äôs out there or have not been briefed, or don‚Äôt know about the importance of that technology?


[10-Apr-21 11:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Another thing is that subatomic swaps does not make any income for anyone. Not for developer, not for community, but are good way to swap cryptocurrencies only.
For that reason, I could not even think of doing any fund raising efforts, because there is NOTHING to give back to the community.
I really wished I could have had helping hand where I lacked and stucked multiple times.
I have been doing one man show with Subatomic DEX for good while with huge amount of hurdles. It was exhausting and I actually quit work for 1.5+ months feel depressed and unwanted in my work anywhere.
I feel better working with nice co-workes in CHIPS discord.

I guess they know that already, and has grasp of it's importance as well.
It's just that the dev resources are actually really scarce within KMD and are much focused on either AtomicDEX or the better suitable places like Komodo Core technologies like CC

I have no idea if there is any efforts or plans to support other outside projects


[10-Apr-21 11:55 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
And I guess my efforts are somewhere outside the project?? ü§î Not sure, may be


[10-Apr-21 11:56 PM] t_dan#3334
Definitely not! Wasn‚Äôt the original idea of subatomic swaps not even presented by JL777?


[10-Apr-21 11:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep, not just presented, James built the subatomic swaps and DEXP2P


[10-Apr-21 11:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but there needs to be dev resources assigned to it


[10-Apr-21 11:57 PM] t_dan#3334
So shouldn‚Äôt it be a joint effort then?


[10-Apr-21 11:57 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Tokel Platform is amazing example of core tech built by James but extended to be an independent project of it's own using KMD CC tech


[10-Apr-21 11:57 PM] t_dan#3334
And actually very relevant?


[10-Apr-21 11:58 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
But Tokel Platform will have incentive for it's Tokens Holder
I have no idea how making subatomic swaps DEX can make incentivised for any Tokens if issued for this tech in anticipation of funds raise etc.


[10-Apr-21 11:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
With Tokel Platform, it's also dimxy who is working and helping the core CC tech,


[10-Apr-21 11:59 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
there CC developers are even more scarce üòÖ


[11-Apr-21 12:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The lacking is:
- Backend developer
- Frontend devleoper
- Funds for these extra developers

And I can think of even putting these funds from my own pocket if the core technology is not promising any rewards to anyone, but my own survival is on priority for 1-2 years minimum. So, I can not afford to put aside any funds from my own pocket for hiring devs. and there is no motiviation found to contribute to my Subatomic DEX efforts previously I did.


[11-Apr-21 12:02 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
There was one dev who showed intrest, but then haven't heard back.


[11-Apr-21 12:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Anyway, I have no intention to work on Shurli proof of concept to extend further, and I'll better try to make Shurli-Core framework and API focusing on backend development on my free time.


[11-Apr-21 12:03 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Khoji Explorer was one of the part of that framework üôÇ


[11-Apr-21 12:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so, I'm actually putting paid tasks out there now when I feel really stuck to get unstuck to get back in flow with my development efforts


[11-Apr-21 12:04 AM] t_dan#3334
I think the incentive shouldn‚Äôt be the highest priority or a condition. Core technologies of the internet are also free: http, tcp/ip etc.


[11-Apr-21 12:04 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Also, have a paid task on CHIPS Lightning-Network, and still looking for a C developer for CHIPS


[11-Apr-21 12:04 AM] t_dan#3334
Market makers would have an incentive by offering slightly below market


[11-Apr-21 12:05 AM] t_dan#3334
And make some gains in both swap directions.


[11-Apr-21 12:06 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I agree, but to get dev help from outside, there are only two possible ways.
- self motivated developers starts contributing and help
- or paid developers starts doing the tasks which needs to be done.

Sadly self motiviated developer we found so far willing work on Subatomic Swaps was only 1. Me.


[11-Apr-21 12:07 AM] t_dan#3334
That‚Äôs sad. That‚Äôs why I said it should be a focus of the Komodo team and assign resources to its development.


[11-Apr-21 12:07 AM] t_dan#3334
The same way they assign resources to the development of atomicdex.


[11-Apr-21 12:07 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think resources assigned to AtomicDEX are much needed and well deserved.


[11-Apr-21 12:07 AM] Mylo#8306
at least it's there to pick up again when ppl are interested in it.
when atomicdex has traction, the ability to use ARRR will be there


[11-Apr-21 12:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
It is the prime project taking KMD to new hights and is one of the actual central points combining many CC tech of KMD core tech.


[11-Apr-21 12:08 AM] Mylo#8306
the ability to want to use ARRR (and hence shurli) is what i mean

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[11-Apr-21 12:08 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
agree


[11-Apr-21 12:22 AM] t_dan#3334
Are you saying the ARRR will be integrated into AtomicDEX?


[11-Apr-21 12:23 AM] Mylo#8306
no.  that is a dev team choice. unlikely.
but a 3rd party dex could create a gui with atomic dex + shurli.

however, the most likely use case is manually by the users, to make a swap, then say use KMD -> ARRR -> new address KMD & swap again with some other coin


[11-Apr-21 12:24 AM] Mylo#8306
depends on volume, number of users etc.


[11-Apr-21 12:24 AM] Mylo#8306
whether it is effetive


[11-Apr-21 12:28 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
there are multiple ways that ARRR can be traded.
Verus DeFi is one way. It can happen sooner once DeFi is released on Verus Mainnet
Initially the gateway might be centraslied, but as little I know from conversations with core devs like Mike and James, that gateway can also be totally decentraslied as well, so it would be way way more decentralised and superior way to make decentraslied trading of ARRR, without depending on proxy tokens tech.

Another way is changes to the `komodod` code or say Pirate's fork of `komodod` code which allows sending transactions specific to AtomicDEX trading, and that may allow atomic swaps of ARRR on AtomicDEX as well. I think there are such plans on that with PIRATE's core devs. I'm unsure about actual state of this, but just telling from little intereactions with the team.


[11-Apr-21 12:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Another way is this DEXP2P based Subatomic Swaps


[11-Apr-21 12:29 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
the first 2 ways are superior, and 1st way is much better


[11-Apr-21 12:31 AM] t_dan#3334
I heard of vARRR, or wARRR, will that be an Ethereum or Verus token?


[11-Apr-21 12:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
vARRR will be Verus token


[11-Apr-21 12:32 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I don't know the details of wARRR


[11-Apr-21 12:35 AM] t_dan#3334
Ok, these look like some alternative solutions, even though they would not be as straightforward as was shurli: instant swapping of ARRR and KMD directly from your one wallet to your other wallet. No gateways, no deposits, no meta token etc.. But still looking forward to the possibilities on the Verus network.


[11-Apr-21 12:36 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, much agree üôÇ

Just did the first $ZEC atomic swaps! "But that's a BTC fork! It had P2SH atomic swaps performed years ago!" But these were shielded üëÄ

Shielded ZEC can now be swapped against BTC, appearing as a standard send in the process. The counterparty does not know where the funds move.

What is the relationship between DEX coin and DEXP2P network?
The AtomicDEX application uses its backend API served by daemon named marketmaker. The earlier version was written in C language by jl777‚Ä¶
