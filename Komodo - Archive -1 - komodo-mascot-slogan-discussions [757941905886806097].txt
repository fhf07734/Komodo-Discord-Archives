**Purpose of discussion**

Good day Komodo Community! We are back for another discussion hosted by Artakush (Komodo intern). 

The purpose of this channel is to talk about **Komodo Slogan & Mascot**! 

We are here for 3 or more days to hold a *discussion*, get the *feedback* from You and try to answer all of the *questions*. 


**Why is this topic important? **

Knowing that **AtomicDex** is just around the corner and **DeFi** is changing the course of crypto technology. We feel that it would be a great move to find out the best **one-liner**, that is *accurate*, *powerfull* and *impactfull* to represent **Komodo brand**, make it more represented through *marketing* and *creativeness*. 

Together with slogan, we are trying to find what could represent Komodo platform as a **Mascot**. It can be anything, so try to think *outside of the box* too. (example: interactive Logo; Pokemon-like character; Avatar with a voice behind; Sentinel)

We have created this channel to ask for your ideas and feedback

**Discussion Time! **
Which sentence could represent **Komodo brand ideology**?

What type of **Mascot**, You, the community, imagine, when using Komodo Platform; dapps; services?
What might be it's **features**? 

Any ideas are valuable, so **please, do not hesitate** writing them out, even if it might sound silly, or not fitting, for you personally.

I think a lot of projects are using emojis now because they're recognizable and simple ü§Ø

@joe_land1


[22-Sep-20 09:22 AM] joe_land1#1088
This I actually have listened to


[22-Sep-20 09:22 AM] joe_land1#1088
So there was this podcast about designing logos


[22-Sep-20 09:22 AM] joe_land1#1088
Or an episode


[22-Sep-20 09:22 AM] joe_land1#1088
Anyway


[22-Sep-20 09:23 AM] joe_land1#1088
The design should be simple


[22-Sep-20 09:23 AM] joe_land1#1088
Recognizable for a child


[22-Sep-20 09:23 AM] joe_land1#1088
Not like words or something


[22-Sep-20 09:23 AM] joe_land1#1088
Easy to replicate


[22-Sep-20 09:23 AM] joe_land1#1088
And understandable


[22-Sep-20 09:24 AM] joe_land1#1088
Like by looking at the logo, you should be able to understand the meaning behind it


[22-Sep-20 09:24 AM] Artakush#4285
it is not for logos though


[22-Sep-20 09:24 AM] joe_land1#1088
Ah fuck


[22-Sep-20 09:24 AM] Artakush#4285
xD


[22-Sep-20 09:24 AM] Artakush#4285
all good


[22-Sep-20 09:25 AM] joe_land1#1088
I think some of it applies though


[22-Sep-20 09:25 AM] Artakush#4285
yes


[22-Sep-20 09:25 AM] joe_land1#1088
Not the simple part


[22-Sep-20 09:26 AM] joe_land1#1088
But should be something understandable


[22-Sep-20 09:27 AM] joe_land1#1088
/relatable


[22-Sep-20 09:28 AM] Artakush#4285
absolutely


[22-Sep-20 09:29 AM] joe_land1#1088
Right so maybe if it could relate to the other parts of Komodo suite (or whatever it‚Äôs called)


[22-Sep-20 09:29 AM] joe_land1#1088
Or


[22-Sep-20 09:29 AM] joe_land1#1088
We could just go out on a ducking limb for shits n giggles and it becomes a meme


[22-Sep-20 09:30 AM] Artakush#4285
like an octopus, but then more of them pusses


[22-Sep-20 09:30 AM] joe_land1#1088
Cuz the robot for the bank I was thinking that the ppl were like ‚Äúhow do we make ourselves look more approachable‚Äù


[22-Sep-20 09:30 AM] joe_land1#1088
Like we can‚Äôt have a fucking orange as our mascot


[22-Sep-20 09:30 AM] Artakush#4285
i like oranges


[22-Sep-20 09:31 AM] Artakush#4285
but no


[22-Sep-20 09:31 AM] Artakush#4285
Pinned a message.


[22-Sep-20 02:06 PM] Churro#4832
@Jack. raise a good point, would a komodo as our mascot work?


[22-Sep-20 02:07 PM] Churro#4832
@Artakush what would the mascot be used for? if not for a logo?


[22-Sep-20 02:30 PM] sakata#4279
When we've decided on a mascot, can we get a bounty together to cover the costs of a costume for this, flights to HK & a day ticket to ride the BTC tram all day?


[22-Sep-20 03:10 PM] Churro#4832
LOL


[22-Sep-20 03:10 PM] Churro#4832
we outtt


[22-Sep-20 03:10 PM] Churro#4832
heard fights are cheap


[23-Sep-20 03:51 AM] Artakush#4285
xD


[23-Sep-20 03:51 AM] Artakush#4285
Easy


[23-Sep-20 03:52 AM] Artakush#4285
Mascot is a more visual representation of the brand, a bit more broader than Logo

We also discovered, that there is someone who makes coin emojis for crypto coins, which he does for every popular coin It seems:

[23-Sep-20 04:13 AM] Audo#5667
We used a designer to make them and it turned out he had copied the original from another company.


[23-Sep-20 04:14 AM] Artakush#4285
auch ;D


[23-Sep-20 04:14 AM] Artakush#4285
it looks a bit familiar from some game or something üòâ


[23-Sep-20 04:23 AM] jorian#4555
all knights eventually look alike


[23-Sep-20 04:24 AM] jorian#4555
i'm afraid to ask, but why not a komodo dragon?

[23-Sep-20 04:27 AM] hastrup#8742
yes some form of a komodo dragon. maybe a dragon i a knigh armor >D


[23-Sep-20 04:29 AM] jorian#4555
somehow somewhere down the line, it wasn't okay anymore that the Komodo platform should be associated with what the only meaning of its name really is. a komodo dragon


[23-Sep-20 04:29 AM] hastrup#8742
can you give more info on that_


[23-Sep-20 04:30 AM] hastrup#8742
@jorian


[23-Sep-20 04:30 AM] Artakush#4285
Dragons are cool, but i guess there had to be a reason why not to choose a dragon. Maybe of it's representative state of being a Dragon? Not sure about it.


[23-Sep-20 04:31 AM] jorian#4555
well yeah, a dragon is frightening, but that's the whole point. komodo should scare banks and governments and centralized institutions to death


[23-Sep-20 04:31 AM] jorian#4555
it's all so random. first a mascot, then no more mascot, now we need a mascot again


[23-Sep-20 04:32 AM] jorian#4555
smh


[23-Sep-20 04:33 AM] hastrup#8742
everything can be drawn cute


[23-Sep-20 04:34 AM] hastrup#8742
just google komodo dragon cute


[23-Sep-20 04:34 AM] hastrup#8742
that i dont understand


[23-Sep-20 04:35 AM] hastrup#8742
but i like the idea that a komdo dragon in armor fighting off banks in a duel


[23-Sep-20 04:36 AM] hastrup#8742
don't be afraid to show your color this is what crypto is about, fighting the banks and governments that steal from us every day


[23-Sep-20 04:37 AM] Artakush#4285
This discussion about Mascot or Slogan does not mean that we have top have one, rather to talk about if we can think of one that could properly represent the brand and be interesting and impactful. Maybe it is not necessary to have one at all. but that is why this discussion

üëç 

[23-Sep-20 05:27 AM] Artakush#4285
It would be great if the community could drop some of their ideas of what could be a great one-liner as a Slogan to represent Komodo brand, and if you have any ideas how should a mascot look, you can drop them here in this channel so we all  could have a healthy discussion about it.


[23-Sep-20 06:44 AM] wil#2080
@Audo Maybe Arclegger can design something


[23-Sep-20 06:58 AM] Audo#5667
first we need an idea, a plan, and a decision üôÇ


[23-Sep-20 07:10 AM] Artakush#4285
well said, That is why we turn to community to see what kind of ideas we can get here, so we could all be a part of it üòâ


[23-Sep-20 07:17 AM] DAVIDMURRüåàüî•#8464
@Audo  are we not adults?? Not kids ??  Think there tacky and not professional..  how can you attract newbies to krypto with something so tacky and cheap looking .. just saying.. like a menu or a meal a lot of it is visual marketing... first impressions  last and all that ...


[23-Sep-20 07:20 AM] DAVIDMURRüåàüî•#8464
This is a serious project .. not sonic the hedgehog .. if the fiat collapses and the banking system , serious investors look for professionalism .. not Walt Disney


[23-Sep-20 07:24 AM] DAVIDMURRüåàüî•#8464
Mickey Mouse logo ... Mickey Mouse operation !

Im not sure why you look at it from this perspective, which is possible, but not the only option.

We want to maintain professional brand for Komodo, but we also want to explore ways to be a bit more approachaple and engaging. I am not all convinced that we need a mascot, and I guess that would depend on what the mascot would be.

The current plan is to launch kmd.io for the KMD coin, and that could have a bit more fun touch.


[23-Sep-20 08:04 AM] Audo#5667
I'll listen to community ideas & feedback, and whatever we end up doing won't destroy Komodo's brand as a serious & professional project pushing blockchain technology forward.

@Audo should we expect one of these comment  threads for kmd.io?


[23-Sep-20 08:11 AM] Audo#5667
what do you mean with comment threads?


[23-Sep-20 08:12 AM] banksy35#0477
I think it's a good idea, to launch kmd.io and make it more fun.  I propose a fan art section, were you can tip the artist would be awesome.  Their are a lot of graphics artist who would love to do Komodo theme art.  People can tip with Komodo coin.  The best art can be used officially.  I remember the infographic contest that was run had some great contributions.

These kind of ways are incentivised in different blockchain communities too, community contributions for fan arts, which often can have some real nice gems.

@banksy35 `Be your own exchange` that is really good.


[23-Sep-20 08:23 AM] Audo#5667
we are currentlyi thinking kmd.io explains what KMD is, and provides links to explorers, exchanges, merchants, wallets, etc. It could have various statistics too about the blockchain.

The mascot could only be connected to AtomicDEX brand (user-facing prodcut). It's all about swapping stuff.

What would be something that is associated with changing / adapting?

A 2007 study found that western scrub-jays plan for the future by storing food that they think will be limited in the future. Anticipating future needs ‚Äî those that are not motivated by instinct (like building a nest) or immediate needs (like hunger) ‚Äî is a complex skill that was previously considered to be uniquely human, according to researchers from the University of Cambridge.

Tournament style, 10kmd buy in. Gets you 10,000 banana coins. You trade banana coins vs 4 novelty coins seeded by bots. The novelty coins are traded for NFT(or coin) seeded by bots. The most NFT(or coin) in a given period wins 100kmd.  Or something like that.

With the collapse of the banking system Komodo need to be professional to attract the serious investors that will be available. We don‚Äôt need a mascot, we need a professionally branded symbol. Mascots are for football matches..  in the new digital era you gotta to look professional. If you want to look like a Mickey Mouse operation your going the right way... in the world of finance class counts.. it says what your all about ... cute dragons indeed üôÑ

I agree, but a mascot doesn't necessarily mean a fluffy 3D animated animal. Discord got a mascot, GitHub got a mascot, ShapeShift got a mascot

I get you, and it's a fair point. However, we can have both. We can maintain a very professional brand for Komodo while perhaps having some kind of a mascot for the community (if they so choose).

In my opinion, Mascot is a good thing for mass adoption or/and promotion of something pretty difficult to understand, translated into a language that is more visual and entertaining/educative. I bet that the big part of this community is very tech savvy people, but one of the biggest problem of blockchain adoption is, that information hard to understand for a regular person. Make blockchain accessible to anyone, even without knowing how blockchain works.

Knowing that community is a bit divided on the idea of mascot, which is ok, I would like to extend the duration of this channel, to brainstorm and store the ideas of people about mascot for AtomicDex and/or KMD coin. It still does not mean, that any of the ideas will be used at the end, but if there is something that sticks and sticks out. That might be valuable. I would like to Ask the community if you would like to continue to talk and brainstorm about it? NFT's is a very fun idea, which I also have seen in few other communities, not necessarily for value.

I don't see the problem in having a KMD coin webpage that has mascot's, etc.  I can see in the future there will be a Komodo gamming site as well, like what red fox is doing https://www.rfoxgames.com/.  Is Komodo not meant to enter gamming as it is not corporate?  hell no!  The existing Komodo Platform site can be kept professional and would be the landing place for business researching the Technology, business case, etc.  But, Komodo is a vast project and requires different marketing lenses to fully engage the audience.  Just my 2 cents...

sounds good.  If you look at the benchmark for mascots, the Dogecoin website - https://dogecoin.com/  It does a really good job, of explaining the coin and onboarding new user's.  With the target market being mainly casual crypto investors.  I would love to see something like this for KMD coin where a casual crypto investor can learn about the KMD coin, it's purpose, how to buy etc.  As the user continues their journey they are introduced to more layers of the project, with https://komodoplatform.com/ being their definitive resource.  I think onboarding casual crypto investor's is a current gap and they are important as the grow the community and spread the word.

Any idea is food for thought. Just as earlier mentions of diff knights or diff dragons as NFTs, or just a story teller with deeper representation of part/whole community.  Does someone knows the story of how or why the knight mascot was removed from the presenxe?

Most likely purged when creating all the documents. Komodo documentation was non existent to all over the place in the beginning. Jl777 doesn't do GUI or documentation.

Does komodo have a slogan? Verus is `Truth and privacy for all`

If I go to komodo platform it looks like the slogan is, `try the next generation of dex technology`

@Audo  Komodo is an environment to build.

What about...

The code that builds the code 

The machine that builds the machine

Etc...

I can relate to the learning aspect


[23-Oct-20 01:27 PM] stnabben#4667
I would suggest create before build. Learn, Create, Build. As per definition that's the correct order.


[23-Oct-20 01:41 PM] Churro#4832
Tht sounds good too

[23-Oct-20 03:32 PM] ejuliano#8606
semantics... in this case i imagine you build using komodo tools to create something greater than the sum of its parts


[23-Oct-20 11:42 PM] Audo#5667
build can also refer to things like "build up your skills"


[24-Oct-20 07:32 AM] Jcharming#2693
Learn build create or learn build repeat
Whatever this three word iteration turns into particularly with the 
> Learn Build 
Statement I think feeds very well into the coming junior developer program and the idea that we are community of builders and @Audo initiative to do path to disperse the knowledge that exists in the space.  

Learn build distribute
Learn build decentralized
Learn build decentralize everything

[24-Oct-20 08:04 AM] Audo#5667
Learn build publish


[24-Oct-20 08:06 AM] Audo#5667
it should also refer to collaboration & networking. Again we could attach the word 'build' for that: "Build relationships" and "Build a network"


[24-Oct-20 08:11 AM] Jcharming#2693
Is there any word or words that we cannot put after 

> Learn, Build, (profit?)

Not sure if this helps you guys' goals, but I came up with bundles of words to help me interrogate/comprehend topics when I study.

The aim was for them to all start with the same letter for easy memory:
Thoughts, Tenacities, Theories, Themes & Tasks
Positions, Purposes, Principles, Precises & Pursuits
Senses, Sights, Suppositions, Solutions & Schemes
Impressions, Initiatives, Ideas, Indications & Interests

Some outliers:
Deliberations, Objectives, Concepts, Outlines & Jobs
Notions, Goals, Viewpoints, Points & Remits

Some I didn't want to chuck away:
Perceptions, Speculations, Activity, Assumptions, Hypothesis, Aspiration, Seeks, Aims, Overviews, Insinuations, Implications, Implementations, Informs, Instructs, Intrigues, Inductions, Briefs, Guidelines, Tangibles, Targets, Intentions, Perseverance, Persistence & Determinations

Hope that wasn't overload ü§£ Might be some inspiration there to take from.

*Hello there @everyone!* :yassinkomodo: 

Since we are finishing our, hopefully, first stage of the internship. I would like to close this discussion channel and also give a little bit of the insights of what kind of ideas we gathered through these weeks. ‚úÖ üìà ü™ú 
First of all I would like to thank everyone who joined, voiced and participated in this discussion. The more ideas, the merrier. Easier to build a picture of what could the Mascot be. üí™ :2561_feelsevilman: 
Second of all I would like to thank everyone who gave their opinions and ideas about slogan, which was a sort of second stage of this discussion. *THANK YOU!*üî• ü•≥ üëè 

*Mascot*: 

One of the most important parts of Mascot was, that it should be simple, recognizable and clear event to a child. Without loosing the core idea of the mature, innovative and educative community of Komodo Blockchain.:yassinkmodo: :KMD: 
Another problem of the old Mascot was, not the design, but in fact, that it was copied from another person, to which Komodo had to take it out.:yassinsad: :5684_Peepo_Goteem: 
One other idea was to have several Mascots or Mascots representing different parts of Komodo Blockchain, such as *Atomicdex*
Some of the voiced ideas for mascot were: Chameleon; Bear; Armadillo; Owl; Robo-Komodo; AI-Komodo; Komodo Coin; Crossed over ideas of animal + Atom; of course - Komodo Dragon. 
Through the time of discussion, there were few interesting ideas of having bunch of mascots (Pok√©mon collectibles) that could be used as NFT's for people to have a gamified version of Mascots.


[29-Oct-20 11:43 AM] Artakush#4285
*SLOGAN* üèõÔ∏è :KMD: 

Last two weeks, we got into discussion of slogan itself. Here are few versions we pressed out of our interns and the community: 
1. The code that builds the code -  @thebaselinetest 
2. "Code That builds Community" ;"Code That Builds Freedom" - @Artakush 
3. The code that builds innovation
The code that builds the future
‚ÄúWe are always ahead, come build the future at Komodo‚Äù - @Churro 
4.  Learn Build Create Trade - @‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª 
5. "build up your skills" - @Audo 
6. Learn build distribute
Learn build decentralized
Learn build decentralize everything
Learn build disrupt - @Jcharming 
7. learn build deploy
learn build deliver - @ejuliano 
8. Enable the dreams of tomorrow
Enable the dreams of the Future
Enable you to be the game changer - @banksy35 

Please remember that this discussion about Mascot and Slogan does not mean, that it is over. Hopefully these few ideas will activate you and if You have any ideas, you can always contact @Audo  or wait for, hopefully, upcoming new phase of this discussion!

Sincerely

@Artakush
