I'm on this.   Setting up to put 1,000 KMD into the ICO.   

Good luck!    Your buyback model is fantastic.   

Do you think this could be adopted for other companies trying to raise funds that eventually want to become self managed and sustained?   

Let's say for example, I want to raise 10 Million in funds to invest in loans.  
As the loans payback, the buyback fund will increase through the interest earnings and investors can withdraw their original investments through the buyback fund allocation.    Hopefully to the point where the company holds all the original assets/funds.  

Is this the goal for Peer2?


[10-Sep-18 01:02 PM] sergipcm#2275
good to see you onboard @Mylo @FishyGuts


[10-Sep-18 01:07 PM] sergipcm#2275
sure there are many models which can be built on this model. Buybacks seem to me a promising model if correctly applied. 

As always the model needs to be developed properly and I hope some countries will allow to do it. Because drawning innovation with high capital needs and bureaucracy is the same old way of limiting innovation only to the rich, and they always try to do so.in order to keep on that ''layer''

thats in fact a node, so you can include 1st question one here. But not sure this node will allow connections from.additional nodes @jorian @Deleted User


[15-Sep-18 05:09 AM] sergipcm#2275
probably we capped connections to unknown nodes to avoid problems until we add DPoW


[15-Sep-18 05:12 AM] Seko#7408
@sergipcm that means exactly, that Pungo is a token on the Komodo chain?


[15-Sep-18 05:13 AM] sergipcm#2275
mmm not exactly we created an independent chain which will be later notarised using komodo DPoW


[15-Sep-18 05:14 AM] sergipcm#2275
for now its an independent chain with 10 million coins, with block under demand (when there are tx on the mempool=aka queue, miners nodes generates a block automagically)


[15-Sep-18 05:15 AM] sergipcm#2275
however there are no fees to send tx (its free) and miners get 0 fees to mine blocks


[15-Sep-18 05:18 AM] sergipcm#2275
that means there is no economic reason to mantain the blockchain if you dont run a service supporting PGT. Thats why appart of having our nodes with the chain, when we add komodo DPoW we make sure that the 64 notary nodes of komodo will be mantaining our chain + it gets copied (backed) into Bitcoin blockchain through this notarization service, so it means it gets fully secured

hey @Seko good you make this question, I wrote an article about this but still haven't published on medium.


[15-Sep-18 06:46 AM] sergipcm#2275
You should consider that cryptocurrencies are new form of private money and value transfer


[15-Sep-18 06:48 AM] sergipcm#2275
we are  building different products that bridge fiat and digital world: easy to use wallet, fiat gateway, card program, distributed fiat gateway...everything meets in  digital wallets (ours or 3rd party we dont actually mind)


[15-Sep-18 06:48 AM] Seko#7408
That sounds good...


[15-Sep-18 06:48 AM] sergipcm#2275
we want to provide the infrastructure


[15-Sep-18 06:49 AM] sergipcm#2275
what you asked is a very good question. Every company out there (big ones and small ones) have the ability to build a digital economy based on their products. To reward users, to create other business around their products, to build a community


[15-Sep-18 06:51 AM] sergipcm#2275
however companies out there are still not aware of this or still dont understand it


[15-Sep-18 06:52 AM] sergipcm#2275
they can create a whole economy around their business models that will make at the same time their business models grow


[15-Sep-18 06:52 AM] sergipcm#2275
thats what some companies are starting to do. However blockchain is still in its infancy and those who want to go too fast wont succeed


[15-Sep-18 06:53 AM] Seko#7408
Ah ok, I understand. But cryptocurrencies very volatile at the moment. If I accept crypto as a seller, instead of Fiat, then I have the problem of volatility. Why shouldn’t I take Fiat directly?


[15-Sep-18 06:53 AM] sergipcm#2275
for example a Shoe shop chain probably wouldnt succeed. But binance created a save-fees token and buyback program and see what happened


[15-Sep-18 06:54 AM] sergipcm#2275
they created a full economy that benefited users and themselves


[15-Sep-18 06:55 AM] sergipcm#2275
crypto has its own use cases. You know, casinos, trading online but also because crypto can be understood as a protocol by machines and fiat doesnt, thats why smart contracts are being born.


[15-Sep-18 06:56 AM] sergipcm#2275
as you know there are also some pegged cryptocurrencies which are interesting if you dont want to expose yourself to volatility


[15-Sep-18 06:58 AM] sergipcm#2275
Or why do you think most of the exchanges out there are now working with Pegged cryptos? its not legal tender, its more secure so computers can control it better. It's like dollar, but when you have dollar someone can freeze your account at any time. Pegged crypto doesnt has this problem.

Each crypto might have its use cases.


[15-Sep-18 06:58 AM] sergipcm#2275
In our case ( regarding to your question) its quite clear. We create a FUND with REVENUE  from our business. So underlying "value" of PGT tends to grow.


[15-Sep-18 06:59 AM] Seko#7408
Do you visualize this concept. For a better understanding graphics and videos would be helpful. Your designs are fantastic.


[15-Sep-18 07:00 AM] sergipcm#2275
then we use PGT to pay commissions, affiliations, save fees...so PGT tends to grow in value and circulate. Nobody can say its worthless because we will always be able to calculate the exact value of each PGT (the amounts in the FUND). However market might give extra value if it thinks PGT is worth it


[15-Sep-18 07:00 AM] Seko#7408
And it’s helpful for the community, of you write an article on Medium about the use-case.


[15-Sep-18 07:00 AM] sergipcm#2275
Yes, will try thanks for the suggestion


[15-Sep-18 10:53 AM] jspook16#3059
So is PGT required for these services? Meaning I have to go from one crypto currency to PGT to Fiat? Or can I go directly?


[15-Sep-18 12:46 PM] Chipmoon#7477
I tried to calculate the rate base of .35 usd /pgt . 1 kmd = 3 pgt


[15-Sep-18 12:46 PM] Chipmoon#7477

Hi, I've been testing the app, funding my KMD address and also the sale page. I always start small and so far I can't input less than 500KMD into the page, is that the minimum buy order?

@Dyeles  $500 is the minimum buy order, so with KMD around $1/coin, that's why

[18-Sep-18 07:04 AM] sergipcm#2275
thanks for your trust @hastrup we have different plans, we hope to be able to push them forward after the sale ends


[18-Sep-18 07:07 AM] sergipcm#2275
payment processing service can be done in many countries, we have some places in mind where it seems likely; however we will need some backing to advance steadily on our plans. As you know we are releasing different products, depending on the amount raised we will need to rely on our products revenue also to fund our expansion 😃


[18-Sep-18 07:26 AM] hastrup#8742
Ok thx I'm looking forward to see you advancements in the field I'm selling out of my mco holding because you give me my privat key so thx to you for giving me the power to controle my own money and the ability to buy a tomato whit them 😁

I'm a little confused. The buy back fund that gives 0,50 usd back. So if I give 1 btc for x amount of pgt and the price on btc goes to the roof . Can I buy back my btc for the same price?


[18-Sep-18 08:52 AM] sergipcm#2275
let me try to explain. Revenue from our products goes to FUND. Right?


[18-Sep-18 08:52 AM] hastrup#8742
Yes


[18-Sep-18 08:52 AM] sergipcm#2275
this FUNDS can only be used to Buyback Pungo tokens


[18-Sep-18 08:52 AM] hastrup#8742
Yes


[18-Sep-18 08:53 AM] sergipcm#2275
so you can sell PGT on any exchange that supports them...or come to us and we will buy them back with the funds accumulated in the FUND.


[18-Sep-18 08:54 AM] sergipcm#2275
So for example, if we accumulate crypto in the FUND, and the value of this crypto is 10 million USD

it means that we can buy back to any one who requests to do so, at 1 USD/PGT


[18-Sep-18 08:54 AM] sergipcm#2275
So for example, if we accumulate crypto in the FUND, and the value of this crypto is 10 million USD

it means that we can buy back to any one who requests to do so, at 1 USD/PGT, as there are 10 million PGT (imagine all are distributed)


[18-Sep-18 08:54 AM] sergipcm#2275
however the idea is that this FUND is here so every token holders can be sure that there is something backing TOKEN VALUE


[18-Sep-18 08:55 AM] sergipcm#2275
if our business goes good, FUND keeps increasing as the time passes


[18-Sep-18 08:55 AM] sergipcm#2275
which is something I find totally logic...btw


[18-Sep-18 08:56 AM] sergipcm#2275
if you see the "revenue fee" is similar to the one most exchanges apply, 0.2% per operation


[18-Sep-18 08:56 AM] hastrup#8742
Ok I see. Is the fund open to see? How much it hold?


[18-Sep-18 08:56 AM] sergipcm#2275
it means everyone trading on our platform...we take that small piece and send to the FUND


[18-Sep-18 08:57 AM] sergipcm#2275
yes, the FUND data will be published by https://openingchain.org

they will publish the FUNDS stored, where those funds come from, how many PGT we (as a company) hold, how do we give a way the PGT we control...

[18-Sep-18 08:58 AM] hastrup#8742
So it could be 2usd/pgt. whatever the fund hold devided by coin supply?


[18-Sep-18 08:58 AM] sergipcm#2275
rigth


[18-Sep-18 08:59 AM] hastrup#8742
Thx :)


[18-Sep-18 08:59 AM] sergipcm#2275
if we accumulate 20 million, its 2 usd/pgt


[18-Sep-18 08:59 AM] sergipcm#2275
however I would say that market will probably trade over "real price"


[18-Sep-18 08:59 AM] sergipcm#2275
depending on expectations


[18-Sep-18 09:00 AM] sergipcm#2275
if FUND holds 1usd/pgt but we are doing great...market would expect value to grow fast so probably it will be better for any holder to sell in the open market...


[18-Sep-18 09:00 AM] sergipcm#2275
well, if it happens with coins backed by...nothing...I guess that a coin backed by a real value behind should perform much better


[18-Sep-18 09:00 AM] sergipcm#2275
😃


[18-Sep-18 09:05 AM] hastrup#8742
Yes I see. I just have a friend that pointed out that he was not that willing to use his btc in the event that btc goes back up and I can understand his concern. Therefore I will buy back the kmd I have used on pgt. So it's the Fiat I have used and not my kmd holdings. But thx for the explanation. I understand now 😊


[18-Sep-18 09:35 AM] sergipcm#2275

also, just noticed the same issue i had while working on new version of agama mobile
>Uncaught SyntaxError: Block-scoped declarations (let, const, function, class) not yet supported outside strict mode
either you forked too early or not in sync with the latest
i think it might be relevant on old phone models/browsers
but i'm not 100% positive on what's the cause
compiling everything inc. agama-wallet-lib to es5 fixes the issue

To measure the interest in the token, is it safe to just monitor the top address on the richlist to know how many tokens have been purchased? Last I checked, there wasn't a tracker on the website.

hey @bishop we havent set a counter because the PGT backed price will be set only on tokens officially sold/airdropped


[01-Oct-18 03:01 PM] sergipcm#2275
that means non distributed tokens wont count. And we guarantee we wont sell PGT in markets under 0.5 usd and if we sell over that price, ie 0.6 usd/PGT at a later occasion we will send this extra 0.1 usd/pgt directly to public fund


[01-Oct-18 04:14 PM] bishop#9773
I was mainly interested to see if/when you sell the entire token sale or if there is a lack of interest.

[25-Oct-18 05:43 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
@Virginia (Peer2Group) i'm curious why is the amount of tokens dropped to KMD holders expressed as 200.000 not just 200?


[25-Oct-18 05:43 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
as there is only going to be total 10 million pungo tokens. so it can't be 200 000


[25-Oct-18 05:44 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
200.000 can be understood differently in many parts of the world


[25-Oct-18 08:26 AM] sergipcm#2275
hey @crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy right will change to 200k


[25-Oct-18 08:28 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
so how can it be 200 000 tokens per KMD address


[25-Oct-18 08:28 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550
if there are only 10 million tokens total

yes 200k total


[25-Oct-18 08:45 AM] sergipcm#2275
we are airdropping 200k PGT among kmd addresses holding 10+ kmd


[25-Oct-18 08:45 AM] crumb | $ARRR Financial Privacy#2550

recently, chainzilla did airdrop on all wallets that have more than 500 KMD


[25-Oct-18 02:07 PM] SadykovT#2123
will the size of airdrop depend on the amount of kmd on the wallet ?

@Virginia (Peer2Group) Any BUG bounty up in here ?  Seems that android wallet has a bug bro .....when transfering wallet to a new phone ive created a new wallet on new handset and installed it via seed and my assets PGT , KMD are not showing 😦 upon closing and restarting thinking this will remedy the problem im now told the new pin i created (used same as old one) and i am now locked out of the new wallet on the new handset


[17-Nov-18 06:26 AM] Virginia (Peer2Group)#1459
Hi @CryptoprenuerUK let me check it with technical team, I will keep you updated


[17-Nov-18 07:19 AM] sergipcm#2275
hey


[17-Nov-18 07:20 AM] sergipcm#2275
@CryptoprenuerUK will contact through PM to fully understand whats the problem


[17-Nov-18 04:10 PM] sergipcm#2275
I have been checking Bassliner comments and pending on new proofs or  comments sor far the possibilities I see are:

1) He commented about different addresses on different devices with same seed. That is only possible doing a typo when recovering the seed. Which effectively creates 2 seeds. the ''original seed'' and the ''typo seed''. One seed always has same address in any device and since our seed is non BIP39 compatible, each seed always has only 1 address for each coin.

2) About setting a PIN and not being able to re-open the wallet using the PIN in the wallet anymore. I dont discard some kind of bug in a given device. I have tested on some devices and couldnt reproduce. Additionally, this should not happen using the web version mobile.pungo.app however will ask the team to make some tests on previous android versions, just in case

hi there @gsnew I was sending this days thousands of coins from Pungo wallet its strange


[27-Dec-18 05:14 AM] sergipcm#2275
whats the error you get?


[27-Dec-18 05:14 AM] sergipcm#2275
can I suggest to carefully backup your seed. Uninstall Pungo Wallet and install it again? just in case, that might help


[27-Dec-18 05:15 AM] sergipcm#2275
thanks @passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 will check last version of agama and report


[27-Dec-18 05:31 AM] gsnew#5366
I do not get an error message. After transferring, the top bar will run and run and run.
I will be new in this evening.
I will inform you later


[27-Dec-18 06:07 AM] sergipcm#2275
ok @passcombo.com 🏴☠🍋 tried last agama version, all looking fine to me regarding pungo


[27-Dec-18 06:07 AM] sergipcm#2275
do you have more details on the error you found?


[27-Dec-18 06:08 AM] sergipcm#2275
maybe an screenshot? I only see it 1 time. I'm talking about agama 0.3.2a the one which is actually on download page


[27-Dec-18 06:17 AM] sergipcm#2275
@gsnew let me know, if top bar runs and runs seems like electrum servers might not be responding, but I just tried and works fine for me


[27-Dec-18 06:18 AM] sergipcm#2275
I fee appears it means electrum server is responding. If fee doesnt appear that might be the issue. Might also depend on your physical location, let me know more info and retry again

[28-Dec-18 02:32 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
guys, there's something very strange in Agama wallet. I read about the airdrop so I added Pungo in native mode, or I believed it was, it has green logo with the name Pungo (PGT). It downloaded the blockchain pretty fast, but then the orange symbol 'native' changed to the green 'erc20' . From the activate coin menu there's a Puregold Token (PGT) , it seems a conflict between it and Pungo


[28-Dec-18 02:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
in fact they have the same logo


[28-Dec-18 02:34 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I must have added the wrong one


[28-Dec-18 02:44 PM] sergipcm#2275
I was actually adding it in light mode and couldnt find it


[28-Dec-18 02:44 PM] sergipcm#2275
but guess I should switch to native mode


[28-Dec-18 02:46 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I was using native, maybe in lite mode it works


[28-Dec-18 02:47 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
I found that if I try adding Pungo in native it always add the Erc20 one


[28-Dec-18 02:48 PM] sergipcm#2275
I have used in lite mode, seems problem is in native, will try now


[28-Dec-18 02:50 PM] KomodoWorld#8282
restarted Agama, same issue. Both have same logo and ticker and it adds the Erc20 with either choice


[28-Dec-18 03:14 PM] sergipcm#2275
agama marks it as ERC20 but just sent PGT and it gets it

@Van you don't have to claim nothing. It was snapshot on 10th december to agama wallets with +10 kmd

Someone here? One user called @jony#9693 wrote on Chainzilla's "General-discussion" channel, he said that pungo "stole" his zilla from your wallet. His profile looks weird.

hey @Instel7 jony reinstalled the wallet and worked fine


[30-Dec-18 09:56 AM] Elmis#0347
I cant find any token of the airdrop in my Agama wallet . Did you have to fulfill any other condition besides having more than 10 kmd to receive the airdrop?


[30-Dec-18 09:58 AM] Elmis#0347
Do the kmd stored in Ledger wallet also participate in the airdrop?


[30-Dec-18 09:58 AM] sergipcm#2275
have you checked in explorer?

yes and says I received 10 pgt, I can see other address with the same bounty that they are in blue and mine is in grey


[30-Dec-18 10:12 AM] Elmis#0347
Does it mean anything?


[30-Dec-18 10:37 AM] sergipcm#2275
in agama? there is some issue about way handles PGT make sure to be in lite mode and maybe logoff login again


[30-Dec-18 10:38 AM] sergipcm#2275
seems it tags it as ERC20 but as far as I tested I was able to receive and send


[30-Dec-18 10:38 AM] sergipcm#2275
guess that should be fixed in new version team was already reported


[31-Dec-18 06:26 PM] Regnar#6164
I just submitted PGT to be listed on Coinpaprika including links to white paper, linkedin of team members, block explorers, API endpoints for circulating supply, coin icon (from BarterDEX github).


[31-Dec-18 06:28 PM] Regnar#6164
I'm not sure if PGT is on other exchanges yet besides BarterDEX/HyperDEX but the information for them there is incomplete. So Idk how they will list it with markets/price without that information. I'll see if I can update that stuff as well.

[31-Dec-18 06:31 PM] Regnar#6164
But it might be only possible to list if PGT is on an exchange with price information.

[09-Jan-19 06:58 AM] jorian#4555
you might want to change the port


[09-Jan-19 06:59 AM] sergipcm#2275
does it cause issues?


[09-Jan-19 07:00 AM] sergipcm#2275
not sure why we set this one, its just the one we are using right now but if it needs to be changed for a good reason can be changed


[09-Jan-19 07:01 AM] jorian#4555
KMD uses that one


[09-Jan-19 07:02 AM] sergipcm#2275
so it creates some kind of incompatibility?


[09-Jan-19 07:03 AM] sergipcm#2275
yes wait a moment I think thats not correctly set


[09-Jan-19 07:03 AM] jorian#4555
yes


[09-Jan-19 07:04 AM] jorian#4555
if i use KMD as electrum i cant use PGT anymore


[09-Jan-19 07:04 AM] sergipcm#2275
ok so only when setting up all electrum servers together?


[09-Jan-19 07:05 AM] sergipcm#2275
guess from a mobile client doesnt care where remote electrum has the port set right?


[09-Jan-19 07:10 AM] sergipcm#2275
I mean, I understand we cannot set 2 electrum servers on port 10001 because only one would work


[09-Jan-19 07:11 AM] sergipcm#2275
but from a light wallet point of view, I guess it shouldnt care calling Server A for coin A on port 10001 and Server B for Coin B on port 10001


[09-Jan-19 07:12 AM] sergipcm#2275
btw I think I missed the port and checking with devops because seems port its 10002 😃


[09-Jan-19 07:13 AM] jorian#4555
it's your mobile application using that port


[09-Jan-19 07:13 AM] jorian#4555
hmm. i don't remember actually


[09-Jan-19 07:13 AM] jorian#4555
but there is a reason


[09-Jan-19 07:14 AM] sergipcm#2275
I just sent PR with updated ports


[09-Jan-19 07:18 AM] jorian#4555
@cipi knows


[09-Jan-19 07:21 AM] cipi#4502
as long as the hostname is another one, it does not matter, you can use same port
on the server it does matter, you can't tell 2 daemons to use the same port


[09-Jan-19 07:35 AM] cipi#4502
explorer link is this PR is wrong, i guess: https://github.com/jl777/coins/pull/229/files
GUI add txid to the link from explorers/PGT and expects to get the transaction
should be something like `["https://explorer.pungotoken.com/tx/"]`

Hi here :).
Barterlly is now open on BETA mode, and will provide tools for users and CoinOwners to perform OTC trades in a safe way.
Any KMD assetchain dPowed will be listed, and supported, for free.
Other coins not already listed can submit a listing application at : https://barterlly.typeform.com/to/iqpS1H
During the BETA, Barterlly won't charge any fee other than the transaction ones. after the release we will charge 1% on top of every transaction.
Our goal is to provide premium tools for coins listed on the platform. (Discord swapbot, twitter integration, public orders, wallet integration, API, custom templating, and many more).
Feel free to join us on our Discord.
https://discord.gg/RHc95zw

Do you have to be fully verified to buy gift cards? If I try to buy it comes up with error “incorrect info”?  Also why no ability to buy with KMD?


[18-Nov-19 01:42 AM] Oszy#5734
@framewood you can use Chameleon to buy gift cards with KMD

@framewood no need to verify to buy gift cards, however kmd is not supported. Btw you can easily swap within wallet

Regarding PGT we are thinking of letting holders choose between sending part of the mining revenue towards KMD ecosystem bounties (Pirate related development, KMD Peg testing etc...suggestions accepted here) or alternatively just direct this amounts towards buying back PGT during this year

hello, after some thoughts on the matter and to avoid problems related to NN profit sharing we have decided to set up a 100 KMD monthly bounty for a Komodo related project

we are looking for very especific solutions to make blockchain easier for noobs that we can help fund during this year

preferably within komodo ecosystem. We will be giving away 12 months komodo mining rewards, meaning we will split the passed months into remaining months budget

Depending on results/effectiveness of budget utilization we might increase the reward at our discretion

you can post ideas here for discussion or just send to me via PM and might be proposed later for voting keeping the source (person who proposed) anonymous if desired

btw we also have some updates related to the project, but will post them once they are ready to share
