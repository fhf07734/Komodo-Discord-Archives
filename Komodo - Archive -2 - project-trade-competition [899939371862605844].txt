Those two repositories is where the changes were being made before being submitted to the main branch.


[20-Oct-21 05:54 PM] jspook16#3059
First issue was changing the ticker from "DRAGONFAIRY" to "DGNF" since the ticker needed to be less than 4 characters I think


[20-Oct-21 05:55 PM] jspook16#3059
since we had to change the ticker....we then had to perform another atomic swap with the new ticker


[20-Oct-21 05:55 PM] jspook16#3059
and also had to change the electrum servers and explorers to match


[20-Oct-21 05:56 PM] jspook16#3059
@scott (notfromthefuture) has the explorer and electrum server info .... I tried to set up an electrum server on my end but Im not sure if I was succesful


[20-Oct-21 05:56 PM] jspook16#3059
we need at least two electrum servers, one explorer and the changes to github to submit to be added to atomicDEX


[20-Oct-21 05:56 PM] jspook16#3059
the coin logo is something simple that scott put together


[20-Oct-21 05:57 PM] jspook16#3059
If we want to change the logo or the ticker name now is the time


[20-Oct-21 05:57 PM] jspook16#3059
any thoughts?


[20-Oct-21 05:59 PM] jspook16#3059
actually i think i was pushing the changes directly back to the main atomicDEX branch for approval... I dont remember any more lol

As far as I am concerned "Fairies Wear Boots" Ozzy Osbourne, and they dance around with Gnomes, Dragon Fairies are something else completely, ha, ha. Is there any point in me creating a Dragon Fairy image? A colorful but mean Dragon Fairy? I like the idea so I probably will explore it anyway, thanks.


[21-Oct-21 09:30 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
They already made a dragon fairy image. 

```Icon file (Required)

The icon file is required.

Icon must be a .png format file.

Dimentions of icon file is 82x82 pixels.

Icon file name MUST be in¬†small letters.

``` what we do need is a few more icons And a few more trading competition coin concepts. Ie: FWB coin "fairies wear boots"

Icons of what? And what do you mean by icon? My idea of an icon might not be the same as yours, my idea of an icon is a small representation of something bigger, like the small fairy logo you posted, which is just copy shrink & paste, I am not sure that is what you mean.  I am already working on FWB but it's a real dragon fairy not a normal fairy called a dragon fairy,  we shall see, thanks.

In order to list a coin on atomicdex it needs an icon file. Names don't matter, images don't matter except to provide something. Icon file needs to be a specific size. But my vision is to spin up a few different coins and add them to dex. Am waiting to see if jspook is successful in getting dragon fairy listed, I'd like to replicate this.

My comments were geared towards if someone had a fun concept for a trading competition coin. Coin doesn't need to do or represent anything.

Since jspook started with theme dragon fairy, in jest I was keeping with the theme by suggesting FWB coin.


[21-Oct-21 10:31 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Could just as easily say, green dragon coin, red dragon coin, black dragon coin: GDC, RDC, BDC


[21-Oct-21 10:31 AM] Nev#5914
Yip got you with logo and sizes, really small hardly worth the effort you might think but those things that you say don't matter actually do, names are important, we name everything so we can build a map of our world to understand it, that is what neurologists tell me and I believe them from personal experience, and an example is try describing a trip on hallucinogenics and you don't even know what you have seen, very difficult to do. A trading competition coin, I actually thought of TT's, there is a world renowned motor cycle competition called the Isle of Man TT's look it up, it means Touring Trophy, I was thinking, Trading Trophy, Trading Tournament, Trading Transmission, Transaction Tournament.


[21-Oct-21 10:35 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
To me it makes the most sense to have several trade competitions. Maybe we keep each one to a specific theme. Note: I am viewing these coins as disposable ( one use, though there is nothing preventing someone to keep it alive)


[21-Oct-21 10:35 AM] Nev#5914
PS. it might be tourist Trophy.


[21-Oct-21 10:36 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
We could make trophy NFTs


[21-Oct-21 10:38 AM] Nev#5914
Yip, trophy NFT's is OK, and Trophy on it's own might be good.


[21-Oct-21 10:41 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Can you provide context on what you mean by trophy on its own


[21-Oct-21 10:47 AM] Nev#5914
I was thinking about art competitions and came up with the idea of a Circle, Square & Triangle, they are the basic shapes of all drawing and image making, I was thinking they could be used at the time as the shape for a trophy. What I mean is Trophy being the main name and then it could be Trophy Red, Trophy Hex, Trophy Zap or Zap Trophy, Zed Trophy, Top Trophy, changing part of the name but keeping Trophy as a solid never changing thing.


[21-Oct-21 10:47 AM] jspook16#3059
I was thinking recycling the coin after the competition to reuse again. Otherwise you have to list on AtomicDEX Everytime and go through the motions


[21-Oct-21 10:48 AM] jspook16#3059
I'll lay out the detailed goal tonight that we originally had planned and we can use that as a starting point


[21-Oct-21 10:51 AM] Nev#5914

[21-Oct-21 10:57 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Yeah, no worries, it's your coin. I can't yet do what I want setup wise anyway.


[21-Oct-21 11:01 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
I can see some scenarios that would work and some that it wouldn't


[21-Oct-21 11:03 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
In my vision of a trading competition I see  fresh setup everytime to ensure a fair environment. Ie: people hoarding coins from past competitions to give themselves an advantage in a future competition


[21-Oct-21 11:05 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Luckily as per above article, kmd asset chains are easy to setup. The icon that needs to be created is small and can be literally anything, the hard part then is setting up the electrums and explorer and any finalizing of swap info for mm2


[21-Oct-21 11:23 AM] jspook16#3059
The other hard part i think is the distribution of the coin. We had planned to use a tip bot but we don't know how much work that is to create


[21-Oct-21 03:08 PM] Artakush#4285
who is we? üòÆ


[21-Oct-21 03:33 PM] jspook16#3059
Me and @scott (notfromthefuture)    
We had planned to distribute with a tip bot to promote some hype for the event


[21-Oct-21 05:10 PM] jspook16#3059
So first item we can resolve is the asset chain name and ticker symbol. Originally we had "DragonFairy" for the name and "DGNF" for the ticker. If someone has other ideas now is the time to change this. Once we go forward it will be more work to change filenames to a new ticker


[21-Oct-21 05:15 PM] jspook16#3059
Second item we can resolve concurrently is the Icon. The one I posted earlier was something simple. We didnt want to spend too much time on it because we were limited on time. But now we have more people so if you guys think we can come up with something better now is the time for that as well.

@jspook16  having quite a long day today. Let me come back through the weekend, but I love the effort, and as you mentioned, not to spend too much time on very simple things.


[23-Oct-21 05:12 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Hey @jspook16 sorry I have been away. Any questions I can answer? Also, for those reading along, we had the intention with things like the name, logo, AC config, etc, to purposefully make a chain that would not gain value. For example it is 100% premined with no mining rewards. Some better ideas we had for things we left out to try to insure this would stay as a giveaway token and not gain any real value. Those things can of course all change

Yes that will more than sufficient. I usually try to stick with LTS (.04). As long as the VPS can run the daemon should be plenty for the rest. Just need decent RAM and you can always upgrade later if it got more traffic. The DragonFairy Daemon/PoS miner/SPV/explorer is runining on a basic VPS service

Not sure if it was mentioned, but the idea behind it all (and why the fairy, lol) was this. We would give away the coin to participants through tipbots, contests, games, whatever generates a little hype. We chose a name that was not coin specific so it can be used cross-asset-chains. The "fairys" are the contributors to the giveaway. They would place buy orders on adex for whatever price or amount they decided. A fairy drop. This way the participants that have received DragonFairy could go on adex and sell for whatever active orders there are. Exchange their received giveaway tokens for KMD with real value. Likewise, if they were feeling bold, they could place a high sell order and see if one of the fairy visits them.

Overall the idea was to create a AC coin that acted as a giveaway token with no in inherit value to get people using adex. Its also an easy way for somebody to contribute to the giveaway as they can simply fill orders on adex for whatever price or amount without having to organize with anybody. Anonymous contribution drops.

AC chain, explorer, SPV, was all easy and up and running with no issue. Where we ran into issue is lack of documentation on listing on adex. There really needs to be a clear standard published someplace. Next issue we ran into is the listing would be on the desktop adex only, where the majority of our target audience was mobile users, so we sort of stalled there.

As an alternative, we were waiting for Tokel to mature a bit (this was pre release when we were working on this) to see if going with a TKL token would simplify the listing side of things. It would be great to promote both projects in the same promo. I understand a token listing in tokeldex is instantaneous, but I am dont believe this is on mobile yet? Correct me if I am wrong and  that will be a done deal.

Other thing we were considering is going with a BSC/ETH token  as that instantly list it on metamask and as ERC20/BEP20 token can instantly be manually added to to adex, but the idea of going over there really doesn't interest me. This should all be simple enough in the Komodo ecosystem. It really sheds light on the larger picture. That bigger picture is that I truly believe that the Komodo ecosystem is superior in every way as a platform compared to the shit eth/bsc platforms. With that said, for a project as simple as dragonfairy, I need to be able to fill out a simple form online, have outputs auto generated, and adex needs to have some method of live updating new coins added to it on some daily or other regular basis. Simply I need to be able to fill out some forms, go through some steps, and it becomes available to use and trade instantaneously. A person who only discovered KMD today should be able to do it without contacting real humans, getting support, working days or months to listings, etc.

In other words, on ETH, if you want to create a token like this you fill out a form, pay your fee, and it is instantly in the explorer, available to be added to wallets, and available on exchanges. Instant and dummy proof. In Komodo, it should be just as simple, with the additional step of setting up the first two nodes that can be as simple as running a generated script on a server. 

Just as with ERC20, there needs to be some published and maintained standard for Komodo asset chains.

So I am starting to wonder, maybe through the creation of this promotion, we can help create that method to improve the Komodo experience. Maybe I am dreaming too big and it is outside the scope of a marketing giveaway. All I know is it is apparent to me this is a major step in Komodo's evolution as a platform and this would be an ideal use case to create those processes from. I am happy to contribute a good portion of my time and energy to this if others are interested as well. IMHO it is vital to the future growth of Komodo, maybe even more so than some single marketing campaign.

You talked about integration into atomicdex. Once steps are followed to list on mm2, does it not automatically work with desktop? Or do you need to wait for an update of atomicdex for it to work. Ie: it doesn't appear in the gui until an official update


[23-Oct-21 06:01 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Even now I am still not all that clear. As I understand it we submit the required pull request, and at some later point in a future update it may be added. Of course somebody manually reviews and contacts you to discuss. I know we submitted the required documents. @jspook16 was working on this portion so he would have a better idea. I think some things needed to be changed (maybe with teh SPV if rememebr correct) to fulfill the listing (no clear documentation to begin with), but I believe we stopped there as we realized it would not be included in the mobile app at that point which was important for what we were originnaly doing


[23-Oct-21 06:03 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
The other immediate question I had for you is what is the actual game mechanics you were going to use? Ie: if a competition how do you see it working?


[23-Oct-21 06:05 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
when we were originally doing this I think it may have had a slightly different twist to what is happening here now. It was less of a competition and more of a giveaway. We saw how much hype people doing "rains" with the tipbots was generating, so we thought of a way to turn simply giving away free coins into more of a adex learning experience as we are both very bullish on the future of atomicdex, as many of us are.


[23-Oct-21 06:06 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
So to answer your question more specifically, no mechanics. Just create a AC coin to act as a token that would not gain value where teh participants had to use adex to get the real value for that token they received in whatver giveaway


[23-Oct-21 06:07 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
We mostly would use tipbots to give away, but I had ideas to get people involved by having them submit art, memes, wording contests, whatever got people active. The idea was mostly to encourage participation, and simultaneously encourage the use of atomicdex and highlight the Komodo platform abilities


[23-Oct-21 06:10 AM] cipi#4502
ADEX Desktop fetches the coins file from https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins on every build, so coin needs to be there
the rest is configured in the ADEX Desktop repo: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/dev/assets/config/0.5.2-coins.json


[23-Oct-21 06:12 AM] cipi#4502
after that is added, it need a rebuild... that can be done by everyone, no need to wait for official release
just clone the repo, add the coin and let github make a build for you... that's it


[23-Oct-21 06:20 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
I very much appreciate your response @cipi . To be clear I very much support this project. I only say what I do above to as clearly and honestly explain my experience to this point. It is easy as somebody that works with the thing every day to say, all you need to do is this, this, and that. I am very much guilty of the same thing in the technical work I do IRL. It is so important that we remember that for something like this, where we try to encourage its adoption by all possible users, that their experience, whether correct or incorrect, can be more important than whatever the actual facts they are unaware of.

I can still say that there is a steep learning curve leading up to the listing piece. I still standby that the process needs to be standardized and be much simpler (dummy proof in fact), if Komodo is to grow as a AC platform.


[23-Oct-21 06:22 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
With that said, I do have a question about your comment. So lets say a user already has the current official release of atomicdex running on their desktop. If I was to add the PR's to those two repos, and after they are approved and accepted, the new coin would still not show up in their version of adex until the next official release, is that correct? The user would have to download the cloned build to see the new coin until it is included in the next official release? Also, if somebody uses say dogedex, when would it appear in there? On their next official release?


[23-Oct-21 06:23 AM] cipi#4502
yes, correct, every new coin added to the above 2 files needs a rebuild of ADEX Desktop and as such an update on users side


[23-Oct-21 06:24 AM] cipi#4502
it's the same with all clones, DogeDEX and so on, new coin = new build = new release


[23-Oct-21 06:25 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Out of curiosity, do you happen to know if there are any plans in the future to have some sort of live updating system? By that I mean, when coins are successfully added, all live versions will find that coin and will be available without having to download a new version? Some sort of repository the adex polls on some regular basis to discover new coins


[23-Oct-21 06:29 AM] cipi#4502
there is one thing that hinders that: the icon of the coin is compiled into the binary of ADEX Desktop, so that loading is faster... you would need to sacrifice this in order to accomplish it... some other settings are also part of the code and need a rebuild, like the charts... those could be for sure made in a different config file, but the idk about the icons... need to ask the actual devs of ADEX Desktop


[23-Oct-21 06:31 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
thats interesting, and makes sense. I would think even a "default" icon could be used until the next release if it meant an instant listing of the coin until then


[23-Oct-21 06:31 AM] cipi#4502
i guess making new releases is the better way... you can do a new one every day üôÇ


[23-Oct-21 06:31 AM] cipi#4502
there is a way to load the icons afterwards, the custom token addition does it, for ERC20/BEP20/QRC20 tokens


[23-Oct-21 06:32 AM] cipi#4502
need to extend the "custom token" to a "custom coin" add feature üôÇ


[23-Oct-21 06:33 AM] cipi#4502
but idk if it's really worth it... for me it's much easier to add a new coin by doing the PR on github


[23-Oct-21 06:39 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
I can agree with that, and learning that now does answer some questions so part of this is documentation of course, but the other part seems to be expectations. It would seem in the state of crypto today, one would expect to be able to fill out a form, not interact with any humans, and have  a new coin instantly available for trade on adex, as simply as it is to create a AC coin without permission. Instantly available with no human interaction

Obviously adex is a much different beast than Komodo so it understandably is more involved for a listing. Unfortunately people becoime use to how tokens work, even though this is a superior service as an actual coin.

@cipi if Marmaradex were to be cloned, for use as a competition dex. Then with every new competition coin added, would it need a new build? Ie: clone Marmaradex, add to the coins and icon files. Does it automatically work now? Is this what you mean?


[23-Oct-21 06:53 AM] cipi#4502
needs a new build yes, and the build is automatically triggered when you make a change to your repo
in official repo there are several new builds every day: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions all those action links contain builds for all 3 platforms (Linux, Windows, MacOS)

[23-Oct-21 06:56 AM] cipi#4502
so it's not a big deal to make a new build for all platforms... but you need to take them from "actions" and make a real release, the things from "actions" are only accessible when you have a github account
it's all just a bit of github magic

Adding a custom smartchain should be possible if a user already have electrum etc...


[23-Oct-21 06:59 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
The trouble is less about the build, that is easy with github. The trouble is having users update their software. Also, lets say we create a giveaway coin, and somebody already has adex, they would need to download the second wallet to have the giveaway coin, which is a clone of adex, right next to their actual adex that does not show that coin. Its more on the users end that it becomes a bit jumbled having those expectations for them.


[23-Oct-21 06:59 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Especially since our target audience is less than fully computer savvy


[23-Oct-21 06:59 AM] cipi#4502
why not replace the old ADEX with the new ADEX? no need to have 2 of them


[23-Oct-21 07:00 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Oh I see, so they could just have a single unofficial version of adex?


[23-Oct-21 07:01 AM] Slyris#2880
I think what you want is the ability to easily add a custom smart chain, or are you talking about an official listing?


[23-Oct-21 07:01 AM] cipi#4502
yes, if it's a clone of the original one, it will have the same features + the coins you added
and the wallet is the same, the directories where those are stored is the same


[23-Oct-21 07:03 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
If I understand teh question correctly, both. So a person creates an AC chain. That is easy enough and very well documented. The expectation would be that an AC chain would be able to be instantly listed and available in adex. Sounds like the best procedure is to setup a server with an explorer, node, electrum, etc, submit the PR's, then once those are approved, clone and rebuild and provide a copy of your custom unofficial adex release to potential users until the coin is included in an official release in the future


[23-Oct-21 07:05 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Unfortunately this is sort of where we ended up orginnaly with this coin as we relized this is just the desktop procedure. I understand there is some more steps and costs to start to look at a mobil listing which is what we really needed for our case


[23-Oct-21 07:05 AM] Slyris#2880
Well Idk, that's sounds rly centralized


[23-Oct-21 07:06 AM] cipi#4502
yes, that is the "procedure" atm... for Desktop... Mobile is a totally different thing


[23-Oct-21 07:09 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
I 100 agree. That is sort of my point. I likely would have stopped at the point that I realized so much human interaction was required originally. I also dont like having to have users maintain versions, updates, and unofficial releases. I understand if that is the procedure for now, but my point is thats what needs to change for future adoption of AC chains being used like tokens are now on ETH/BSC. Its fair to have the extra step of setting up the first two nodes as it is an actual coin vs a token, but the rest is over complicated to attract average casual users. Especially since we are condensing the process here, the actual process includes much more learning and questions, where it needs to be a form a caveman could complete


[23-Oct-21 07:10 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
no offense to any cavemen in here


[23-Oct-21 07:10 AM] Slyris#2880
Also you have too accept that Smart Chain are real blockchain, meanwhile on ETH/BSC those are ERC20, so you also have the big advantage of having a standalone chain that require more works ofc but it's a trade-off at the end of the day üôÇ


[23-Oct-21 07:11 AM] cipi#4502
the listing of new UTXO coins was intended for the developers of those coins... they should know exactly what all those parameters mean that are needed


[23-Oct-21 07:11 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Oh I agree. The beuty of Komdoo is I think it is possible to bridge taht gap. To have the simplicity of creating and using a AC chain like a token, but the benefits of having an actual coin


[23-Oct-21 07:11 AM] Slyris#2880
Actually you are a quite late, because it's was possible with the antara composer in the past if I remember, am I correct @cipi ?

creating AC coin is simple and well documented. Permissionless and clear as would be expected. Its the steps after that as far as a adex listing we are discussing üôÇ


[23-Oct-21 07:14 AM] Slyris#2880
But a coin listing is only 2 pull request, and click on button in the GUI that's not so harmfull, Can add a sync button to dl last coins file / last desktop cfg if required


[23-Oct-21 07:15 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
If the intention of adex is not meant for casual users that might otherwise use a ETH token, then I retract my comments. I do not see the possibility of Komodo to grow as a "token" type platform to compete with ETH/BSC if it doe snot include some sort of instant listing somewhere


[23-Oct-21 07:17 AM] cipi#4502
i meant UTXO coins, not the KMD ACs...
for KMD ACs it is easier, since you don't need the parameters about address format and priv key and txfee, they are the same for all ACs


[23-Oct-21 07:22 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
As a knowledgeable user of the process that works with the thing, it does not sound to difficult to say, install teh required explorer, build the correct electrum servers, configure your node, complete some manual swaps, fill out the configurations, people can help with questions about requested fields, submit the two PR's, once approved, clone adex, build your binaries, contact any potential users of your coin, have them replace adex with your custom version, etc. The issue here is this is not a coherent or obvious process. What I just listed isnt even listed anywhere. It is not possible to do this without human interaction. I agree two PR's is not difficult, but the full process, when taken as a whole, will not attract average users. Average users will create a AC coin simply then become confused. Especially when with tokens on ETH/BSC you fiull out a couple line form, pay your few hundered dollars, and done.


[23-Oct-21 07:23 AM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
I only write all this not to argue, but rather to to provide real world feedback on why us, as avid Komodo supporters that have been here for 6+ years because we see the power of atomic swaps, didnt complete the process and are looking for alternatives, let alone some average user that may have stumbled onto Komodo and want to give it a try. Especially if they read that it is superior in every way to a token, but cant figure out how to get a listing without becoming highly involved with the community, when maybe they just needed some basic coin for some particular use, as we did for the giveaway. Through this process I see how Komodo and adex can be great and bridge that gap with even some basic changes to the process. If we can figure out atomic swaps, onboarding should be simple!!

Yes this was initially meant to be a trading "event" to expose users to atomicdex with the intent of trading their DragonFairy for real coins that the community would put up (a more engaging method to distribute coins rather than, as an example, raining Pirate directly to users). Everyone participating would win in some form by receiving real coins. 
I also agree that the listing process is not for the common person. Also, I think at some point desktop and mobile will need to find a way to "sync" up but i dont have all of the insight into the complexities of listing on mobile. Perhaps as a temporary medium, out of this process we can have a solid documentation process that covers all of the steps from creating a new smart chain to listing  it on atomicdex Desktop.


[23-Oct-21 11:01 AM] jspook16#3059
I see alot of other ideas being posted as well which is great but i think as a starting point we need to get a basic process going. I would suggest we start with a simple trading event, produce the documentation, and then study the outcome of a trading event. (Participation levels, bots, community reaction, etc) I think we can build as we go.

[24-Oct-21 06:08 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
along the way we had actually came up with some good ideas for things that we dropped to be sure this did not gain any value. The intent is to be a "token" that you do not want, and will immediately exchange for a coin with real value that the participants would want.  We dont want anybody holdng on to this coin. I know that is counter-intuitive. I think we would all be open to a better name, ticker, or icon if it made sense and remained non-chain-specific. We had discussed dust as a ticker (fairy dust). If you felt compelled to make a icon I would say go ahead,. 

The one I originally made was simply a modified legacy komodo icon in the modern logo colors with some clipart fairy so something more unique would be great. Only thing I would suggest is if it could somehow have a connection to the Komodo platform through colors or some other meaning, but I suppose that is not important, just opinion. You are the expert with art. I am always impressed with your skill. The one we have now doesn't scale down to a small size very well, which will likely most be used in the small adex format, so something that scaled small would be an improvement


[24-Oct-21 06:20 PM] sems#7713
Sure. I've been thinking about the name and it sounds not bad actually. It feels like that; somehow connected with komodo dragon but this dragon is not komodo itself, just a fairy version of it for this tale (project). The name makes sense. Then we can move forward if you guys wish. And I work on logo by this time.

Oh sorry, I was only making a comment about how we have discussed other options. I dont mean to change it. Honestly I would leave as it is for now unless we make otehr changes. Yes, everything would need to be resubmitted. We would need to update SPV servers, update explorer, and resubmit the PR to adex, so not worth the change, IMHO. I kind of got here late so I am not sure what the direction of the project is here. If I understand correctly maybe a it will be more of a competition? I would say the best approach would be to make all decisions for the entire thing, then make all changes at once. We can even restart the chain then too.


[24-Oct-21 07:34 PM] jspook16#3059
Ok im good with leaving it as is then. Dragon Fairy as the asset chain name, DGNF as the ticker to minimize impact to the existing work that has been done. Either way, we need changes to the ticker because the ticker previously was DRAGONFAIRY and only after I submitted did we know that we had to reduce the character count

I guess teh first question I have is this. We kind of explained what the original intent of what you and I were doing. What exactly is the intent of the project now? Is it the same or a different direction? I missed the earlier conversations


[24-Oct-21 07:34 PM] jspook16#3059
I still have one node running the chain


[24-Oct-21 07:36 PM] jspook16#3059
I think its the same. With the addition that we will document it thoroughly. Whats sort of still in question is whether we will recycle the DGNF coins or create a new chain for each subsequent event. However, if we get to that point that would be a win


[24-Oct-21 07:37 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
The asset chain is very simple to create, the trouble is the listing on adex, especially if we pay for a mobile listing. It does not seem effective to have to redo  the listing each time there is a new event.


[24-Oct-21 07:39 PM] jspook16#3059
I agree. Thats why i think recycling (or attempting) to would be a good approach. Also, I think we can try the first event with just the Desktop app....see how that goes.....see how many coins we cant recycle ....and see what else we can learn before committing to a mobile listing.

[24-Oct-21 07:39 PM] jspook16#3059
Im also concerned about the tip bot and how that would happen


[24-Oct-21 07:40 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
I discussed with the original tipbot dev. There was a fee of around $500, which includes not only the creation but ongoing maintenance and integration.. He is out with covid at the moment, but it also seems I saw a different tipbot around?


[24-Oct-21 07:41 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
The main trouble with teh tipbot path is unless we pay for somebody to maintain it, somebody would need to dedicate time to it and that seems can be quite involved at times


[24-Oct-21 07:42 PM] jspook16#3059
Another reason to recycle the coins, so that we can continue to use the tip bot that we'll probably end up having to pay for


[24-Oct-21 07:44 PM] jspook16#3059
Ok what do you think about doing the first event with just atomicdex desktop...that way the only expenses are the tip bot and any costs for the chain nodes


[24-Oct-21 07:46 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
I personally use the desktop so I see no real issue. The main thing is as you mentioned before. Many of the participants are in countries that they dont have desktops. Many are cell only users. So immediately it unincludes some percentage of potential users. The other issue is if the promotion is meant to highlight adex, it leaves out a major feature.


[24-Oct-21 07:47 PM] jspook16#3059
yeah....do you know how much a mobile listing is?


[24-Oct-21 07:47 PM] jspook16#3059
I asked in atomicdex mobile


[24-Oct-21 07:48 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
I have no idea, hopefully they respond. For some reason I feel like I saw a ~$1k/year number somewhere,but maybe that was as a service


[24-Oct-21 07:49 PM] jspook16#3059
Ok we'll wait and see. I probably cant start on updates until the middle of the week.


[24-Oct-21 07:51 PM] jspook16#3059
Im thinking the first thing we need to do is update the electrum servers and the explorer..... I was running one of the electrum servers if I remember correctly. Do you have time for the other server and the explorer or do we need to find someone else (I know you have other endeavors now üôÇ )


[24-Oct-21 07:51 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Oh, I recal where I saw it, I assume its less if we do teh listing ourselves: https://youtu.be/QBDK2_2MsrE?t=251 (link timestamped to a price list)

[24-Oct-21 07:54 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
It is a busy time for me right now. I can give you permission to the server as well. Thiose things are not much work though. The thing that is more work is doing it multiple times. So lets first make all final decisions, than we can do all updates at once and a final submission to the adex PR


[24-Oct-21 07:55 PM] jspook16#3059
Ok will do. I'll post a list of final decisions on here tomorrow. If we get enough consensus a couple of days afterwards, we'll consider those the final decisions.


[24-Oct-21 07:55 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
you may have seen above Sems was going to consider a new icon over the next few days as well.

[24-Oct-21 07:56 PM] jspook16#3059
Yep I saw that. I think that can be worked concurrently with all of the other updates needed


[24-Oct-21 07:57 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
It will need to be finalized for the updates to the explrer and the PR submission, so better to finalkize everyting


[24-Oct-21 07:57 PM] jspook16#3059
Ah yeah i forgot about the explorer


[24-Oct-21 07:58 PM] jspook16#3059
Ok we'll make that one of the first items to get done. I guess after the final decisions are decided I can post a list in order of items to be completed


[24-Oct-21 07:59 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
So the things we need to decide on is:
1) Chain parmaters (are they good as they are? 7777777 premined, PoS, 30 sec blocks, etc) 
2) chain name
3) ticker
4) Icon


[24-Oct-21 08:00 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Lastly I need to look through our past conversations. If I recall correctly, I though I remember you mention that a Komodo dev responded taht we needed to make a change with teh SPV? I think we were instructed to use electrumx, but then they wanted a different one, though I forget now. Does that sound familiar at all?


[24-Oct-21 08:01 PM] jspook16#3059
We had to enable websockets on the server


[24-Oct-21 08:01 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Also, I know there was conflicting documentation on the icon size. Did we get a final info on what that needed to be? Would be helpful for Sems before he starts


[24-Oct-21 08:01 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Oh, tahts right, I belive we already enabled that servce


[24-Oct-21 08:01 PM] jspook16#3059
it was a simple parameter change that we had already made


[24-Oct-21 08:01 PM] jspook16#3059
yep we both did it ....it was one of the last things we did

JUST to be sure


[24-Oct-21 08:04 PM] jspook16#3059
I suppose one more thing we need to decide is whether we want to pursue a mobile listing for this first event or not


[24-Oct-21 08:04 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Ina earlier conversation you mentioned:


[24-Oct-21 08:04 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
> The logo is supposed to be 82 x 82. The one we have is like 180 x 180


[24-Oct-21 08:05 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
So best we get clarification first


[24-Oct-21 08:05 PM] jspook16#3059
mmmm ok then i agree lets wait for cipi to reply on that.


[24-Oct-21 08:06 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Well, we have to do teh desktop listing first, so lets just start there. Mobile listing would be a matter of getting enough people together to contribute, though if it is <$1k seems doable.


[24-Oct-21 08:07 PM] cipi#4502
i uploaded all icons in 128x128, like they are in https://github.com/spothq/cryptocurrency-icons/tree/master/128/icon
Desktop scales it as needed anyway afaik


[24-Oct-21 08:08 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Thanks @cipi . So @sems looks like 128x128

Ok so I would say ticker decision is made.


[24-Oct-21 08:11 PM] jspook16#3059
I personally would like to keep the chain parameters and chain name as they are now. For the ticker name i have no preference; "DGNF" was just something that we came up with on the fly after a day or so of brainstorming.


[24-Oct-21 08:12 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
I agree. Lets wait to hear what the other people in this channel have to say


[24-Oct-21 08:13 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
To all that are participating in this, please react to this message with a ‚úÖ  or ‚ùå  on DGNF as the ticker, or suggest anything else you prefer. This ticker was just made on the fly so we are open to suggestions to get this step finalized

Yes, looks like that is the community consensus, so that we can consider resolved. Once we have logo from Sems we can rebuild everything and get that submittal together.


[26-Oct-21 06:12 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Now I have another question, and thats governance. I paid for a year of hosting and the url, so we cam just leave like that for now, but in the future maybe we can consider having multiple people host the explorer, we can deal with that in one year. For now, its really just the coins. The idea is that this project is done in every way possible so that these coins do not get any value. In fact, we will explain the chain can be deactivated at any time so people should trade them ans they get them. 

Previously, I just sent all of the coins to jspook for him to hold as he was going to be more involved in the giveaways. I have to hold on to around 12k for staking across the segs on a full POS chain, so at least one node is doing that. I prefer to not hold any. Does this community think the should be handled in some other way? I really dont think we need to go to multisig wallets and strict accounting, but we should have a plan now so there are no issues later


[26-Oct-21 06:13 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
I would say, have me keep what I need for staking, the rest goes to jspook, and he can disperse as he sees fit to others. It is a fully transparent chain (no z-addrs) for this reason so there is already a public ledger


[26-Oct-21 06:15 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Our original idea was also to ask whoever contributed (the people that placed buy orders on adex for DUST, the fairys), if they would send back the DUST they bought to another address jspook would have in his wallet. This way we could keep track of how much was going out, coming back, being traded through adex, etc


[26-Oct-21 08:17 PM] jspook16#3059
I am running of couple of remote machines.... I can host the explorer as well. As for the coins... Im good either way but I would prefer splitting up the major sums with folks on here that will be actively distributing. So essentially... putting out a call to see if anyone else is interested in being a distributor of DUST


[26-Oct-21 10:09 PM] sems#7713
I have a dedicated mini pc which I use it for staking mcl. I can use it if it would help.


[27-Oct-21 12:13 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
for now a year is paid for for the server, so we can deal with that in a year. I agree with your @jspook16 . We'll just send the full amount to you, and then you can distribute chunks to whomever will be distributing.


[29-Oct-21 09:04 PM] jspook16#3059

@scott (notfromthefuture) did you use any of these or would you recommend any of these?


[06-Nov-21 12:37 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Yes I believe so. I think most of these I have read, dont think I had anything else. There are some things not included in those that are required for atomicdex. One thing that comes to mind is websocket service needs to also be enabled.

One thing jspook and I had discussed was that once we are able to get a successful listing of a asset coin, to publish a medium article that discusses exactly how to do it with a clear checklist and step-by-step guide. Something that puts everything you need to know into one summarized article so anybody considering doing the same wil knwo what exactly is involved and how to accomplish it.

This comment goes hand in hand with my questions about the composer in #üí¨‚îÉgeneral . CLI based composer should be included with komodo install. Something to help navigate the many options for creating a chain. Sure creating a chain is easy but creating it correctly not so easy. Even Nutella had to run lots of tests to get it correct. If komodo expects to get to the 1000+ asset chains then free composer is a must. Also having a free and easy to use one-click install script for the explorer and same for the spv server would be amazing. And of course a one click script that performs the steps required for MM2 integrations.
And to top it off, I want it to be voice activated so I don't have to type any keys. (That last pay is meant to be funny)

The coin creation part seems pretty clear and is well documented, but I do agree with you, especially when you compare to the process of the competition where you fill out a form, pay a fee, and done. Seems the Komodo process could also be form based, which will ensure properly formatted submissions and a way to answer common questions along the way. I envision a two form system. One for the asset chain that at the end spits out a install script or the first two nodes (includes SPV, explorer, nodes, etc). Then a second form for adex once the chain is up that performs the required manual swap, and gathers all data for the listing

Choosing the AssetChain Parameters
most info came from 
https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/antara/antara-setup/antara-customizations.html#ac-adaptivepow

with supporting examples from
https://blockchain-developer-docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/komodo/example-asset-chains.html#

Whereas it is very easy to launch a Komodo AssetChain, using the correct parameters requires some research. My research concept is to build a trading coin for a hypothetical trading competition on AtomicDex. I want this coin to be fast, I want a premine at near 100%, I don‚Äôt necessarily need it to contain a block reward after a certain point. I don‚Äôt need privacy, and I don‚Äôt need CustomConsensus Modules.

So here are the parameters I‚Äôm looking at. 
ac_name , ac_supply, ac_reward, ac_end, ac_blocktime, ac_adaptivepow, ac_public. Other parameters I won‚Äôt use, but might have a use for down the road so I‚Äôm listing them out of interest. ac_cc, ac_snapshot, ac_txpow.

ac_name=CompetitionCoin -ac_supply=777777 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_end=200 -ac_blocktime=20 -ac_adaptivepow=1 -ac_public=1 &
```


[10-Nov-21 03:23 PM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
wondering if anyone has any comments on these selected parameters


[10-Nov-21 03:25 PM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
the coin is 20 sec, blockrewards end in about ~5 minutes after launch, great premine at nearly 100%


[10-Nov-21 03:26 PM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
I choose adaptivepow in case I screw up any mining, and I want to mine via cpu


[11-Nov-21 03:43 AM] smkhound#7640
looks ok, though generally ac_name is all caps and not quite so verbose. Best way to confirm  it works for you is to spin it up locally and play with it, then you can just delete everything before doing it for real.  See - https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-tutorials/creating-a-smart-chain-on-a-single-node.html

Creating a Smart Chain on a Single Node
Under most circumstances, a developer should use two separate nodes to set up and create a Smart Chain.

Yeah, my first try launching between two nodes, it appeared to work but failed to mine the Genesis block. Both nodes could ping each other. One node is running Tokel, the other node was running an instance of rogue. So it is possible that is the issue. The second command I launched, the one with the mining instruc, gave an error? That said something about try mining with tnomp or something like that. Am not by my computer.


[11-Nov-21 10:13 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Needless to say I'll try again with changing the chain name to all caps with less words


[11-Nov-21 10:13 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
And try to get it to work via one node


[11-Nov-21 10:14 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Maybe I don't need two nodes for my purposes?

Anyone know if the ac_name of an asset chain is also the ticker? documentation I have found seems to imply that but I see chains like TOKEL that have an ac name of "TOKEL" but a ticker of "TKL". If these can be different where is the distinction made?

Ok I have set up two DRAGONFAIRY nodes:
./komodod -ac_name=DRAGONFAIRY -ac_staked=100 -ac_supply=7777777 -ac_blocktime=30 -ac_public=1 -ac_reward=1 -ac_end=1 -addnode=51.222.85.227

The second node is currently synching up.

@jspook16  and I completed some testing sending and swapping via a adex build, all is working great! Hopefully we can make this a great learning experience and gateway to atomic swaps for those that have never used it before. Cool to see it starting to come together. Lots of good information for putting together a guide soon for anybody wanting to create a new asset chain and list on adex too

Does anybody know somebody we can speak with about a discord tipbot? Our guy on the Pirate server is out with health issues fro a bit, but I see there are other ones floating around. Not sure if best path is to make our own or work with somebody already running one on KMD ecosystem servers

@Artakush most of the KMD ecosystem tipbots are made and maintained by @sclear

Awesome, thanks! Was not sure who maintained them. Do you think we can ask him for some help? üôÇ

Thanks @gcharang and @Artakush , I have spoken to sclear about the tipbot and he was willing to provide one for a modest fee. Unfortunately he is the one out with health issues. I haven't seen posts from him in a few months so I really hope he is OK.

As I understand, he ran the one called "tipbot", but I do see there is another bot around, I think callled "tip.cc". Maybe we can track down who runs that one


[24-Nov-21 02:03 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
@Tovar we are looking at setting up a tipbot to distribute a promotional asset chain coin we call DragonFairy. I would like to ask your experience in setting up `tip.cc`


[24-Nov-21 02:10 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Oh, I think this is private channel. @Audo am I able to invite `Tovar#1111` to this channel or do you need to add her?


[24-Nov-21 03:01 PM] jspook16#3059
tip.cc is outside of the komodo ecosystem i think. 
https://tip.cc/
That one is about $1k usd for listing.

It is the one being used on teh Pirate servers, Tovar (and others) set it up. Once she can join this channel she can tell us what was involvled and if we can use it with DUST

Ok cool

A tipbot wouldn't be very difficult to code. Especially with the bitgo library.


[24-Nov-21 03:48 PM] cryptosammy#3587
hosting the tipbot on a fairly secure server should be good enough, just simply dont allow private keys to be dumped and only allow local server shutdown possible. Store the private keys in a flatfile with encryption.


[24-Nov-21 05:59 PM] sems#7713

Yeah I assume there will be some charge, but it may be worth it to save teh working of building one, maintaining, and supporting issues. Would be great if we had our own with some template for other AC chains to use

you would need $1000 in BTC to list as long as it's on BSC it can easily be added.

It's a komodo smart chain not a bsc token. Does that still apply?


[25-Nov-21 09:00 AM] Tovar#1111
let me check, one sec


[25-Nov-21 09:02 AM] Tovar#1111
I think it could be possible but confirming and as soon as I hear back I will update you all!


[25-Nov-21 09:14 AM] Tovar#1111
``` we don't support komodo chain as of now, we could look into it but it would prolly cost too much for a single project to pay, would be >$5k

in the past e.g. for avax we first found 5+ token projects interested in paid listing, $1k each and then we added the chain and the tokens

that's how we usually add support for new chains```

if tip.cc cannot I think it would be worth checking with Bago as I am currently in talks with him now about his current project if you guys are interested.

Komodo asset chains are launched in the exact way that kmd is (with different parameters of course)


[25-Nov-21 10:07 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Kmd and all asset chains are launched via komodod.

Which might not be all that different from bitcoind

Is it not tip.cc thats being used for ARRR in the Pirate sever? If so, Pirate is still essentially an asset chain. Should actually be easier


[25-Nov-21 01:59 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Either way, my question is does that $1k cover maintenance and support of the bot and any user transaction issues that arise? If so it may be worth funding between a group of us just for that reason. Though I am starting to think maybe just creating a AC bot the whole ecosystem could benefit from may be worth it for somebody interested in maintaining it. Thye could make a few bucks off the effort I would assume

[25-Nov-21 03:12 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Oh, that was my confusion, didnt realize it was for wARRR. So we dont currently have a ARRR bot while sclear is out, is that correct?


[25-Nov-21 03:13 PM] jspook16#3059
arrrtip bot i think still works. But if it did break, sclear would be the person needed to fix it


[25-Nov-21 03:15 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
ok, so that makes sense. He was charging $500 to setup teh same arrrtip bot, but for DUST which would include all the backend work and ongoing support. Basically he would setup and handle its operation so we would not need to do anything on our end.


[25-Nov-21 03:35 PM] jspook16#3059
Yeah i think that's the best option. Any word on if he is ok?

This uses a script to setup. For whatever reason it wouldn't make the correct folders and setup didn't work. But I didn't start with this guide, started with decker, and also a binary install, so must have done something wrong. I'll try it on a fresh install see what happens.

[26-Nov-21 12:48 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
Yes, that is the same one I used @‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª . If it is not creating folders I would probably check that the chain was launched so the conf file is there for the script. Also make sure of case. Asset chain names should be all caps. The directory.sh is pretty straight forward so if the issue persists you could walk through it manually to see what may be causing the issue. Often with setup scripts like these I will use them as a guide to do the steps manually anyway so I can be sure of what exactly they are doing.

@Audo  could you add @bago here. Need to ask him about a tip bot


[01-Dec-21 11:33 PM] scott (notfromthefuture)#4595
@jspook16  I just spoke with @Bago. He is working on a bot that seems functional but still beta. I asked him to come see if he has advice on how we might proceed or if he may be interested in providing for a fee. Sounds like the main issue is a sufficient server, which should be no issue. Probably not a good ise to run on the spv/explorer server, but it should be sufficent if we think that is a good idea.

Hello, thanks for add üôÇ got a couple more issues to solve.. but i can have a look soonish on how i can implement support for komodo and komodo smart chains.. i'll write an implementation that can be used on full nodes..
support for additional coins mainly goes into "services"
https://github.com/bobpepers/RUNES-Tip/tree/master/src/services
and each coin will probably need some helpers that are specific for the coin in question
https://github.com/bobpepers/RUNES-Tip/tree/master/src/helpers/pirate

i can have a look at an svp implementation on later date if the code for the svp api is open source, but i wouldn't recommend running it on any light wallet..

oh right, totally forgot to answer this message.. i'm running a test version for pirate in some of the alternative servers for pirate like (ARRRmy/PirateClout) using these servers to test the tipbot on larger sample sizes and to receive feedback from people. people there are helping me to test and to bring issues to light if there are any. i need to think about how i'm going to integrate komodo (and smartchains) and if i'll be forking my own library for it or not. i'll try to keep you updated. still need to overhaul the telegram side of the bot.

Thanks to @Bago , the dragonfairy (DUST) tip bot is now active! üôÇ Next step is to create two flyers. A Supporter Flyer describing how different projects can support the movement. A Participant Flyer describing how users can trade DUST for real coins. Intent is to keep them simple, concise, but effective. I will start on these as soon as i can.
