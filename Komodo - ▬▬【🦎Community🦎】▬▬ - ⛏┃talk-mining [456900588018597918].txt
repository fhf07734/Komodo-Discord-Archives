any good pool advice ? was on suprnova, but as they decide not to send the forgotten password for weeks even after countless emails to admin, I'll just switch my rigs

Komodo Mining Pool
Komodo mining pool is a mining pool for mining Komodo (KMD), the first komodo pool and best on web. On komodominingpool.com you can mine with your CPUs and GPUs.

hi question i normally use xmr stack to mine monero based coins as i have a mixed amd and nvidia setup however i would like to mine kmd and its asset chains like Equaliser which miner would be best to use for this as it is an equihash algo

Hey @Cypher just to let you know your role in discord is spelled wrong, 'Eqaulsier' instead of Equaliser, not sure if that's something that has to be changed by a kmd admin here though

YMMV with any miner
It wasn't too extensive (just under 2 hours), but on rigs as low as 3 1080TIs and as high as 13 1080TIs, I saw no discernible performance difference between dstm and EWBF (with 0 fee)

I dont think they have enough RAM for that.


[18-Jun-18 07:14 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
even if they don't and a RAM mod increases the price 10x, they're still set to punch out a greater ROI than GPUs


[18-Jun-18 07:15 AM] Alright#0419
BTCZ, the only coin to switch so far, has lost about 1/3 of it's hash rate


[18-Jun-18 07:17 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, that's a double edged value, because the changed K&N values make a more intense algo and sols go way down on every card


[18-Jun-18 07:18 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
iirc, a 1080TI on BTCZ is only getting like 50-60 Sol/s


[18-Jun-18 07:18 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
so the numbers drop with that naturally


[18-Jun-18 07:25 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
__________
On the humor side of things, unsafe changed their K&N values because they are anti-Bitmain and they feel that the change also makes them "nicehash resistant" üòÇ


[18-Jun-18 07:32 AM] Alright#0419
Taking it that into consideration, what I meant is that their network lost about 1/3 of hardware actually mining it


[18-Jun-18 07:32 AM] Alright#0419
it's about a 15x decrease in sol/s


[18-Jun-18 07:33 AM] Alright#0419
for any given card


[18-Jun-18 07:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think that comes from 2 things:
1) profit switchers still on "regular" equihash
2) people that lack the ability to see that their drop from 700-60 is the same as everyone else's and their "loss" really isn't


[18-Jun-18 07:35 AM] Alright#0419

"Lets all switch to 144 & 5, that way our efforts to be 'ASIC resistant' make it easier for ASIC manufacturers to target all of us"
Feken morons centralize around a set of numbers that makes it even easier to target more coins in order to "fight centralization"

I see many zec forks that have plans to move to 144,5


[18-Jun-18 09:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
I don't think it's very smart, either. They seem to be doing it so they don't need to write their own optimized miners and can use existing miners that support common (N,K) values


[18-Jun-18 09:18 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the only thing that changing to the same KN values does is increase investment costs - profitability of ASICs with more RAM will not change


[18-Jun-18 09:20 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and the more that switch to the same K&N is the more likely that an ASIC for that K&N will come into being


[18-Jun-18 09:27 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
or just put 4G of RAM in the damn thing and make K and N both a variable setting


[18-Jun-18 09:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
this very nice write up (but long) describes how Bitmain can most likely already follow forks with arbitrary (N,K), they probably use it for themselves already: https://blog.sia.tech/the-state-of-cryptocurrency-mining-538004a37f9b

[19-Jun-18 08:22 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Orphan blocks are going to become the norm. If someone did a running average I'm almost certain it will eclipse atleast double the reward per block.


[19-Jun-18 08:22 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm betting that zcash never forks due to ASICs, I think the devs are smart enough to see the true value over the anti-Bitmain FUD and rhetoric


[19-Jun-18 08:22 AM] BlackJesus#6161
the latter half of my statement is a major change for orphan interest


[19-Jun-18 08:23 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Definitely I feel like this will be a defining moment for privacy cryptos specifically zksnarks vs. ring signatures


[19-Jun-18 08:24 AM] BlackJesus#6161
They have clearly taken divergent dev paths now. Funny thing is we know where the asic path leads. *stares at BTC/BCH*


[19-Jun-18 08:24 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
If your stratum and your interweb connections are good, orphans are quite minimal
I think I've had like 3 this year and that includes days of 1M+ Sols in rentals


[19-Jun-18 08:25 AM] BlackJesus#6161
granted a community split will be less likely I think in privacy cryptos due to the dev team coming from inception with ico's

with your amount you certainly have to be pointing a decent size at zcash


[19-Jun-18 08:29 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
as it stands now, the plan is that 1 mini will be on a custom stratum for asset chains (I still haven't started writing it yet, though), the GPU power will go towards Stanford's folding program, and most (if not all) of the minis will be on KMD


[19-Jun-18 08:30 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
short of some outstanding profit margin jump, I can't see me aiming anything at zcash


[19-Jun-18 08:35 AM] BlackJesus#6161

Losses today are major gains tommorow.


[19-Jun-18 08:36 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, if you look at value expected (assuming a rehitting of ath), ZEC = 4:1 and KMD = 6:1


[19-Jun-18 08:36 AM] BlackJesus#6161
true.


[19-Jun-18 08:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and if you expand to 10x, KMD will hit $19.50 long before ZEC hits $1,982.5


[19-Jun-18 08:38 AM] BlackJesus#6161
That's very true.


[19-Jun-18 08:38 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I  fully expect komodo to go through a fomo phase unlike any other coin.


[19-Jun-18 08:38 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Due to the self generating interest.


[19-Jun-18 08:40 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's literally the reason that I'm dumping so much under $2.25 in order to buy minis and Z9s too (when they come out)
I'm betting on a far greater future return than holding


[19-Jun-18 08:41 AM] BlackJesus#6161
oh wow.


[19-Jun-18 08:41 AM] BlackJesus#6161

Assuming most mini buyers head to ZEC, I should make it all back before Jan 1


[19-Jun-18 08:42 AM] BlackJesus#6161

[19-Jun-18 08:44 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
The evil side of me has a true hope that one of the ASIC makers (hopefully BM since I'm buying so many from them) make their fw open source and they can support RAM upgrades and the KN changers get crushed


[19-Jun-18 08:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
even if 3GB of RAM sends the BM prices up by 10x, they're still more powerful and profitable than GPUs


[19-Jun-18 08:46 AM] BlackJesus#6161
what is a kn changer


[19-Jun-18 08:47 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
a few coins are changing the K and N values of their algo to be "more ASIC resistant", based on the myth that ASIC have like no RAM


[19-Jun-18 08:47 AM] Alright#0419
There are supposive  firmware dumps of z9s floating around


[19-Jun-18 08:48 AM] BlackJesus#6161
oh yea, I heard about that to break asics they were upgrading the k and n values


[19-Jun-18 08:52 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it doesn't "break" anything; in simplest terms, it just makes a more "complex" computation that requires more RAM and power to solve
with 200 and 9 as values, a 1080TI uses 50 MB of RAM and can do ~740 Sol/s
with 144 and 5 as values, a 1080TI uses 2.5 GB of RAM and can do ~58 Sol/s

that's dumb why would zcash do tht


[19-Jun-18 08:53 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Right now they are doing their best to reduce the memory intensiveness of shielded transactions


[19-Jun-18 08:53 AM] BlackJesus#6161
making the base algorithm more memory intensive seems extremely counterintuitive


[19-Jun-18 08:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it reality, the change is driven by 2 camps
those that own GPUs already
those that hate Bitmain

[20-Jun-18 06:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Surprised they ship it by air


[20-Jun-18 07:06 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
UPS air is a bit faster and more expensive than FedEx boat


[20-Jun-18 07:09 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
conversely FedEx pre-clears shipments, so less overall issues with customs
It's a coin flip, really; but, since BM has the account page feked for what they link to FedEx when you order I went with UPS this time around


[20-Jun-18 09:09 AM] SHossain#0007
I will never use FedEx anymore in life if I have other alternatives. Would even pay more for other companies.

whats your beef with fedex shossain?

besides the hidden fees?


[20-Jun-18 10:52 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm not disagreeing, just wondering. I've never really noticed fedex fee's being much more than anyone else's.. but most of my shipping comes from amazon


[20-Jun-18 10:53 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I just saw my email from Bitmain. It says that my power supply was shipped but not the z9 mini... hmm


[20-Jun-18 10:55 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

I feel like I need to hang out in here more often.   
None of my minis have shipped.   I am sad fishy. 
I did half my order with UPS and half with DHL.   I hope DHL gets it right.   I've always used them in the past but not so much for international.

Hi folks, anyone here knows about a Dutch company 'Whinkel' (www.whinkel.be)? Looks like I got hoodwhinkel'd by them... ordered ~10K EUR worth in miners, they stopped communicating not long after the Bitmain news... Of course I ordered a bunch of 1080's a week before the  Bitmain news, but that is a different story...

Wasnt a Z9 mini already 10x more performant for only like twice the price?


[21-Jun-18 07:35 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
current batches (with PSU included) are ~ $30 more than 1 single 1080TI card
by the time you count hw, minis are cheaper than 1 card and ~13.5x the sols


[21-Jun-18 07:37 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
per sols, you need 14 1080TIs to match 1 mini
and 10k sol GPUs are at 13x the energy costs too


[21-Jun-18 07:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
a mini at $8,500 is still a discount over GPUs


[21-Jun-18 07:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[23-Jun-18 02:57 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah. I saw this after i saw it was unstable as fuck. But as the first of my rig was running without any problem on win10 I decided to clone hdd. Thing is the only way to tune it at that time by a noob was with polaris editor... on... win


[23-Jun-18 02:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
And yeah equihash isn t eth. But like you said : I mine what s the most profitable. And atm for amd... eth is just the best option for "stable" and "less risk"


[23-Jun-18 04:12 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
What I meant was that despite that addons that allow for it to be used for other algos, it's designed with eth in mind; so, one has to take that into consideration when choosing it

All "old" asset chains are minable, as are most of the newer ones; however, the block reward is 0.00010000 per block (plus any tx fees)


[24-Jun-18 11:38 PM] CiPhEr#2091
i'm trying to put an equation in my excel spreadsheet to calculate mining revenue for KMD. It seems as if it functions differently than other equihash coins. Usually I would use ((MyHashrate/(DifficultyX8192))Xsecondsinaday)Xblockrewardof3 and its pretty close for an equihash coin, however for KMD it seems the 8192 number needs to be closer to around 16. Does anyone know the precise # I should use there?


[25-Jun-18 12:38 AM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie the DEX hashrate is actually lower than usual, typically I see around 1 Ksol on it. SN about double that.

I'm only on BTC atm because the decay rate of the 5N pool I'm in is paying ~4x

normally, I mine ~2 dozen sha shitcoins

I tried over and over to do that, so if you could somehow replicate that, it'd be appreciated

it's kinda hard to mine without a daemon üôÑ

as in, not just the COQUI daemon


[25-Jun-18 11:24 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes, among others


[25-Jun-18 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
did it rewind your chain?


[25-Jun-18 11:25 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I don't think it did yet, but it will


[25-Jun-18 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
will only happen if a notarization tx from the real chain ends up in your mempool I believe


[25-Jun-18 11:27 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
iirc, the notary should notarize in it's correct position in the chain and the other 200 blocks will be orphaned

Something to do with mining a bunch of blocks while there is a pending notarization


[25-Jun-18 11:30 AM] Alright#0419
but the purpose of testing it was to see if it rewound properly


[25-Jun-18 11:30 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the notary should be like every 20 or 30 blocks, no?


[25-Jun-18 11:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
not really


[25-Jun-18 11:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
the freq is 2 blocks per AC but 10 blocks of KMD


[25-Jun-18 11:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
but that assumes every notarizations happens... and that doesnt happen every time... its a lot better than it was i the past but stil not 100% perfect


[25-Jun-18 11:32 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
It can't be every 2 blocks (going by my SN numbers)


[25-Jun-18 11:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok... each AC gets a notarixzation every 2 blocks of its chain but only if 10 KMD blocks have passed.


[25-Jun-18 11:32 AM] Deleted User#0000
If KMD is in f4a and no blocks are mined for 25mins... then SN can have a shit load of blocks before a Notarixztion


[25-Jun-18 11:33 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, like I said, 20-30 üòõ

well KMD is in f4a so notarizations are not really working.. thats when I do updates etc... even if it is 2:30 am here

[25-Jun-18 11:39 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
one of these days, I'll probably do the smart thing and mine something else and buy KMD

lol


[25-Jun-18 11:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
with your hash power, you might be able to mine the entire f4a, with an auto statum... might help KMD out too, still se 20-30mins blocks in it. Miners dont mine, until diff drops lots then hit it ahrd and mine all the 64 blocks super fast.


[25-Jun-18 11:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
all my KMD miners are 24/7 KMD


[25-Jun-18 11:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
yeah... thats prolly best way to go with the new algo for NN... f4a should be shelved as soon as its possible, likely next year at hard fork though üò¶

[25-Jun-18 01:02 PM] jansako#3330
I might set up my own stratum, once I settle on a coin. Would it really make that much difference with just one z9?


[25-Jun-18 01:03 PM] jansako#3330
yes, I did settle for an algo, of course... I meant coin


[25-Jun-18 01:04 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
aside from variance, all mining in a pool does for you is give you:
(pool mining) = (your profits) - (coinage you give away)


[25-Jun-18 01:05 PM] jansako#3330
I save the cost of time spent on setting up the stratum, and the cost of VPS...


[25-Jun-18 01:05 PM] jansako#3330
is that worth the 1% fee?


[25-Jun-18 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
fek a VPS, take 40 minutes and set up a local virtual machine


[25-Jun-18 01:06 PM] jansako#3330
that still costs in power


[25-Jun-18 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you believe in a coin, you should already be running a full node for that coin anyway


[25-Jun-18 01:07 PM] jansako#3330

I completely agree, I've been trying to add it since day 1. (while not actively trying myself still, just wanting) 

I know how to add pools, so if we could figure out the notary hash or whatever, we could add it that way but i think they all use the same. And decker told me thats not how he does it


[25-Jun-18 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[27-Jun-18 01:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Runaque Every one of those forks relies on the misguided notion that RAM is expensive and that's a deterrent for making an ASIC with more RAM. That's, literally, the only added "resistance".

The whole "big miners centralize" claim is null because tech advances should never be limited by the dreams of the economically "disenfranchised", simply because they can't afford it on a burger flipper's wage

Looks like I missed a pretty interesting discussion about mining here. @ComputerGenie I certainly get your stance, but I think the point you keep missing is that by allowing asics, and not trying to become asic resistant, you're effectively allowing for a large corporation to wipe out a union of smaller corporations and individuals both competitively and financially. A simple change to the equihash algo does indeed render most purpose built asics useless, and they'll continue to reshape and repurpose their hardware to create new versions, that's fine with their business model over at Bitmain, and doubly so if you believe they mine on the products before sales. This basically isolates and marginalizes your core adopters whom, admittedly, were well rewarded for doing so, but have grown attached.

I guess from a mining perspective, I don't see the benefit of becoming ASIC Tolerant. Perhaps I'm missing a big picture here, but is there any real benefit towards standing idle while ASICs run up the difficulty and nethash? I can certainly see the downsides of ASIC tolerance. By that decision alone, whether or not intended, KMD is deciding to not support those that have supported them, and will stand on the sidelines and do nothing while a big corporation comes in and makes their chain completely unable to be supported by GPU miners, therefore making it more centralized in practice because you'll have fewer miners carrying the weight.


[27-Jun-18 11:37 PM] CollectorKC#4360
.I guess a lot of people are just sitting back trying to figure out how ASICS could benefit KMD more GPU mining in a scenario where they have most of their support wiped out. Its not like you'll have miners mining at a loss just because they are fans, and in cases like mine, I'm holding KMD exceptionally long term because I find its potential to be the most promising, but I'll have to point my rig in a new direction here in a few days as profitability crashes in part to difficulty and market concerns. I think at the end of the day it just leaves a bad taste in everybody's mouth, even if they like the tech, its damaging to early adoption.


[28-Jun-18 12:22 AM] jansako#3330
I got my Z9 mini a few days ago. This thing was so clean there is no way it was run for any relevant length of time before shipping. They may run others before selling them, but not the one I got.
As Computergenie pointed out, the price of a 1080 Ti and a Z9 Mini are almost the same, so your point about a mega corp wiping out small miners is not valid. If you can afford one, you can afford the other.
Wiping out the current, existing GPU miners is  a different question. Money talks, as we say here, and miners do replace their hardware (they should anyway). If using ASIC will get more profitable, even the small miners will buy them, if GPU's are more profitable, miners will buy those too.


[28-Jun-18 12:24 AM] jansako#3330
I would even argue that a z9 significantly lowers the barrier of entry for a miner! I built my first GPU rig some months (yeah I know) ago for ~3600 USD. Again comp[are to the price of a z9...


[28-Jun-18 12:42 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Z9's launched at like $2k while the average 1080ti was around $850, you can't make the argument that they are the same price when they simply are not, and I've heard arguments for and against the Z9's  having been mined on with photos with an without dust, YMMV. The point is that you have a sketch company, one who not so privately goes out and attacks coins denouncing asics during the launches of their asic platforms by paying for nicehash users to 51% attack the network and/or drive up difficulty so high while failing a 51% attack ,miners are forced off the network for profitability's sake.


[28-Jun-18 12:43 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And again, its not about the profitability or efficiency of a Z9, its the miners that were there supporting the network prior to the Z9, and whether KMD NEEEDED to support asics or not


[28-Jun-18 12:44 AM] CollectorKC#4360
There's more miners negatively affected by asics on the network than those positively affected by it, that's simply not a win for KMD at all


[28-Jun-18 12:45 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Like I was trying to state, the point is rather about PR and how it looks, rather than the efficiencies or profitability of the asic and miner htemselves.


[28-Jun-18 12:45 AM] CollectorKC#4360
KMD literally looks like they are dropping their "average" looking girlfriend who has been there for years, to date the hot model.


[28-Jun-18 12:45 AM] CollectorKC#4360
To put it to a crude analogy


[28-Jun-18 12:46 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And I say this, because I've seen nothing genuinely presenting itself as a positive for KMD by accepting ASIC Tolerance.


[28-Jun-18 12:46 AM] CollectorKC#4360
If there was one, show me the facts and allow me to digest them.


[28-Jun-18 12:49 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And again, the points I'm representing are merely the sentiment right now, not necessarily the facts. It seems like the image of KMD and the feelings of those formerly attached to it are merely being swept off the table with the asic tolerance movement, but left without any reason WHY KMD would allow for the support of asics. I think that's the real big question mark for most GPU miners.

If all gpu miners got an z9 on the side... wouldnt it be same as before.. all small miners in the game..


[28-Jun-18 01:23 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Why would any miner buy a z9 without surety that the algorithm they intend to mine with would be there down the road?

@CollectorKC  Your question: "WHY KMD would allow for the support of asics. I think that's the real big question mark for most GPU miners."

I think you may have it backwards. ASICS were made to mine the Equihash algo, it was NOT KMD that was built to support ASICS. 
KMD did not change to allow or disallow asics. I am not pro or contra asics, I have a bit of both GPU's and Asics, they are simply tools for different jobs.  
I realize that can be taken as semantics, but my main point is that KMD is NOT made for miners, GPU or otherwise. 

The way I understood jl's vision form the start, KMD is a utility coin, it's value comes from being used by various parts of the ecosystem, and mining is meant to be a very small part of that. That is one of the reasons for the dPOW and 75% of the blocks mined by notaries. Miners are expected to have much less say in KMD than for example companies that are/will be  building on top of it. (see the 'Ecosystem' list on the sidebar). Right now that ecosystem is only just starting, but I for one am happy that it is finally taking off.

Thanks!


[28-Jun-18 03:40 AM] CollectorKC#4360
@jansako you can't make the argument that KMD Is neutral in the For .vs Against ASIC debate. KMD is on Equihash, Equihash was built for the very purpose of remaining ASIC resistant. Here's a little brush up from the Wikipedia. "Equihash was introduced at the Network and Distributed System Security Symposium 2016 in San Diego. The cryptocurrency ZCash integrated Equihash in April 2016, for reasons such as security, privacy, and ASIC miner resistance. Bitcoin Magazine notes, "According to the CryptoLUX scientists, the algorithm permits avoiding centralization of the mining process in the hands of a few first-class miners with specialized mining hardware, thus contributing to the ‚Äúdemocratization‚Äù of digital currencies based on Equihash."[3]". You'll note the part where it specifically states that the purpose of Equihash was to avoid centralization in the mining process to t hose with specialized hardware.  You'll also note the following from the same Wikipedia article "Equihash is now considered broken in the sense of purpose. The manufacturer Bitmain has succeeded in optimizing the processing of the algorithm with an ASIC. This makes the use of graphics cards too expensive.[4]".


[28-Jun-18 03:40 AM] CollectorKC#4360
You'll also note that KMD uses a paragraph citing Satoshi's vision, whom you'll remember coined the phrase 1 cpu 1 vote. KMD is not Zcash, and certainly have the ability to fork away from asics without damaging their own eco system, but they have not. Instead, the decision is to make no decision. Sitting on your hands is not something Satoshi would have done, certainly isn't something KMD should be doing, and it really draws attention to the fact that a deal might have struck under the table with Bitmain NOT to fork the coin so they can sell their asics, or, that the team themselves own asics and for the sake of their own greed, do not wish to fork. That answer, honestly, would be a much more appreciated answer than "mining only accounts for 25% of the network, it wont' matter, we'll do nothing", which is a huge middle finger to the miners.


[28-Jun-18 03:47 AM] jansako#3330
There can be an ASIC made for any algo, and someone else would need to answer if the asic-resistance was even a factor when Equihash was chosen for KMD.  If it was not, there is no argument  to be made.
The KMD team making a deal with Bitmain? Please.. now you are going too far.

I argue with computergenie all the time in safecoin chat, because they forked to 144,5 and he has a farm of ASICS and isn‚Äôt happy that we forked to look after the community and the little guy.  It seems any coin not forking right now comes into 2 categories, they either got paid to not fork, or they bought a load of z9s for themselves and are mining it until it earns less than a gpu does right now and then fork hoping to win back their communities. The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few - this statement should be imprinted on everyone‚Äôs head who runs a coin and bends over for ASICS.
What they will find out tho, is by not forking they lose their community which helped build the coin, and when they need help or support and look around there will be an empty space.

Also, again, where is the emotional attachment being found?


[28-Jun-18 04:04 AM] CollectorKC#4360
In fact, the opposite is more true if I'm venting about the lack of logic for the lack of mining support


[28-Jun-18 04:04 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I seek to operate


[28-Jun-18 04:05 AM] CollectorKC#4360
That has little to do with emotions.


[28-Jun-18 04:06 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
OK, I'm going to go get my coffee; when I come back you're going to explain to me the "downside" of using $850 ASICs over $875 GPUs and your explanation needs to include 0 anti-Bitmain shit and 0 emotional attachment to GPUs.....


[28-Jun-18 04:06 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I don't "need" to do anything


[28-Jun-18 04:08 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And I don't need to include emotional attachments to GPUs as that is not the case, nor the Anti-Bitmain sentiment, though its likely some deal had been made. The argument, again makes itself. KMD is on equihash, equihash was developed to be ASIC resistant, when given the opportunity to fork and remain ASIC resistant, no real answer comes out of KMD's mouth other than condescension in the line of "Mining accounts for 25% of our network" yada yada.


[28-Jun-18 04:08 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And, again, the issue is the lack of logic behind any statement supporting their decision NOT to fork


[28-Jun-18 04:08 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
You "need" to present a rational claim if you intend to get anywhere with this path you're trying to go down


[28-Jun-18 04:08 AM] CollectorKC#4360
That's the huge piece of the puzzle I"m missing.


[28-Jun-18 04:09 AM] CollectorKC#4360
No, you're sidetracking with bullshit and ignoring the point


[28-Jun-18 04:09 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Which is, where is the logic provided by KMD for not forking?


[28-Jun-18 04:10 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And, in the interest of full transparency, from KMD themselves, do they own any Bitmain ASICs themselves, and have they made an agreement with BItmain?


[28-Jun-18 04:10 AM] CollectorKC#4360
All could easily be addressed without much more time wasted


[28-Jun-18 04:10 AM] CollectorKC#4360
The lack of addressing, is the concern.


[28-Jun-18 04:10 AM] CollectorKC#4360
As pointed out at least four times now.


[28-Jun-18 04:10 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
OK, so that this point, all your claim amounts to is that ASICs shouldn't be because they were originally not meant to be, correct?


[28-Jun-18 04:11 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Please take the time to read the argument or don't comment at all.


[28-Jun-18 04:11 AM] CollectorKC#4360
If that's that conclusion you've come to from my request, you don't need to be wasting my time.


[28-Jun-18 04:11 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I've literally stated it four times already.


[28-Jun-18 04:11 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I wont' be doing it again.


[28-Jun-18 04:12 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I don't read or respond to dumbass, unfounded FUD speculation; so all I got out of the words you wrote are 
your claim amounts to is that ASICs shouldn't be because they were originally not meant to be


[28-Jun-18 04:12 AM] CollectorKC#4360
To be fair, It wasn't until I expressed my concerns that the whole Bitmain deal came to light, as I was delivered that by someone here already on your discord for sometime.


[28-Jun-18 04:13 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I , for the fifth time, came here for a logical reason as to why KMD decided NOT to fork.


[28-Jun-18 04:13 AM] CollectorKC#4360
If the dev team has made one, please present it.


[28-Jun-18 04:13 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
And, in the interest of full transparency, from SAFE themselves have they made an agreement with NVIDIA?


[28-Jun-18 04:13 AM] CollectorKC#4360
All I've been asking


[28-Jun-18 04:13 AM] CollectorKC#4360
What do SAFE or Nvidia have to do with KMD here?


[28-Jun-18 04:13 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
you're pulling shit out your ass


[28-Jun-18 04:13 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Should a coin decide whether or not to fork everytime new GPU's or FPGA's are released?


[28-Jun-18 04:13 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Nothing


[28-Jun-18 04:14 AM] CollectorKC#4360
It could


[28-Jun-18 04:14 AM] CollectorKC#4360
That's the point of democratization with Equihash.


[28-Jun-18 04:14 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I have pulled nothing out of my ass, @ComputerGenie


[28-Jun-18 04:14 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I'll ask that you take a deep breath and start reading.


[28-Jun-18 04:14 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"What do SAFE or Nvidia have to do with KMD here?"
About the same as pretending that Bitmain is the only ASIC maker or has any place in this conversation


[28-Jun-18 04:15 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Did I ever once pretend that Bitmain was the only ASIC maker?


[28-Jun-18 04:15 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And they certainly do have a place in this conversation


[28-Jun-18 04:15 AM] CollectorKC#4360
As this conversation is about ASICS


[28-Jun-18 04:15 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

Feel free to stop responding at any time


[28-Jun-18 04:15 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Again, for the sixth time now, I'm looking for a response from KMD that provides the logic for their reasoning NOT to fork.


[28-Jun-18 04:15 AM] CollectorKC#4360
If you could provide that, that would be great.


[28-Jun-18 04:15 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
dude you need to go back to wtf ever troll hole you climbed out of and stop tagging me for dumb shit at 1am

Maybe you shouldn't say dumb shit, then?


[28-Jun-18 04:16 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
1) KMD isn't forking because there's no need to fork
2) see 1


[28-Jun-18 04:17 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Awesome, heard that story already, would love the reasoning behind it.


[28-Jun-18 04:17 AM] CollectorKC#4360
If you don't have it, please don't talk for the team themselves.


[28-Jun-18 04:18 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
The reasoning behind not filling your car with gas when you pass a new gas station is what?


[28-Jun-18 04:18 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Actually for that analogy to work, you'd be not filling your gas tank with 87, and instead using 91, though your car doesn't require 91.


[28-Jun-18 04:19 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Also, with next to no improvement in performance, I might add.


[28-Jun-18 04:19 AM] CollectorKC#4360
In case you also had no idea how cars work.


[28-Jun-18 04:19 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
no car "requires" 91 octane


[28-Jun-18 04:19 AM] CollectorKC#4360

Go own one of them, read their manuals, most actually suggest not to use 87 because of reduced performance

"suggest " IS NOT "require"


[28-Jun-18 04:22 AM] CollectorKC#4360
By suggsting that you NOT use less than 91, isn't that the same as require in semantics?


[28-Jun-18 04:22 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And yes, there are in fact cars that REQUIRE 91+

"By suggsting that you NOT use less than 91, isn't that the same as require in semantics?"

As long as computergenie is the key respondent here, I suppose they would all be nonsensical, no?

A little snippet "Up until the last few years, just a handful of cars had 91 octane requirements versus 91 octane recommendations. High performance cars like the BMW M3 and the Audi S4 required 91 octane, and the engine management system was so calibrated toward high performance that running lower octane fuel was detrimental to the engine‚Äôs health."


[28-Jun-18 04:24 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
as a 4th generation mechanic, I know that there are NO cars that REQUIRE x octane; because, internal combustion hasn't advance (other than injection) since the advent of a V block


[28-Jun-18 04:25 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Wrong


[28-Jun-18 04:25 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Could I suggest you guys take this to the #talk-other-topics forums please!


[28-Jun-18 04:25 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I mean, I'm good with refraining from responding, so long as he admits that statement about being a 4th generation mechanic and yada yada about there being no cars that rerquire 91, was wrong.


[28-Jun-18 04:26 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

@CollectorKC there‚Äôs 0 reason to fork KMD. Because of dPoW, the notaries mine 75% of the blocks so there is asic resistance. But @ComputerGenie he is right about fuel octane. My car is tuned specifically for 93 and e85

Thank you @xRobeSx but I suppose I was looking for a breakdown of the logic behind the lack of forking, rather than yet another "quick" reason of not forking.


[28-Jun-18 05:38 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Its actually the same answer, though less condescending, as the 25% of the network are miners bit.


[28-Jun-18 05:40 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@CollectorKC What if I told you that, globally, there are 14 different octane measurement "standards" and the number `91` means 9 different things.....

[28-Jun-18 05:43 AM] xRobeSx#5136
@CollectorKC im driving I‚Äôll answer more about kmd in a few minutes. But computer genie is right in the fact that a lot of octanes are mixed to make different levels. But if I run lower octane it does throw off my fuel/timing maps and preform worse.


[28-Jun-18 05:43 AM] xRobeSx#5136
But we should drop the gas because it‚Äôs irrelevant hah


[28-Jun-18 05:44 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Just as soon as he admits his claim was wrong, that there are cars made that in fact REQUIRE 91


[28-Jun-18 05:44 AM] CollectorKC#4360
As proven by my link


[28-Jun-18 05:44 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And then he can step off his soapbox about being a 4th generation mechanic


[28-Jun-18 05:44 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Like he's not speaking to someone in the same fucking field


[28-Jun-18 05:44 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Probably hasn't even passed his ASE master certs'


[28-Jun-18 05:44 AM] xRobeSx#5136
They only require it based on the way they are tuned. If they were just tuned for lower octane it wouldn‚Äôt be required


[28-Jun-18 05:44 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Correct


[28-Jun-18 05:45 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And he came back with "no, they are recommended not required", and i gave him several examples of REQUIRED vehicles


[28-Jun-18 05:45 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And then he went on to ignore, slander, and attack


[28-Jun-18 05:45 AM] CollectorKC#4360
all side tracking my question, of whether or not that was anyone who could point me in the direction of the logic concerning the inaction of a fork


[28-Jun-18 05:45 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Specifically, was it debated? Voted on?


[28-Jun-18 05:45 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Is there a log?


[28-Jun-18 05:46 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Well required is still sketchy. It will run with lower octane but not as well.


[28-Jun-18 05:46 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Required differs from Recommended, but some are in fact required


[28-Jun-18 05:46 AM] xRobeSx#5136
As for komodo there is just no reason to fork. ASICS are fine on our network


[28-Jun-18 05:47 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I've heard that answer


[28-Jun-18 05:47 AM] CollectorKC#4360
But is that under the knowledge that it will throw off more miners from the network whom were supporting it?


[28-Jun-18 05:47 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Why change something that isn‚Äôt broken or a problem?


[28-Jun-18 05:47 AM] CollectorKC#4360
To adhere to the fundamental construct of equihash?


[28-Jun-18 05:47 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Every other z fork wants to fork to prevent ASICS


[28-Jun-18 05:47 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Hence they are forking


[28-Jun-18 05:48 AM] xRobeSx#5136
In a dumb way too


[28-Jun-18 05:48 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Right, because that's what Equihash was made for

[28-Jun-18 05:48 AM] xRobeSx#5136
In komodo it‚Äôs been established that notaries mine 75% even since the start


[28-Jun-18 05:49 AM] xRobeSx#5136
There‚Äôs no need to fork to prevent ASICS mining the other 25%

Well the claims that ASICS make centralization is wrong. As Genie said yesterday (you can scroll up), you can buy a 850$ gpu or 850$ asic. What‚Äôs it matter?


[28-Jun-18 05:50 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I already linked you straight to the wikipedia for equihash which uses that claim verbatim


[28-Jun-18 05:50 AM] CollectorKC#4360
its in half the white papers


[28-Jun-18 05:51 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Except for neither the asic or the gpu is $850


[28-Jun-18 05:51 AM] CollectorKC#4360
That argument is completely trash


[28-Jun-18 05:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

[28-Jun-18 05:53 AM] CollectorKC#4360
@xRobeSx the point was the alienation of equihash miners who are vehemently against asics, therefore supporters of the equihash movement, which is anti asic


[28-Jun-18 05:53 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And the logic behind not forking

Kindly fuck off back to your unSafeCoin troll hole


[28-Jun-18 05:54 AM] xRobeSx#5136

@CollectorKC day 1 as soon as the z9 got announced we asked @jl777c if KMD would fork or not


[28-Jun-18 05:55 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Like, NEVER asic


[28-Jun-18 05:55 AM] xRobeSx#5136
literally I asked 30 seconds after seeing the miner


[28-Jun-18 05:55 AM] xRobeSx#5136
i know someone screenshotted it


[28-Jun-18 05:56 AM] xRobeSx#5136
James answered instantly and said we would not fork....


[28-Jun-18 05:56 AM] xRobeSx#5136
there is no reason to


[28-Jun-18 05:56 AM] CollectorKC#4360
So, one man saying "we're not going to fork we have no reason", makes that final? And nobody brings up the concern for supporters and losing that support?


[28-Jun-18 05:57 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Well that one man is our Lead Dev, and no one else cared...


[28-Jun-18 05:57 AM] xRobeSx#5136
where were you then?


[28-Jun-18 05:57 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Not aware this discord was even here, apparently


[28-Jun-18 05:57 AM] xRobeSx#5136
the discussion was on slack before we even came to discord


[28-Jun-18 05:57 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Probably busy in my mineshaft mining kmd to be honest


[28-Jun-18 05:57 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I don't do slack, so that's certainly a reason why


[28-Jun-18 05:58 AM] xRobeSx#5136
well that was the primary chat for KMD


[28-Jun-18 05:58 AM] CollectorKC#4360
But its actually alarming that nobody said anything.


[28-Jun-18 05:58 AM] xRobeSx#5136
its not really that alarming, as anyone who can buy GPU's can buy ASIC's...


[28-Jun-18 05:58 AM] xRobeSx#5136
for about the same exact price


[28-Jun-18 05:58 AM] xRobeSx#5136
and its more efficient


[28-Jun-18 05:58 AM] CollectorKC#4360
They are not even close


[28-Jun-18 05:58 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And that's also a terrible argument


[28-Jun-18 05:58 AM] xRobeSx#5136
its better than the argument to switch...


[28-Jun-18 05:59 AM] CollectorKC#4360
The hell it is


[28-Jun-18 05:59 AM] xRobeSx#5136
to change some values that need more memory...


[28-Jun-18 05:59 AM] CollectorKC#4360
You're literally losing support for not switching


[28-Jun-18 05:59 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And that's not even a remote concern for the lead dev?


[28-Jun-18 05:59 AM] xRobeSx#5136
losing support from what?


[28-Jun-18 05:59 AM] xRobeSx#5136
haha


[28-Jun-18 05:59 AM] CollectorKC#4360

[28-Jun-18 06:01 AM] xRobeSx#5136
@CollectorKC a few other community members questioned the non fork that day, and brought it up, and we all talked it ou


[28-Jun-18 06:01 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I used to be #3 on Suprnova pool before I pulled support


[28-Jun-18 06:01 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm not questioning your hash, just speaking for CG


[28-Jun-18 06:02 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm not saying your concerns aren't valid, I'm just saying we discussed it, and doesn't really have any effect at all on our network


[28-Jun-18 06:02 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Right, but you also said jl answered within 30 seconds, and that was that, and that nobody brought it up


[28-Jun-18 06:03 AM] xRobeSx#5136
well he answered, right away, and then a few other people chimmed in, and the decision was made and talked about


[28-Jun-18 06:03 AM] xRobeSx#5136
no one else complained


[28-Jun-18 06:03 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"I used to be #3 on Suprnova"
And I ran a netsplit on more MSNChat rooms than anyone in the network's history
Who give a fek about either of those things?


[28-Jun-18 06:03 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I guess with ideas like, "the z9 and a 1080ti are the same price", and "25%" I can see why such a decision was made so hastily.


[28-Jun-18 06:04 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Its not about you CG, I was just explaining to @xRobeSx that I'm not marginalized miner.


[28-Jun-18 06:04 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Now, please stop responding unless you have something legitimate to say if you're going to address me.


[28-Jun-18 06:04 AM] xRobeSx#5136
The main factor was that NN's mine 75% of the blocks and there's no threat of a 51%. So why not let the hash rise and the network be more secure


[28-Jun-18 06:05 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I really have nothing else to say, switch your rigs elsewhere if you want


[28-Jun-18 06:05 AM] xRobeSx#5136
But I bet most z9's won't be on KMD network anyway, since only 25% of the blocks are up for grabs ...


[28-Jun-18 06:05 AM] CollectorKC#4360
They are, and have been


[28-Jun-18 06:05 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Pretty heavily actually.


[28-Jun-18 06:05 AM] CollectorKC#4360
But I probably monitor nethash more than most haha


[28-Jun-18 06:06 AM] xRobeSx#5136
yes, more than me. But whats wrong with the hash rising? besides you making less $?


[28-Jun-18 06:07 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Difficulty rising is the concern because eventually asics will run into zero profitability, and then simply switch coins


[28-Jun-18 06:07 AM] CollectorKC#4360
You'd have to rely on the nodes, and on any crazy gpu miners still left, to continue mining until the difficulty corrects


[28-Jun-18 06:07 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Which could technically cause some bumps along the way


[28-Jun-18 06:07 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"But I probably monitor nethash more than most"
How do you manage to monitor a non-factual estimate?

[28-Jun-18 06:08 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Even if all the asic's leave, there is no concern. CPU miners can come back for all i care...


[28-Jun-18 06:08 AM] CollectorKC#4360
That's the issue, though @xRobeSx


[28-Jun-18 06:08 AM] CollectorKC#4360
You're basically making a stance that says, "we don't care enough to support your needs"


[28-Jun-18 06:08 AM] xRobeSx#5136
NN's mine 75% of the blocks.. even if ASIC's, and CPU's leave, NN's could mine the other 25% as well in open competition


[28-Jun-18 06:08 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And then asking for them to return


[28-Jun-18 06:08 AM] CollectorKC#4360
But not protecting them if they did


[28-Jun-18 06:09 AM] CollectorKC#4360
By that point, you'd become centralized, no?


[28-Jun-18 06:09 AM] CollectorKC#4360
If NN's did 100%


[28-Jun-18 06:09 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm a NN, and I know 100% the NN's will protect the network no matter if the hash rises to the moon, or goes away


[28-Jun-18 06:09 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
'You're basically making a stance that says, "we don't care enough to support your needs"'
No, the basic stance is that your personal economics shouldn't be a pandering factor of the protocol.


[28-Jun-18 06:09 AM] xRobeSx#5136
if NN's did 100% its because no one else wants to mine the 25%


[28-Jun-18 06:09 AM] xRobeSx#5136
all they'd need to beat the NN's is genproc=3 cpu


[28-Jun-18 06:10 AM] CollectorKC#4360
True or false, Genie. By allowing ASICS to run on the network, GPU miners will become unprofitable over time.


[28-Jun-18 06:11 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I know its not for me... but TRUE. and that's fine. If you're mining you should realize that the technology is better, and you should use some of your GPU profits to upgrade your hardware to the latest, most efficient tech. IMO


[28-Jun-18 06:11 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
`Difficulty rising is the concern because eventually asics will run into zero profitability, and then simply switch coins
You'd have to rely on the nodes, and on any crazy gpu miners still left, to continue mining until the difficulty corrects`
You are showing a full lack of understanding Komodo protocol with this claim.
*If* that were to happen, the NNs blocks would re levelize the diff


[28-Jun-18 06:12 AM] xRobeSx#5136
exactly


[28-Jun-18 06:12 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"True or false, Genie. By allowing ASICS to run on the network, GPU miners will become unprofitable over time."
Why does the protocol care about your personal profitability?


[28-Jun-18 06:12 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Are there profitable GPUs for Bitcoin?


[28-Jun-18 06:12 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Ignore the protocol, its not smart from a business standpoint to alienate and marginalize supporters


[28-Jun-18 06:12 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I'm not sure how you haven't figured that bit out

"Ignore the protocol"
dafuq?


[28-Jun-18 06:13 AM] CollectorKC#4360
If your forked today, and left GPU'S  on the network, would there be a downside to KMD?


[28-Jun-18 06:13 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Would KMD be any less secure?


[28-Jun-18 06:13 AM] xRobeSx#5136
more hashrate is better


[28-Jun-18 06:13 AM] xRobeSx#5136
james has admitted its better as in safer


[28-Jun-18 06:14 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Safer, how?


[28-Jun-18 06:14 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Specifically.


[28-Jun-18 06:14 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Other than taking 30 seconds to say "nahhh"


[28-Jun-18 06:14 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Has anyone broke down, in the big picture, this decision?


[28-Jun-18 06:14 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
a higher diff block is ALWAYS more secure than a lower diff block; because, Bitcoin


[28-Jun-18 06:14 AM] CollectorKC#4360
So far, I'm getting a resounding no.


[28-Jun-18 06:14 AM] xRobeSx#5136
this has been discussed before


[28-Jun-18 06:15 AM] CollectorKC#4360

That's why we've moved to discord.. because slack doesn't preserve text

[28-Jun-18 06:16 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@CollectorKC If you want a discussion, perhaps come to the table without the preconceived notion of "Me Ogg. Ogg say GPU good, ASIC bad"


[28-Jun-18 06:17 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm sure eventually @jl777c is going to pop in here and give you quick message explaining everything correct, give him time to get on.    On that note, I'm gonna go try to get something done. I appreciate your concerns and supporting KMD @CollectorKC but there really is no harm in ASIC's on KMD. üòÉ

I actually disagree with that @xRobeSx I think there's significant harm in ASICS on KMD, especially if the NN's are as entrenched as you guys claim them to be.


[28-Jun-18 06:18 AM] CollectorKC#4360
There's significant community blowback to be had

Ingrained? Solid?


[28-Jun-18 06:20 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Each NN pubkey is directly in KMD codebase and is changed each year for the elected notaries


[28-Jun-18 06:20 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I think you misunderstand me


[28-Jun-18 06:21 AM] xRobeSx#5136
so yes that is firmly established. But they are elected. That's kind of irrelevant though, it's more about the fact that they mine 75% and make 51% attacks not possible, so the increase of hashrate with ASIC's isn't doing harm to the network


[28-Jun-18 06:21 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I get that you think that means certain GPU supporters will stop supporting KMD


[28-Jun-18 06:21 AM] xRobeSx#5136
but I can tell you that there are certain people I know that never GPU mined, and are excited and now mining with ASIC's


[28-Jun-18 06:22 AM] CollectorKC#4360
The 75% is what I was talking about with the entrenched comment


[28-Jun-18 06:22 AM] xRobeSx#5136
so that's arguing the opposite, that possibly more community support can be gained by allowing ASICS to mine on our network


[28-Jun-18 06:22 AM] CollectorKC#4360
There are far more GPU miners than asic miners, actually.


[28-Jun-18 06:22 AM] CollectorKC#4360
That possibility of "more" support could never be true.


[28-Jun-18 06:23 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I agree, I'm just saying I know of people who order/and some that have received their z9's minis and are mining, that never GPU mined before. So it's not like we're just losing miners, new ones will come as well


[28-Jun-18 06:23 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Certainly every z9 owner who bought the miner thinking they could mine anything else, will indeed find solace here, though.


[28-Jun-18 06:24 AM] xRobeSx#5136
exactly, look at all those miners we could fine just because every other coin wants to fork


[28-Jun-18 06:24 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Getting 200 new miners at the cost of 1000 isn't plus.


[28-Jun-18 06:24 AM] xRobeSx#5136
but those GPU miners that left at least heard about KMD and most likely own some still.


[28-Jun-18 06:24 AM] xRobeSx#5136
they'll just mine something more profitable


[28-Jun-18 06:25 AM] xRobeSx#5136
doesn't mean they don't believe or hodl kmd anymore


[28-Jun-18 06:25 AM] xRobeSx#5136
mine something more profitable, sell it, and buy KMD


[28-Jun-18 06:25 AM] CollectorKC#4360
"Today at 3:11 AM
Yeah kmd, zcash and any coins that aren‚Äôt forking are dead to me.

From one of those messages I received after my post here.


[28-Jun-18 06:26 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Probably not best to assume what a marginalized miner might or might not be doing, now that they can't physically suppport the coin profitably.


[28-Jun-18 06:26 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"Getting 200 new miners at the cost of 1000 isn't plus."
Actually, per hash per unit, it'd be a 1.5X bump; but who cares about facts when you're stuck in a rhetoric spewing rut

CG, it isn't about the hashrate bump, its about the community, you imbecile.

i realize people have to mine to support costs


[28-Jun-18 06:27 AM] CollectorKC#4360
You have to sell some to maintain the ability to hold, as a miner


[28-Jun-18 06:27 AM] xRobeSx#5136
but if your whole point is to mine KMD just to dump it all and not hodl any, go mine something else


[28-Jun-18 06:27 AM] xRobeSx#5136
i get that


[28-Jun-18 06:27 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Therefore profitability must be there.


[28-Jun-18 06:27 AM] xRobeSx#5136
but then they're hodling some in your situation


[28-Jun-18 06:28 AM] CollectorKC#4360
You removed profitability, you remove mining support.


[28-Jun-18 06:28 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And no, I don't support mining to dump


[28-Jun-18 06:28 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"it isn't about the hashrate bump, its about the community"
evidently not, because the community cares about the tech advancements, not protecting the personal investments of "miners" that refuse to evolve


[28-Jun-18 06:28 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I support mining of quality coins, profitably.


[28-Jun-18 06:29 AM] xRobeSx#5136
it doesn't need to be profitable forever......  it was, they sold some to pay bills, and got to hodl the rest... now its unprofitable so you switch, but you don't have to say "fuck kmd and dump"... if you believe you'll keep hodling, switch to something more profitable, and as i said above, sell the mined profitable coin to buy more KMD


[28-Jun-18 06:29 AM] xRobeSx#5136
that is if you really believe


[28-Jun-18 06:29 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Refuse to evolve is a moot point when you decide to launch on equihash, CG. The coin literally designed from the onset to avoid asics.


[28-Jun-18 06:29 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I'm holding, don't worry


[28-Jun-18 06:30 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Its the fact that you've marginalized mining support


[28-Jun-18 06:30 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Forcing them out the door


[28-Jun-18 06:30 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Forcing some to say "fuck KMD, never again"


[28-Jun-18 06:30 AM] CollectorKC#4360
Tangibly more support than any amount of asics would ever have brought.


[28-Jun-18 06:30 AM] xRobeSx#5136
that's their own stupid fault TBH


[28-Jun-18 06:30 AM] xRobeSx#5136

[28-Jun-18 06:30 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

"Its the fact that you've marginalized mining support"
No one is "marginalizing miner support", except those that think "miners should only be x and only have y equipment"


[28-Jun-18 06:35 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
If the definition of "miner" is limited to that which Joe Burgerflipper can afford to mine while making minimum wage, then miners are marginalizing themselves


[28-Jun-18 06:36 AM] xRobeSx#5136
stupid IMO yes because KMD has way more going for it than just mining. Yes that's one way to get involved, but if it's not profitable, its not profitable... face it. No need to rage out and dump it. Being non profitable doesn't make it a bad coin or have bad features. Smart miners mine profitable coins, sell them, and buy the coins they really want. 

I truly do agree with you that we don't wanna just upset people and lose awhole bunch of people. But i really see you making a bigger deal out of this than it needs to be. You even agree'd you are still hodling. So you're one of the smart one's, even if you do have to switch your rigs to something more profitable. 

I really don't think there is anything wrong with ASIC mining, its more efficient and it doesn't hurt our network.  The GPU miners can mine profitably elsewhere and continue supporting KMD by BUYING and not dumping for costs. or good luck.


[28-Jun-18 06:42 AM] CollectorKC#4360
"I truly do agree with you that we don't wanna just upset people and lose awhole bunch of people. ", that's actually my point. As a HODLer, I want to support the coin because I believe in the tech. But if you unnecessarily alienate and marginalize supporters, you start working against your own best interests. And if a decision like that is made in 30 seconds with no real dispute like the one I've brought here, that's very alarming. Then you end up with people in my inbox, seeing me sispute some points for apparently the first time ever, who are raging upset with KMD for the decision, and want to see it fail. That's not healthy for the coin or the community, even if its an extremely acute minority of the community. I know this might sound like heresy, but not all decisions can be tech first, community last like this one has been.


[28-Jun-18 06:42 AM] CollectorKC#4360
I certainly do appreciate the conversation about it though

"But if you unnecessarily alienate and marginalize supporters, you start working against your own best interests."
For the love of crypto, stop conflating miners and the actual support of the coin and the tech.


[28-Jun-18 06:47 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it would not me surprised if, statistically, 99% of the supporters of any coin (other than Bitcoin) couldn't mine the coin if you gave them the equipment and set the miner up for them


[28-Jun-18 06:53 AM] xRobeSx#5136
It would be great if you could bring people like that here @CollectorKC vs you having to accept all of their messages and relay into here and back etc. I'm not against open discussion and such. I just feel like if people really believed in KMD, they wouldn't be outraged over the decision.


[28-Jun-18 06:53 AM] CollectorKC#4360
From the sounds of it, there are, but feel like they don't have a voice here if they are filling up my DMs with commentary.


[28-Jun-18 06:54 AM] CollectorKC#4360
And I mean ultimately, if jl777 isn't going to do anything other than what he's decided, I can see why they don't bring it up

James is open to listening to the community and has stuck to things people have decided on in the past. It would be better for all of us to just wait til he's back, as I'm 100% sure he will come in here and post his technical reasoning as to why its the right thing for KMD to do. 

If people wanna argue it with him, then go for it and we'll see. But I know he does have technical reasoning, so that should make the supporters lurking here that don't wanna speak up, believe in him. or give them something to talk about


[28-Jun-18 06:57 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

Hi @Cye   There's a discussion about that above. ‚òù


[29-Jun-18 03:45 AM] Cye#9860
Ok so Komodo are still deciding same as Zcash?


[29-Jun-18 03:46 AM] jl777c#5810
should we defent 1060 GPU owners from 1080 GPU miners?


[29-Jun-18 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
and if we need to defend the existing hardware base of miners, does that mean we cant ever allow using new hardware?


[29-Jun-18 03:52 AM] Cye#9860
Ok so Komodo won't defend against ASIC miners I take it. I stopped mining Zcash because they did not defend their ASIC resistance. For me it's more about ethics, if you say a coin is ASIC resistant then get a backbone and don't be a coward when it comes time to fight off Centralised Bitmain ASIC miners, it's a hostile takeover of network. It's so bad they almost have 51% of Bitcoin Network now.
I just think it's sad to watch projects not defend themselves.


[29-Jun-18 03:53 AM] jl777c#5810
when did we say KMD was ASIC resistant?


[29-Jun-18 03:53 AM] jansako#3330
@jl777c would it be appropriate to ask the marketing group to put up a statement about ASICs and we can just refer anyone to it?


[29-Jun-18 03:54 AM] jl777c#5810
you didnt answer my questions about the 1060 miners


[29-Jun-18 03:54 AM] jl777c#5810
how is it fair to them that 1080 comes out and outperforms?


[29-Jun-18 03:54 AM] jansako#3330
otherwise we will have the same discussion going round and round...


[29-Jun-18 03:54 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we need to make a 1060 miner subsidy?


[29-Jun-18 03:54 AM] Cye#9860
For me most projects get support from the start from the community, CPU & GPU miners. They enable the projects to grow. For them to just get shafted when Bitmain takes an interest and starts secretly mining the network with ASICs just seems like a double-cross


[29-Jun-18 03:54 AM] jl777c#5810
do you see how nonsense that all becomes?

what about CPU miners?


[29-Jun-18 03:55 AM] jl777c#5810
not fair CPU make CPU mining ineffective


[29-Jun-18 03:56 AM] Cye#9860
VERUS Coin created a hashrate for CPU miners that could match GPU hashrate as far as I know


[29-Jun-18 03:56 AM] jl777c#5810
nobody ever promised GPU miners a monopoly on mining KMD forever


[29-Jun-18 03:57 AM] jansako#3330
@jl777c  those are not good examples. Intel or Nvidia is not going to be running their hardware before it starts selling it (I don't know if Bitmain does or does not). Still think a clear and concise statement from the KMD team would go a long way.  Just to address the 'why'.


[29-Jun-18 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
bitmain is selling ASICS to basically anybody


[29-Jun-18 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
there is also a second ASIC miner for sale


[29-Jun-18 03:58 AM] jansako#3330
sure they do, I got one too


[29-Jun-18 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
there does not seem to be a valid centralization argument


[29-Jun-18 03:59 AM] jl777c#5810
nvidia + amd are 2 vendors, not muc more decentralized than bitmain +1


[29-Jun-18 03:59 AM] jl777c#5810
and shouldnt it be the other way?


[29-Jun-18 03:59 AM] jl777c#5810
if an external product release forces a change of the consensus mechanism, it should be explained why


[29-Jun-18 04:00 AM] jl777c#5810
not changing consensus due to an external product being released shouldnt need an explanation


[29-Jun-18 04:00 AM] jansako#3330
there I disagree. This is about communication, not tech at this point


[29-Jun-18 04:00 AM] Cye#9860
For me Bitmain ASIC Miners are a plague of networks. I'm reluctant to mine a coin that supports them. I had thought Komodo was ASIC resistant so I switched from Zcash to Komodo. I might have to switch again now. It's just my own personal belief that supporting Centralised Bitmain ASIC miners is very negative for the network and community as a whole and the networks will suffer once Bitmain takes over, which they mostly control already. The writing is on the wall. I just don't want to support Bitmain growing any stronger.


[29-Jun-18 04:00 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD was not marketed as a GPU get mining monopoly coin


[29-Jun-18 04:01 AM] jl777c#5810
notary nodes mine 75% of blocks for KMD


[29-Jun-18 04:01 AM] jansako#3330
also just to save you time you spend rehashing the same argument


[29-Jun-18 04:01 AM] jl777c#5810
even if bitmain controlled 100% of mining it would e 25%


[29-Jun-18 04:02 AM] jl777c#5810
people will still complain


[29-Jun-18 04:02 AM] jl777c#5810
they dont seem to care about the reasons


[29-Jun-18 04:02 AM] jansako#3330
yes, and we can point them to the article.


[29-Jun-18 04:03 AM] Cye#9860
I understand your points...I'm not arguing...I'm just saying what I feel and that I think Bitmain's attack will eventually be understood in future. I will rather seek out projects that defend against Bitmain


[29-Jun-18 04:04 AM] jl777c#5810
do you understand that GPU are mining only 25% of KMD blocks?


[29-Jun-18 04:04 AM] jl777c#5810
how will bitmain attack KMD with 25% of hashrate


[29-Jun-18 04:05 AM] Cye#9860
Well if ASIC miners were killed off GPU/CPU miners would be 100% of blocks


[29-Jun-18 04:05 AM] jl777c#5810
NO


[29-Jun-18 04:05 AM] jl777c#5810
in KMD notary nodes get 75% of blocks regardless of CPU, CPU or ASIC mining


[29-Jun-18 04:06 AM] Cye#9860
How are notary nodes operated/hardware?


[29-Jun-18 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
special nodes, annually elected, CPU mining


[29-Jun-18 04:07 AM] Cye#9860
:)


[29-Jun-18 04:07 AM] Cye#9860
100%


[29-Jun-18 04:08 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD is ASIC resistant, doesnt matter the hashrate, notaries get 75% of blocks, maybe over the years it will be reduced to 50% of blocks but that would be a gradual process


[29-Jun-18 04:10 AM] Cye#9860
So in regards to KMD, are you saying that KMD currently supports ASIC miners on network?


[29-Jun-18 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is ASIC resistant in a way that still allows ASIC mining


[29-Jun-18 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
how can you prevent an ASIC miner?


[29-Jun-18 04:10 AM] Cye#9860
Monero


[29-Jun-18 04:11 AM] jl777c#5810
for how long? so hardfork each time an ASIC comes out?


[29-Jun-18 04:11 AM] jl777c#5810
seems a losing battle


[29-Jun-18 04:11 AM] Cye#9860
Until a better solution is found


[29-Jun-18 04:12 AM] jl777c#5810
but ASIC will alwasy be possible to be made


[29-Jun-18 04:12 AM] Cye#9860
At least they fight the good fight. They understand the danger of Bitmain


[29-Jun-18 04:12 AM] jl777c#5810
dif you forget that all miners combined get 25% of blocks, how will bitmain overcome that?


[29-Jun-18 04:15 AM] Cye#9860
For me it's more about ethics, and Bitmain is my enemy. So I'm finding it upsetting that more and more of my favourite projects are allowing their networks to be infected by the Bitmain corruption


[29-Jun-18 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
so because  KMD wont hardfork over a non-threat, we have bad ethics?


[29-Jun-18 04:16 AM] Cye#9860
Can't be decentralised when Centralised Bitmain control mining network


[29-Jun-18 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
25% is not control last time I checked

Well if KMD is ASIC resistant and it allows ASIC miners, then yes, no ethics. But if you say that KMD was never intended to be ASIC resistant then you have ethics and carry on.
In regards to Zcash they stated ASIC resistant but then backstepped and now allow ASIC miners, so that's cowardice and shows no ethics, which is why is stopped mining/supporting Zcash. 
I had thought KMD was ASIC resistant, but maybe I'm wrong. If your allowing ASIC miners then you obviously support Bitmain and I will find a new project I can mine with a good conscience


[29-Jun-18 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i support miners who bring the highest hashrate to KMD


[29-Jun-18 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
to increase its security


[29-Jun-18 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe nvidia will make an ASIC one day


[29-Jun-18 04:22 AM] Cye#9860
If you control 25%/all of the network it's only a matter of time they control KMD coins/markets/prices etc etc...It's a losing battle....better to kill Bitmain when you have a chance


[29-Jun-18 04:23 AM] jl777c#5810
you are wrong again


[29-Jun-18 04:23 AM] Alright#0419
You realize you can buy one, right? üòÖ


[29-Jun-18 04:23 AM] jl777c#5810
the 5% rewards are far more than all mining combined


[29-Jun-18 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
also who are we to target any specific company and try to take them out?


[29-Jun-18 04:24 AM] Cye#9860
How do you get a notary node?


[29-Jun-18 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
that is not anything any coin should be aiming to do


[29-Jun-18 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
convince about 2% of KMD stake to elect you to notary position in next year's election


[29-Jun-18 04:25 AM] Cye#9860
There you go, Bitmain just buy Notary Nodes. Money corrupts all. It's only a matter of time.


[29-Jun-18 04:26 AM] Alright#0419
You act as if anyone who buys a z9 mini is solely controlled by bitmain


[29-Jun-18 04:26 AM] Alright#0419
Alright - Today at 7:23 AM
You realize you can buy one, right? üòÖ

if he buys one, he becomes part of bitmain

it is like the borg


[29-Jun-18 04:27 AM] jl777c#5810
they will eat the universe


[29-Jun-18 04:30 AM] Cye#9860
I understand what you are saying, I'm just looking to the future and see the results of Bitmain's infection. 
But you are right, if I don't agree with a projects support of ASIC miners there are literally thousands of other projects to support. So I guess it comes down to personal opinion and beliefs what you think is the right project to support.


[29-Jun-18 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes. if you are invested in GPU and have no ASIC, then the thing to do is GPU mine coins that can be profitably GPU mined. nobody is forcing you to lose money, but plz dont try to force us to hardfork over your econimic investmetns


[29-Jun-18 04:31 AM] Cye#9860
The "Borg" is a very accurate interpretation of the Bitmain infection :)


[29-Jun-18 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i was joking about the borg, the tech to mind control purchasers of ASIC  is still 13 years from being perfected


[29-Jun-18 04:32 AM] Cye#9860
I wouldn't force anyone to do anything


[29-Jun-18 04:33 AM] Alright#0419
Could I ask why you don't just buy some z9 minis?

Ok thanks for the chat, I know you are busy, I will consider your points and decide what to do with my miners hashrate next.
I've owned Bitmain miners in 2016, but when I realised what they were doing I sold them off and switched back to GPU/CPU miners


[29-Jun-18 04:36 AM] TheHaddock#3171
64 people representing 75% of kmd's rewards by finding blocks???


[29-Jun-18 04:36 AM] TheHaddock#3171
Thats one of the most centralised coins then

[29-Jun-18 04:37 AM] OsTa#2589
first you need technical skill


[29-Jun-18 04:37 AM] OsTa#2589
you need to be available 24h/7j

As im looking to abandone mining due to high elec rates.. masternodes, staking and supporting networks would be my thing.
Together with hodl/trading

You'd want a server.


[29-Jun-18 04:45 AM] TheHaddock#3171
Interested..
I succeeded to learn how to setup ubuntu 18.04 from scratch.. setting up ETC node and mining komodo on it.
Never seen linux before .. was interesting learning curve


[29-Jun-18 04:45 AM] CrisF#3405
As you look into it more you might find the NNs work pretyy hard to earn their mining rewards.


[29-Jun-18 04:45 AM] TheHaddock#3171
Yeah server would be nice


[29-Jun-18 04:45 AM] TheHaddock#3171
Then it is deserved and well earned


[29-Jun-18 04:46 AM] CrisF#3405
Look around some more and I figure you might find somethings you like.  There is a lot on offer here.


[29-Jun-18 04:47 AM] TheHaddock#3171
I will.. and will have a good look at it.
Will take my time a bit too to get a good hold on it.

it's not about the rewards someone becomes a notary. Notaries secure the KMD network and its assetchains. And GameCredits as of a month ago


[29-Jun-18 04:48 AM] jorian#4555
not at all only economic

around 30 places will be newly elected


[29-Jun-18 04:49 AM] jorian#4555
if the community deems you a worthy notary, you are elected


[29-Jun-18 04:49 AM] jorian#4555

you can be notary on any cpu, as long as its powerful. it's your own decision, since when your node has performed better than average, you are automatically re-elected for the new period

@jansako - Today at 5:57 AM
`those are not good examples. Intel or Nvidia is not going to be running their hardware before it starts selling it (I don't know if Bitmain does or does not). Still think a clear and concise statement from the KMD team would go a long way. Just to address the 'why'.`
1) the instant you make your anti-ASIC case about a single company and not about ASICs, you've already lost any validity your case might have.
2) Why should there be a "why" statement about nothing changing?


[29-Jun-18 05:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
3) In your theory that the algo should change to prevent BM from silently mining on their own, what's to prevent them from adding RAM, mining on their own, and then never releasing just to spite the assholes who changed 2 variables in an attempt to financially hurt BM?


[29-Jun-18 05:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I've yet to see a single coin make an anti-ASIC change to 144,5 (or any other K & N values) that the majority of the reason wasn't just a bunch of "fuk Shitmain" and not much else


[29-Jun-18 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
but what about the borg?


[29-Jun-18 05:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
borg?


[29-Jun-18 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the only valid anti-ASIC theory i heard. bitmain perfected the mind control and anybody that buys their ASIC becomes mind controlled


[29-Jun-18 05:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
LMFAO


[29-Jun-18 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
probably you need to plug in the ASIC first though before the mind control kicks in


[29-Jun-18 05:49 AM] jl777c#5810
this is really the most viable anti-ASIC argument I have heard


[29-Jun-18 05:50 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I can *almost* see the "well, equihash was meant to be anti ASIC" claim, but even that falls flat because it's still the same thing - it's all about RAM cost


[29-Jun-18 05:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
a $1.5M+ cost to market, do people really believe that ASIC makers are just going to say "oh well, we lost on that one; just scrap it all" as opposed to, worst case, spending $90k to add RAM and private mine to recoup their losses?


[29-Jun-18 05:58 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
imo, the move to exclude all AMD miners, and pretty much anyone with an NVIDIA older than a 1050, is pure insanity


[29-Jun-18 06:03 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
especially when the claim is usually "everyone has a GPU".... Guess what, Skippy, "everyone" doesn't have $1k per to drop on a high-end GPU that is 2+ years old and costs more than when it was released

[29-Jun-18 06:15 AM] jl777c#5810
isnt a GPU really just an ASIC customized for "graphics" calculations. so really the anti-ASIC seems to be about "anti-hardware i dont have"

be careful with buying bitmain ASIC, it has mind control tech from the future making all of people who buy it into onemind to 51% attack all chains when you least expect it. essentially if you have bitmain ASIC you are part of a single centralized collective that acts as one. so the theory goes


[29-Jun-18 07:00 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
And they have a hidden worm that can take over your ASIC if the mind control fails, right?

@ComputerGenie 
1) the instant you make your anti-ASIC case about a single company and not about ASICs, you've already lost any validity your case might have. 

Suspect the 'you' in this case is not myself personally... cause I am not making an anti-asic case. I am not anti or for ASIC, I buy hardware I think will make me money. My point was that the main 'anti-Bitmain' sentiment is that they are doing shady stuff with hardware. I don't see NVidia or AMD doing that... it is downright silly to think NVidia is running a  bunch of GPU's mining somewhere... But according to the 'info' floating around, Bitmain is doing just that. That is why you cannot compare the two.

2) Why should there be a "why" statement about nothing changing?(edited)

The statement is needed because there are people asking for a change/pushing for change. There is a 'discussion' in a number of coins communities going on whether coins should or should not change because ASICS, and since KMD decided that it will not change, it would put some (notice I said some!) of the 'you all love Bitmain' bullshit to rest. 
More importantly, it would give the mods an ability to just point to an article and stop rehashing the same arguments. Starting with JL who is prbably spending way too muc time on this.

3) In your theory that the algo should change to prevent BM from silently mining on their own, what's to prevent them from adding RAM, mining on their own, and then never releasing just to spite the assholes who changed 2 variables in an attempt to financially hurt BM?
No idea what theory are you talking about... you may be responding to someone else here...


[29-Jun-18 07:41 AM] jansako#3330
sorry, just passing by... will respond in DM a bit later if appropiate


[29-Jun-18 07:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Well @jansako ,
1) Bitmain practice vs AMD/NV practice is like comparing Ford and Advanced Auto Parts - one makes full units and the other makes chips

2) no statement will quash any anti-Bitmain/KMD sentiment, because it words, deeds, and reality mattered, Bitmain wouldn't even get a mention


[29-Jun-18 07:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
3) goes to the 1) claim about BM running before selling - there's nothing stopping them from "covertly" creating and **never** selling


[29-Jun-18 07:46 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I give Bitmain the benefit of the doubt. No one creates a multi-billion dollar business on the back of a revolutionary technology to shoot their cow...


[29-Jun-18 07:47 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I give BM no benefit, I'm 100% certain that they do shady shit


[29-Jun-18 07:47 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Especially when the milk is high in fat and great for a ton of dairy products which don't even have companies for them yet.


[29-Jun-18 07:48 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I'll give you that, but overall I'd look at them as good actors in today's market.


[29-Jun-18 07:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
If BM really wanted to "control" CoinX or AlgoX, they'd never do a release, ever


[29-Jun-18 07:49 AM] BlackJesus#6161
There is literally 0 incentive for them to be extremely bad actors. This industry is budding and they are a major player. Them being bad actors would drive away adoption hurting them more than any profits they could make by being holistically bad.


[29-Jun-18 07:50 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
BM could, literally, be making $10,523,520 per day mining BTC in private if they wanted to do that*
*based on a $5800 BTC/USD


[29-Jun-18 07:50 AM] BlackJesus#6161
cryptocurrencies in general have atleast 20-100x growth in them possibly 1000x on the entire market cap.


[29-Jun-18 07:52 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Despite all the bullshit and FUD, BM doesn't have 51-100% of any given algo because they don't want 51-100% of that algo


[29-Jun-18 07:55 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Outside of the 2,000-3,000 people that own an Avalon, is *anyone* doing any serious mining of BTC that doesn't boil down to BM didn't want that much hash?


[29-Jun-18 08:06 AM] TheHaddock#3171
Many do gpu mining on nicehash to be payed out in btc ..


[29-Jun-18 08:07 AM] BlackJesus#6161
nicehash gives btc alot of buying pressure.


[29-Jun-18 08:07 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I wish they could allow other payouts other than BTC.


[29-Jun-18 08:08 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm just waiting for r/bitcoin vilify them as they have every other BTC company.


[29-Jun-18 08:11 AM] TheHaddock#3171
Awesomeminer does same.. can chose wich coin payout..

Miningpoolhub has autoconvert... mine algo you want payout in algo you want.


[29-Jun-18 08:20 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Nicehash has created the perfect business model - convince suppliers that your cut doesn't matter and convince consumers that even with your cut they are magically making more than if they were a supplier

NVIDIA Launching Next-Generation Graphics Cards At Gamescom 2018
In line with what I reported a few days ago, another major leak has just occurred with details of invites being leaked (via Videocardz) of an NVIDIA event that will be happening around Gamescom and should be the event we have all been waiting for: the launch of their next-gen...

[29-Jun-18 08:12 PM] saltyminer#3228
I think there is a surplus of 10 series cards still in inventory out there


[29-Jun-18 08:13 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
NVIDIA hasn't made chips for them since December and you can still buy 1080s and 1080TIs by the pallet


[29-Jun-18 08:19 PM] saltyminer#3228
anyway, on a more fun note, I am working on building an open source gpu mining monitor app


[29-Jun-18 08:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
because the 20000000000000000 that are out there aren't enough?

@ComputerGenie#2331 are mining with nvidia?  Just curious if you use ewbf, dstm, bminer or something else

just ask here


[01-Jul-18 01:14 PM] bishop#9773
I haven't tried it yet, but in theory, if I have agama running locally and setgenerate true, can't I point my miners at the local ip with the rpc user/pw in the config file to mine solo?


[01-Jul-18 01:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, komodod (the daemon behind Agama) lacks the API to mine GPUs and ASICs without a stratum program running as well


[01-Jul-18 01:20 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
that and stratums are more efficient in handling more than 1 miner than a wallet anyway


[01-Jul-18 01:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
also, `setgenerate true` = CPU mining


[01-Jul-18 01:25 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
I had toyed with the idea of modding the in-wallet tromp to accept an API and essentially add an internal stratum, but for 100 different reasons decided there was no point


[01-Jul-18 01:29 PM] bishop#9773
So you're just pooling up all your hash vs soloing?


[01-Jul-18 01:44 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
traditional, direct-to-wallet mining (using getwork) pretty much ended for most everything years ago when slush came out with the stratum concept


[01-Jul-18 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you find one that has getwork, chances are more than likely that the code was forked from Bitcoin pre-2015


[01-Jul-18 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
modern "solo mining" = you in a "pool" by yourself


[01-Jul-18 01:52 PM] bishop#9773
Fair enough, I'll set one up on my node

‚òùüèø good question given the `{"type":"request error","message":"socket hang up"}`


[02-Jul-18 10:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
do you have your komodo config file set to allow daemon connections (and specifically from the IP of your znomp rig)?


[02-Jul-18 10:49 AM] daemonfox#6136
Yes I do and that is communicating

what's the komodo.conf look like for the node


[02-Jul-18 10:53 AM] Alright#0419
could try adding `rpcworkqueue=256` or an even higher number


[02-Jul-18 10:54 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
queue shouldn't cause a hang up though, just a shit ton of debug errors


[02-Jul-18 10:55 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
usually hang up = garbage send/receive or permission issues


[02-Jul-18 10:56 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@daemonfox do you have a miner trying to connect to nomp when this happens?


[02-Jul-18 10:56 AM] daemonfox#6136
yes


[02-Jul-18 10:57 AM] daemonfox#6136
one miner connects gets shares looks good


[02-Jul-18 10:57 AM] daemonfox#6136

take out the blocknotify and see if that makes a difference


[02-Jul-18 11:03 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you use p2p, notify is almost always meaningless


[02-Jul-18 11:04 AM] daemonfox#6136
p2p disabled until i get the rest working


[02-Jul-18 11:04 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, enable it

[02-Jul-18 11:05 AM] daemonfox#6136
is 7770 the default no config to set or I need to set that somewhere as well?


[02-Jul-18 11:05 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
you will need teh magic that I posted earlier


[02-Jul-18 11:05 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
7770 is default iirc


[02-Jul-18 11:05 AM] daemonfox#6136
ok ty ill check that shortly


[02-Jul-18 11:06 AM] daemonfox#6136
trying without the blocknotify first


[02-Jul-18 11:06 AM] daemonfox#6136
then ill add p2p


[02-Jul-18 11:06 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
p2p port *should be* rpc -1


[02-Jul-18 11:08 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
not that it totally matters in this setting, but if you don't enable p2p, you'll be relying 100% on your `blockRefreshInterval`


[02-Jul-18 11:08 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, make sure that is set at a realistic number

[02-Jul-18 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
there might be some disparity in settings due to the only copy I have is way older, but since null = not 'true' there shouldn't be any need for it in kmd config

thats the function causing all the commotion i just have no idea why


[02-Jul-18 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
when you look at the code, you have to go back further (in progression, not lines)
`undefined` basically means that the spot you keep looking at wasn't passed any actual variable


[02-Jul-18 04:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
can you limit how many threads z-nomp opens?


[02-Jul-18 04:17 PM] daemonfox#6136
I have 8c/16t and it opens 16 rpc threads everytime


[02-Jul-18 04:24 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
clustering.... forks
auto = 1 per core
any number = that many threads

I need to stop being lazy and just sit down and set it up on my old mining rig (sold all the graphics cards it's bare bone) when my new Psu comes in.


[02-Jul-18 06:58 PM] bishop#9773
I figured I had a full node running already so why not setup a private pool for all my miners and maybe hit my luck with a massive block from rewards not being collected


[02-Jul-18 06:59 PM] BlackJesus#6161
That's my whole reason for buying z9's


[02-Jul-18 06:59 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Playing the lottery especially after block 1 million


[03-Jul-18 01:26 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@bishop what's your hash rate?


[03-Jul-18 03:46 AM] jansako#3330
Hi all, anyone knows what is the 'expected' number of blocks one can find with a z9 mini at this point? 
I mine on a pool (for now), it shows 'luckdays' for my miner around 0.7-0.8 or so on average. I read that as if I were to solo mine, I would get between 1-2 locks per day. 
The interesting part is that they pay out  8-9KMD/day, which is more like 2-3 blocks (looking at the avg block sizes). The 'pool luck' shows as average for that period too so it is not that the pool is finding more blocks than 'expected'.
One obvious conclusion is that the pool stats are 'skewed' to make you feel that you are getting paid more that if you were solo mine, but I am reluctant to jump to that.

Again, anyone solomining with a z9 mini, how many blocks do you get/day?

THX!


[03-Jul-18 03:47 AM] jansako#3330
I would appreciate a PM if you are reluctant to share publicly...


[03-Jul-18 03:50 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Extrapolating backwards from my increase, @jansako, I'd say 3-4 blocks per day "expected" per mini solo mining (influenced by luck and NN timings)


[03-Jul-18 03:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
however, it should always be noted that scale does have some impact on find rate


[03-Jul-18 03:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
Unless it's a 0 fee pool, over time you'll always make less mining in a pool; how well you can, personally, cope with variance is highly individual


[03-Jul-18 03:54 AM] jansako#3330
Thank you!


[03-Jul-18 03:55 AM] jansako#3330
Yeah, we had that discussion. Is the pool fee more or less than the electricity used by the PC running your local stratum/VPS fee üòÉ


[03-Jul-18 03:56 AM] jansako#3330
Are you sharing the costs by running other stratums etc


[03-Jul-18 03:57 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
for the average person, the electricity used by the PC running your local stratum is less than the electricity used by the PC dealing with email and social media üòâ

[03-Jul-18 06:23 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
zpool hit 1 block for 300+ KMD Sunday
and I've hit as high as 1500 KMD in 1 block


[03-Jul-18 06:24 AM] TheHaddock#3171
Been mining at suprnova for KMD.. quit there. Not happy with returns they do


[03-Jul-18 06:26 AM] TheHaddock#3171
Thats lots.. but how much sol/s do you throw at it?


[03-Jul-18 06:26 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
atm ~75k


[03-Jul-18 06:26 AM] TheHaddock#3171
10x me then appr.


[03-Jul-18 06:27 AM] TheHaddock#3171
30 - 35 rigs?


[03-Jul-18 06:27 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
2 GPU rigs and 3 ASICs


[03-Jul-18 06:27 AM] TheHaddock#3171

[03-Jul-18 06:27 AM] TheHaddock#3171
Z9 üòî


[03-Jul-18 06:28 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
my GPU rigs are 13 1080TIs each


[03-Jul-18 06:28 AM] TheHaddock#3171
Nice..


[03-Jul-18 06:28 AM] TheHaddock#3171
Here electricity is too expensive.. about to quit.
0.30$ / kwh


[03-Jul-18 06:29 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
equihash is still waaaaaaaaaaaaaay cheaper than my sha ASICs cost to run üòõ


[03-Jul-18 06:30 AM] TheHaddock#3171
For few months maybe..


[03-Jul-18 06:30 AM] TheHaddock#3171
Huge profits with asics but usually doesnt stay long like this i think.


[03-Jul-18 06:31 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
370 watts per z9 is cheaper that 1400 watts per S9 every day of every week


[03-Jul-18 06:31 AM] TheHaddock#3171
Thats for sure


[03-Jul-18 06:33 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
overhead is the thing most stumble on when "planning" an expansion


[03-Jul-18 06:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I've seen more guys buy shit they can't power than I can count


[03-Jul-18 06:46 AM] daemonfox#6136
bingo!


[03-Jul-18 06:47 AM] daemonfox#6136
i think we have a winner


[03-Jul-18 06:47 AM] daemonfox#6136
taken three block notifications and no errors


[03-Jul-18 06:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
GPU shares are being accepted!


[03-Jul-18 06:50 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, what'd you do different this time?


[03-Jul-18 06:53 AM] daemonfox#6136
i only did two things since last try...


[03-Jul-18 06:54 AM] daemonfox#6136
1. combed config.json but did not change anything... so i checked pool_configs/komodo.json and corrected the one moderate alert it gave me... payout interval was 58 it said make it 120 so i did and saved.


[03-Jul-18 06:54 AM] daemonfox#6136
2. I flushed redis, reran npm update and npm install


[03-Jul-18 06:54 AM] daemonfox#6136
and now it works... GPU and ASIC

That's 5 things üòõ


[03-Jul-18 06:55 AM] daemonfox#6136
so... I have a working pool technically on Windows 10 but using the Ubuntu embedded subsytem to run stratum and komodod


[03-Jul-18 06:58 AM] daemonfox#6136
im just happy it seems to be up...


[03-Jul-18 06:59 AM] daemonfox#6136
would be amazng to catch some nice KMD blocks now


[03-Jul-18 07:02 AM] daemonfox#6136
and now my brain wont let it go... cant prov it now but did the fork i pull have a newer blocktemplate? and did Redis still have that template expectation after i pulled the correct komodo?


[03-Jul-18 07:03 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
My bet, given that it worked after redis dump and the `TypeError: Cannot read property 'miner' of undefined` that it was related to redis


[03-Jul-18 07:05 AM] daemonfox#6136
ill have to settle for that answer and not let it eat at me


[03-Jul-18 07:20 AM] daemonfox#6136
got the blocktemplate error once so far but it kept going...


[03-Jul-18 07:20 AM] daemonfox#6136
twice now...

_still thinks that running linux as a subsystem of a pile of dogshit is a bad plan_


[03-Jul-18 07:25 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and Ubuntu at that ü§¶üèø


[03-Jul-18 07:30 AM] daemonfox#6136
they have Debian as well?!?


[03-Jul-18 07:31 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
vbox and vmware has wtf ever you want üòõ


[03-Jul-18 07:31 AM] daemonfox#6136
i know... and i know i can do that easily...


[03-Jul-18 07:31 AM] daemonfox#6136
part of this was to see if Win10 subsytem linux would even handle it


[03-Jul-18 07:32 AM] daemonfox#6136
plus they have 5 distros... Ubuntu 16.04, openSUSE Leap 42, SUSE Linux Enteprise Server, Debian GNU/Linux and Kali linux


[03-Jul-18 07:32 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
what one *can* do and what one *should* do are usually not mutually inclusive


[03-Jul-18 07:32 AM] daemonfox#6136
i will agree with you there...


[03-Jul-18 07:33 AM] daemonfox#6136
this is my first successful pool ive put up after a few attempts on other coins


[03-Jul-18 07:33 AM] daemonfox#6136
now to see if I can get it going in gcloud


[03-Jul-18 07:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
for 100 different reasons, I'm quite pro debian and anti ubuntu. That being said, I'd sooner run a ubuntu box than a debian inside win10 any day of the week


[03-Jul-18 07:36 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
tbh, I'd probably pick a 10" chrome lappy over a PC with win 10 üòõ


[03-Jul-18 07:37 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you can't tell, I have a deep hatred for win10 üòú

I run my stratum on a $80 laptop


[03-Jul-18 07:38 AM] Alright#0419
seriously would not recommend doing it with windows like that


[03-Jul-18 07:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
my 1st stratum was on a 10 year old HP "slimline" running ubuntu


[03-Jul-18 07:47 AM] daemonfox#6136
if it were for other miners to connect to yes... not planning on that so for a solo pool this seems to be working for now


[03-Jul-18 07:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
baby steps


[03-Jul-18 07:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
i have a dedicated node already hosting several coin daemons and personal block explorers


[03-Jul-18 07:50 AM] daemonfox#6136
and i had tested previously connecting to an external daemon instead of the local komodod... even had it polling the VRSC version of AGAMA with KMD loaded up


[03-Jul-18 07:52 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
never be less concerned about the stability of your solo pool than you'd be about the stability of it if others were involved; after all, your main duty is to yourself üòâ


[03-Jul-18 07:53 AM] daemonfox#6136
its a work in progress building to see if an idea I want to try is feasible...


[03-Jul-18 07:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'd so love to play with VRSC, but I don't have the time or inclination to upgrade my OS and/or mess around with fixing their dynamic linking


[03-Jul-18 07:54 AM] daemonfox#6136
My company is moving into AZURE hosting and I really want to try and put together a project to host internal asset chains and block crawlers... get dev testing blockchain for retail ops use

You do know that Azure != win10, right?

The only reason I dumped them was because I was lied to about the updates and the whole mn thing was kept secret until it was done


[03-Jul-18 08:01 AM] daemonfox#6136
I held 4400 BTCD when @jl777c  took over... and i spent them on various things shortly after using some to buy two antminers


[03-Jul-18 08:02 AM] daemonfox#6136
at peak in Dec that was $1.76M USD


[03-Jul-18 08:03 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

[03-Jul-18 08:11 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
LOL better one....
If you figure BTC ath value, I spent $44k per S9 for my 1st 2 üòõ


[03-Jul-18 08:11 AM] daemonfox#6136
yeah me too... got the BTCD traded to BTC and bought S4s when BTC was in the hundreds


[03-Jul-18 08:13 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
but I did make out quite well on my 1st BTC buy....
Bought at $460 locked in price from coinbase, by the time the bank transfer cleared BTC was at $720 and a week later I cashed out at over $900. 2x in 2 weeks was golden


[03-Jul-18 08:14 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
but, then I did something stupid and bought a dozen S7LNs a week before S9s were released üò¶


[03-Jul-18 08:15 AM] daemonfox#6136

[03-Jul-18 08:21 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
my best per hash mining was UNB. about every 16 months the diff drops super low and I make a killing doing rentals on it, the flip side is it spends 6-9 months after that at insane high diff moving like 1 block a day


[03-Jul-18 08:23 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
last low it was $100+ per block and the diff was like 100k; me and one other guy doing rentals rolled 4032 blocks in like 27 hrs

its been in existence sinc eBTC/NMC


[03-Jul-18 08:32 AM] daemonfox#6136
from merged mining to actual dual ming


[03-Jul-18 08:32 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
If your shitcoin doesn't have the community to sustain it without leaching the hash of some other coin (also lessening the efficiency of mining that higher coin), then your shitcoin should die


[03-Jul-18 08:33 AM] daemonfox#6136
ok...


[03-Jul-18 08:33 AM] daemonfox#6136
merged mining was not originally a choice by dev...


[03-Jul-18 08:33 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
no one ever had a merge core that wasn't by choice


[03-Jul-18 08:33 AM] daemonfox#6136
it was a "feature" cloned from BTC coinbase that all clones that didnt change the parameters could do


[03-Jul-18 08:34 AM] daemonfox#6136
just like low diff SAFE mining for KMD notaries...


[03-Jul-18 08:34 AM] daemonfox#6136
SAFE messed up there


[03-Jul-18 08:34 AM] daemonfox#6136
other old coins found out later and chose not to change it


[03-Jul-18 08:34 AM] daemonfox#6136

you think NMC and the earliers ones merge mined out of the gate?


[03-Jul-18 08:36 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think someone (I'm too lazy to think of who, when, etc) said .... hey, if we do this, then we can promote "security" without having to have any miners of our own and our shitcoin will pay us free $

can kmd in theory be dual mined with smthg else?

@wookie ware you asking dual mine or merge mine?


[03-Jul-18 08:37 AM] wookie#7663
I'm fairly noob to mining. I was asking about dual.


[03-Jul-18 08:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
In theory, there's at least 30 coins I can name off the top of my head that can dual mine with KMD (albeit most are asset chains)


[03-Jul-18 08:40 AM] wookie#7663
@ComputerGenie i have a 1080 and a 160 3gb, I dedicate both to KMD, but I read somewhere that it can be dual mined. not sure if my understanding is correct: mining kmd uses mainly memory, while the core sits unused. so the core can be used for mining something else? is that accurate?


[03-Jul-18 08:41 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
ish, but KMD and ZEC use far less mem that the circlejerk of 144,5 coins

Merged mining refers to the process of reusing (partial) PoW solutions from a parent
cryptocurrency as valid proofs-of-work for one or more child cryptocurrencies. It
was introduced as a solution to the fragmentation of mining power among competing
cryptocurrencies and as a bootstrapping mechanism for small networks. Merged
mining was first implemented in Namecoin in 2011, with Bitcoin acting as the parent
cryptocurrency. One of the earliest descriptions of the mechanism as it is used today
was presented by Satoshi Nakamoto in [33]. Apart from the source code of the respective
cryptocurrencies implementing merged mining, a detailed technical explanation is
presented in the Bitcoin Wiki [25].

its always been there since Satoshi published the code


[03-Jul-18 08:44 AM] wookie#7663
@Alright what I understand from dr. google: dual mining redirects some power from coin A to coin B, essentially mining 2 coins on 2 algos. Merged mining has a smaller/"weaker" coin to latch/leach onto the PoW of a coin with a stronger network. that's my "ish" understanding.


[03-Jul-18 08:44 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"It was introduced as a solution to the fragmentation of mining power among competing cryptocurrencies and as a bootstrapping mechanism for small networks"
100% exactly what I said:
" if we do this, then we can promote "security" without having to have any miners of our own and our shitcoin will pay us free $"


[03-Jul-18 08:45 AM] daemonfox#6136
but your statement is implying it was their idea... it was not... it was always part of the codebase and idea from Satoshi


[03-Jul-18 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
miners need to choose to merge mine and a coin needs to add a merkle trees to the blockheader, ie big changes


[03-Jul-18 08:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
On block 19200 Namecoin activated the merged mining upgrade


[03-Jul-18 08:48 AM] daemonfox#6136
it was added 6 months after launch


[03-Jul-18 08:50 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@daemonfox So, you're of the camp that believes that the bct satoshi was the same satoshi that wrote the whitepaper?


[03-Jul-18 08:50 AM] daemonfox#6136
why does that even matter?


[03-Jul-18 08:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
because, that's where that claim comes from: bct


[03-Jul-18 08:51 AM] daemonfox#6136
what claim?


[03-Jul-18 08:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
that satoshi designed mergemining


[03-Jul-18 08:52 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
in order to assert that satoshi came up with mergemining, you also have to say that the satoshi on bitcointalk is *the* satoshi


[03-Jul-18 08:53 AM] daemonfox#6136
its not from bct...


[03-Jul-18 08:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"its not from bct..."
do yourself a favor and the next time you goggle something, look at the references so that you don't say something that wrong

ok... that line is... that wasnt my point... did Satoshi go back and add that code to BTC after that comment? It was already there...

1) There's no conclusive proof presented, as of yet, the Craig is *the* satoshi
2) back then all the Core devs were on bct


[03-Jul-18 09:03 AM] daemonfox#6136
it still doesnt matter for this scope...


[03-Jul-18 09:03 AM] daemonfox#6136
merge mining was possible before that post


[03-Jul-18 09:03 AM] daemonfox#6136
every BTC clone had it


[03-Jul-18 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
LTC cant be merge mined


[03-Jul-18 09:04 AM] daemonfox#6136
but LTC can be a PARENT


[03-Jul-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
any coin can be a parent without changing the daemon, as long as the miners run a special merge mined version, so that isnt really saying much...


[03-Jul-18 09:05 AM] daemonfox#6136
or couldhave idk what all they stripped out


[03-Jul-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
all the changes are on the non-parent side


[03-Jul-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
and miners have to opt in


[03-Jul-18 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is a limit to the number of coins that can be merge mined


[03-Jul-18 09:08 AM] daemonfox#6136
damn... got this again...

whoa...I set off a whole can of worms here. interesting discussion. But I was just asking if anyone can help me figure how to dual mine kmd with some other coin just so I can maximize my returns. I'm not interested in merge mining.


[03-Jul-18 09:11 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@daemonfox so, your position is that Core had code to merge mine before Core devs said that it was theoretically possible (which was a full 6 months before namecoin began)?


[03-Jul-18 09:12 AM] daemonfox#6136
no


[03-Jul-18 09:12 AM] daemonfox#6136
Core had code yes... before Core dev revealed it was theoretically possible yes...


[03-Jul-18 09:12 AM] daemonfox#6136
NMC launched and mined for 6 months


[03-Jul-18 09:12 AM] daemonfox#6136
and at that block height upgrade d to add merge mining


[03-Jul-18 09:14 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, they upgraded before they upgraded? ü§î


[03-Jul-18 09:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
lol


[03-Jul-18 09:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
no they launched as a non merge mined PoW


[03-Jul-18 09:15 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
methinks you need to draw yourself a timeline and look at some commits üòâ


[03-Jul-18 09:18 AM] daemonfox#6136
what am i missing... in April 2011 the launched... 19200 blocs later they activated merge mining... does it matter when the commit happened to make that 19200 block change happen?


[03-Jul-18 09:19 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
December 2010 -> April 2011 -> July 2018


[03-Jul-18 09:20 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
since we're not in theoretical physics channel, timelines are linear üòâ


[03-Jul-18 09:22 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
"does it matter when the commit happened to make that 19200 block change happen"
Yes, it matters when your assertion is that the code existed **before** Dec 2010.


[03-Jul-18 09:25 AM] daemonfox#6136
the code in BTC existed to act as the parent... the code in NMC cloned from it existed but was not functional in April but was implemented 6 months later...


[03-Jul-18 09:25 AM] daemonfox#6136
BTC code pre 2010 > NMC clone 2011 > Mainnet April 2011 > Merge mining implemented


[03-Jul-18 09:27 AM] daemonfox#6136
my assertion is the base code existed before... and then NMC committed the change they needed to act as a child to merge mine from the BTC parent


[03-Jul-18 09:28 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
What you've said so far:
`Core had merge code> BTC code pre 2010 > Core said merge possible in theory> NMC clone 2011 > Mainnet April 2011 > Merge mining implemented`


[03-Jul-18 09:29 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
What happened:
` BTC code pre 2010 > Core said merge possible in theory> NMC clone 2011 > Core had merge code> Mainnet April 2011 > Merge mining implemented`


[03-Jul-18 09:30 AM] daemonfox#6136
so my timeline isnt wrong, you have one more insert where BTC core dev had to add the code...


[03-Jul-18 09:30 AM] daemonfox#6136
or activate it themselves...


[03-Jul-18 09:30 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the code came *after* the "in theory", not before


[03-Jul-18 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
only the miner needs to change for the parent (as far as I know)


[03-Jul-18 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
and only miners that are merge mining need to run the special version


[03-Jul-18 09:31 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
iirc there's a opcode change
in Core


[03-Jul-18 09:31 AM] daemonfox#6136
the in theory was stating it was already there... child coins just needed to make a change


[03-Jul-18 09:32 AM] daemonfox#6136
can you link i was looking for it


[03-Jul-18 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
so BTC miners that want to merge mine would run a mergemining daemon that generates merkle proofs for the merge mining, the BTC mining is unchanged. not sure what OP_CODE would be needed for BTC, but certainly for the non-parent chain it is a lot of changes


[03-Jul-18 09:33 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
mm is pretty much like LN, Core change isn't *needed* but made it easier


[03-Jul-18 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
that I can believe


[03-Jul-18 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
a small change on the BTC side, much more changes on the NMC side


[03-Jul-18 09:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
yes


[03-Jul-18 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and no, I dont plan to add merge mining to KMD


[03-Jul-18 09:34 AM] daemonfox#6136
lol


[03-Jul-18 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
not that there is anything wrong with it


[03-Jul-18 09:35 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
_goes back to pretending he doesn't despise the current Core team and goes back to working on his stratum_


[03-Jul-18 09:37 AM] jl777c#5810
probably gavin added the needed core side changes?


[03-Jul-18 09:37 AM] daemonfox#6136
idk i asked for the link im curious what was changed


[03-Jul-18 09:37 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

[03-Jul-18 09:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@daemonfox as an fyi, there's no part of me that's going to pour through a random 6 month period of commits to save you the time in doing so yurself


[03-Jul-18 09:39 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
üòõ


[03-Jul-18 09:55 AM] daemonfox#6136
np... you made it sound like what you found was difinitively a commit for merged mining updates


[03-Jul-18 10:03 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
not sure how it came across, but the intention was:
there was no code to make it possible before the discussion where it was stated that it should be possible.
You said:
code -> saying possible in theory
I say
saying possible in theory -> any code


[03-Jul-18 10:06 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and setting all that aside, I still say that I doubt the claim that Craig = *the* Satoshi (i.e., the author of the Bitcoin whitepaper); ergo, Satoshi never said fekall about mergemining üòõ

[03-Jul-18 12:53 PM] Alright#0419
Public pools are targets. If something happens to them in which their miners receive less coins, they aren't likely to mention it or reimburse for those coins. For example, 1 miner faking shares on the pool steals from every single participant


[03-Jul-18 12:54 PM] TheHaddock#3171
Soo... should i solo?

[03-Jul-18 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
mining in a pool =
* adding "centralization" (e.g. - in Bitcoin, because people mine more often in larger pools 1 company can easily hit 51%)
* gives income away for no reason other than convenience
* adds additional trust to a trustless system

no, no equihash calculator accounts for KMD notary node blocks

you mine KMD because you think it has more future value than CoinX, not because it has more "today" value

Hi all, I've got a question about mining reward. I was looking at notary nodes and found that one of them mined a block with ~9900 KMD reward. Anyone can explain it? Are the rewards not claimed redistributed?

Since i did the coqui ANN there has been many people asking for what mining pool mines coqui


[09-Jul-18 05:40 AM] siu#3920
it seems like there is no official assetchains mining pool available


[09-Jul-18 05:41 AM] siu#3920
Do you guys think that a assetchains mining pool is a viable project?


[09-Jul-18 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
not really, 0.0001 rewards seem pretty small, but for high value coins it might be worthwhile


[09-Jul-18 06:39 AM] siu#3920
but since the blocks are on demand, the more usage a chain has, the more 0.0001 rewards miners can get


[09-Jul-18 07:48 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

mergemining requires changing the header and it is better to just do a mining rotation for chains with mempool, like decker has


[09-Jul-18 08:01 AM] Deleted User#0000
Something like that was suggested already, it would be mad for scale chains, we could do some crazy numbers being able to use a single miner for X chains.


[09-Jul-18 11:41 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
In an "untouched by external miners" chain, mergemining would also defeat the benefits of self-mining your own on-demand transactions


[10-Jul-18 04:31 AM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie have you been testing your ac switching mining-thingie? I have seen some 'suspicious' üòÉ behavior, where I mine 10 or even 20 blocks in a row, but when I drop a tx or two into the mempool, suddenly someone else grabs that block... If it is not you, someone else may be on it too.

[10-Jul-18 04:49 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`the price is just linear multiple of the mini?`
yeah, at that price-point they are quite underwhelming


[10-Jul-18 05:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I'm going to get both,  mini and full.  Full will have more longevity and with the possibility of OC  may perform very well.  Minis to space hashpowe over multiple coins


[10-Jul-18 05:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
And pools


[10-Jul-18 06:41 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@polycryptoblog I'm not sure that I agree with longevity, given chips per board. If 1 chip in a mini shits the bed, you are down 3 good chips; if 1 chips in a "full" shits the bed, you are down **7**


[10-Jul-18 06:50 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes ,  but if nothing shits the bed ,  you will be able to mine longer with the full.  Regardless,  point taken


[10-Jul-18 06:53 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Still not sure how you come to that conclusion


[10-Jul-18 06:54 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
Care to share what metric you're using to determine "longer"?


[10-Jul-18 06:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The length of time that a given hashrates production covers its power cost


[10-Jul-18 06:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
the hash and power and price are within nominal differences, so you're still not saying anything that would indicate "longer"


[10-Jul-18 06:59 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
40k sols @ 1200 watts is 40k sols @ 1200 watts


[10-Jul-18 07:00 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
beyond that, the "power cost" difference is $9 in cables


[10-Jul-18 07:11 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
1150


[10-Jul-18 07:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Mmm just saw minis at a lot lower power consumption, 260 at base that would make them more efficient.  So the real difference is space taken up,  amount of power supplies .   Ports taken up at the switch etc. Still at this rate might as well go with the minis especially considering coupons.


[10-Jul-18 07:55 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
`polycryptoblog - Today at 9:11 PM
1150`
1150+115=?


[10-Jul-18 07:57 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
and as for "amount of PSUs", that's more of a hobby miner issue, not any actual comparative thing


[10-Jul-18 07:58 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, still not seeing support for the "longer"/"longevity" claim


[10-Jul-18 08:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

@polycryptoblog Something else I just thought of:
Since Bitmain has yet to release any specifics on the Z9 (to actually compare with the minis), it's key to accept the possibility that we're all merely assuming that they are 12 chips per card and thus 4x but they could actually be 10 chip cards that are already punched up to a higher frequency.


[11-Jul-18 06:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
From a manufacturing and business sense, the latter would be far more profitable for them to do.


[11-Jul-18 12:26 PM] ComputerGenie#2331

[11-Jul-18 01:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Same I think the z9 minis are then better buy


[11-Jul-18 01:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Risk is spread as well.


[11-Jul-18 01:41 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Mini goes down your out 14-15k hashpower


[11-Jul-18 01:42 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Z9 full goes down your out 40-50k


[11-Jul-18 03:51 PM] FishyGuts#5085
Important things being equal, cost, power consumption 
One Z9 breaks, you lose 100% of your hashpower.
One Mini breaks and you lose 25% of your hashpower.

Plus, does anyone know if you can use more than one coupon per unit?   If not, then you can use 1,000 worth of coupons on 4 minis.


[11-Jul-18 04:01 PM] ! zpool.ca | crackers#9719
One coupon per machine


[11-Jul-18 04:32 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes,  that would be a kick in the nuts of the full version is already maxed out on hashrate.   Will get one to test it out ,  just in case it's the opposite of the assumption and we can crank these badboys up to 70ksol+ but I'm convinced : the rest will be minis.


[11-Jul-18 07:03 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Yea I'm thinking 10 boards in a z9 full


[11-Jul-18 07:03 PM] BlackJesus#6161

Those are already in komodod, if you use the ac_cc=x parameter.

I'm also getting this below that line `[Master]    [PoolSpawner] No pool configs exists or are enabled in pool_configs folder. No pools spawned.` So i'm guessing there may be a problem with my komodo.json file somewhere, or it is just because it doesn't recognise the equihash json.

the drawback is that if I have to build from the template instead of a stratum subdividing work, then there's no sense in not just feken solo mining (aside from variance and donating to someone else's retirement fund)

Bitpoolmining.com is still donating all mining fees to the Komodo dev fund. The pool operators have also released their bitpool miner (BPM) that is completely free and open source. BPM allows remote monitoring as well as profitablity estimates from whattomine. Help the community grow by mining on bitpoolmining.com

[18-Jul-18 12:43 AM] Alright#0419

Off set  your gpu rigs/less profitable asics loss with other miners profit when looking to build up bags.  Ex. 1 mini is making like 25ish a day profit. Off that one mini you could cover the electric cost of 7-8 L3++.  Reduces taxable gain too

Hi. I'm running a z9 mini


[19-Jul-18 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
@marv101 if you're running a mini, then your best bet is looking into running your own pool (like znomp) and not giving away your hard earned KMD


[19-Jul-18 02:21 PM] Bla5t_Tyrant#0494
When kmd does the notary fork once per year, will that make the Z9 useless for kmd mining?  I'm looking into mining kmd.  Right now i have a gpu rig mining eth.


[19-Jul-18 02:22 PM] ComputerGenie#2331
all the notary fork means is that new notaries replace the old ones

[22-Jul-18 02:08 PM] TheHaddock#3171
Im not sure about the z9 .. new batches coming in and not many equihash coins open for Asic.. meaning that those algo's will see explosion of difficulty. meaning plummiting rewards for miners... but for 850$ for a mini.. it is not a big investment and might be an entree level into asics to experience first hand.

[23-Jul-18 07:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
The biggest current issue with GPU mining VRSC is PCIe bandwidth. Depending on setup, the hashrate of a 1080Ti ranges anywhere from 2-145 MH/s. GPU slotted direct to 16x in board is best (and even an unpowered 16x riser will drop rate some) and 1x-16x riser slotted in 1x gen2 port is the worst.


[23-Jul-18 07:44 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
board, slot, power, CPU, and w/out riser(s) all play a big role in what a card does with Verus


[23-Jul-18 07:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
best results I had on my z170-pro was with only 1 1080Ti and it was direct in slot


[23-Jul-18 07:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
because of how the board is laned, just the act of having 2 cards on that board drops card0 by 31% (from 145 to 101) üò¶


[23-Jul-18 07:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
this is good news for CPU miners


[23-Jul-18 07:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
and also it benefits small time GPU miners with just a few cards in a normal setup, instead of crazy riser monstrosity setups. Those big GPU farms won't switch to Verus


[23-Jul-18 07:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
but a few smalltime GPU people with cards that are almost worthless, sounds like we get a few of them


[23-Jul-18 07:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
ya, my i7 6700k is ~ on par with a 1080Ti on this board if I have 2 Tis on it


[23-Jul-18 07:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
People might not build new GPU rigs just for Verus, but they will repurpose old ones


[23-Jul-18 07:52 AM] dukeleto#7326

[23-Jul-18 07:52 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
CPU has a big impact on how well the GPU does, too
i7 + 1080TI kicks ass of i5 + 1080Ti


[23-Jul-18 07:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
most "re-purposed" GPU rigs will likely need a CPU upgrade because of the transfer demands of Verus


[23-Jul-18 07:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
That seems like the limitation in the software that Decker was talking about... GPU mining should not rely on CPU.


[23-Jul-18 08:01 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

There are CPU only coins.... that need like 8GB of ram n some crazy dumb shit... pretty much just cannot mine on GPU.


[23-Jul-18 08:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think if the miner is better GPU could be better... A far as I know the Verus miner still needs AVX CPU, so thats likely what is using the CPU, but I havent tried to read the code or anything.


[23-Jul-18 08:04 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
most "CPU only coins" are "CPU only coins" because no one has been assed to create a way to send the instruction set to a GPU

[23-Jul-18 08:25 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@dukeleto 
1) The main thing is how much you support decentralization; pools = centralized
2) The "full time" thing came from NOMP and the ability to set it up and run a public pool; not anything to do with solo
3) Do you enjoy donating 1-3% of your currency to some random stranger so that you don't have to spend an hr or 2 setting up your own stuff?


[23-Jul-18 08:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie it all comes down to the real estimate of time for 3, and ongoing maintenance

@Alright installing npm from packages is usually asking for trouble


[23-Jul-18 08:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
so it comes down to "how much time you spend installing/maintaining znomp" versus 0.5% fee, if we are talking purely financial


[23-Jul-18 08:34 AM] Alright#0419
installing takes 15-20 minutes


[23-Jul-18 08:34 AM] Alright#0419
"maintaining" it is keeping a process running


[23-Jul-18 08:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
if we estimate $10/day profit per z9, that is 5 cents a day pool fee, or about $1.50/month. If you value your time at all, it doesn't work out

@ComputerGenie awesome, that is good to hear


[23-Jul-18 08:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
so if any pool operators out there are going to add Verus, it seems they need to do a lot of work to znomp, right? To replace equihash with verushash. I haven't seen any pool actually say they are working on it


[23-Jul-18 08:40 AM] Alright#0419

[23-Jul-18 08:40 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

[23-Jul-18 08:40 AM] dukeleto#7326

[23-Jul-18 08:42 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

[23-Jul-18 08:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
I have vague plans to revive my hushwebminer codebase and make it mine Verus instead, since it makes a whole lot more sense to CPU mine Verus in a browser. So I need a backend znomp/etc to talk to, and it sure would be great if I didn't have to write it myself üòÉ


[23-Jul-18 08:44 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the real hassle, I think (I haven't gotten that far to know for sure), is going to be a verifier to preempt "fake shares"


[23-Jul-18 08:46 AM] dukeleto#7326

I never bother with tls/ssl on solo and why do you "have" to use claymore?


[23-Jul-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
because my miner is terrible


[23-Jul-18 09:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
The litteral only way to make it work, was with a custom archlinux wth hacked drivers and claymore software

If what I am trying out here works, I can at least use it for something, otherswise I'll make a bunch of cheap gaming computers and sell them all.

d you need the magic value for that simple pool you linked... we seem to have removed it from the scaletest znomp configs.

can that profit switching be changed to a "time based switch" ?

so it just rotates thorugh chains ?

I made some great progress on that, but likely all you need is 90% of the hash for the first 1000 blocks and you wont be able to lose.

definitive guide:


[24-Jul-18 12:22 AM] jansako#3330
just installed the KMD dependencies
just do 
`sudo apt-get install build-essential pkg-config libc6-dev m4 g++-multilib autoconf libtool ncurses-dev unzip git python zlib1g-dev wget bsdmainutils automake libboost-all-dev libssl-dev libprotobuf-dev protobuf-compiler libqt4-dev libqrencode-dev libdb++-dev ntp ntpdate vim software-properties-common curl libcurl4-gnutls-dev cmake clang` 

right away on the fresh install (sudo apt-get update first)
then nodejs 8.xx (https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions)
then redis
then libsodium
then z-nomp

RFOX and CRYPTO both give exact same error üò¶

are RFOX and CRYPTO both PoW assetchains?

yes


[24-Jul-18 04:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
I can CPU mine them both just fine

I think they were all lower hash rate, but I really dont care if they are low hash or not.. as long as I can mine empty blocks, I can test what I want to test

james merged CC upsream to dev, so I cant compile it... but its doubtful thats an issue as CPU mining works fine.

@HashUnlimited it also happens with a ruleset change
@Deleted User do you have a good komodod build?

@Deleted User " block template polling is disabled" says to me that you have `blockRefreshInterval` set to 0 or something invalid


[24-Jul-18 04:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes I set it to 0, becaues I am using blocknotify


[24-Jul-18 04:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
but I have nfi what I am doing


[24-Jul-18 04:29 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'd never set it to 0 but if you set it off, then it's safe to ignore when it tells you that you set it to off


[24-Jul-18 04:30 AM] Deleted User#0000
maybe it should not be zero... its worth a try


[24-Jul-18 04:30 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
that being said, it's possible that because you're not polling, you're on the wrong block


[24-Jul-18 04:30 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
That might indeed be an issue as block notify alone isn‚Äôt enough, you want to use walletnotify as well


[24-Jul-18 04:31 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
if the daemon has block 9, you can't build block 8 ontop of it


[24-Jul-18 04:31 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok... I put it to 500

[24-Jul-18 04:33 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
That‚Äôs fine but you will only call blocktemplate on blank blocks thus never incorporate fresh transactions but only the ones in your mempool

te block notify script updated the block, and the RPC error about block decode failed went away, but the invlaid block error is still therre

Where‚Äôs a block decode failed? Daemon log?

[24-Jul-18 04:37 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
no


[24-Jul-18 04:37 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
That would be a header mismatch


[24-Jul-18 04:39 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
There‚Äôs something to the transaction part like strTxComment which he is not hashing correctly


[24-Jul-18 04:39 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
isn't header mismatch when you're trying to build 9 with the header from 8; rather than when you're trying to build 8 on top of 9?


[24-Jul-18 04:39 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@Deleted User what do you have for txfee in the json?


[24-Jul-18 04:40 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
he is getting merkle root mismatch and that check is explicitly for the tx section

try with tx fee as 0.0001; it shouldn't be the issue, but that's the correct fee

I am not using a magic value, as I coundt find anywhere to put it


[24-Jul-18 04:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
Also didnt start deamon with -pubkey, so that should not be doing anything


[24-Jul-18 04:43 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
crapcoin-cli getblocktemplate


[24-Jul-18 04:43 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
Then decoderawtransaction for every tx inside


[24-Jul-18 04:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
when you run the daemon from terminal, you'll get like: `RFOX: p2p.32268 rpc.32269 magic.4406ad4c 1141288268 1000000000 coins`
the magic for stratum would be `4cad0644` -- magic = 4 hex values and in the stdout, they are 'reversed' because of endian


[24-Jul-18 04:47 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
magic for stratum?


[24-Jul-18 04:47 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
as for -pubkey, it gets ignored when using stratum, because the stratum builds the equivalent of a rawtransaction


[24-Jul-18 04:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@HashUnlimited most nomp forks use "magic" to decode P2P connections


[24-Jul-18 04:49 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
aka "pchMessageStart"


[24-Jul-18 04:49 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
which is pretty much deprecated as it comes with a nice blocknotify. in fact most daemon will get you the blocks and kick you


[24-Jul-18 04:51 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
if you like to go down that road of hacks, you need to make sure to fake the correct service bits as well

Which NOMP isn‚Äôt doing so it‚Äôs treated like an SPV client


[24-Jul-18 04:51 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
it's about a 50:50 split on which is faster: P2P or notify


[24-Jul-18 04:52 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
we will serve you blocks if we got a semaphore available, otherwise look somewhere else.


[24-Jul-18 04:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
I know where to get the magic from, and I remeber something about reverseing it... but where do I put it?


[24-Jul-18 04:55 AM] Deleted User#0000
there is no magic values in the kmd-nomp software


[24-Jul-18 04:56 AM] Deleted User#0000

`    "peerMagic": "4cad0644",`


[24-Jul-18 04:58 AM] HashUnlimited#9427
cool approach. so you can only mine when the last block is more than twice the target time behind so your fake node gets accepted

Well if you think it‚Äôs my pool, try z-nomp. I was just about to say, for anyone interested it‚Äôs basically exactly the same. I just got rid of the other coin setups, and added ones for all the assetchains.

[24-Jul-18 06:06 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I can test on my side if you‚Äôd like. I‚Äôm just about to start testing some assetchains on my public pool site


[24-Jul-18 06:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
I tried RFOX and CRYPTO both gave same errors

Hmm okay. I‚Äôm going to try a few here in a minute


[24-Jul-18 06:07 AM] Deleted User#0000
sweet let me know.. I think its something I did, becasuse I had heaps of issues to get it to even install...


[24-Jul-18 06:07 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Yea I would get tons of install issues originally as well. I‚Äôm not sure why v7.8.0 seemed to install flawlessly for me


[24-Jul-18 06:07 AM] xRobeSx#5136
But I‚Äôm reusing that version on multiple servers hah


[24-Jul-18 06:08 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I‚Äôll add it to the readme install notes


[24-Jul-18 06:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok I think maybe I should create another VM... I guess to get a public facing port I can SSH tunnel to the public facing VM... damn not having my own NAT access lol.

Well that‚Äôs what OS mine are running on ha


[24-Jul-18 06:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
k I will make a new VM using that, not like it takes long... I recently found out I can assign more resources than my server has and it just shares them... so its not really an issue. üòÑ


[24-Jul-18 06:13 AM] xRobeSx#5136
hah thats pretty cool


[24-Jul-18 06:13 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm installing assetchains now on my pool server


[24-Jul-18 06:14 AM] xRobeSx#5136
then we can do some private testing on assetchains before i make it public


[24-Jul-18 06:14 AM] xRobeSx#5136
hopefully its goes fast. its not quite NN resources

There I fixed it for you.


[25-Jul-18 03:56 AM] Trystaero#7522
Fpgas are not that much faster without expensive supporting hardware and would make them extremely price inefficient.


[25-Jul-18 03:57 AM] Trystaero#7522
Some algos they will be faster at but not a blanket statement as you suggested.


[25-Jul-18 04:16 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the only "expense" to an FPGA is the same as to an ASIC -- board bandwidth and RAM


[25-Jul-18 05:59 AM] dokudoku#1366
nope i really mean fpga, i think it's that much faster. i already tried in AWS it's 10x faster. and that's the unoptimized code


[25-Jul-18 06:18 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
@dokudoku you coded, compiled, and deployed an AWS FPGA for equihash?

not really, i follow some tutorial https://fpga.guide/4a-Howto-AWS/

it might not be something "you" missed, it might be that the flavor stratum you're using isn't getting the correct info to even start building the correct block

[25-Jul-18 07:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
or, it could even be that the current dev branch is wonky


[25-Jul-18 07:47 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
have you tried with komodo master branch instead of dev?


[25-Jul-18 07:51 AM] Deleted User#0000

The rented hash has the same issue.


[25-Jul-18 08:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
So its definatly something with the pool. This is also on komodo master branch.


[25-Jul-18 08:54 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the issue is all of the centralized bullshit in the stratum core

`payFoundersReward, percentFoundersReward, maxFoundersRewardBlockHeight, foundersRewardAddressChangeInterval, vFoundersRewardAddress, percentTreasuryReward, treasuryRewardStartBlockHeight, treasuryRewardAddressChangeInterval, vTreasuryRewardAddress` and all the dumshit that goes with all of those

it's now just reward, it's in the template and all of the pool-stratum module


[25-Jul-18 08:59 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
any znomp that doesn't have all of the new shit *should* work, if new shit then likely needs edits or some random dumshit changed in config (e.g., "payFounders":"fekNo")

Looked at what you posted, this may not help but here is what I see you have different from my setup, I realize some of these are not relevant: (other assetchains)
- I do not use blocknotify
- To install Redis, I do this: sudo apt-get install redis-server (from Decker's guide) I do not run redis in a separate screen.
- Banning and website enabled
- Payment processing true (with the rest of the shebang)


[25-Jul-18 09:38 AM] jansako#3330
can't see anything obviously wrong either, except that you seem to use different packages...

I did not mean it is the coin itself, rather your particular install of the coin... but if you have already rebuilt it several times


[25-Jul-18 09:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the problem is not with the coin/daemon
the problem is that "kmd-nomp" is a fork of some random znomp and isn't actually for kmd


[25-Jul-18 09:46 AM] Deleted User#0000

if you roll back `bitcoinjs-lib-zcash` 2 commits and take all of the ZEC shit out, kmd-nomp works as expected

[26-Jul-18 05:09 PM] Alright#0419
master branch is on a different chain


[26-Jul-18 05:09 PM] Alright#0419
master is at "longestchain": 274321,


[26-Jul-18 05:09 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Okay. So can the other assets stay on dev branch too?


[26-Jul-18 05:10 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I have to run them all on dev or master


[26-Jul-18 05:10 PM] Alright#0419
if you mine blocks that have multiple vouts in the coinbase on any chain right now, it will fork between nodes that are on dev and master


[26-Jul-18 05:10 PM] Alright#0419
I think the extra vout is coming from the pool fee


[26-Jul-18 05:10 PM] Alright#0419
if you were to turn that off for now, it'd be fine (I think)


[26-Jul-18 05:13 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Well what I‚Äôm saying is master going to be updated to dev rules? So that I can keep them all running on dev. I‚Äôll just leave it off til I know I‚Äôm safe. Idk why pool fee would cause that because it‚Äôs not sending to the fee address til the payout block which is way after mining it


[26-Jul-18 05:13 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Strange


[26-Jul-18 05:13 PM] Alright#0419
it claims the pool fee in the coinbase tx


[26-Jul-18 05:14 PM] Alright#0419
master should be updated when someone who has access to the repo is available


[26-Jul-18 05:15 PM] xRobeSx#5136
I gottcha. Sounds good I‚Äôll leave it off for now so no other chain ends up forked


[26-Jul-18 05:18 PM] xRobeSx#5136

btw if you update your pool, you need a fix, either use deckers or kmd-nomp or one genie made


[27-Jul-18 12:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
the fix is in all of those, but default z-nomp no longer works


[27-Jul-18 12:16 AM] jansako#3330
I thought the issue was with the AC's themselves, not the pool?


[27-Jul-18 12:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
its the pool, there was a zcash overwinter update that makes the pool build incorrect blocks


[27-Jul-18 12:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
if your using a copy of znomp before that commit then it works after not

Just FY, I am seeing a bit of an issue with the payout feature. (z-nomp release) It seems to  'keep some' of the mined coin back, so there is a slowly ever increasing amount left on the pool wallet. It is quite a significant amount actually, so keep an eye on that. It does not do it for KMD for some reason, but it does it for the AC with those miniscule block rewards.


[27-Jul-18 12:20 AM] jansako#3330
wrong tag, meant @xRobeSx


[27-Jul-18 12:22 AM] jansako#3330
Anyone else sees that? You may not even notice if you just set up the payout and not look at the original deposit wallet...


[27-Jul-18 12:22 AM] Deleted User#0000
you might have the txfee set to the wrong size in the 'coins' folder


[27-Jul-18 12:23 AM] jansako#3330
I left it at default... hmm what should it be?


[27-Jul-18 12:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
0.0001 I think is the exact value


[27-Jul-18 12:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
0.00005 was in robes configs


[27-Jul-18 12:25 AM] jansako#3330
Yes, I have it at 0.00005


[27-Jul-18 12:25 AM] jansako#3330
It is still sending though, so how come it keeps some back?


[27-Jul-18 12:25 AM] jansako#3330
and it always sends the KMD reward


[27-Jul-18 12:26 AM] Alright#0419
txfee only matters if you use the payment processor


[27-Jul-18 12:26 AM] jansako#3330
yes, I do


[27-Jul-18 12:26 AM] Alright#0419
well actually shouldn't matter at all, as the txs will get confirmed with a lower fee anyway


[27-Jul-18 12:27 AM] jansako#3330
and it does pay out, just not all the mined coins, there is an ever increasing amount that stays behind


[27-Jul-18 12:28 AM] jansako#3330
I will fix the fee on half of the AC's, see what it does üòÉ


[27-Jul-18 12:32 AM] jansako#3330
could it be the 'maxBlocksPerPayment' value? If I mine more than the specified number over the payout period? I have it set to 600 blocks over 570 payment interval. I have the payment intervals set staggered, cause I though maybe the payouts are not going out cause all of them are trying to send at the same time...


[27-Jul-18 12:33 AM] jansako#3330
actually no way one can mine 600 blocks in 9.5 minutes, so that can't be it...

Will there still be a point in using my gpu miners on kmd?


[27-Jul-18 02:50 AM] jansako#3330
probably better off mining other things & buy KMD with the profits


[27-Jul-18 02:51 AM] jansako#3330
I think even the mini's will kill GPU mining KMD, if they have not already


[27-Jul-18 03:28 AM] wolfgang#3508

@ComputerGenie do you think I should change assetchain txfees to .0001 or leave at .00005 like KMD has?


[27-Jul-18 06:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I think you should set the tx fee to whatever the tx fee is supposed to be üòõ


[27-Jul-18 06:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
in theory, all it *should* do with the wrong tx fee is take the difference out of the pool's funds
I haven't looked at it too much, but that seems the logical conclusion


[27-Jul-18 07:57 AM] xRobeSx#5136
KMD-nomp coin tx fees have been updated and MGNX was added. If anyone wants to check out the repo its here: https://github.com/komodoservices/kmd-nomp although computergenie's is stripped down version could be better :)

Is it possible to run one machine and have different GPU's pointed to Different pools/stratums?

E.G.:

zm --server stratum.web.services --port 3123 --user wallet.id  --color --dev GPU0
zm --server stratum.notthesameweb.services --port 3103 --user wallet.id  --color --dev GPU1


etc... etc... ? 

If not this way, could it be done with the --cfg-file command?

[27-Jul-18 07:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
After that the miner program wont open any more.


[27-Jul-18 07:07 PM] FishyGuts#5085
But the 10 will stay on.   Now they dont appear to be submitting shares but the difficulty is changing.

you're using your own pools or robes'?

By using --dev 0,1,2 I can run an instance with just those GPUs.

I was testing on robes


[27-Jul-18 07:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
it just required a gpu# and port change


[27-Jul-18 07:09 PM] Alright#0419
and if you open less than 10, do they start mining?


[27-Jul-18 07:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
they mine up to 10


[27-Jul-18 07:09 PM] FishyGuts#5085
and 11 and 12 wont stay open but 1-10 will

[28-Jul-18 12:14 AM] TheHaddock#3171
gpu doesnt make a dent realy in mining equihash.
the z9 is king now.
A 1070 rig has a hashrate of 2600sol for 720watt and cost you 3500$
A z9 mini has a hashrate of 10 to 16k sol for 350watt and cost you 850$

it should be a no brainer to sell the 1070 rig and buy z9‚Äôs for it


[28-Jul-18 12:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
depends on what price you can get for the rig... My rig is ~1800w and only 2Ksol ü§£ Was looking into some minis, but the noise put me off.


[28-Jul-18 12:28 AM] Deleted User#0000
This rig can easily mine AC's though as nobody is mining them, but its not exactly profitable with such a low block reward.


[28-Jul-18 12:31 AM] TheHaddock#3171
my elec rate is high .. 0.3$
so 350watt for +10ksol is profitable for me.. niw my 1070 rig mines at break even


[28-Jul-18 12:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and you cant use the gpu rig to mine ethereum or something?


[28-Jul-18 12:41 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or rent it out on nicehash?


[28-Jul-18 01:04 AM] jansako#3330
I am trying to sell my 1070 rig, but the prices went to shite and nobody is buying... so might as well keep it on AC's. Not worth doing though, unless you can eat the electricity cost until there is any liquidity on AC's. I think I sold like 2 KMD worth in the last month...

Good stuff about being able to run 2 miners per GPU, did not know that!

@TheHaddock My GPU rigs disagree with you, as does the 10 Komodo blocks they found yesterday

@Cryptoon   Small/medium size commercial operation .   The idea if if everything works out legally is to have a B2B barter exchange where mined coin can act as a clearing mechanism for outstanding credit.

[29-Jul-18 11:05 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
90% of my kWh is going to equihash.   Though have been bouncing back and forth on picking up a bunch of sha asics just to get power bill higher ( a lot better rate) .    I just have a feeling though there is going to be a 25-35 TH for ~1500w soon, given by bitmain prices and network hashrate.  Haven't pulled the trigger on it.  @ComputerGenie   Do you find it worthwhile to mine with the sha ASICs?


[29-Jul-18 11:08 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I did for the 1st 2 years I had them. Lack of any real advancement in chips has diminished any interest I had and why we switched to equihash ASICs and GPUs

@polycryptoblog thanks for the clarification, and how does this work exactly? People start mining or rent hashing power and use the hashing power as colleteral to start paying off debt?


[29-Jul-18 01:36 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Barter exchanges have a perennial issue of having too much credit floating in the network at any given time.  This is due to two factors,  1) lack of double coincidence of wants 2) overwhelming amount of soft good vendors ( services ) compared to amount of hard good vendors.  (Products/things).  The 2nd exacerbates the first.   Mining will provide a hard good into the barter exchange economy ,  and the icing on top is that hard Good is comparatively liquid.  Eventually the farm will resell miners, lease hosting as well.  FinCEN also has given the green light on selling mined coins as not being money transmission.   The overarching idea with the barter exchange is to create a credit network in the Komodo ecosystem giving it a stablecoin.  The big holdup is B2C interaction,  my original idea was to use something like the burn protocol to issue trade credit vouchers but I have some concerns with that as I stated in KBS channel.

@xRobeSx check the pool when you have a sec.  Most of the blocks stay 'pending' (for me a pool restart fixed that last time), not sure the payout is working either, or could be just because the blocks do not 'switch' to 'confirmed' status. I pointed a few hashes on Zilla just because, should have expected a payment by now...

could you not detect the mempool TX on KMD, and flood hash on that to mine huge interest blocks?

hope you can eat the cost of that mining for a while, or do you expect actual liquidity to come to the chains?

soon (tm)


[30-Jul-18 03:48 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
the shortest answer is that it will work akin to "weighted averages" in math
a waiting tx gets the most weight
then comes "personal preference" ( I like SN, the next guy likes DEX...)
then comes "profitability"
lastly, all other things being equal, all hash goes to KMD

`yes, but the huge tx could come in 10 sec before the block is found no?`
it will not be something that "turns on a dime" for many different reasons, but it will scrape the mempools quite often

@Cryptoon no, I actually started out in Stanford's distributed computing project, it paid out in FLDC and CURE, and they both mooned at a really good time for me


[30-Jul-18 05:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Sweet


[30-Jul-18 05:19 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
so, then I got more cards and equihash became profitable


[30-Jul-18 05:20 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
then last May-July brought a ton of unexpected income on top of it all

Report: How Bitmain Mines Coins in Secret ~ CryptoBuzz‚Ñ¢
We often imagine blockchains as towers made of crystal. Bright, fascinating, landmarks looming above the fields of cryptography, data science and economics. Inspiring but also intimidating for those that approach them. The ledger of transactions is public, continuously valida...

[30-Jul-18 07:21 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
The real question is why they'd ever release ASICs to the public....


[30-Jul-18 07:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Every time they have a new generation for themselves, they use the more efficient ones for themselves


[30-Jul-18 07:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Limited power supply or so?


[30-Jul-18 07:31 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I'm still waiting for someone to tell me why they'd invest 5-10 million USD to design a chip and **not** use it for themselves


[30-Jul-18 07:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
They use it first for themselves and when they are paid back and then some for the development of a new chip they sell it to the public and use the new chip?


[30-Jul-18 07:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
They probably figure that after x months/years these chips also start showing wear/tear


[30-Jul-18 07:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So better to sell them as 'new' and leave the risk of a faulty product to the customer that buys them


[30-Jul-18 07:32 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
no clue on the actual numbers, but from a business standpoint, I can't see why that wouldn't be the way to go


[30-Jul-18 07:33 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I can see a case for both


[30-Jul-18 07:33 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
even "non-profits" exist for the sole function of earning as much income as possible


[30-Jul-18 07:34 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
99% of bitching about BM comes from people that are just pissed because they are making pennies for every $1000 BM makes üòõ


[30-Jul-18 07:37 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
ask one of them feks if they had 10 million USD to design a chip, would they release it to market with 0 pre orders and 0 self-interest usage
all of the ones that say "yes" are all of the ones that have never been and will never be in a successful managerial position üòâ


[30-Jul-18 07:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Tbh


[30-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I would do indeed exactly the same


[30-Jul-18 07:44 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Maximise profit and they will keep doing this untill an incumbent enters the market and threatens their profitability


[30-Jul-18 07:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As you say, untill someone steps up and coughs up the money to develop a new chip


[30-Jul-18 07:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
tbh, if it were me (like I said initially), I'd make the damn chips and sit back and collect my billions of every algo and say fek the public


[30-Jul-18 07:47 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But then they would destroy the ecosystem they are making money off of


[30-Jul-18 07:48 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So they need other miners to also support price for for example btc or whatever


[30-Jul-18 07:50 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
not really, I mean we still mine KMD knowing that at best we can only get a max of 36% between us on a good day


[30-Jul-18 07:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
look at the bottom end ot top 20 BTC pools:
`17     CKPool     0.64 %     269.64 PH/s     
18     KanoPool     0.64 %     269.64 PH/s     `
That represents quite a few people looking for their "piece of the pie" knowing that there's really a nominal chance of getting any "big" payout


[30-Jul-18 07:55 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
if BM kept all their own stuff, those 2 pools alone would be ~ 45k Avalon units


[30-Jul-18 08:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm that's a lot, but still, it's not like they can keep adding miners to their pool untill they stop working


[30-Jul-18 08:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
As I said, after a while electricity consumption and other logistical stuff becomes an issue I can imagine


[30-Jul-18 08:09 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway, they are making millions upon millions upon millions, they probably have a good view over the operation/ecosystem and found the equilibrium that maximises long term profits?


[30-Jul-18 08:15 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
given how much pressure I'm told they impart on suppliers and transport lanes, I'm not sure "equilibrium" is anything that even enters into the equation; more like "How much can we do before more people start bitching again?"

the only parameter that defines someones succes in mining is the price of electricity.. to let run some gpu or asic is childplay.
unfortunatly that parameter works against my mining ambition .. therefor selling all rigs by end of year.
has been interesting.

yeah bye.. no point to lose money


[30-Jul-18 09:27 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
if you're loosing $ mining equihash, even in the current "down" market, then you couldn't afford to be mining in the 1st place


[30-Jul-18 09:29 AM] TheHaddock#3171
i pay 0.35$/kwh that draws a line in the sand.. no mining for you 
only Ethash is somehow netting just over breakeven.


[30-Jul-18 09:29 AM] TheHaddock#3171
and i pay in ‚Ç¨ üòÇ


[30-Jul-18 09:31 AM] TheHaddock#3171
So.. your elec bill defines the mining succes.. nothing else


[30-Jul-18 09:33 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
even at 35 cents, if you're not big enough to be making $5 a day, then (as I said) you couldn't afford to be mining in the 1st place


[30-Jul-18 09:33 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
scale determines success, because that's how business operates with large overhead


[30-Jul-18 09:37 AM] TheHaddock#3171
true.. i only bought for 10k‚Ç¨ hardware.. so stupid.. but selling everything would return a lot..


[30-Jul-18 09:39 AM] TheHaddock#3171
a 200 to 250k‚Ç¨ initial investment for hardware AND have cheapest elec would be a good step.


[30-Jul-18 09:39 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
not sure how you spent $11712 and are operating at a loss üòï


[30-Jul-18 09:40 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
lemme guess, you mine in a pool and give your profits away?


[30-Jul-18 09:40 AM] TheHaddock#3171
a single 1070 was at it cheapest here 469‚Ç¨
a single 1060 at 299‚Ç¨


[30-Jul-18 09:40 AM] TheHaddock#3171
i only mine in pools yes.. too small for solo mining realy


[30-Jul-18 09:40 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
ahh, so you invested badly to start with


[30-Jul-18 09:40 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
and then compounded it by giving $ away


[30-Jul-18 09:41 AM] TheHaddock#3171
i know everything is cheaper in US.. here in europe it is realy the cheapest cards


[30-Jul-18 09:41 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
anything short of a 1080 was a waste of investment


[30-Jul-18 09:41 AM] TheHaddock#3171
not realy

[30-Jul-18 09:42 AM] TheHaddock#3171
a 1080 was almost 1000‚Ç¨ for only 36Mh at 160watt?
a 1070 at half price doin 32Mh at 110w sounds better


[30-Jul-18 09:43 AM] TheHaddock#3171
your elec rate is cheap.. thats your win and only that


[30-Jul-18 09:43 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
1080 kicks 550 sols @ 173 watts

not sure where you're getting "Mh" from anyway


[30-Jul-18 09:44 AM] TheHaddock#3171
my 1070ti zotac kicks 520 sol at 115w for 470‚Ç¨/card


[30-Jul-18 09:44 AM] TheHaddock#3171
Mh stands for hashrate on ethash algo


[30-Jul-18 09:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, stop mining a shit algorithm and mine Komodo/equihash


[30-Jul-18 09:46 AM] TheHaddock#3171
That would be a clear loss if i mine komodo


[30-Jul-18 09:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

price and rewards mining komodo is too low compared to the price of electricity i pay

im sure you have no idea what you are talking about


[30-Jul-18 09:49 AM] TheHaddock#3171
simple basic math.. cost for mining on elec is as high as returns..

[30-Jul-18 09:52 AM] TheHaddock#3171
but end of ranting here..
mining is stupid at such high rates... second hand sites are overwhelmed with rigs here ... if you are interested üòÇ


[30-Jul-18 09:53 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
1) if you're operating at a loss, there is no point at which it's a good plan to literally **give** part of your earnings away
2) if you can't cover your electric mining an algorithm that your cards do not excel at, then you should be mining an algorithm that your cards **do** excel at (e.g., nvidia=equihash)
3) if you can't accept that I know how much 3.5x my electric bill is, then you can't accept the fact that you're wrong


[30-Jul-18 09:55 AM] TheHaddock#3171
i earn more on ethash algo than equihash algo with nvidea cards... how weird it sounds .. this is what i see here


[30-Jul-18 10:02 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
You can't be losing $ and "earning"; because, words


[30-Jul-18 10:22 AM] TheHaddock#3171
i earn and later pay elec bill .. then eventually i lose if bill is higher than what has been earned.

[30-Jul-18 11:42 AM] TheHaddock#3171
So i understand if you found a very profitable way of mining that you keep it to yourself.. otherwise you give away your advantage.
Im doing the same with trading.. not telling how i trade .. for the same reason.


[30-Jul-18 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
no, I freely tell my profitable way of mining to anyone that will listen
a) buy 1080 Tis
b) mine equihash
c) don't mine in a pool and give your income away
d) if you have $5 to invest than invest that $5
e) "there ain't no half-stepping"; either you're a miner or you aren't


[30-Jul-18 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
that was then


[30-Jul-18 11:45 AM] ComputerGenie#2331

[30-Jul-18 11:46 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
anyone with 1060s and 1070s after 1080s and 1080Tis existed are either hobby miners or bad at math


[30-Jul-18 11:47 AM] TheHaddock#3171
450 sol for 460‚Ç¨ card at 115watt doesnt seem bad at all right?

Might add this into it instead and push it to my fork of your pool... simpily install pool, start all AC then run script. done pool configured.

[01-Aug-18 07:38 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
well, I didn't copy any of the chains that I already had over to the vm, I just ran ./assetchains and it ate everything up (even when I put a 3 minute delay between chains)

havent got that far anyway.. I think I will make this config script with that jq comman of yours, it saves about 2-4 steps from the older version. And I can combine it with `assetchains.json` so it always pullsevery single AC from komodod repo.

[03-Aug-18 03:47 AM] jansako#3330
Dunno... for $20k you can get 20 z9mini's, with power sources. They will hash ~300 kSols, and use 8kW, but the electricity cost difference is negligible at that level.


[03-Aug-18 03:48 AM] jansako#3330
Even if you can OC it at +50%, still better off with the mini's if you have the space. Granted, you need more infrastructure for that kind of setup


[03-Aug-18 04:15 AM] Deleted User#0000

I forget, without factual board specs to compare to minis I wasn't interested


[03-Aug-18 06:20 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
I do know that per advertised hash of z9 vs irl hash of minis, the price difference is nominal


[03-Aug-18 06:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah I'm trying to look but the bitmain site seems down atm


[03-Aug-18 06:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I thought value/usd was slightly better for Z9, but not sure


[03-Aug-18 06:25 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
value for Z9 vs mini is "better" if, and only if, the assumption holds true that the z9 has 4x chips


[03-Aug-18 06:26 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
however, if the Z9 has less chips that are already OCed, then minis are greater in value


[03-Aug-18 06:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
gamble that they hold more chips?


[03-Aug-18 06:28 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
The chance that the Z9 has more chips than 4x the mini and those chips are underclocked is an infinitesimal chance at best


[03-Aug-18 06:31 AM] ComputerGenie#2331
from a manufacturing standpoint, the only 2 real options are:
Z9 has 4x chips
Z9 has less chips and those chips are running at a higher multiplier than that of the minis

Given those choices, it stands to reason that the manufacturer's better option for higher profit yields is the latter

ive got it set up the same way as all the others


[06-Aug-18 02:34 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
@Cryptoon any tips?


[06-Aug-18 02:34 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
i thought it might be max coins suported by znomp so i turned 1 off and kmd on and still didnt show but the other coin was removed


[06-Aug-18 02:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I am a mining noob, I just know most of the mining stuff happens here :p


[06-Aug-18 02:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@ComputerGenie  is the mining wizard extra ordinaire, although @Deleted User  @jansako @xRobeSx and others might also know a thing or two


[06-Aug-18 02:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But think they are in different timezones and getting some sleep atm


[06-Aug-18 02:37 AM] jansako#3330
@CryptoWrench  what are 'the others', and what errors/issues are you seeing?


[06-Aug-18 02:37 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
thats the thing no errors lol


[06-Aug-18 02:37 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
but


[06-Aug-18 02:38 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
other coins are zen,vote,zcl,btcz,xsg,btcp and zel


[06-Aug-18 02:38 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
all from 1 instance


[06-Aug-18 02:38 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
i put the kmd config to true and start pool and it just doesnt show but also doesnt show an error lol


[06-Aug-18 02:39 AM] jansako#3330
OK... are you able to shut down the other pools, and only start KMD? maybe there is an error, just goes by too fast?


[06-Aug-18 02:39 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
ill look through npm log i think


[06-Aug-18 02:39 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
because people are mining those other coins


[06-Aug-18 02:39 AM] jansako#3330
are you using the 'default' config, or edited?


[06-Aug-18 02:39 AM] CryptoWrench#6022

but thats the right directory its running from and thats where i made the changes


[06-Aug-18 02:43 AM] CryptoWrench#6022
and when i turned btcp off from that directory it left the pool


[06-Aug-18 02:45 AM] jansako#3330
that a went a bit over my head... sorry. I run a kmd + assetchains pool only

can you first double check you kmd daemon is fully synced?

well... yes and no.. .we get a fair amount already, but they can and it seems are, either monitoring the mempool for these transactions then switching hash or its a person, makign the TX then mining the KMD chain to claim their own interest.

Risky way of claiming tho, theres always a chance of not mining that block

Yes, if thats indeed what they are doing, it seems ok with me.


[09-Aug-18 03:47 AM] jansako#3330
Risky way of 'claiming', but once they are past the 1 year, there is no other way to claim... spend a couple of hundred on Nicehash for a good chance of getting the 'lost' interest back.


[09-Aug-18 05:54 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Yea I'd rather claim my interest safely and not risk losing it to another miner ha


[09-Aug-18 06:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Is there a way to detect if the hashrate goes x10 and write a script that immediately directs your miners to kmd as well to increase your chances of hitting the megablock?


[09-Aug-18 06:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If so, might be something you should look into if you are mining anyway :p


[09-Aug-18 06:23 AM] xRobeSx#5136
code a bot üòÉ to switch over, but idk how you know about the megablock coming


[09-Aug-18 06:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
No that would be impossible... but you can script to detect a megablock is in the mempool and slam your whole farm to KMD bia a stratum switch


[09-Aug-18 06:25 AM] xRobeSx#5136
there definitely used to be pools/miners that would switch over to KMD just for the Free For All mining period, not sure if they still do


[09-Aug-18 06:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
provided the TX got to youtrnode fast enough you would have just enough time to mine 10 blocks in 1 minute and almost gaurnetee to get it. @xRobeSx  they do, thats why we removed it


[09-Aug-18 06:26 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I figured that was the reason. I just haven't seen anyone mention it in a bit


[09-Aug-18 06:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362

if GPU is under 25% notaries just wait longer to submit a block, longer than 60s so that GPU miners have time to find a block

I'm not sure, but you could mine on a pool


[09-Aug-18 09:18 AM] jansako#3330
I have a kmd pool as a 'failover' on my 1070 rig, would not call it 'effective', but but you can get at least something if your primary pool goes offline... probably worth more even to point those at nicehash, üòÉ

then extract it to a folder. Inside that folder create a new text file. Name it `miner.bat`(or anything followed by .bat) and put something like this in it `zm --server stratum.komodo.services --port 3333 --user <PUTYOURKMDADDRESSHERE> --pass x`


[09-Aug-18 06:16 PM] Alright#0419
save the file and double click it


[09-Aug-18 06:16 PM] Alright#0419
it will start mining with all your GPUs


[09-Aug-18 06:17 PM] Alright#0419
if you want to choose which GPUs to mine you can add `--dev 0 1 2 3 4` for example and it will mine with the first 5 GPUs

Hi, i am new to this coin. I have 2 questions. Waht is the immature balance and is bpm tool an all in one tool to mine with nvidia and amd at same time? Or do i need 2 miners? Thanks...


[12-Aug-18 09:56 AM] Trystaero#7522
Equihash is dominated by Nvidia cards and Asics. AMD doesnt fare well currently

@Trystaero  thanks, than i will by KMD my Nvidia Card gives 15 Sol/s and my Amd 290 Sol/s... so it will take years to get some Coins


[12-Aug-18 10:02 AM] xRobeSx#5136
If you mine on a pool you‚Äôll get some coins. The pool finds blocks and then you get a % of what you contributed


[12-Aug-18 10:03 AM] xRobeSx#5136
You‚Äôre welcome to use my pool: http://pool.komodo.services. We‚Äôve found 2 blocks in the past 100. @MHoApps


[12-Aug-18 10:04 AM] xRobeSx#5136
And to answer your question above, the immature balance is 100 blocks, so it would stay immature on the pool until then (showing in your balance), and then would be paid out to you.


[13-Aug-18 02:00 AM] MHoApps#2201

Even with a pool, block rewards are 3 KMD, then divided up between all of the miners.


[22-Aug-18 12:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
the best way to mine KMD is via CPU, by running a notary node üòÉ

@grewalsatinder you can try the IP they have for a stratum, but they could have the daemon on a different machine


[22-Aug-18 08:45 PM] Alright#0419
don't think there's a simple way to find their IP otherwise

@ns408 FYI mate! üëÜ

could set up a bunch of nodes all over the world and try to find where blocks are originating from


[22-Aug-18 08:46 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
cool, I guess starting with stratum address and check on port connect on the p2p should be a solution

Bitmain will be requiring KYC information to purchase mining equipment in the very near future. I can see this not going over so well with various privacy-loving miners, reducing Bitmain marketshare and also creating an underground market to resell miners sans KYC ‚õèÔ∏è...

@ComputerGenie i think it's a big change, from no KYC, but it makes sense to me. Mostly, it's annoying to see the space embrace KYC, but not surprising


[23-Aug-18 10:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
Mtgox went bankrupt right after they asked for my selfie, so maybe I am jaded on the whole KYC concept


[23-Aug-18 10:17 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Cryptoon it depends on the "type" of business transacted if regulations (those lovely things Congress invented to bypass the Constitution) require KYC or not


[23-Aug-18 10:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
if your business goes across state and country borders, tons more laws apply, in terms of AML

there's nothing wrong with the block reward falling to an inflation minimum once CHIPS is actively used and fees will be plentiful

Why does this things fans keep ramping up for a minute then slowing down >.>


[27-Aug-18 01:39 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
Because they did some math and decided how to control fans automatically because morons kept burning up S9s by setting fans to 40% and freq to 700

At height 983921 , the suprnova pool reward was 1597.1974 KMD - thought the block rewards were  always 3 KMD (plus mining fees) - how is this possible?


[27-Aug-18 03:26 PM] xRobeSx#5136
There are blocks that have unclaimed rewards sometimes


[27-Aug-18 03:31 PM] CheeseBaby#1954
Thanks - could you please explain a little bit more? Unclaimed by whom? I was just surprised to receive in the past few hrs what would normally take over 2 weeks to mine...


[27-Aug-18 03:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Some exchanges,  some from sending fromledger


[27-Aug-18 03:51 PM] bishop#9773
When you move coins that do not have the nlocktime set, the rewards go to the miners who mine the block those tx's appear in


[27-Aug-18 10:29 PM] jl777c#5810
actually, with nLockTime set, but when the reward isnt claimed


[27-Aug-18 11:29 PM] dukeleto#7326
@CheeseBaby some platforms, either choose to not implement or don't understand how to implement KMD interest, and by the rules of bitcoin protocol, if the inputs add up to more than the outputs, the difference goes to the miner of the block


[27-Aug-18 11:30 PM] dukeleto#7326
some KMD notary nodes have received very large "lottery blocks", it's pretty random and usually the lottery amount is very tiny, but sometimes it's not üòÉ

Is 60-80 PCB ok and 70-90 Chip temps ok?   Trying to watch the fans and that seems about when they kick in.

To get 750 frequency I saw a video that you have to gointo the firmware and change antfrequency


[31-Aug-18 06:15 PM] bishop#9773
you just have to ssh in and vi the config file


[01-Sep-18 05:44 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
BM has now added specs to the Z9
`Max Hashrate, 44 KSol/s`
With the same number of chips as 4 minis.
(which would `Max Hashrate, 64+ KSol/s`)
The question now is: did they lower the max freq or use "weaker" chips?


[01-Sep-18 06:00 AM] bishop#9773
Guessing most, if not all of batch 2 (and perhaps inclusive of the non-mini), were binned chips from batch 1. Would explain them removing the frequency adjustment in advanced settings


[01-Sep-18 06:01 AM] bishop#9773
I never ordered a full z9 because I figured with the OC potential of the minis, they would have used less chips and OC'd them from the start since specs were largely missing


[01-Sep-18 06:07 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
heh, we finally agree on something
that's the exact same reason I passed on buying "full" Z9

Batch 2 is hit or miss. Some reports have the dropdown under advanced settings like Batch 1, others, like all the ones I received of Batch 2 just have "Balanced" under the advanced settings so runs at the default 500


[01-Sep-18 06:34 AM] bishop#9773
you can still get around it by manually changing the config file, but they don't OC as high as Batch 1, at least none of my Batch 2 have been able to hit 750

either way, 16.6 avg is a thing of the past without manipulation


[01-Sep-18 09:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe, if batch 2 are binned chips from batch 1, OC'ing them will bring down their lifespan noticeably. Bitmain QA probably had data that made them decide to remove those OC options for a reason

mine's running at 3240, i want to run around 2000+


[01-Sep-18 09:50 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@SHossain Use "Customize the fan speed percentage"


[01-Sep-18 09:51 AM] SHossain#0007
yes. what number to put there? i used 80% and the rpm raised to 5000


[01-Sep-18 09:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
33%?


[01-Sep-18 09:52 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
depends if they are 5500, 5600, or 6k RPM fans, really
edit: if 80% = 5k then they are 6250 RPM max


[01-Sep-18 09:53 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
not sure why you'd want to overheat the chips, but that's the way to do it :trollface:


[01-Sep-18 09:59 AM] SHossain#0007
thanks @ComputerGenie


[01-Sep-18 09:59 AM] SHossain#0007

[01-Sep-18 10:00 AM] SHossain#0007
how about if i use an additional quiet fan at the back while reducing rpm?


[01-Sep-18 10:01 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
how about if you take the advice of engineers and let it do it's thing? :trollface:

noise


[01-Sep-18 10:02 AM] SHossain#0007
i don't like constant noise and need to work from the same room


[01-Sep-18 10:02 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
jokes aside, I used to have a fan curve calculation of 2 fans vs 1 and I forget if there's any major difference or not, but I'm thinking maybe


[01-Sep-18 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
with everything stock, i get 56C temp on chips


[01-Sep-18 10:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
any added effect by push-pull is still going to be limited by the pull fan though


[01-Sep-18 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
that's true


[01-Sep-18 10:05 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
heh my chip temps are all 70+ üòõ


[01-Sep-18 10:06 AM] SHossain#0007
i don't mind if the temp is even 60 or 65. just the constant NOISE üòõ


[01-Sep-18 10:06 AM] SHossain#0007
my laptop already makes a lot of noise when i'm syncing or compiling something


[01-Sep-18 10:07 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I have no idea what 60-65 is like üòù 
I OC each rig to failure and then back it down 5-10%

I'm assuming that it's "locked down" in the same manner as the "newer" Batch2 minis

[02-Sep-18 11:24 AM] wookie#7663
I need some help. I've been mining for weeks/months non-stop, then I lost internet connection for a few minutes today. I shutdown the miner. After I re-established internet connection, I started up the miner again. But the miner just keeps crashing. I have a 1080ti and 1060 that I've been using for months with no problems. I use DSTM's CUDA miner on a pc and I mine on miningpools.cloud. Any help is appreciated.


[02-Sep-18 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
@wookie start the miner from a cmd window and see why it fails

Can someone recommend a KMD pool that is easy to get going in?  I used suprnova months ago, prior to the software upgrade but I couldn‚Äôt get my batch file right after the update. Pretty noobish, so i am looking for a pool that has super clear instructions on how my batch file should read. Thanks.

I am not at home right now. I have an old Nvidia gaming rig.  I have tried a few different mining programs, none with luck tho since earlier this year. I am open to whatever, tho. Dont mind downloading something new. My problem usually lies with there being insufficient instruction on how to write the batch file.

@meatspoon there's download links for the EWBF miner on that thread. 

then your  start.bat should be something like this `miner --server stratum.komodo.services --user <yourKMDaddress>.MyWorker --pass x --port 3333` from what I've found. 

That's my pool, but you can change it for others.

one would think Suprnova would just give an example of the batch file text on their site

So... is everyone solo mining with their Z9s?  Seems better than joining a big pool if you have a few rigs, yeah?


[11-Sep-18 09:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
my rule of thumb is never join a public pool if you have enough hash to get at least 1 block a month

{Reactions}
üêô 

[11-Sep-18 10:10 AM] coinr#7073
Risk mitigation.  One month is too much of a long shot for me.  If its a hobby, then i guess thats fine but pools for larger hash coins average out to the same anyway over long periods


[11-Sep-18 10:19 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@coinr Provided you have the hashrate to cover the overhead without digging into your own pocket (aka "one block per month"), if you enter into a public pool you are only accomplishing 3 things:
1) providing for some random stranger's retirement fund
2) helping to centralize hashrate
3) giving up all consensus rights in the efforts of 1) and 2)


[11-Sep-18 10:21 AM] coinr#7073
Yeah i get it, but that "overhead cost" is a killer when you are spinning a lot of machines.

The smallest pool I can find.


[11-Sep-18 10:31 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Only one other rig there with me.


[11-Sep-18 10:32 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I do not trust myself to set up a pool properly.


[11-Sep-18 10:33 AM] coinr#7073
Either do i.  Had one set up for me .for game credits with a bunch of L3s, but had enough to hit multiple blocks a day.  I just dont have the balls to wait long lol


[11-Sep-18 10:33 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`Only one other rig there with me.`
That I can mostly get behind. One of my main issues with pools is that people are lazy and just flock to whatever pool "everyone else" is on and it creates a dominance factor that isn't good for crypto (albeit that it's mostly a moot issue in KMD mining)


[11-Sep-18 10:35 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Would it make you feel better if the "pool" operator was a KMD supporter and Notary Node Owner?  

If I were to google search a noob friendly znomp setup for myself, what terms would I use?  

Exactly those?  
Thanks again for the input.   I am not adverse to giving this a go.   I do have a few VPS to use for this purpose ( I assume this is advised ).


[11-Sep-18 10:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
The other main issue I have is that for every 100 people in a pool, there's 99 less nodes in the network üò¶


[11-Sep-18 10:36 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Fair enough.   I am game for this.   Always trying to learn.


[11-Sep-18 10:40 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
If you're looking for a pool that's run by a notary, xrobesx has one (he's also got a z-nomp github repo for running your own komodo pool)
Decker made a tutorial for running a solo-pool on Ubuntu that's pretty decent


[11-Sep-18 10:41 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'm not sure how much of either is still currently effected by z-nomp's overwinter updates, though


[11-Sep-18 11:30 AM] Cryptoon#3362
@! zpool.ca | crackers also notary and own pool I think?

Think I'm going to buy 2 a9 zmasters to add to my minis


[11-Sep-18 02:21 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@FishyGuts you got fucked bro I had a 870 tarrif on 5 of mine I called ups and had them manually change it then when I picked them up from ups. I had 0 tarrif to pay ;)


[11-Sep-18 02:21 PM] BlackJesus#6161
Change the tarrif code*


[11-Sep-18 02:22 PM] FishyGuts#5085
I learned that after the fact.   I am waiting for one more rig and will get the opportunity to test that out.

what is a good temperature to keep the z9 mini at?


[11-Sep-18 03:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am trying to decide how much to overclock. the UI was disabled but I used "copy as curl" in chrome and edited the form data, works fine


[11-Sep-18 06:43 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@BlackJesus  explain the process for this,  looking at a huge tariff soon


[11-Sep-18 06:47 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@dukeleto  60's ,  heard some problems with this new batch running at 70s

People looking for an easy to setup pool, I have a pool called Knomp and a script that does all the configurations for KMD and AC automatically via a one line command. Its not super easy to do, and could use some polish, but its not bad.


[12-Sep-18 01:25 AM] $tefano.#3560
Great! New goal for our komodo pool, thank you
130.000 KMD paid and 1 Mh/s

[12-Sep-18 07:59 AM] BlackJesus#6161
@$tefano. this afternoon ill be adding another 120k sols to your pool. I was too lazy to setu my znomp :(. plus I'm in the process of moving cities and setting up my miners remotely in TN wilst I live in Wisconsin.


[12-Sep-18 08:02 AM] BlackJesus#6161
@polycryptoblog just call the international ups hot line and tell hem they have the wrong tarriff code and get them to manually change it to 8470.50.0150 as the tariff code which will remove the fees.


[12-Sep-18 08:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
has anybody ever gotten a high-pitched horrible beeping sound when trying to overclock a z9 mini? I couldn't tell if it was the fan or some error noise


[12-Sep-18 08:02 AM] BlackJesus#6161
You will have to send them an email stating that you had them manually change the tariff code.


[12-Sep-18 08:03 AM] BlackJesus#6161
@dukeleto none but I had single boards go down on startup with a 700 clock speed had to bring them back to 650.


[12-Sep-18 08:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
there is a way to get rid of tariffs?!?!

can that be done after the fact? I bet it takes them a while to cash that check


[12-Sep-18 09:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
my z9m makes a crazy horrible high pitched noise when overclocking above 625, tho it still seems to hash. 625 seems to make it happy


[12-Sep-18 10:33 AM] BlackJesus#6161
they have to send it through customs again


[12-Sep-18 10:33 AM] BlackJesus#6161
but it will pass


[12-Sep-18 10:33 AM] BlackJesus#6161
its those damn trump tariffs why this happened


[12-Sep-18 10:33 AM] BlackJesus#6161
btw all 8 of my miners are up and running had to pay a grand to get my l6-30 installed by a licensed electrician zzz

How long does it take to go through customs again, do you know what happens if they don't accept it


[12-Sep-18 10:53 AM] BlackJesus#6161
like a day max


[12-Sep-18 10:53 AM] BlackJesus#6161
didnt take long at all for mine


[12-Sep-18 10:54 AM] BlackJesus#6161
If they dont reclassify it. It'll just end up with the same tariff it had before they reclassified mine though for me

@BlackJesus As much as I hate Trump, he and his shitty tariffs have nothing to do with why your miners from China go through Customs. In fact, it started long before he was even born.

[12-Sep-18 05:44 PM] BlackJesus#6161
@ComputerGenie everything that comes through america goes through customs and he has alot to do with the tariffs we are experiencing. Don't be daft...


[12-Sep-18 07:02 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@BlackJesus I'm not sure why you're pissy over a duty fee of 0.31%, but whatever...


[12-Sep-18 07:52 PM] BlackJesus#6161
It was 27.5%

tariffs always go to the state not the damn shipping companies


[13-Sep-18 04:48 AM] BlackJesus#6161
they are beholden to the state to collect before delivery or they'd be held liable. It's the reason they request social security numbers on all international shipments.

That monitor in the top right isnt permenant I ordered a cheap monitor, because I'm taking that monitor with me to milwaukee. I got to get my old barebones rig up and running so I can portal into my parents network and control my miners from wisconsin. Moving from a celeron on it to a r5 2600


[13-Sep-18 05:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
use a dongle
like: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B074P1K5W2


[13-Sep-18 05:06 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I don't think that'll achieve my goal. I need that barebones on top to just always be on so I can teamviewer into it and have access to the LAN that my miners are operating on.


[13-Sep-18 05:09 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
It replaces the need for a monitor on any rig that you're not going to be physically at. Specifically for folks that want to use tv or ssh


[13-Sep-18 05:12 AM] BlackJesus#6161
But I honesty dont need a monitor on it. To teamviewer into my rig.


[13-Sep-18 05:12 AM] BlackJesus#6161
I'm going to be 700 miles from my operation II NEED a way to access my miners and the network they are on.


[13-Sep-18 05:14 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Which is exactly why I suggested a dongle instead of a monitor

"copy as curl" from Chrome is an easy way to OC your z9m

look at your Network requests inspector tab, press "save and apply" with default (no OC settings), then "copy as curl" and change 500 to the freq you want


[13-Sep-18 08:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
then you have a CLI command to run to change freq, better than inspect element every time üòÉ

[14-Sep-18 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
You can just take the link and use it for URL, put your address for worker and anything for password


[14-Sep-18 06:13 PM] Alright#0419
Just took a look at their site, not sure which port they'd suggest for a z9 mini


[14-Sep-18 06:14 PM] Alright#0419
I know http://pool.komodo.services/stats has an ASIC compatible port. You could just do `stratum+tcp://stratum.komodo.services:3333` for URL

@Alright  @xRobeSx thank you for the info. I got it set up last night for zcash. I'll mine that for a while and then maybe switch over and try kmd just to test it out. Looks like zec is the best financially right now. Might sell zec and just buy more kmd lol

Hello, I have a problem on a Komodo AssetChain. A miner rented about 20 Msol/s for 5 mins raising our difficulty to 1190428.129796985 (449.56 KSol/s). Our current hashrate is about 40ksol/s and now no blocks are being mined anymore by anyone according to https://call.explorer.mycapitalco.in/blocks Is there any way to low the difficulty?

[16-Sep-18 02:53 PM] Alright#0419
@adrian.marinescu if you were to make the chain some % of POS, something like that would not stall the chain

even 1% POS would prevent long stalls like that

[16-Sep-18 02:57 PM] Alright#0419
keeping hash rate on the chain

`@un Haiduc The 20 Msol/s spike was recorded on the chart`
@adrian.marinescu#0328  while that may be what you're seeing on your pool, there's more to a P2P network than just 1 node


[16-Sep-18 03:01 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328
@ComputerGenie I understand this, anyone on the network could have done this not just through our pool but now the network is stuck because of this. I want to ask you when the diff retarget would happen to restore the normal state of the network


[16-Sep-18 03:03 PM] Alright#0419
You could unstall it immediately with NH or just wait for @ComputerGenie 's minis to start finding blocks


[16-Sep-18 03:03 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
well, "normal" is going to be relative to if the 1 miner in your pool dedicates the 65k they were running  this morning or not


[16-Sep-18 03:04 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
because of that miner, I had no qualms with backing off when I did


[16-Sep-18 03:23 PM] adrian.marinescu#0328

@Alright We don't know yet, but I think someone messed up NiceHash order and that may have caused this. If so, I am sorry for his money because he haven't much CALL in this timeframe. I have his address, I don't know if it's ok to ban him or not for this

only reason I asked was because you should explain to that person what they just did

He did that through our pool, that's why I am saying this

I mined ~5k in coins and when I decided to switch back to KMD, there was in excess of 70k in his pool so I didn't think it would be an issue to drop off


[16-Sep-18 04:11 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
the still high diff is a result of the miner that then had 65+k now having less than 25k and the diff kickdown still hasn't kicked in


[16-Sep-18 04:13 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@adrian.marinescu the initial increase was **not** done through your pool and that 5 minute rental you saw in your graph was basically meaningless in the scope of what happened

Then you don't know what I am talking about. If you want I will extract all datas from the database to explain the situation with precise info. In the beginning  this guy RLp5x6vENBM16weiwYc1C9XAbWQYrivYhW connected NH for about 3 minutes with 7 Msol/s, this didn't affect much the difficulty, but after several hours same guy connected NH with 20 Msol/s for 5 minutes raising the difficulty causing the situation. Trust me, I watched the pool activity today and I think he caused this. Maybe he mistakenly placed the order to high, maybe he wanted to hurt us. I don't know exactly, but if you know this guy: RLp5x6vENBM16weiwYc1C9XAbWQYrivYhW tell him to contact us

The difficulty rose over a 1 hour-ish time period, was driven by my miners, and your pool had a minimal impact on the diff increase

https://eu1.call.pool.mycapitalco.in/workers/RQfozSZZSKsN4h2sAzzF3CMkNiF81YQuQD <- is the crux of the issue
when I decided to disconnect, that miner had in excess of 65k (which should have brought the diff down hours ago)
tbh, looking at pool stats vs find luck, either your pool's luck is really sucking or your pool's reporting is off

"waves" can only be avoided by the information I have to go on

Hey guys, I'm using the kmdminingpool and have been for a long time. Today I got way more kmd than a typical day. Is this a result of the difficulty talk mentioned above and will settle down and be okay now? It feels like the pool is on a chain fork happily mining away with low difficulty and I don't want my miners wasting time on a bad fork or something. 

Am I all set or do I need to switch pools?


[17-Sep-18 07:06 PM] Senter#6848
Looks like it stopped a few hours ago but it looks like kmdminingpool was mining every single block for almost half an hour. Really?


[17-Sep-18 07:07 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
maybe the pool hit a block that had unclaimed rewards rewards


[17-Sep-18 07:07 PM] Senter#6848
Could be. Gotta love those days...


[17-Sep-18 09:08 PM] dukeleto#7326
mining many simultaneous blocks sounds like the pool could have been mining on a fork


[17-Sep-18 09:16 PM] Senter#6848
Hey there DukeLeto, hope all's well. That's what it looked like to me. I've gotten large single mine rewards in the past, which look more like a block with unclaimed rewards (they are sweet) but this was like 25 blocks in a row where normally I'll get 2 to 4 blocks a day from the pool. Anyway, thanks for chiming in on it.


[17-Sep-18 11:23 PM] $tefano.#3560
@Senter  @dukeleto it's not on a fork .. kmd daemon crashes on main server. ( i'm investigating on it )  many simultaneous blocks are paid when main server go up again. the important is that miners set ALWAYS backup server as a second server


[17-Sep-18 11:29 PM] $tefano.#3560
if main server go down, traffic it's redirect to backup pool ( if you have set backp.miningppol.clud as second server on miner software ) that continues to work. 
The interface and payments are stopped temporary.


[17-Sep-18 11:36 PM] $tefano.#3560
maybe after 130.000 kmd paid, wallet it's too big and kmd take time to elaborate payments.
I will try to create a new wallets to speed up kmd daemon resources


[17-Sep-18 11:36 PM] $tefano.#3560
sure this will be fix of this crash
Anyway it's works very well now

@Resistor miningspeed dropped KMD over personal issues with a user of another coin that had nothing to do with KMD ü§¶


[18-Sep-18 04:21 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
As for ASIC miners, if they really want to "distribute the hashing power" in a meaningful way, then they should be solo-mining anyway


[18-Sep-18 04:46 AM] Resistor#1215
solo mining how is this done


[18-Sep-18 04:46 AM] Resistor#1215
because right now 98% of the hashrate is on one pool.. soooo


[18-Sep-18 04:46 AM] Resistor#1215
why isn't there more pools to carry kmd?


[18-Sep-18 04:49 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I can only assume that most pools don't have KMD for the same reason that KMD is market valued at ~$1 .... we live in an irrational world


[18-Sep-18 04:51 AM] Resistor#1215
I guess i'm not understanding. to eliminate double spend and 51% network attacks you're going to have to accomodate miners with a reasonable fee for one, then distribute hashing power accordingly.  is this project controlled by nicehash or something?  asic or no asic miners still want to get properly paid and distribute evenly. responsible ones anyway. nicehash is a joke

so if this guy has all the network hash solo mining on the "eco-system" why the fuck is he provoking potential buyers and investors?

Pool hashrate distribution, 12 mh/s are outside of pools but notary node prevent 51% of attack.
All altcoins should be notary node system

hashrate it's balanced


[18-Sep-18 06:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
interesting that that only shows public pools and not "unknown" or whatever to indicate solos


[18-Sep-18 06:06 AM] $tefano.#3560
because system read info of who send theirs APIs


[18-Sep-18 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it also seems very balanced


[18-Sep-18 06:08 AM] $tefano.#3560
yes balanced


[18-Sep-18 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and each of the big pools is approx like 2 to 4 notary nodes


[18-Sep-18 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
I dont see any risk exposure here, not that there really could have been due to the desing


[18-Sep-18 06:10 AM] $tefano.#3560
indeed as i said all altcoins should be notary node system


[18-Sep-18 06:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
smallest coins, by hashrate, with the slowest block intervals have the most to gain from KMD dpow

@resistor you literally could have read the white paper, or looked at KMD website or .... literally ANY KMD resource for 5 minutes and would have not only had answers to every single question asked, but also would not have appeared to be an ignorant raging lunatic.    

Jesus man, that was hard to read.   


TLDR, KMD does not need miners to be secure.   Learn about something before you mine it.


[18-Sep-18 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
we certainly dont need toxic people like that in the community


[18-Sep-18 06:44 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie yes, very specifically, Hush. When dpow on Hush starts, selfish miners will be limited to about 4 Hush blocks before hitting a notarized block. some pools are reporting selfish-mining on Hush, maybe it's you???? If it's not, you should be happy somebody else is not stealing your blocks when dpow goes live üòÉ


[18-Sep-18 07:01 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@dukeleto I'm far too lazy to do selfish mining


[18-Sep-18 07:03 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
ü§î although, it might cut down on my 7% HUSH orphan rate :trollface:


[18-Sep-18 07:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
selfish mining is like running a marathon to get to pull the lever once at the casino, and you have to run another marathon to pull it again. KMD notarization puts a time limit on how fast the selfish miner has to run the marathon, increases risk and hence the cost of selfish mining. Just another benefit of DPoW


[18-Sep-18 08:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
tbh, in the current market, I can't see how it would be cost-effective for anyone that doesn't **own** a ton of hash

how come you can't solo mine with windows. .why doesn't developer make exe file and solo mine?


[18-Sep-18 11:59 AM] xRobeSx#5136
you can solo mine on windows if you build the stratum software


[18-Sep-18 11:59 AM] xRobeSx#5136
same as linux


[18-Sep-18 11:59 AM] Resistor#1215

[18-Sep-18 11:59 AM] xRobeSx#5136
then you won't run your own stratum


[18-Sep-18 11:59 AM] Resistor#1215
why not?


[18-Sep-18 11:59 AM] xRobeSx#5136
there are miners for windows, that you can point to a pool


[18-Sep-18 12:00 PM] xRobeSx#5136
but there's not a prebuilt pool stratum for windows or linux


[18-Sep-18 12:00 PM] Resistor#1215
but i was told solo mining is more profitable

and everyone solo mines


[18-Sep-18 12:00 PM] xRobeSx#5136
if you can't build the stratum software, you probably shouldn't be running your own

they are every day..


[18-Sep-18 12:02 PM] Resistor#1215
now that the public knows they don't have to pay pool fees. they can solo mine

there was literally just a pool posted above that you can solo mine on

maybe it is worth spending $20/mo on a unix VPS to run the pool software on

there are 3 good options:

3. use the solo pool which is here: https://www.waterparkmining.com

as I said before. You really shouldn't be trying to solo mine by using a stratum pool on windows. If you can't build it and maintain it, then you should probably just go to a pool anyway. Hosting a pool isn't for consumer windows users, as you've tried to say.

"no i was told paying a pool fee is stupid so i don't want to be stupid and i'll mine myselfbut on windows" @Resistor 
I would like to explain a little concept based on who belive in a project like KMD and not only for REWARD as you said 

1% of fee on my pool is 0,03 KMD  at every block , after 100 block my earn after a year and a half is 3 KMD, about 80/90 KMD at month if pool is lucky.
i have 4 servers with dedicated infrastructure for KMD some with more than 4 cpus and 8 GB that each  that costs more than 80/90 KMD at month.
Image when kmd was at minus than 0,4$ last year with half and half of blocks found...
Without considering time to dedicate on it.

A pool fee it's just like to say "hey man thank you for your time! "

@$tefano. I was the one that told him that, and please don't take it personally, but I have strong viewpoints against the usage of pools in the modern era (especially as it concerns centralization and miners seeking pure profits with no specific regard to the coin in question).
Conversely, from the standpoint of a purely economic scale, I 1/2 hope that **everyone** else joins public pools and I can grow 1-2% faster than they can.

that is a fair port. about your growing 1-2% faster though, i offer a counter point: the time you are spending trying to set up and maintain a node is a cost. it is worth exactly 1% of total earnings assuming you match a good pool's uptime. alternatively, if you put that set up time into earning money literally any other way, you could use that money to increase your hashrate far faster


[18-Sep-18 01:05 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@waterpark setting aside the things I do as me, setting up a private solo pool takes at max 1 hour (not counting chain download time), maintaining a viable node/wallet is something we all need to do in order to secure our personal finance anyway, and the more individual nodes that exist (miners or not) is the more decentralized the network becomes/stays


[18-Sep-18 01:06 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
as far as my uptime, if I have no internet, I have no miners mining solo or in a pool


[18-Sep-18 01:07 PM] waterpark#6318
ah, i presumed your comment about pubkey coinbase tx was you working  a pool and it costing a fair amount of time


[18-Sep-18 01:07 PM] waterpark#6318
if you have the skills to get it up and running fast, go for it


[18-Sep-18 01:08 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
and for the record, a solo pool is far less complex and need-intensive than that which is required to set up and maintain a public pool, so 1% is a vast over-estimate


[18-Sep-18 01:11 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`ah, i presumed your comment about pubkey coinbase tx was you working a pool and it costing a fair amount of time`
That's where the real irony comes in about my personal views, I'm working on trying to help set up the possibility to add some of the new Komodo assetchain features into public stratums (specifically `-ac_perc`)

just use curl to overclock your z9m, no need to mess with firmware


[20-Sep-18 07:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
all they did was remove the items in the select dropdown, the backend API accepts all the same OC freq's


[20-Sep-18 07:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
for most people the GUI is going to be easier since the newer minis almost all are "weaker" than batch 1 and may take several tries to find "the" OC setting that works without fail


[20-Sep-18 08:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
or I guess you *could*  just use some generic number and *hope*  it works üòï

i tried 600 which worked fine, 650 sounded like dead zombie horses screaming, 625 worked nice, 675 was still zombie horses, so I stayed on 625. And yes, a gui is easier, but robs you of that fun of wondering "did I just brick my z9"

we're spending part of this weekend tearing every unit down and max testing each board
loads of joy fun, but in the end will stop from needing to set boards at 600 that will run fine at 675-700+ because 1 board in the unit has a "lesser" chip or 2
Hopefully, by Monday each board will be in its "optimal" range


[20-Sep-18 09:35 AM] xRobeSx#5136
that sounds like a fun project ha


[20-Sep-18 09:38 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
ballpark guesstimate is that it'll be like adding 3-5 minis for "free"


[20-Sep-18 01:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
very interesting, never thought of that possibility. I learn a lot from this channel, just sayin'


[20-Sep-18 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
The downside is that opening them is an instant warranty void, but in the grand scheme of things if they still run after a week or 2 it's fairly likely that the warranty isn't going to ever be an issue (not that they'll usually actually warranty any unit that's been running for 160 days at full overclock anyway [unless you know how to kill all of the buffer logs before you send it back])


[20-Sep-18 02:26 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
The upside is that, at scale, it makes a value tradeoff that any 1 $850 unit that would have needed warranty is offset by higher yields


[20-Sep-18 02:28 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
At scale, +10% over the life is more than worth the 2-4% loss of lifetime


[20-Sep-18 04:18 PM] bishop#9773
According to Bitmain, OCing voids the warranty anyway, not sure how they would know unless there is some sort of saved log of the frequencies


[20-Sep-18 04:24 PM] bishop#9773
...but, anyone not OCing shouldn't be mining


[20-Sep-18 07:23 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
There are several reasons not to OC when your outfit is small enough or doing it as a hobby. I haven't looked into it with the Zs, but with the Ss one could actually underclock and get a better ROI per watt than possible with overclocking.


[20-Sep-18 07:27 PM] bishop#9773
Valid point, although I think the scaling of increased hash for additional wattage with the z9s has been pretty damn impressive. Quite surprised they didn't just factory OC them and drop one of the boards personally given that it is bitmain


[20-Sep-18 07:34 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Seeing the first z9 get out of course mine are stuck on a plane that has mechanical failure for 2 days now üò≠ .  Seen they are doing balanced and turbo,  turbo is getting like 47k at 550frequency.  Saw a video with a 650 option maybe it's part of the firmware they just released?


[21-Sep-18 12:03 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Youtuber said he couldn't get 650 mode to work normally ,  not sure if he's tried new firmware yet


[21-Sep-18 06:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
you can OC by using `curl` to hit the API

it's a pure marketing pyramid scheme where they call it a "FreeCO" and give out "Free money" to the first level of the pyramid so they do work to promote the coin, making the 30% the founders get valuable. They found me via LinkedIn, so they must by scammy

Opinions from the miners here.
Just started mining with my GTX 1050 over a week ago, just for the experience. Started mining Verus coin a few days ago, using my cpu for the same reason. 

Conclusion: CPU mining Verus is a waste of electricity (for me anyway). 

GPU mining gets me a few coins @ 190 sols/s, but when I see other miners at 10,000 ¬†sols/s and higher, it seems there is a better way. 

Lately it appears that everyone is going the ASIC/Z9 mini route, making the GPU less desirable. I keep hearing how those miners could be doorstops soon because many projects may change their algos. It also makes sense that when everybody Is using an ASIC, then really nobody has an advantage. 

But that doesn‚Äôt seem to stop people from buying the Z9‚Äôs, sometimes in large amounts, like what ploycryptoblog is doing. I happen to see on craigslist in my area someone is selling 4 Z9 minis for $750/each. My question is: do you think it would be worth picking one up? My thoughts are that I‚Äôll be mining for the future and not selling anything now, so maybe this would be good for the early projects on Komodo where many would be using similar algos. I‚Äôm also thinking time is of the essence. 

With so many ASIC equipment starting to proliferate the space and new/better ones coming out (and projects changing algos), I would need to mine as much as I can now. Of course, I do wonder why is that guys selling his z9 minis in the first place?
¬†
Thoughts?


[26-Sep-18 12:19 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
My 1st though is: ' use `Enter` more often'


[26-Sep-18 12:21 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Unrelated to how much you're going to make back mining KMD... IMO its nice to have the asic for down the road coins as well. You never know when a new assetchain like PIRATE or STAKED will start up and you can get a head start mining with your mini.


[26-Sep-18 12:26 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@yorklab joke aside, my eyes aren't what they used to be, can you break the ASIC and VERUS parts down separately?


[26-Sep-18 12:40 PM] yorklab#7270
@ComputerGenie Yes, I was on the phone at work and in a hurry...I didn't like it when it posted, but had to leave so left it. Should be better now.


[26-Sep-18 12:42 PM] yorklab#7270
@xRobeSx That was my thoughts also. I've only been doing this for less than two weeks and didn't want to jump the gun without some knowledgeable input.

@ComputerGenie settings, appearance, chat font scaling...


[26-Sep-18 12:43 PM] xRobeSx#5136
Just incase there is any confusion since you mentioned VRSC at the start. VerusHash can't be mined with the asic though. So know you'll be limited to just KMD, other equihash coins, and equihash assetchains @yorklab


[26-Sep-18 12:46 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@sunk818 If you'd be so kind as to point me to the specific setting that separates a users 15 sentences into paragraphs on my end only, I'll be more than happy to toggle the setting you're talking about


[26-Sep-18 12:47 PM] yorklab#7270
@xRobeSx Yes, i do realize that, just looking at the all the variables. I am close to upgrading my old computer and thought about an amd threadripper for the cores and CPU mining and high end GPUs for other mining. I also thought about just forgetting the whole idea completely.


[26-Sep-18 12:48 PM] yorklab#7270
Just good to get different ideas from the others who are experienced


[26-Sep-18 12:49 PM] yorklab#7270
I could just decide to quit while I'm ahead.


[26-Sep-18 12:53 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@yorklab the key to answering the question is you knowing what you want long-term and if you can afford scale.
If you want some kind of in-and-out, then you'd be better off with newer GPUs to give you some "mobility" as to what you can do next. If you want to stay with a specific algo "until the wheels fall off", then ASICs will always be a good choice. If the latter, then sooner is always better.
Scale of ASICs (or any leading edge hw) is best done with the "as much as you can, as fast as you can" mentality. If it takes 2 months to reach positive ROI on deviceX and you can get 12 of them, then you can get 12 more in 2 months. If you only get 1 at a time, then your growth rate will be exponentially slower.
My personal philosophy, as cliche as it is, is "go big or go home".


[26-Sep-18 12:58 PM] yorklab#7270
@ComputerGenie I was just planning to get one and figured I could mine as much of the different coins that I can, while I can, but never planned to scale. I think you have given me very good advice. Money might be better served buying new computer equipment and mine what I can that way; and as you said, it gives me better mobility.    Thank you.

@yorklab as a plan of purely hobby-mining, the best anyone can tell you is to weigh what you feel drawn to. If I were to start today, as a personal-only thing, I'd go with an ASIC and mine KMD until the rig died. For a higher profit-minded venture, I'd use that same ASIC for ZCL.

[26-Sep-18 01:05 PM] yorklab#7270
Yes, it was just for a hobby. I figured if I can get my money back in time (even if over a years time when I might sell the coins I mined), then I'm good, because in most hobbies, you never make your money back.

[26-Sep-18 01:49 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
as far as electric, ASIC and GPU are close enough to the same for 1 unit


[26-Sep-18 01:50 PM] yorklab#7270
**`@yorklab are you calculating electricity bill?`**

No, I'm not; it's high where I live. My idea was mine now then sell down the road when value is high. Maybe it would work out, maybe not. But  I was thinking the same  as you mentioned about the computer setup @sunk818 . A computer has many uses, so can't loose really if I was going to buy anyway.

I am wondering how feasible it would be on a large scale. Say, building a solar farm for the purpose of powering miners. There would be a lot of limitations and hurdles to overcome, but I think it could be achievable

[27-Sep-18 05:25 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

as for sun, we're on a mountain top in Arkansas, sun is about as good here as anywhere in the US can be


[27-Sep-18 05:34 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Ahh fair enough. I was looking into one of the fairly big solar farms here in Aus. A local government shelled out $15 mill AUD. It will supply all of the governments energy needs in total. Sounds like a decent investment xD


[27-Sep-18 05:42 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yeah, but when you take into account what all mining needs, it gets a lot bigger and a lot more expensive.

Hey guys, yesterday i started to solo Mine KMD. I saw that the BR is 3...but i get 6.14KMD out of my First Block that i have found. How is that possible?


[30-Sep-18 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
KMD has something called active user rewards in which you can receive 5% APR on your KMD


[30-Sep-18 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
if someone has accrued rewards but does not claim it, it goes to the miner of the block in which they send a transaction


[30-Sep-18 03:21 AM] Alright#0419
typically because of ledger users

(For instance a Nvidia 1080ti gets an average of 650-680 Solutions per Second) then add up your Cards+Solutions and plug that number into:` https://whattomine.com/coins/166-zec-equihash?utf8=‚úì&hr=680&p=280&fee=0.0&cost=0.1&hcost=0.0&commit=Calculate`
`Then you can calculate your coins/profit per day for your rig.`

kmd mining with 1080ti gives 27 cents per day (not counting electricity)

I have not bought the power supply from antminer. someone suggested better to not and buy own


[30-Sep-18 09:04 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
in the sense of basic use, z9 and z9 mini are the same


[30-Sep-18 09:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes I expect that. how about the power supplies ?


[30-Sep-18 09:07 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I've used a bit of everything and in the end, a 6pin pcie is a 6pin pcie
As long as your PSU has enough wattage, it's all good

I have 2x 2450W PSUs here I could offload to someone with ASICs they are very noisy, but good efficiancy and power. 1 has 8 pin pice and one has no calbles, i was goign to make my own, but then mining turned not profitable so its all just gathering dust.

What would be recommended to someone who has never mined before but is interested in possibly starting? budget would be about $800 max currently


[01-Oct-18 07:37 AM] IP#9768
@Zach just buy the coins


[01-Oct-18 07:37 AM] IP#9768
800$ would get you quite a lot of KMD right here and right now

whats the best pool for kmd


[01-Oct-18 12:54 PM] xRobeSx#5136
"best" is hard to define. If you want a smaller pool without a bunch of miners, you can join mine:  http://pool.komodo.services


[01-Oct-18 11:46 PM] exploitURcoins#7419
how much kmd your pool making a day ?


[01-Oct-18 11:51 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
That depends on the hashrate of the miners


[01-Oct-18 11:51 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
for any pool


[01-Oct-18 11:52 PM] exploitURcoins#7419

@exploitURcoins ?

I dunno wouldn't be fair for asics to pool togeather and gpus do the same ?


[02-Oct-18 10:18 AM] exploitURcoins#7419
then gpus would still beable to get decent rewards?


[02-Oct-18 10:18 AM] exploitURcoins#7419
im new bare with me


[02-Oct-18 10:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
"fair"? hash = hash
your percentage of the overall hash doesn't change based on who you pool with
in fact, you *want* ASICs in your pool if you want to get paid on a semi regular basis (20 1080TIs that are overclocked will only find 1 block every 3-5 days)


[02-Oct-18 10:21 AM] exploitURcoins#7419
um I was in a all gpu kmd pool and got me my best daily payout of any pool I have tried for kmd


[02-Oct-18 10:21 AM] exploitURcoins#7419
getting 3-5 kmd a day


[02-Oct-18 10:23 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Then I'd love to know what this pool is, because I've not seen any such happenings since batch 1 of minis arrived


[02-Oct-18 10:23 AM] exploitURcoins#7419
well this was awile ago when I first tried kmd  its been a long time


[02-Oct-18 10:24 AM] exploitURcoins#7419
didn't think it grew this much lol

for mining, don't use a gui at all


[02-Oct-18 11:12 AM] chagidel#6952
need a node


[02-Oct-18 11:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
so, set up a node


[02-Oct-18 11:12 AM] chagidel#6952
agama as node ?


[02-Oct-18 11:13 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
gui and node are not exclusively interchangeable terms


[02-Oct-18 11:13 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Agama is a GUI that connects with the daemon, you don't need a GUI to mine (you need the daemon)


[02-Oct-18 11:15 AM] chagidel#6952
yea could only find the agama one on the komodoplatform webpage

I only just turned this miner on and it's noisey as hell!

I thaught of a few ways to utilise a building Ihave on my property, but in summer time here it would be so hot in there they would not be able to work, reqiring massive ducts and things to and from my house... to cool them, upside was free heating in winter with that system.

but t would simply never pay for iteself, so I went with a huge pile of solar panels instead, and no longer have a power bill.

If you have 2 devices that do 60db each, is the end noise 120db, or how does that work? I assume the sound is somewhat amplified but not 1:1?


[04-Oct-18 07:36 AM] jl777c#5810
db are logarithmic


[04-Oct-18 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure, but maybe 1000x adds 30db?

In the end they measure db of a container and it reads about 80db outside of the fan

of such a container


[04-Oct-18 07:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
But in the very beginning he's filming from inside such a container and it seems way louder than 80db


[04-Oct-18 07:46 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
that's kinda deceptive due to where he's holding the camera

[04-Oct-18 07:50 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
thermodynamics will cause a Z9 to be louder than 2 minis, even with the same 2 fans; heat, volume, etc.


[04-Oct-18 07:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
they need more RPMs in 1 box than 2


[04-Oct-18 07:51 AM] jl777c#5810
on  a hashrate basis it is 4x?


[04-Oct-18 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so fair compare would be 8 minis


[04-Oct-18 07:53 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
by the time you heat-spread across 8 boxes (with 8 low speed fans) it's even quieter than 2


[04-Oct-18 07:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it takes a ton of cfms to compact like that and still cool in the same range


[04-Oct-18 07:54 AM] SHossain#0007
i couldn't stand only 1 mini running in the same room where i work


[04-Oct-18 07:54 AM] SHossain#0007
they are not as loud as S9's. but, still there is a constant noise

`i couldn't stand only 1 mini running in the same room where i work`
Oddly, by comparison, I stood in front of 50 as was like "WOW, these things are feken quiet!" (compared to our S9 room)

@ComputerGenie  my NH orders look like a f-ing sawtooth... a 0,1 MSol goes from lows of 10-15 k all the way to 1 MSol...


[04-Oct-18 08:47 AM] jansako#3330
The cap is still showing as 0.1 though


[04-Oct-18 08:48 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@jansako the chart is a little wonky to interpret (especially if mining PIRATE) because of the diff and "accepted shares" are partially based on block finds and some other things
It can get complex explaining how retarded their graphs are


[04-Oct-18 08:50 AM] jansako#3330
I have another running on Zergpool (cause their Equihash profitablity is ~20% higher than the cost of the hash on NH), it does the same...

I see what you are saying though


[04-Oct-18 08:52 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
when the diff is high and there's long periods of your rental not finding a block, you'll see a ton of red and if you find multiple blocks in a row, the green will spike like double üòñ

measured the second too, and the result was same at start of second miner, then I guess it got loud by time, as more heat, more noisy fans

All BM needed to do was look at the aluminum shell to see that didn't just "Burst into Flames", that's a feken power arc.

what happens if you run it over with a steamroller, they dont cover that either?

yup bitmain is a scam. none of their miners work at all


[05-Oct-18 02:12 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
LOL I may be wrong about the lightning, but with an arc like that it's my best guess

Yea that's an arc. That's why you use surge suppressor and a lightning arrestor in your box


[05-Oct-18 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
along with the rod for the power and the in-box serge protectors, we have a 4m rod in the ground just for the racks and every rack is grounded and every miner is grounded to the rack (not just because it sit on the rack, but actually grounded)


[05-Oct-18 02:30 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Didn't think of doing that for the racks .  Are you using the fan screw for the grounding wire?  Or did you put a hole into the casing?


[05-Oct-18 02:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Selftap with ring crimp is what I'm visualizing .  Or did you do another way?

[05-Oct-18 03:29 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ok,   Was just wondering. I need to find someone that has one that can do a benchmark on tensority .  There was rumor that the architecture was better suited not sure if just because both have the word tensor in it or there is legitimacy to the claim.  I'm just curious to see how it stacks against a b3.  Currently a b3 can be found for like 100-200 dollars.  A 1070ti can match it 1080ti beat it by 50%

[08-Oct-18 07:51 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I didn't think of it when I answered, but if you go the nheqminer route and join a pool, it likely will be better than the long haul of doing solo


[08-Oct-18 07:53 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
as far as "worth doing" that's going to be entirely up to what hash you have and what profit margins you can live with

I never even thought to power multiple devices with one PSU before, to be honest. I have multiple PSU's which are under-used

[09-Oct-18 07:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am just seeing this on their site. I didn't buy a PSU in batch 3, but I did buy a batch 2 one. It seems to have enough connectors


[09-Oct-18 07:08 AM] $tefano.#3560
innosilicon VS z9 mini in italy, my experience 

price of z9 mini now is ~1024$ (psu included +  shipping + duty tax of 22%)  for 15K/h and for 300 watt
price for innosilicon is ~4504$ (psu included + shipping + duty tax of 22% ) for 52K/h and 700 watt

4 x z9 mini = 4096$ - 95$ for 1 psu because 1 psu is for 2 z9mini  =~4000$ for 60/khs and 1200watt
so 4 x z9mini are better than a 1 innosilicon with +500$ less than innosilicon, +10 k/h that is +576,22‚Ç¨ 
(1 K/s = 4000/60 = 66$ x 10K/h = 660$  => 576,22‚Ç¨  )

electricity in italy is about 0,30 cent so 500 watt a day is about 3,6‚Ç¨
436,53‚Ç¨ + 576,22 = 1012,75 / 3.6‚Ç¨ day =  ‚Ç¨ 281days 

after 281 days innosilicon is better than z9 mini


[09-Oct-18 07:09 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
whoa the speed text


[09-Oct-18 07:11 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@$tefano. I'll check the numbers later, but to start with 1 PSU runs more than 1 mini, so that number is off by $300-400+


[09-Oct-18 07:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
the description doesn't make sense to me, because I see 10 connectors on my batch 2 psu, and 6 are still free


[09-Oct-18 07:11 AM] $tefano.#3560
1 psu x 2 z9 mini with 2 connector out


[09-Oct-18 07:11 AM] $tefano.#3560
every z9 mini 4 connectors


[09-Oct-18 07:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@dukeleto there's 10 because they cord them for S9s


[09-Oct-18 07:12 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie i was wondering, since the z9m only uses 4


[09-Oct-18 07:13 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Why make a 2nd production run when you can sell more of the same?


[09-Oct-18 07:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, makes sense


[09-Oct-18 07:14 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`1 psu x 2 z9 mini with 2 connector out`
That's fine if you want to turn your nice, shiny new 1250 watt PSU into a 600 watt PSU and buy another for the next 600


[09-Oct-18 07:15 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
for me, $12 in splitters is cheaper than $110 in PSUs


[09-Oct-18 07:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
so when the new z9m comes, I read that it is best to have power off while connecting the new mini to the same PSU (1.2 gigawats?!?!?!?), so what is the preferred way to power down the asic? I've never turned it off, and all I see is a "reboot" option in their shitty web gui


[09-Oct-18 07:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
ssh in and do a `halt` ?


[09-Oct-18 07:17 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
If they don't have the loop wire on the PSUs anymore, pull the connector that goes to the control board


[09-Oct-18 07:18 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
They used to have a green loop wire that is a connector "switch"


[09-Oct-18 07:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
thanks for the info. I don't see a green loop wire on my batch2 z9m


[09-Oct-18 07:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
not on the z9, on the bm PSU


[09-Oct-18 07:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
if you have a non-bm PSU, just flip the switch üòõ


[09-Oct-18 07:21 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
pulling the power plug out of the wall works too


[09-Oct-18 07:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, love doing that üòÉ


[09-Oct-18 07:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
In theory, will connect all plugs for both z9m's to the PSU, *then* plug in PSU to wall, and then hopefully magic happens


[09-Oct-18 07:23 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes


[09-Oct-18 07:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
this one time, I filled every jumper position with spare jumpers I could find, on a 486 motherboard. The CPU smoked and caught fire when I turned it on. Guess that experience has always stuck with me

[09-Oct-18 07:54 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I'm not opposed to adding new coins, it just hasn't really been a priority for me tbh. 

I tried adding MGNX the other day, but it was having some errors, so I disabled it until I get around to figuring out what's wrong with it. 

I added CALL a few weeks back when the dev asked me and no one at all used it for like 2 weeks so I took it off for now


[09-Oct-18 07:55 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@xRobeSx Unless you're staking with the same node, there shouldn't be any MGNX issues


[09-Oct-18 07:56 AM] xRobeSx#5136
@ComputerGenie yea I used to have MGNX v1 and v2 working fine, I think its just something weird I missed between all the versions.


[09-Oct-18 07:57 AM] xRobeSx#5136
Overall my point is, no one really even uses my pool for KMD as it is. So I don't really have much interest in other coins unless people really express interest that it will be used @Mark81


[09-Oct-18 07:57 AM] Mark81#4505
Aah! Ok so you are already onto it. Yeah i think its just could be nice to have one pool for komodo ecosystems coins without any husshle to set your own pools to be able mine with gpu..


[09-Oct-18 07:57 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I haven't mined it since PIRATE went to dPoW, but the komodod from the pull the day before that worked like a dream


[09-Oct-18 08:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
other than out of mem error when staking, I don't think I ever had any issue with MGNX


[09-Oct-18 08:00 AM] xRobeSx#5136
komodod isn't the issue, it was something pool related specifically for MGNX which made me think it's something to do with the db carrying over from the v2 or whatever


[09-Oct-18 08:01 AM] xRobeSx#5136
I honestly couldn't really be bothered at the time, I simply did MGNX `enabled=False` hah

I'm considering getting a z9 or z9mini for "hobby" mining. I've never used these miners before. I've watched a bunch of youtube videos and read some websites, one question I can't find an answer to is: is it possible to use a vpn to route the data?


[10-Oct-18 06:25 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
anything is possible, but why would you want to?


[10-Oct-18 06:26 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

[11-Oct-18 04:23 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
in a month of time, depending on the CPU, you might have some luck with VRSC
beyond that, maybe pick a low diff asset chain

Nice. I hoped, but figured vrsc might already be too difficult

I did see there was a way to make a-team mine more blocks than its allowed too .. but seems a bad idea, and probably wont increse chances of getting more big blocks over external miners who can monitor mempool then switch hash for large rewards TXs


[12-Oct-18 04:57 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes if you have hashpower stand by maybe you can analyse the mempool and mine it just in time

af far as balance in wallet, that's going to be determined by when your pool pays out and how low the payment threshold is

if you only have 1 GPU and you estimate 1 per day in pool, then without pool you are looking at 256 days between blocks

"shares" are how pools determine who gets paid what (your fractional portion of the total amount of work attempted before a valid block is found by someone)

I run a few of tests I wanted to share & maybe get a little feedback:

- I found a pool that does auto-coin switch & payout in BTC.
- I put a NH order for about 30% less than the pool's listed profitability (the lower of estimated or actual)
- Once the order run out of money (usually 2-3 days, total about 24 hours hash time) I checked the results. 
- After 4 tries in 3 different pools I found that I have mined about 50% of the hash cost (a 0.005 NH order mined ~ 0.0025 BTC) Exception - I caught that megablock in zpool yesterday so at least I got my BTC back)
- Doing the same as above in a Pirate pool returned almost exactly (within 1-2 %) the expected amount of coin (Network hash/my hash x 100 x block reward x number of blocks for the order duration)


[16-Oct-18 04:55 AM] jansako#3330
On the face of it, I would expect to turn at least a small profit when buying hash  30-50% cheaper than the stated 'profitability' of the pool...

What gives?


[16-Oct-18 04:57 AM] jansako#3330
The 2 obvious answers are:
- my not understanding math, or missing something
- the pool operators misleading the miners about 'real' profitability
- NH misleading the buyers about the hashrate they actually provide - does not seem likely considering Pirate hash was repeatedly spot on


[16-Oct-18 04:58 AM] jansako#3330
Sorry for the wall!


[16-Oct-18 05:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@jansako The main thing to remember is that the hash you rented is assumed to *already be* part of the network when you run it through a calc


[16-Oct-18 05:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
So, there will always be a disparity there


[16-Oct-18 05:12 AM] jansako#3330
not sure what you mean


[16-Oct-18 05:13 AM] jansako#3330
If I am renting a 'general' Equihash hash, then directing it to a specific pool, how can that hash be in that pool before I send it there?


[16-Oct-18 05:14 AM] jansako#3330
BUT if my hash is already part of the network, then the calc based on that network hash should be more accurate, not less


[16-Oct-18 05:16 AM] jansako#3330
I was thinking of PPLNS - related losses as well cause (cheap) NH hash is unstable, so I picked pools with high hashrate that get blocks often


[16-Oct-18 05:18 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
OK, lets say you want to rent 10M sols.
When you put that 10M into a calculator, the calculator does not *add* that 10M to whatever "network hashrate" and/or the resulting "difficulty" of adding that amount of hash
If you already had that 10M running and the calc *did* account for it, there are other factors (not limited to other miners joining, luck, etc) that determine actual vs theoretical results
----
Sadly, there is no calc in the world that is accurate, and even less than that are even close when it comes to KMD (which would throw off any math of using a pool like zpool)


[16-Oct-18 05:19 AM] jansako#3330
I see the issue with renting a massive hash (especially short time)


[16-Oct-18 05:20 AM] jansako#3330
What I did was specify a max 0.1 MSol, to large pools that mine multiple coins. Usually the incoming hash to my workeds was going to 3-4 coins at the same time


[16-Oct-18 05:21 AM] jansako#3330
My hash was never more than 1-2% of the pool's hash


[16-Oct-18 05:23 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
The larger the network is will be the more any given amount is "accurate" in a calc
When swinging 100k even, coin network size can matter greatly
What all coins where these pools mining?

also 'miningpoolhub' which mostly switches between zcash, zencash or zcalssic


[16-Oct-18 05:26 AM] jansako#3330
I also tried SHA 256 which has a ton of coins & hashrate, as you can imagine


[16-Oct-18 05:28 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Specifically, a pool like zpool *can* have the opposite of intended results from time to time
If you hit a run of bad luck, it's entirely possible that you only hit blocks from low-diff coins and when you switch to the high-diff coin(s) you get nothing and then later switch back to a low-diff coin and have a share that would have been of block find diff on the high-diff coin (you may need to reread that, I don't know how else to phrase it)


[16-Oct-18 05:29 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
luck plays a huge factor in mining


[16-Oct-18 05:31 AM] jansako#3330
Understood. Need no more proof that I gotten a part of that mega block (which ended up bringing me to the expected results overall). Trouble is that  it seems to me that one was an outlier.


[16-Oct-18 05:32 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Also, if you did a run for a year, rather than a day, the result would likely be much closer to "expected" because of the law of averages


[16-Oct-18 05:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`(usually 2-3 days, total about 24 hours hash time)`
Another thing that I just thought of, it's possible that many block finds happened while you weren't submitting shares and thus you didn't get paid "fully" for that period (due to a lowered share %age)


[16-Oct-18 05:36 AM] jansako#3330
Yeah, I thought about the PPLNS thingie... figured 30% cost/proceed difference coupled with the high block frequency of a large pool would cover that


[16-Oct-18 05:36 AM] jansako#3330
I would almost have to run another test with a 'fixed order'


[16-Oct-18 05:36 AM] jansako#3330
those suckers are expensive though


[16-Oct-18 05:38 AM] jansako#3330
Or find a pool that only does PPS


[16-Oct-18 05:39 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
As near as I can tell, NH doesn't misrepresent hash by any meaningful amount.
The share-diff that they use can screw you based on a block diff actually being lower than their min diff, though


[16-Oct-18 05:39 AM] jansako#3330
Yep, it would have shown up clearly on the Pirate test for sure

Dear Miners,
I'm happy to announce that we have activated the hot suggested minimum payment feature for all our Pool coins.
This will help to alleviate the Bitcoin's inherited issue for wallet address which constantly receiving massive of flow of low-amount coins (due to mining) which in-turn affecting the wallet address'  UTXO sending out allowance.
This also can be useful if you wish to send your mine proceed directly into Exchange's wallet address, although we discourage you to do this for your own security (if don't own the private key, you are not owning the wallet).
Here's how to do it:
If you want to get paid from 20 coins, add this value into your password field of your mining software:
payfrom=20  
or any float value if you like such as:  payfrom=20.5

who got lucky?


[17-Oct-18 04:29 AM] jorian#4555
btw, it seems our dear notaries will never get those beefy rewards again, since i guess miners here can detect when such a transaction hits the mempool and increase their hashing power


[17-Oct-18 04:30 AM] jorian#4555
6 blocks in 1 minute too

[17-Oct-18 04:54 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
How exactly would you know that a big block is coming?


[17-Oct-18 04:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
you monitor the mempool


[17-Oct-18 05:43 AM] Cryptoon#3362
damn juicy block üòÆ


[17-Oct-18 05:49 AM] Alright#0419

[17-Oct-18 05:49 AM] Alright#0419
largest ever maybe?


[17-Oct-18 05:50 AM] Alright#0419
I have a feeling all these blocks lately are binance mining them themselves somehow


[17-Oct-18 05:50 AM] Alright#0419
or someone at binance knowing when they're going to happen and mining them


[17-Oct-18 05:54 AM] Alright#0419
yea that address has *a lot* of large blocks

;_;


[17-Oct-18 05:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Or someone bothered to make the script to monitor mempool?


[17-Oct-18 05:55 AM] Alright#0419
yea, but you'd need a farm pretty much


[17-Oct-18 05:55 AM] Alright#0419
NH wouldn't be able to spin up quickly enough


[17-Oct-18 05:56 AM] Alright#0419
you only have *seconds* to start hashing it after you detect it


[17-Oct-18 05:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Is it possible to find out how much the hashrate jumped during the time around that block?


[17-Oct-18 05:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
On average you should have 30 second I guess?


[17-Oct-18 05:57 AM] Alright#0419
seems they start hashing a couple blocks before it happens


[17-Oct-18 05:57 AM] Alright#0419
so they know it's about to happen before the tx is even broadcast?


[17-Oct-18 05:58 AM] Alright#0419
If I had to guess, an exchange isn't claiming rewards for tax reasons


[17-Oct-18 05:58 AM] Alright#0419
and an employee of that exchange is taking advantage of that


[17-Oct-18 06:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I thought exchanges simply werent able to claim because they had special wallets or whatever


[17-Oct-18 06:04 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Guess I thought wrong :p


[17-Oct-18 06:04 AM] Alright#0419
no, they choose not to


[17-Oct-18 06:04 AM] Alright#0419
they could use `-donation=<pubkey>` to donate it to somewhere


[17-Oct-18 06:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Would someone know if they were donating?


[17-Oct-18 06:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
If hash jumps a few blocks before then it would even be easier than just monitoring mempool?


[17-Oct-18 06:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
One could just monitor increases in hashrate by over 100% lets say


[17-Oct-18 06:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Which would mean someone is making a move?


[17-Oct-18 06:06 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I assume hashrate/difficulty is easier to monitor then mempool?


[17-Oct-18 06:07 AM] Alright#0419
ü§∑ if someone put the time in and it works, good for them


[17-Oct-18 06:07 AM] Alright#0419
am happy when I get a 10 KMD block


[17-Oct-18 06:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Sounds like a job for the genie :p


[17-Oct-18 06:12 AM] Alright#0419
Ah, I was wrong about it already mining before it happens


[17-Oct-18 06:13 AM] Alright#0419
looks like someone scripted it to just watch mempool and dump *tons* of hash on it when it detects one


[17-Oct-18 06:15 AM] Cryptoon#3362

[17-Oct-18 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
a ledger user could ramp up nicehash before he does the tx, to at least have a good chance to collect on their own. sort of a probabilistic way to claim your ledger reward

What I think is that the only reason the lemming coins are "safe" from ASICs is that BM makes all of their products to serve both comercial and hobby markets at the same time and others have followed their lead. All it will take is 1 $12k unit that uses variables and the fallacy that the "anti-ASIC" movement was founded on will crumble. The only "resistance" in equihash is the concept that RAM is expensive.

if someone had a farm(or consistent large NH orders), they could use a stratum proxy to switch their hash rate when they detect a tx that isn't claiming rewards

I use Agama wallett.


[18-Oct-18 05:21 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@…ÉrockKoli in your workername, you need to use a z address (really long and starts with `z`, as opposed to the "normal" `R`)

and that's why it doesn't work; reread my last comment


[18-Oct-18 06:38 AM] …ÉrockKoli#6597
So, the Agama wallett address is not good...?


[18-Oct-18 06:48 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@…ÉrockKoli
The Agama address that starts with `R` (called a 'transparent' or 't') cannot be used for transferring funds (and as such, cannot be used for public pool mining).
The Agama address that starts with `z` (called a 'private' or 'z') **must** be used for transferring funds (and as such, **must** be used for public pool mining).


[18-Oct-18 06:49 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
For PIRATE, anyway

Yes, is it better to go completely barebones with consumer desktop/laptop is the hash from server CPUs comparable or better than the desktop CPU ?


[18-Oct-18 02:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
laptop get better watt per hash


[18-Oct-18 02:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
lower power costs per coin, it works out to


[18-Oct-18 02:41 PM] dukeleto#7326
laptops also take up way less space


[18-Oct-18 02:42 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

[18-Oct-18 02:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
make sure to account that even tiny compact "lunchbox" desktops need to have a monitor/keyboard connected for maintenance (which always fucking happens)


[18-Oct-18 02:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
VRSC has had so many mandatory upgrades


[18-Oct-18 02:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
those old library "thin" desktops are the shiznizzle


[18-Oct-18 02:43 PM] dukeleto#7326
but laptops don't need to have monitors and laptops within cable distance/etc, they are less maintenance in that respect


[18-Oct-18 02:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am a tiny miner, but I see that the time you spend maintaining rigs is the biggest "hidden cost" that almost nobody accounts for


[18-Oct-18 02:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
I rented time on beefy AWS boxen for VRSC, when that was a reasonable thing to do. nethash is basically too high for AWS prices now

if you find something that is viable, let me know üòÉ


[18-Oct-18 02:48 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
That's why I went asic ,  just interested in spreading out into other kinds of mining.     I think CPU /GPU will have a place still in the future ,  I'm surprised no one has done a BOINC based system with a proper business model . I think we will see it in the kmd ecosystem in the next couple of years


[18-Oct-18 02:51 PM] dukeleto#7326
Right now I only have ASICs and CPU VRSC miners warming me, I like diversifying into both instead of being "all-in" with one or the other

i mined a ridiculous amount of VRSC, that is timelocked, in the 384 block days, so my perspective is warped. But VRSC is at something like 35 cents now. Not sure the math works out to buy the GPU


[18-Oct-18 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
but if you have it already


[18-Oct-18 02:55 PM] dukeleto#7326
it makes a lot of sense to point it at VRSC

I'm considering getting the vega gpus they are going pretty cheap and its replacement isn't coming out anytime soon


[18-Oct-18 02:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
i really know nothing about GPU mining VRSC, I have always done CPU solo from the beginning. It's hard to keep track of


[18-Oct-18 02:57 PM] dukeleto#7326
i5/i7's are the sweet spot for cost/hash it seems, and I like CPU mining for some reason

To start with, it'll be just znomp fork that's got changes made for KMD (and assetchains) with all of the unnecessary bits chopped out
As time goes on, I hope to finish porting ckpool from sha256 to equihash and use that

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCsa2c1IDR4 <- looks like it should give you the basics (I have not checked any of his links, so do own due diligence), from there you can just substitute "ZCash" with Komodo (and an actual KMD pool ,of course) and you're good for that
Once you get that down, hop over to #deleted-channel and someone can give you the rundown of how to get a zaddress needed for PIRATE and then it's a similar process

should be `setgenerate true 0`
no?

I started komodod with no gen params since CPU mining is waste

if they are using the same params we do, `-1` = all cpu, `0` = staking, and any other number = that many cores

it should be something like `-zpool stratum+tcp://pool-address:port -zwal z-address-for-payouts`

you won't need a password

directly from the supplier right?

My A9 has fallen off the pirate.io pool 4 times in the last 6 hours. Wondering if the problem is on my end (my internet connection sometimes fails) or if it's the pool


[20-Oct-18 03:46 PM] WeyezOD#1176
I know the pool is pretty 'saturated' now and @webworker01 might be implementing some changes so thought I'd check status here in the Discord

[21-Oct-18 03:51 AM] WeyezOD#1176
I'm checking out your pool üòÉ  I connected with port 3408 and it seems to be working. Is there an advantage of one port to another with the A9?


[21-Oct-18 03:52 AM] WeyezOD#1176
In other words, for best results, which port is preferred?


[21-Oct-18 04:01 AM] marktibosch#5960
Ok, started yesterday mining on Pirate! I use the same port for a Z9 as for a A9. Is this correct?


[21-Oct-18 04:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i think all the various equihash ASIC can use the same port, especially if their hashrate is similar


[21-Oct-18 04:03 AM] marktibosch#5960
Is there allready an exchange, so i can calculate what my earnings are?

[21-Oct-18 04:09 AM] jl777c#5810
floor price is 0.1KMD per PIRATE


[21-Oct-18 04:10 AM] TheMiningPool#9076
@WeyezOD The difference will be on high hashrates. For a single Z9 , Z9 mini or A9 you can use 3408 perfectly. If you rent at MRR or NICEHASH use the high diff port 4408 instead

what are you talking about, that is the main pool


[21-Oct-18 06:39 AM] jl777c#5810
if its hashrate is lower, it isnt finding as many blocks


[21-Oct-18 06:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
@hfaz63 that pool has seen some maintenance lately, and it's run by a trusted KMD person


[21-Oct-18 06:40 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe there are load issues, or maybe it is normal fluctutation

it obviously can't handle the load then....if you read I am not the only person having conenction issue to the pool

[21-Oct-18 08:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@hfaz63 You have to start by accepting that it's just an estimation based on that exact second
If nothing in the entire network changes for a year then you will get that amount, on an average day, ¬± a nominal difference
But that's not the world we live in
Your miner has ¬± luck
The pool you're on has ¬± luck
The other pools have ¬± luck
the block diff changes ¬± 100%
etc...


[21-Oct-18 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810

Hi all, I'm new here. Amateur question: is it possible to mine KMDs using GPU rigs? And, is it still remotely somewhat profitable assuming ive got 5k hashing power and electricity at 250USD/month? Tqvm in advance for all useful feedback and tips

@ComputerGenie i hope im getting it right. 

I have two rigs of 5 x 1070ti . 10 in total. 

And per rig it costs 120-125usd a month to run. 

So, as you can tell, im struggling to find something that is worthwhile to mine (if there's any)

@jansako thanks for sharing your personal experience with the 1070s. I thought i was doing something wrong or not managing my rigs/settings well enough. 
Anyone here has experience mining coins like siacoin? And is it worthwhile? 
Or should i just keep my rigs off for now?


[22-Oct-18 06:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@JaseOfAllTrades imo, anything "weaker" than a 1080TI should be sold off and upgraded; 2016 is over


[22-Oct-18 07:22 AM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
Got my 1070s in 2017 though. Havent got near to ROI. Oh wells......taking it as a lesson and a learning curve.

It is sad to the point of hilarity the number of people selling i9-9900k Pre-Orders on ebay and the complete lack of shame they are doing it with
ffs, there's some people selling for $1k+, they don't have it yet, and their "ad" is a ss of their Amazon order page


[22-Oct-18 09:30 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

AMD Ryzen 7 seems to be where it's at for CPU mining, unless you have too much money weighing down your pockets

i am pricing out potential VerusHash mining rigs, and my variable of interest is Cost Per MH/s


[22-Oct-18 10:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I figured since I had to wait on the GPUs that waiting on the CPU was just as well


[22-Oct-18 10:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's interesting to use that metric, interesting possibilties arise. It's not perfect, and does not take into account watt/ hash


[22-Oct-18 10:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
i think since black friday is about a month away, buying any high end CPUs right now is not a good idea, all prices will change in a month


[22-Oct-18 10:01 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
for pure mining, there's no part of me that would have went with the i9


[22-Oct-18 10:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
Ryzen 7's are fucking cheap, because threadrippers are the new hotness


[22-Oct-18 10:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
threadrippers are crazy expensive, but will give you higher hashrate and 20% less cost per hash, but double-ish the price, for cheapest threadripper


[22-Oct-18 10:04 AM] higgy#2168
@polycryptoblog i have 3 units, 6 cards each,  1 with 4x  rx570's, and 2 x  rx580's,  and two units each with 6 x rx580's only.   I do have a couple of vega64's but I'm keeping those in a different unit.

[22-Oct-18 12:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie are you willing to minimize cost per hash, no matter the price, or is there some reasonable trade-off ? I am trying to decide on a reasonable cost for each rig in a small CPU farm

@ComputerGenie my choice is complicated by the risk that higher end CPUs will have a big price decrease when new stuff comes out in a month or so, but I do use your advice as a guide. Go bigger or go home

@ComputerGenie threadrippers require newer + more expensive mobo's, and don't come with fans, I am just now learning. Increases costs more than I thought. can't use no $65 mobo on these beasts, TR4 mobo's *start* at $300

[22-Oct-18 03:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
batch 1 are stable at 700ish most people say. My batch 2 is stable at 625, and I run a batch 3 at stock because my `curl` trick no longer works there

I have 2 orders, the 'standard' one has twice the hash and half the cash remaining compared to the 'fixed' one, yet both show the same estimated time. What gives?

@jansako "remaining time" is the value of current hash cost / btc remaining

right, so I would expect the fixed order, with a larger cost remaining and less hash being used to have a longer time remaining

Fees they charge you for various operations (deposit, withdraw, 'payout' if you are selling hash) seem random to me. I am sure they are all listed somewhere on page 683 of the T&C.  Yes, I admit it is my fault for not reading up on them beforehand.


[23-Oct-18 11:44 AM] jansako#3330
Not exactly complaining, but it is one of the reasons I stopped selling hash through them as a backup for MRR.

So based on your experience, the fixed vs standard order performance is comparable? I can certainly understand that comparing two 'estimates' may not give 100% reliable results...

[23-Oct-18 11:48 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
If you "babysit" your order, standard will always be cheaper; "fixed" = you pay a premium for "set it and forget it"

[24-Oct-18 10:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie do you have advice on calculating how much to hook up to 1 PSU? I know power usage is variable and spikes sometimes


[24-Oct-18 10:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am only looking to do very low power CPU rigs, no GPU, very few if any peripherals


[24-Oct-18 10:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
i think the CPU+mobo are the biggest power users, and RAM I guess


[24-Oct-18 10:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
it seems that a 650w psu can supply at least 2 ryzen rigs, but i am not sure how much buffer to allow


[24-Oct-18 10:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
will probably have usb 3.0 HD and usb wifi adapter, that is about it


[24-Oct-18 10:24 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I usually figure out the max pull of each item and add 15% (even though most say 10%) and that's where I set the limit

i am looking to make these wire racks I have hold more mobo's, a simple placement only gives about 8 per rack, but I think I could probably make 16 work with some stacking


[24-Oct-18 10:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
at least now I know, 1 psu for 2 mobo's is viable, which really changes some statistics

look up the TDP and add 5%


[24-Oct-18 11:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
adding 5% to each **or** 15% to total
It doesn't math the same, but both seem to workout with enough overhead


[24-Oct-18 12:22 PM] dukeleto#7326
i didn't realize the ryzen 7 2700 and 2700x were actually different (65w vs 105w TDP, 3.2 vs 3.7Ghz cores)


[24-Oct-18 12:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
they are almost the same price, but power draw is a lot more on 2700x


[24-Oct-18 12:24 PM] dukeleto#7326
the 2700x doesn't come with a fan and was $10 different, thought it was the fanless model. need to read fine print

@ComputerGenie does each mobo have it's own TDP, in addition to each part?


[24-Oct-18 12:33 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
nothing really meaningfully measurable for the board itself


[24-Oct-18 12:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
ok, they don't really provide any stats in easy-to-find places


[24-Oct-18 12:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
not finding any stats for TDP of ddr4 ram, which is probably low (i guess the +15% at the end accounts for small stuff)


[24-Oct-18 12:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
the CPU seems like 80% of the total TDP, other draws will be cpu fan + 2 usb sticks, pretty small power draw


[24-Oct-18 12:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
65w for CPU + 20% for everything else + 15% safety buffer is 89.7w, pretty amazingly low


[24-Oct-18 12:40 PM] dukeleto#7326

you only get 4 2700x's on that same psu


[24-Oct-18 12:42 PM] dukeleto#7326
or else you need a 1000w psu to do 7 2700x's

not sure how viable it is to split cables to so many machines, i am shooting for 4 rigs per 1 psu


[24-Oct-18 12:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
which fits nicely, 4 rigs per shelf, 4 shelfs per rack. which gives 4 psu's and 16 rigs on a single rack

@wookie for some reason the TLS negotiation is choosing SSLv3, which is usually turned off or disabled for security, it shouldn't be using that


[24-Oct-18 04:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
at compile time, a binary can link to different ssl libraries locally, which could effect how it tries to negotiate with a remote server

most likely, the code that works does not try to use sslv3, which is a security hazard

@dukeleto, you mentioned earlier VRSC can be mined using GPUs. Could you point me in the right direction in mining pools for this? It's the coin for Verus that is on the Komodo tech right....?

Hey guys I have a MSI AMD R9 390 and I wanted to know what the best setting for the afterburner to use less power but still function efficiently cheers in advance


[26-Oct-18 04:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That's a hard question, each card performs differently. My advice would be to google some settings based on your card type, and then adjust the settings, check if it's stable and repeat until you're happy. I'm sure there are some specs out there for that card

[26-Oct-18 03:36 PM] Hypocalese#3688
@polycryptoblog   Go to a Class B subnet

192.168.1.1-255


[26-Oct-18 03:38 PM] Hypocalese#3688
you will get more broadcast addresses that way but that works too


[26-Oct-18 03:39 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's generally easier for new folks to understand than subnetting, in my experience


[26-Oct-18 03:40 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
How to do that?  Do I just change subnet and make all the miners have static up in the miner config screen?   I was tinkering with router ,  made  subnet mask there 255.255.255.0  but didn't do what I wanted

255.255.255.0 in the router


[26-Oct-18 04:54 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Hypocalese is it an `-ac_staked` chain?

yes


[26-Oct-18 05:26 PM] Hypocalese#3688

does it matter at this point?


[26-Oct-18 05:49 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
do you have any nodes that are trying to stake (`setgenerate true 0` or `-genproclimit=0`)?


[26-Oct-18 05:50 PM] Hypocalese#3688
3 nodes genproclimit -1


[26-Oct-18 05:50 PM] Hypocalese#3688
1 node genproclimit 2


[26-Oct-18 05:51 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
well, that's the issue then
You told the chain "I want an average of 50% of the blocks to be PoS and 50% of the blocks to be PoW" and then you did no PoS, so the diff is massivly high to allow PoS stakers to stake


[26-Oct-18 05:52 PM] Hypocalese#3688
Ah now that you are explaining it makes sense.  I didnt know setgenerate true 0 was for staking

the higher you push the freq is the higher that will climb, it's safe to ignore unless it climbs to a point where you're producing measurably  significant number of errors

After 3 hours without problem he switch into green light and red light. I can't connect on web page and ssh too. Someone with the same issue ? What can I do ?

@Lox3ur running a batch3 like it's a batch1 doesn't sound prudent. My batch3 needs constant babysitting, even without overclocking. It sits next to a batch1 OC'ed to 625 that has no issues so far

[30-Oct-18 01:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
batch 1 are the highest QA boards, batch 2 and 3 are lesser quality. which is why they took away GUI way to OC in batch2 + batch3

Yep - 4x the revenues for a month mean they essentially paid for them selves in about 6 weeks.
Im not sad I made my large order in batch 2, because I haven't done the math on what my positive would have been by paying 2x the price for them earlier.

I'd recommend a Z9 mini, it is a bit above your price range ($750 USD plus postage) but it is your best bet.


[02-Nov-18 09:37 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I don't think they are making minis anymore


[02-Nov-18 09:45 PM] Seek#0355
ok thanks


[02-Nov-18 09:45 PM] Seek#0355
if mini isnt available whats the next best one i can try


[02-Nov-18 09:46 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Oh is that right? What are they selling now? I think the full Z9 but that is a lot more expensive.


[03-Nov-18 02:29 AM] jansako#3330
He can always buy a second hand mini... the prices are very different based on the location though

@Ric of Ric & Ric yes, or by simply using browser edits, but they tend to be "hit and miss" as to stability when overclocked (so that's why I assumed B1)

@ComputerGenie this custom z9 firmware looks cool, you can set a custom hashrate for each hashboard: https://releases.broked.net/


[04-Nov-18 10:32 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's possible to overclock batch 3 z9 mini's via `ssh`, at least to 550. More requires binary patching the `cgminer` binary :abusedsmily:


[04-Nov-18 10:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
```ssh to miner.
edit /config/cgminer.conf
see bitmain-freq in config file, change value.
save file.
"/etc/init.d/cgminer.sh restart"```


[04-Nov-18 10:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
values more than 550 will be ignored, but hey, free 10% OC, I'll take it


[04-Nov-18 10:33 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'll pass on 3.5% of my hashrate going to someone else


[04-Nov-18 10:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie i didn't see that üòÉ


[04-Nov-18 10:34 PM] dukeleto#7326
but if you can OC 30% more, paying somebody 3.5% makes sense


[04-Nov-18 10:34 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`Please note that this firmware is "free", but does include a small developer fee consisting of 10 minutes of developer mining time for every 280 minutes of regular mining. The exception to this is when the miner is first started, it will mine for the user for 10 minutes, and then developer for 10, at which point it will cycle 280minutes user, 10 minutes developer.`


[04-Nov-18 10:35 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
` OC 30% more,` only applies if you have 1 bad board


[04-Nov-18 10:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
these are for late batch z9's


[04-Nov-18 10:35 PM] dukeleto#7326
that can't be overclocked


[04-Nov-18 10:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's hard to keep track of all the sheisty stuff Bitmain is doing


[04-Nov-18 10:36 PM] dukeleto#7326
later z9+z9m have a hardcoded limit of 550 in the cgminer binary


[04-Nov-18 10:37 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I wouldn't call any of it "sheisty" other than cherry-picking chips for B1


[04-Nov-18 10:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
maybe you know all this, I am just trying to OC my little batch3 z9m


[04-Nov-18 10:37 PM] dukeleto#7326
10% OC for reading bitcointalk for 10 minutes, I will call that a win


[04-Nov-18 10:38 PM] dukeleto#7326
it doesn't seem hard to binary patch `550` to `650`, just one character binary patch, right????


[04-Nov-18 10:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
kind of doubt my batch 3 will be stable at much higher than 550, i am sure they chose that for a reason

What‚Äôs the 500W here? How long do they mention in general

in the equihash realm, I'd suggest an ASIC fro KMD and any other 200,9 coin and a 2080 or 2080TI for any other equihash coin

[05-Nov-18 02:15 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
if you get one of the new 2080s and use it on one of the non200,9 coins, you could likely make a decent profit, but ASIC dominate the 200,9 coins

the equihash algo has variables (K & N) and 200,9 are the "standard" and some coins use other numbers

Hi all, just trying to get started "miner --algo ??? --server stratum.piratepool.io --port 2095 --user zAddressHere.Rig1 --pass x --fee 0 --intensity 50" wondering what I need to put in the algo field? I'm currently testing with ccminer


[05-Nov-18 08:27 PM] Tronodisc#3942
After seeing the few posts above mine I can see 200/9, so thinking I need to add 200_9 but was looking for confirmation on this or what others are using that works


[05-Nov-18 08:30 PM] Tronodisc#3942
Just tried and 200_9 fails for me...tried 192_7 earlier and it at least runs but I can't see any shares or immature after I'd left it to run for 20mins or so


[05-Nov-18 09:07 PM] Tronodisc#3942
Is anyone there?

@ComputerGenie  
I have an idea, and I wonder if its possible, or why stratums work the way they do... 
Is not a pool only required to calcualte a PoW? So why does a stratum build blocks ? It seems to do things, like mine a % of block rewards to CC contacts, and such that what we want a pool to do... is calcualte the PoW solution and submit it tothe daemon... and let the built in miner code do everything else. 
It seems that 99% of pool issues disapear if we simply dont  let the stratum build the block.

cool as .. .jame went and did my next task earlier so Im looking for something eles ...

`we need ability to have cc vouts in coinbase eventually`
And for that, we need to do what I've been saying for a feken year now: ditch znomp and make something that's actually for Komodo

I thaught that by changing the conesneus rule to use ExtractDestination (so address instead of scriptpubkey/pubkey hash etc) I could mine block rewards to a CC contract... but if they are not a cc vout .. then they coins are just lost, as the contract cant use them ..

makign the daemon build a block containing a CC vout is pie ...

but a pool can simpy never work with it, as it cant build the same vout .. .and even if it could... it wound tneessarily ahve the right data avalibe to build the right tx

leaving the ONLY solution in my mind... have the pool not build the block at all

`makign the daemon build a block containing a CC vout is pie`
If the daemon can build it, them it has a template to build from and a pool can follow that template
the issue isn't in execution, the issue is in execution **in znomp**

znomp uses a feked up library that I don't understand and is abandoned, making it work with something newer/better is totally doable; the issue has always been making it backwards compatible with existing znomp pools

Going to ahve a go at this... I found where it builds the coinbase ... because of -pubkey


[10-Nov-18 09:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
the correct address can be set just by starting your KMD daemon with -pubkey


[10-Nov-18 09:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
and the coinbase is already set the pool address


[10-Nov-18 09:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
so all thats required is to get the coinbae tx given in getblocktemplate


[10-Nov-18 09:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
and subsitutre the entire function that builds hte coinbase

yes, but the stratum ois stupid .. and builds the coinbase itself


[10-Nov-18 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810

It seems the only reason the pool builds the coinbase and ignores hte one sent to it via `getblocktemplate` is to add its own fees and address

using -pubkey make sthe block template use the correct address


[10-Nov-18 09:34 AM] Deleted User#0000

Doesnt seem hard .. once I work out how to make the statum [rint things to console, I can just pass the 0 tx directly to it, isntead of calling the tx building function.


[10-Nov-18 09:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`It seems the only reason the pool builds the coinbase and ignores hte one sent to it via getblocktemplate is to add its own fees and address`
mostly true, but because that bit was added, it will fail if you try to use as template provides for any "non-standard" cb tx (because, buffers)


[10-Nov-18 09:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
or at least as to the pubkey cb tx


[10-Nov-18 09:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
*I think* that just having this: 
this.genTx = transactions.createGeneration(rpcData.height, blockReward, this.rewardFees, recipients, poolAddress, coin).toString('hex');
return the first tx in getblocktemplate it will just work for any coinbase built by the daemon

the hex its building there, is already in the template ... as long as -pubkey is set to the pools address ... it will pay to the pool,a nd the payment processor cna work as normal.. .I think ...


[10-Nov-18 09:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
although not 100% sure how the payment processor works out how much it gets.. assume it just gets the balance of the tx it receives as coinbase on the payment processor side of things, and has nothign to do with the block it submits.


[10-Nov-18 09:42 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`the hex its building there, is already in the template ... as long as -pubkey is set to the pools address ... it will pay to the pool,a nd the payment processor cna work as normal.. .I think ...`
That would require a rewrite of the payments and more redis entries....


[10-Nov-18 09:43 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
not saying that's "good" or "bad", just saying that if you don't separate in cb, then the pool will have to keep track later


[10-Nov-18 09:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
The pool doesnt use incoming txs to its address to determine its balance ?

I had to disable the treatment of the coinbase as a "specical" transaction in teh daemon ... Now all that happens is the stratum receives the block, and adds the PoW then submits it back to the daemon as received.

I need to make it an option I think rather than a hardcoded change... then I might need some help from either you or @webworker01  to make the pool have a definable parameter to use it.


[10-Nov-18 01:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
For CC chains, using speical coinbases, just set an option to true? the relavent things passed from the pool are:
`{"method":"getblocktemplate","params":[{"capabilities":["coinbasetxn","workid","coinbase/append"]}],"id":1541885661086}`
I think we just need to change capabilities or "mode" to a new mode.

that will just pass the coinabse as a starndard tx... then in the pool all you need to do is somehow take a parmeter that tells it to pass that mode to the daemon, and disable the creation of coinbase (and the calc of merkle root including its created tx)

and he daemone must be using -pubkey. You can set it with `setpubkey` RPC from the pool iteslf if you like, so it uses the correct pool address from the config files.


[10-Nov-18 02:45 PM] Deleted User#0000
Although you would need to convert the address to pubkey first, however, the pool already calls validate address, so you probably have this somwhere.

`Thanks a lot if you can figure this out.`
@Deleted User maybe post a doc somewhere of exactly what you're wanting? (preferably without something you've started with a custom daemon)


[10-Nov-18 02:58 PM] Deleted User#0000
All u need is an option to make the pool use that template.. The commit shows which code in the pool needs to be removed to make the template work


[10-Nov-18 02:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
It's backwards compatible so can be merged  to kmd without issues

`to make the pool use that template.` That's my point, short of using your custom daemon I have no idea (nor will anyone else) what "that template" is...

The only thing that changing any Equihash K&N values will ever do as far as making any coin "ASIC resistant" is change the RAM requirements of any given ASIC.
If there is enough demand, someone will make a 20GB RAM ASIC with variable K,N, and pers values and remove any such "resistance"
All of the valued Komodo assetchains (including PIRATE) have 51% resistance (which is the real requirement) due to dPoW and none of them have any need to make changes to the algo that are cumbersome to users and/or remove the ability to have some miners even be able to mine them.

Just have some silly code left to make sure the correct -pubkey is set in the daemon, as if the pools addres != the -pubkey address the pool wont receive any payments.

I had a good look and it seems you need the private key... being a poo;l the private key should not be imported to the main daemon for preformance reasons


[11-Nov-18 05:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
It currently does getinfo to get he pubkey, if that doesnt work, it does validate address on the pool address

if both return nothing it fails to start

ExtractDestination will turn any scriptpubkey to an address.. .os you can blacklist or whitelist address's... and you can fitter vouts under a size ... whatever you want

[11-Nov-18 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
```-mintxvalue=<amount in sats>
This defualts to 1 coin, how it works is:
-- takes all the vouts in a transaction and counts which ones are to the notary nodes address (set with -pubkey=) 
-- Adds the value of these together (total in sats) try sending heaps of vouts to make a really large tx value and see if it crashes it?
-- Divides by the number of vouts, 
-- if the amount is less than this number the transacion is ignored, not added to wallet. This filter does not work with -rescan or importprivkey(?) so you can add them to wallet by doing a rescan if you need to.
-> if this number is 0, the wallet accetpts NO transactions ... once a notary is funded, likely this should be the setting you use. Only allowing to send from yourself, for iguana utxo split txs.


-whitelistaddress=RTVti13NP4eeeZaCCmQxc2bnPdHxCJFP9x
-- Set this along with -pubkey= to a valid staked notary, and it will let all txs from this address into the wallet, even if mintxvalue is set to 0.```

if you can go from address to pubkey, you just destroyed crypto as we know it as both rmd160 and sha256 have to be broken

The speed of the order doesn't impact cost; you pay per valid share

there is a setting that shows 'speed paying', and 'speed at pool', the second can be higher

at least it appears to be so, not sure of they 'reconcile' this eventually?

there's a dozen reasons that the 2 numbers will never match


[13-Nov-18 02:01 AM] jansako#3330
right, so you don't think the bot 'asking' for a large hashrate, then suddenly dropping the order speed would get soem free hash? (yes, I know you said 'paid for hash delivered')?


[13-Nov-18 02:01 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
"speed" is a thing that isn't actually measured, it's estimated
different layers estimate differently


[13-Nov-18 02:02 AM] jansako#3330
OK, so they just count shares, then do a calculation for shares over time to get an estimated 'hash speed' number?


[13-Nov-18 02:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
sort of
at *x* difficulty, it should take *y* time to produce *z* hash
Based on that, hash is guessed at


[13-Nov-18 02:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

whats with redis ... it somehow let me start 2 instances on the same port on my second pool... Ijust mined with 1.2msol on a pool to test fee and it never paid out ... never errored nothing... just didnt add any shares ...

if it didn't pay out, it's because you didn't tell it to pay out. redis has nothing to do with that

no probs just let me find the miner you need for Nvidia


[15-Nov-18 06:23 AM] Paul#0981
So you're saying I can mine 1 ARRR a day.


[15-Nov-18 06:23 AM] mrlynch#5735
1060 3gb pulls about 300 sols


[15-Nov-18 06:23 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
i dont really know what a 1060 will get you but if a 1080ti get 1 a day you will get less


[15-Nov-18 06:24 AM] mrlynch#5735
Power consumption is around 100w


[15-Nov-18 06:24 AM] mrlynch#5735
You might get 330sols if you oc it


[15-Nov-18 06:24 AM] mrlynch#5735
Use ebwf miner for nvidia cards

You're looking at 0.95 ARRR per day with current difficulty


[15-Nov-18 06:27 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
it is handy to learn as more new coins will be coming so its worth leanring


[15-Nov-18 06:27 AM] mrlynch#5735
But that oscilates so realistically it's more like 0.7

[15-Nov-18 06:28 AM] Paul#0981
same way for ARRR?


[15-Nov-18 06:29 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
the process is the same. once you learn to set up the miner its just a case of changing a pool url and port number for each coin that you want to mine


[15-Nov-18 06:29 AM] mrlynch#5735
If you want to mine arrr while the block reward is still 256, it will halve in about 3-4 months(correct if i'm wrong, don't have the data at hand) you're better off buying asics

How do I get started mining? Asic vs gpu  or should I rent? where to rent for specific coins? anyone have a link?


[17-Nov-18 06:21 PM] DG#6934
For Komodo assetchains Asic will get you a better performance.  People are using nicehash.com and also miningrigrentals.com the configuration for each coin is different because are running in different IPS.


[17-Nov-18 07:01 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
` or should I rent? ` If you ever have to ask that question, the answer is "no". Only rent when you know why you're renting, you've done the math, and you know that it's your best option.

[18-Nov-18 10:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
i have a very similar ASUS MB to that, which I can remove the only graphics card, and it boots just fine (this is a CPU mining rig)


[18-Nov-18 10:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
also, on a scale from 1 to 10, how bad is it to remove a GPU from a running MB? Asking for a friend


[18-Nov-18 11:03 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I don't want to sound stupid but it has onboard graphics no?  The HDMI port would indicate it should be able to fire up.


[18-Nov-18 11:04 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I would tell your friend NOT to remove the graphics card from a running MB... as a standard of good practice.  

Can he/she?  Sure.   
Will problems arise?   I don't know, you'd have to google that.

Others, they get stuck at boot. Like they are waiting for a keypress or something. it's a common problem I am seeing on forums


[18-Nov-18 11:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
those "headless" display things above, trick the bios into thinking there is a GPU attached


[18-Nov-18 11:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
I guess my point being, with an HDMI port like that, there's got to be a setting for booting from onboard graphics.  Perhaps its through disabling the PCIE slots


[18-Nov-18 11:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
fucking BIOS'es are too smart


[18-Nov-18 11:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
And if they are disabled, they'll boot from onboard or processor.


[18-Nov-18 11:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
@FishyGuts you would think so, but most MB's only support intel onboard graphics


[18-Nov-18 11:07 AM] FishyGuts#5085
..... good point.


[18-Nov-18 11:07 AM] dukeleto#7326

_uses these in his rigs:_ https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XSY9THQ (or you can use an old HDMI cable and solder in a diode and make your own)


[18-Nov-18 12:45 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
P.S. they don't "trick the bios into thinking there is a GPU attached", they plug into GPU0 and "trick the bios into thinking there is a __monitor__ attached"


[18-Nov-18 02:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie so I am trying to understand why some MB's will allow booting with no GPU installed, some don't, and what that is called. I seem to get the BIOS post, and fan LEDs come on, but it gets stuck on the bios when no GPU is installed. Put a GPU in, it will boot just fine, regardless of monitor being attached, such that I can ssh in


[18-Nov-18 02:14 PM] dukeleto#7326
with this MB and a ryzen 2700X, you can remove the GPU and it boots just fine: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07FKV5HWJ/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o07_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1


[18-Nov-18 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
my end goal is not not have any graphics card installed at all, so these hdmi "fakers" are not really what I am looking for, unless I can plug them directly into the MB HDMI slot to get it to boot


[18-Nov-18 02:41 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@dukeleto it's not a "setting" change when you use a CPU that has "onboard" graphics
Every system has to have *something*, that board uses:
`Graphic
Integrated in the AMD Ryzen‚Ñ¢ with Radeon‚Ñ¢ Vega Graphics Processors `
It's in the CPU and that board supports it


[18-Nov-18 02:56 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'm not quite sure what you think you're after (or at least as you explain it) is even a thing


[18-Nov-18 03:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie what I am after, is a rig that will boot with no graphics card at all, and be a CPU miner, with ssh access. I have accomplished that with the ASUS MB, and thought I could do the same with this "better" MSI board


[18-Nov-18 03:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
I use a GPU to install/setup the rig, then turn off, remove GPU, restart and then maintain via ssh


[18-Nov-18 03:06 PM] dukeleto#7326
Ubuntu 18.04 . Works fine, if the BIOS lets you do it. I didn't think integrated graphics mattered if I am not trying to use any graphics


[18-Nov-18 03:07 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am using Ryzen 2700's (X and not)


[18-Nov-18 03:07 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`what I am after, is a rig that will boot with no graphics card at all, and be a CPU miner`
Then you need:
a) a CPU with integrated graphics
or
b) a motherboard with integrated graphics

[18-Nov-18 03:11 PM] dukeleto#7326
i am missing the feature difference that allows the ASUS to boot with no GPU but the MSI won't. Perhaps a bios update would change something


[18-Nov-18 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
the 450 is supposedly a superior MB to the 350, more compatible with 2nd gen Ryzen's/etc


[18-Nov-18 03:12 PM] dukeleto#7326
but maybe not


[18-Nov-18 03:15 PM] dukeleto#7326

the MSI doesn't work if you plug a monitor into it?


[18-Nov-18 03:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
everything works if a graphics card is plugged into a PCIe slot


[18-Nov-18 03:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
what I want is to have many many rigs, and only a few GPUs for maintenance/etc. I don't want to have 1 GPU per rig


[18-Nov-18 03:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
it seems to POST the BIOS without a graphics card, but gets stuck in bios-land


[18-Nov-18 03:17 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
If you plug a monitor into the onboard slot of the MSI, does it work?

Think I figured it out ... seems you need to use the percentage OC rather than the clocks... Card seems overvolted from factory, so just rais powerlimit and then bump it by 1% at a time until it stops wokring ... I think it will cap out at about 1700MH/s VerusHash @ ~350w

Guys, I need help. Now my friend wants to mine the Pirates, but he has an Nvidia GPU. Does anyone know which miner program is better suited for this?

I'd recommend EWBF's miner. Link and setup configuration are on that page :)

Sure is, this is pulled straight from the #pirate chanel.

Since we have no dev fund or premine, this will help tremendously.

@bishop what batch and what price?


[25-Nov-18 03:42 PM] bishop#9773
Batch 2 w/ B1 firmware, was thinking around $570ish in crypto since they are still going for $650 and up on ebay. Figured I would see if anyone had interest here before throwing up there.


[25-Nov-18 03:42 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
so, like 300 KMD?

they are about pointless A9s use a fraction of the electric per sol


[25-Nov-18 03:46 PM] bishop#9773

I wouldn't expect anyone other than hobbyist to be taking the ten units I am interested in parting ways with


[25-Nov-18 03:47 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
At a non-depressed market, you're asking 2/3rds the price of an A9 for 1/5th the sol rate üôÑ

Lower clocks though right ? Mine is at 4.2Ghz 24/7 it can go heaps higher, but my mother board sucks ... 1.35v directly to 1.4v gets too hot


[26-Nov-18 07:40 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I think most of them are seeing stable OC as high as 4.1 @ 1.35-4, so other than cooling it's a fairly level field to compare against

Wait for the next gen chips... I looked into them a bit, very new idea, 14nm SoC and then they use 7nm "chiplets" which are a CPU processing core, seperate dies, so they can just keep glueing on more chiplets, the next EPYC server chip is 64 cores 128 threads, and that'd the first gen chip, it won't be long until we start to see 256 core CPUs IMO.

[28-Nov-18 12:40 AM] jl777c#5810
why not use CPU for all mining? CPU can be used with a lot more things than GPU


[28-Nov-18 12:40 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case if you are mining, arent you using the hardware at 100% (or overclocked?), so what does it matter what else it could be doing?


[28-Nov-18 12:41 AM] jl777c#5810
if ASIC uses less power and you recoup its cost while mining, you can use it as a heater or a doorstop, who cares?


[28-Nov-18 12:41 AM] gzezo#2697
You can use it also for non crypto related, if market crash you can still sell your GPU to gamers, you can use it for AI,machine learning, rendering ...


[28-Nov-18 12:41 AM] jl777c#5810
why to be 30x less efficient using GPU, just because you can play games at high resolution with GPU after it isnt profitable to mine with anymore


[28-Nov-18 12:42 AM] jl777c#5810
if mining is about the profit, it should be about the profit. just assign a resale value of $0 for ASIC and really how much will you get for a GPU after years of overclocked mining with it?

@gzezo your argument would have a bit more weight if you are talking about just the GPU a gamer would use for playing games, but if we go into the realm of havng more GPU than you can use for mining, then it is all about the economics, the resale value, the electric costs, the amount of coins mined. Since ASIC are now less expensive than GPU and with more manufacturers, there is no valid argument about GPU being more decentralized. also, how to explain hashpower rentals. that seems quite available to everyone.


[28-Nov-18 12:45 AM] jl777c#5810
mining with GPU nowadays is like mining with CPU


[28-Nov-18 12:46 AM] jl777c#5810
almost exactly


[28-Nov-18 12:46 AM] jl777c#5810
CPU is more available, can do more things, etc.


[28-Nov-18 12:47 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, verushash is not having an ASIC yet, so just mine it until the ASIC come out for it


[28-Nov-18 12:48 AM] gzezo#2697
Yeah I like CPU and GPU equally, on ASIC I like that it's like a math you are using the strongest tech technologically possible, but don't like that bitmain with biggest market share mines coins alone before releasing asic to public


[28-Nov-18 12:51 AM] gzezo#2697
Also, you might buy GPU in about any store possibly doing purchase anonymously

What is happening is that Komodo is allowing assetchains to choose what algorithm to implement. Komodo itself is continuing to use equihash. 
I understand why you ask this question, there was some ambiguity in the announcement made.

We were discussing with our main advisor @jl777c and other founding members about the mining of Marmara coin. It will use some Verus features in new Komodo fork. It will be a Verushash mineable coin with 50 % staking and 50 % of all blocks is planned to be timelocked between 3 months and 2 years. If decided, this 50%- timelock feature will be permanent policy. What would  a mining operator say about this? How would mining community and other users react to this? We are trying to find an optimum and just solution. Opinions?


[01-Dec-18 02:50 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
_is not a fan of mining out of pocket for `between 3 months and 2 years`_


[01-Dec-18 02:59 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@ComputerGenie thanks. Is it for miner, or pool operator or both?


[01-Dec-18 03:00 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
And What percentage would be ok?


[01-Dec-18 03:01 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
both
Getting folks to join a pool is hard enough, but when you add "I can't pay you" to that, the coin itself has to have a unique draw like Verus itself does


[01-Dec-18 03:02 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
@ComputerGenie What do you mean by unique draw?


[01-Dec-18 03:06 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Verus is/was a totally unique thing that "everyone" wanted in on early
In order to sustain miners with timelocked rewards, you have to be unique enough to make them want to stop mining VRSC (or whatever else) and not get paid
While it's easier with CPU algo than GPU/ASIC, time and money are what they are


[01-Dec-18 03:18 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Marmara will also use Verushash and timelocked coins. Besides it will have 50% Verus staking. Those features are coming with new Komodo fork to Komodo.

50% staking sounds great until one realizes that they have to wait out the timelock before they can stake (which actually means it's 100% mining for the 1st 3 months or up to 2 years)

@mrlynch it depends on what you're looking for and/or how much work you're willing to put into it


[01-Dec-18 04:38 AM] mrlynch#5735
I'm looking for something that allows me to monitor the temps of the miners and be able to switch pools easily

[01-Dec-18 04:39 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I really like https://github.com/cryptoGlance/cryptoGlance-web-app, but it's an old repo and some of the things need manual edits to work with newer miners


[01-Dec-18 04:40 AM] SHossain#0007

[01-Dec-18 06:16 AM] jorian#4555
if i remember correctly, VRSC didn't have timelocked blocks right from the start


[01-Dec-18 06:29 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yeah, that's what I mean, it's hard enough to get miners interested in a "new thing", but nearly impossible when they can do nothing with any of it for a time
(imo) locking from the start = only "rich" miners and "insiders" will do anything for quite a while


[01-Dec-18 06:32 AM] jorian#4555
what is the main reason for having timelocked blocks? why did VRSC do it?


[01-Dec-18 06:33 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
no sure I ever understood any reason for doing it


[01-Dec-18 07:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
to prevent early devs/miners/speculators from dumping on the market, I think was miket's motivation


[01-Dec-18 07:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
@B. G√ºltekin √áetiner timelocked blocks basically mean pools will not exist until time-locked blocks end


[01-Dec-18 07:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
most miners dislike timelocked blocks, I would venture to say

[01-Dec-18 06:03 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
If you're on a nomp, it can sometimes say that, I don't believe it would actually be assigning a negative value though. It's most likely assigning the positive value of whatever is shown


[01-Dec-18 06:07 PM] mrlynch#5735
oh... ok... everything seems fine though... must be the pool then front end then


[01-Dec-18 06:09 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I've seen what you're talking about and the number shown (say -209000) is actually assigning 209000 as the difficulty.


[01-Dec-18 06:09 PM] NutellaLicka#4241

@here The first KMD public pool to be Sapling ready will get a 100 KMD bounty from me and 1000 KMD bounty from jl777.
Requirements: You need sapling specific pool code and release the source for community.
The komodod binaries need to be compiled from **FSM** branch of https://github.com/PirateNetwork/komodo repo specifically. and the chain param is 
```
./komodod -ac_name=SPLTEST -ac_supply=5555555 -ac_reward=10000000000000 -ac_cc=2 -addressindex=1 -spentindex=1 -addnode=54.36.126.42 -addnode=94.130.224.11 &

**FSM** branch of PirateNetwork repo for the above chain


[03-Dec-18 12:30 PM] SHossain#0007
the above chain has already sapling activated and works like KMD.


[03-Dec-18 12:30 PM] SHossain#0007
so, would be a good test on SPLTEST chain

for test, you only need the FSM branch of https://github.com/PirateNetwork/komodo to be used with SPLTEST chain

You can try my stratum, which just takes no fee and usues the coinbase from the daemon :trollface:

@REWik if my CPU can mine without errors and your pool can't then your pool is malforming the block


[03-Dec-18 04:28 PM] SHossain#0007
can you guys pelase test the transition as well? just start a new chain with the following params changed in `~/komodo/src/komodo_defs.h` file
```
#define KOMODO_SAPLING_ACTIVATION 1543073054 // Sat, 24 Nov 2018 15:24:14 GMT
#define KOMODO_SAPLING_DEADLINE 1543593600 // Fri, 30 Nov 2018 16:00:00 GMT
```
change the activation time 12-24 hours in the future in a new chain.


[03-Dec-18 04:29 PM] SHossain#0007
deadline also another 12-24 hours in future after activation


[03-Dec-18 04:29 PM] SHossain#0007
so, we can be sure that the transition is smooth and doesn't stall the chain


[03-Dec-18 04:30 PM] SHossain#0007
you can use any branch except master from jl777/komodo

You just use -pubkey and block template


[03-Dec-18 05:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
its the same as get work


[03-Dec-18 05:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
I alrady did it


[03-Dec-18 05:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
and my ZEX pool has been running for weeks.. never even loged in to it.


[03-Dec-18 05:51 PM] Alright#0419
if @Deleted User adds ability to pay pool fee in cb tx, will you admit it's a good solution?


[03-Dec-18 05:51 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can probably do that


[03-Dec-18 05:52 PM] Alright#0419
just do it in daemon


[03-Dec-18 05:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
but its adds a LOT of complexity


[03-Dec-18 05:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
ot impossible though

`we have best of both worlds now`
You really don't
I don't understand why neither of you gets that znomp is a disaster and continuing to use it "because it's there" is silly af


[03-Dec-18 05:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
yeah we can add another vout to the coinbase for the pool fee


[03-Dec-18 05:52 PM] Alright#0419
it doesn't have to be znomp man


[03-Dec-18 05:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
you can make any pool

its not the pool thats the issue


[03-Dec-18 05:53 PM] Deleted User#0000
its komodod making crazy coinbases woth exotic chain aprams


[03-Dec-18 05:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
So make the komodod be able to creae the coinase you want ?


[03-Dec-18 05:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
and then build a pool on top of that


[03-Dec-18 05:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
it has to be 100x eaier than rewritign all the C code in JS


[03-Dec-18 05:54 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`I just used znomp becase it have it

At some point, I pray, that you'll stop and realize that is akin to saying
`We don't need Komodo because Bitcoin is already there`


[03-Dec-18 05:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
look man ...


[03-Dec-18 05:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
you can make any pool work with this method

znomp was juts tthe fastest to get working


[03-Dec-18 05:55 PM] Alright#0419
genie whatever flavor of nomp you work with, we'll just add it to it


[03-Dec-18 05:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
if I make it so that the pool fee cna be set in the daemon


[03-Dec-18 05:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
will you use this method to sav YOURSELF TIME?


[03-Dec-18 05:57 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`it has to be 100x eaier than rewritign all the C code in JS`
You still fail to grasp the fact that it's not that feken hard
if the tx is
`bla op 1234`
then you make it say
`bla op 1`
`bla op 1233`
or vise versa
it's not like it's reinventing the wheel to make 1 vout into 2 vouts


[03-Dec-18 05:57 PM] Alright#0419
special vout types tho....

[03-Dec-18 05:58 PM] Alright#0419
his "just works"


[03-Dec-18 05:59 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`literally anything the daemon's miner can mine,`
can be created because 1=1


[03-Dec-18 05:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
I fully get that doing it this way ... can make "dust" end up in the pool address and I assume this is the only technical issue with it...


[03-Dec-18 05:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
So if we move the pool fee to the daemon


[03-Dec-18 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
so it makes the exact same tx


[03-Dec-18 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
as the pool does


[03-Dec-18 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
Then there can no longer be any technical argument


[03-Dec-18 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
against it

ü§¶üèΩ


[03-Dec-18 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
and the pool never needs to create a tx any more


[03-Dec-18 06:00 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
then why dafuq even have pools?


[03-Dec-18 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
BOOM ... you throw away 90% of the pool deps


[03-Dec-18 06:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
you need a stratum


[03-Dec-18 06:00 PM] ComputerGenie#7004

[03-Dec-18 06:01 PM] Deleted User#0000
komodod is already compicated as fuck ... the pool doesnt need to be aswell


[03-Dec-18 06:01 PM] Alright#0419
genie, just ignore his solution and do what you're doing


[03-Dec-18 06:01 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
if you're going to code pool tx into the daemon, it'd be simpler to code getwork back in and just mine straight from the dameon.... actual decentralized


[03-Dec-18 06:01 PM] Alright#0419
his can be added to anything you do as an option


[03-Dec-18 06:02 PM] Alright#0419

[03-Dec-18 06:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
I discussed at lenght what the problem was here


[03-Dec-18 06:02 PM] Deleted User#0000
and made the simplest solution i could find


[03-Dec-18 06:04 PM] Alright#0419
there is no equihash getwork miner


[03-Dec-18 06:04 PM] Alright#0419
that's why he went this route


[03-Dec-18 06:04 PM] Alright#0419
along with everything being 4-5 years old


[03-Dec-18 06:06 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`and the miners are not competile with getwork`
because it would be too much like not being a lemming to take cgminer getwork code and add equihash to it, right?

[03-Dec-18 08:19 PM] Deleted User#0000
so what is needed to do that ... coinbase we need to give a list of address's and %'s for the pool fee so it can build the coinbase in the way you guys like it ... but what else is the stratum doing to the block that adds the solution? I think doing that is more reverting to getwork lol


[03-Dec-18 08:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
To stay compatible with the current mining software ... we need the stratum protocol in python, (which exists already right?)


[03-Dec-18 08:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
I guess python would be the best way to go tbh

because that's how protocols work...
the guy that writes them decides the rules

adding txs indide the daemon is shit load easier than doing it on java script wth hundreds of dependancies that you cant control or verify to be safe.


[03-Dec-18 08:30 PM] Deleted User#0000
also can be written to be backwards compatible easy enough, as my current option already is.

I can have a look at that python and see if I can offload all the heavy lifting directly to the daemon ... with verushash, we cna add more algos to AC's very easily

It doesnt need NOMP ... any pool can use it ... litterally all it does, is stop the coinbase tx from being a speerate part of the JSON in getblocktemplate and just use the blocktemplate

Going to work on making my Knomp be compaible with any and every algo that could ever be added to komodod out of the box. Adding poolfee to coinbase is not really required IMO ...

@Cryptoon being polite only goes so far. That company kept the fact that their rigs can do VerusHash a secret, as long as they could. Now the secret is out. VRSC can "brick" the fpga's for a few weeks/months maybe, before a new bitstream is written. VRSC doesn't have a lot of good options that I am seeing

Latest word on the street is the @VerusCoin mining network has been taken over by FPGA miners. 20-40X power efficiency and ~50X the hashrate of high end CPUs + GPUs, it's not looking good for CPU/GPU miners. What happens next?

Which isn't too bad a medium between asics and gpus.  More raw power like an asic ( but less than ) but with adaptability like a gpu ( more effort to get that adaptability ). If a mass consumer market comes out of these things prices will drop even further,  maybe to the cost of a high end gpu

Seems the biggest hurdle is the complexity of programming them, but as they are a new thing I expect that to improve over time, especially if the code is open sourced by most players, mining might be good for that, once a better code is out, and the advantage is over hopefully miners release old code and the knowledge spreads fast, will be looking to get one to play with for sure.

now GPUs are roughly equivalent (not a bad thing) and FPGAs can control most hashrate, when they come online. It's not bad or evil, it just changes everything about verus mining

as soon as any "anti" process becomes worthwhile to anti-"anti", it will happen
the minute VRSC became of value, it should have been expected that *someone* was going to begin working on a non-CPU *something* and so on

that has always been the best choice, worked pretty good for BTC


[06-Dec-18 12:49 AM] jl777c#5810
guaranteed that all "ASIC resistant" coins are actively mined by fpga, including XMR


[06-Dec-18 12:50 AM] jl777c#5810
you can write open CL that runs on fpga now, so basically GPU software on ASIC level hardware


[06-Dec-18 12:51 AM] jl777c#5810
a safe bet is stocks in fpga manufacturers as they will get a giant sales boom, like the GPU makers did

@Pool-Operator Please update your pool with latest Komodo source which is sapling ready and make sure your pool software is sapling ready too. If you are running assetchain pool as well, after updating Komodo, just restart all the daemons. Remember to this before 15 Decembe. Otherwise, you are risking to go on fork. Please post here once your pool is sapling ready.
1. Navigate to your Komodo directory.
`cd ~/komodo`
2. Make sure you don't have any changes made to the source and reset it. This will ensure clean source and shouldn't create issue while pulling the latest source in the next step.
`git reset --hard`
3. Use master branch
`git checkout master`
4. Clean the source directory.
`make clean`
5. Update the source. (If you‚Äôve made any changes to the source code, this step may not pull the latest source. Please make sure you used the step above to eliminate this issue.)
`git pull`
6. Fetch updated zcash sapling params
`./zcutil/fetch-params.sh`
7. Compile the latest binary.
`./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)`
Start your daemon as usual. (If you have not stopped the Komodo daemon before compiling, please stop the daemon now and start it again.)
8. Verify the update
`./Komodo-cli -ac_name=COIN getinfo`
Please look for the KMDversion in the output of the above call, which should display:
`"KMDversion": "0.3.1",`

@webworker01 while both sprout and sapling addresses are supported, it would be best to phase out sprout addresses sooner than later, for obvious reasons. Maybe just do sprout payments once per day ? some way to incentivize people to switch to a sapling address.

Hello, I asked this in another section that discussed the update, but I haven't seen a reply as of yet.  I actively mine Komodo, at the time I started the first valid wallet I located was on my cell phone in the Coinomi wallet.  I was wondering if there is any action I need to take prior to the update being executed.  I plan to update to the new desktop wallet after the update, but as of  yet the links are still not active to download.  Please advise .. thank you.  Very Respectfully, WX2


[09-Dec-18 01:05 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@ronyi this happened to me, I had to try and build it about 3-4 times before it successfully built. I'm not sure why though


[09-Dec-18 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as coinimi updates, there wont be an issue. just make sure you update prior to the next time you are sending coins


[09-Dec-18 02:28 AM] ronyi#5719
@NutellaLicka yes, but i think(permission issue?) sudo ./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc) worked smoothly for me....


[09-Dec-18 04:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
@webworker01 
I am back today, I think I can make the payment processor work for pirate, sapling should work by just using a sapling address, can have a go at this today. Unless you have it sorted?


[09-Dec-18 04:59 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I think the problem is when there is a mix of sapling and sprout addresses that need to be paid out


[09-Dec-18 05:00 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Also, I am happy to do some testing with you. I am trying to get the RKT chain up and running at the moment


[09-Dec-18 06:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Just had a look at the pool code, and yes that will be the problem.


[09-Dec-18 06:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
My pool should actually work already with the Z-tx that web made for Pirate.... however if that happens, then there will be an issue with the sendmany.


[09-Dec-18 07:04 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
One way around it is by forcing sapling addresses from the start. Easy for a new pool, not so easy for web and their pool with a lot of people on it currently.


[09-Dec-18 07:05 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
A small change to the `var getProperAddress` in the payment processor should ensure that the pool won't accept sapling addresses


[09-Dec-18 07:06 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
(In web's knomp anyhow)


[09-Dec-18 07:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
Yeah ... it seems like you need to have 2 seperate configs... one for sapling address and one for sprout


[09-Dec-18 07:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
and people will need to move over after it activates


[09-Dec-18 07:09 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It is a difficult problem to manage. I think for your pool, you'd be better off forcing sapling addresses from the get go. That way you don't have to worry about sprout


[09-Dec-18 07:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
I dont have a pirate pool... Just wasnt sure if they needed mine for it or not..


[09-Dec-18 07:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
I thaught that my pool didnt work with z-tx payments, but I juts read the code and it looks like it will work just fine.


[09-Dec-18 07:11 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah I believe snomp has z transaction and shielding in the payment processor as well


[09-Dec-18 07:12 PM] Deleted User#0000
I am testing my pool with an ac_private=1 chain now.. will test just with spaling address's ... and ignore the sprout stuff. It seems like having seperate ports for sprout and sapling will be the only way to do this for pirate.. every other chain works already.


[10-Dec-18 12:12 AM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
I have a noob question, what is a sapling? 
Necessary to mind KMDs? Also, any other coin that is on the KMD ecosystem to mine that could also still be profitable for 1070s GPU rigs?


[10-Dec-18 12:54 AM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
*mine


[10-Dec-18 01:05 AM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
Hmm okay. How does that directly/indirectly affect miners, if it does?


[10-Dec-18 01:15 AM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
Ah alrights. It's clearer now. Thanks for pointing me in the right direction. 

As to the other question on, are there any other coin to mine in the komodo infrastructure already?


[10-Dec-18 01:15 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Surely is


[10-Dec-18 01:16 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
There is a bunch. VRSC (good for CPU/GPU), ARRR (mostly mined by ASIC's, if you have cheap electricity and a lot of GPU's this could still be profitable), KMD (self explanatory), HUSH. They're just a couple I can think of


[10-Dec-18 01:18 AM] JaseOfAllTrades#8229
VRSC. Ah yes, not the first time hearing about this. Will be looking at this as i only have CPU/GPU hardware to mine


[10-Dec-18 02:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
Wasnt able to get my pool working with sapling payouts, over the change over.. Spent a fair few hours on it, and gave up. Seems like you 100% need to have a seperate sapling port, and there is no way to validate a zaddress via RPC.


[10-Dec-18 02:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
@dukeleto  Did you get that working? z address validation in nodejs?


[10-Dec-18 02:08 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Did you try incorporate both sprout and sapling payouts?


[10-Dec-18 02:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
I started the chain on sprout and connected sapling address miners to it


[10-Dec-18 02:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
once the address was valid after activation


[10-Dec-18 02:10 AM] Deleted User#0000

[10-Dec-18 02:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think most of my problems were not knowing how to setup a private chain mining pool.. Let alone use sapling.


[10-Dec-18 02:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
As far as I can tell... just using a sapling address for the pools Z address, and NOT starting the pool, until after saplign si avtivated is the only way.


[10-Dec-18 02:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
as sprout still works for a few months, this should be ok, just for pirate... pools can launch a new port for saping


[10-Dec-18 02:12 AM] Deleted User#0000

On Dec. 1 they claimed ready to "take on Genesis mining" in an hr long "Can Digital Gold out last Genesis mining? " and 5 days later they are closing?
It's some 12' deep bullshit somewhere in that mix


[10-Dec-18 01:03 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
from "ready to outlast Genesis" to "closing" __in 5 days__ is a **lot** more than "overextending"

@SHossain In my experience with CentOS by now, I learned that libraries on CentOS can be pretty old as they update it only with stable (maybe major versions). Here we have gcc error, so my first guess would be too old gcc.

[12-Dec-18 07:47 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
pretty much, it means
"You're using some old shit that doesn't understand what the new shit has"

yes, but cleanly written code should compile without warnings for many generations of compilers

Yeah, now just have to  update   `libstdc++` somehow for our  fresh gcc


[12-Dec-18 10:33 AM] TonyL#3577
@SHossain This env var resolved an issue with not visible custom compiled libs for new gcc: ```export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/lib:/usr/local/lib64:/usr/lib64
```
So now on my side Komodo is synching on ```CentOS Linux release 7.6.1810 (Core)```

@ComputerGenie does your fix for `-Wint-conversion` was for Debian?
```
remove -Wint-conversion (including the space) from all of the makefiles (makefile, makefile.am, and makefile.in)
```

I am in need of some troubleshooting help. I am using knomp sapling branch on the RKT chain and i'm regularly getting this output.
```2018-12-12 21:10:18 [Pool]      [rkt] (Thread 1) Submitted Block using submitblock successfully to daemon instance(s)
2018-12-12 21:10:18 [Pool]      [rkt] (Thread 1) We thought a block was found but it was rejected by the daemon, share data: {"job":"ccea","ip":"::ffff:127.0.0.1","port":10000,"worker":"zs1wqnm9d8yvwgn89l2rc5n3xc773x9mtpx6eklg5r6qzsxkwf92vhwzd57kvstnca7hqaqx8sk3yg.ballgag","height":24146,"difficulty":5,"shareDiff":"6.28810795","blockDiff":1.165926502,"blockDiffActual":1.165926502,"blockHash":"000145b1b419f65485f076f3e8cb00fa6f62350d0855a8288123ac64abb80700","error":{"unknown":"check coin daemon logs"}}```

The coin daemon log is always:
```2018-12-12 11:06:46 CheckBlockHeader komodo_check_deposit errorERROR: ProcessNewBlock: CheckBlock FAILED```

I am still finding blocks regularly, and this rejected block occurs when I'd expect to have found one(I am one of two miners on the network). It may happen a handful of times before it actually finds a block. Has anyone seen this daemon output error before?


[12-Dec-18 04:56 PM] Alright#0419
@NutellaLicka edit pool.js in stratum-pool/lib/ to print `blockHex` to console


[12-Dec-18 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
then get the blockhex and use `komodo-cli -ac_name=RKT submitblock <blockhex>` and check debug.log and stdout to see what error the daemon throws


[12-Dec-18 04:57 PM] Alright#0419
Ah I guess that won't quite work unless you're doing it on your own chain that you can stop


[12-Dec-18 04:58 PM] Alright#0419
or you do `invalidateblock` on the public block found at that point


[12-Dec-18 04:58 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I could get the chain stopped, should I try that?


[12-Dec-18 04:59 PM] Alright#0419
you can just force your node to fork with `invalidateblock`


[12-Dec-18 04:59 PM] Alright#0419
first get the stratum to print hex of the block


[12-Dec-18 05:00 PM] Alright#0419
then wait for that error to happen, wait for the next block to come in and do `invalidateblock <blockhash>` on it, your node will now be on it's own fork


[12-Dec-18 05:00 PM] Alright#0419
then take the blockhex outputted from the stratum and do `submitblock <blockhex>`


[12-Dec-18 05:00 PM] Alright#0419
that should give you an error in stdout, debug.log or shell you're doing it in


[12-Dec-18 05:01 PM] Alright#0419
if you get that far, let me know and I'll help you pin down what consensus rule it's violating


[12-Dec-18 05:02 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Sweet thanks, I'll get on it

@jl777c this check is failing for @NutellaLicka 's RKT(sapling test chain) pool. I looked at the block and transactions in it. Can't figure out why.

2.5599 is the vout1 in the transaction with the tx fees of the block subtracted from it

ac_private needs tx fees burned if you have more than 1 vout in coinbase


[12-Dec-18 07:27 PM] Alright#0419
just realized whatever @NutellaLicka was using was not burning tx fees because the above block is claiming 256.0001 in coinbase

@ComputerGenie @Deleted User there's a quirk in ac_private consensus rules themselves


[13-Dec-18 09:56 AM] Alright#0419
if coinbase has >1 vout, must burn fees


[13-Dec-18 09:56 AM] Alright#0419
has nothing to do with the pool software


[13-Dec-18 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810

[13-Dec-18 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
works on ZEX


[13-Dec-18 10:03 AM] Alright#0419
guess that's a special case though


[13-Dec-18 10:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Alright yes, I'm aware. In fact, webby and I were discussing it last night, the comment in komodo source combined with my lack of knowledge of C gave me the wrong impression that it could be done


[13-Dec-18 10:07 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the "compromise" I came up with is that k-nomp will not "entirely" burn tx fees, but subtract that amount from pool op's fees (vout1) while adding to vout0
Mathematically it's the same to the cb as burning them, but this way ops take the hit and not miners


[13-Dec-18 10:55 AM] Alright#0419
that seems rather bad solution


[13-Dec-18 10:56 AM] Alright#0419
can send txs with inputs > outputs then steal from pool op


[13-Dec-18 10:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Well, you can always rewrite `komodo_gateway.h`, fix it, and submit a PR


[13-Dec-18 10:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
:trollface:


[13-Dec-18 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
i can fix it, but then it would break backward compatibility


[13-Dec-18 10:59 AM] jl777c#5810
though with the new timestamp -> height mapper, it is actually possible to do a timestamp activated consensus rules change


[13-Dec-18 11:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
sapling pretty much does that anyway, no?


[13-Dec-18 11:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
break backward compatibility


[13-Dec-18 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
for tx, not for blocks


[13-Dec-18 11:13 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`can send txs with inputs > outputs then steal from pool op`
What are you really "stealing" if you spend 2.56 ARRR to get 2.56 ARRR? At best you're breaking even. Granted it leaves no financial overhead to be a dick and leave the op with a 0 fee; but, currently the only other alternatives are "Hey, that tx fee you just paid, no one gets it it just gets vaporized" and rewriting the entire payout system of any nomp fork you want to support


[13-Dec-18 11:16 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
dick the users, dick the miners, dick the ops or dick around trying to support 4 different pool codebases; those are the current choices

@everyone **ATTN Pool Operators:** We are just about 28 hours away from the biggest network update that Komodo ever had. Please make sure you have your Komodo and assetchain daemon and pool software updated to support sapling. Don't risk going on fork. Wasting hash in a forked pool would be pointless. To avoid that, all you have to do is update your pool with sapling ready source. If you need help, please ask questions here. We have experienced pool operators and engineers here to help you out. Help us to carry out the major network upgrade smoothly. Thanks for your contribution.

Sapling is necessary to do that,  so think of it as building the way to mobile pirate

[13-Dec-18 11:54 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Does anyone know the komodo `"peerMagic":` number


[14-Dec-18 12:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka are you wanting the `magic` key from `getinfo` that is returned for asset chains, but not kmd itself?


[14-Dec-18 12:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka i think maybe it's 2387029918 for kmd


[14-Dec-18 12:23 AM] Deleted User#0000
I just tried to get it that way for him, but no there is no magic value in getinfo.


[14-Dec-18 12:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User you must go much deeper my child


[14-Dec-18 12:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
it could also be this slightly different hex value: `if ( magic == 0x8de4eef9 )`


[14-Dec-18 12:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
i don't pretend to understand all the magic inside this magic


[14-Dec-18 12:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
``` string=$(printf '%08x\n' $(echo $getinfo | jq '.magic'))
    magic=${string: -8}
magicrev=$(echo ${magic:6:2}${magic:4:2}${magic:2:2}${magic:0:2})```


[14-Dec-18 12:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
that will convert the number in getinfo to the correct value for ZNoomp


[14-Dec-18 12:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
`magic` comes from ASSETCHAINS_MAGIC, which defaults to 2387029918 for kmd


[14-Dec-18 12:26 AM] Deleted User#0000
well thats the right number ... run that number through those commands above and he will have the correct hex value for the pool.


[14-Dec-18 12:28 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Thanks. Yeah I didn't realise KMD wouldn't output the magic


[14-Dec-18 12:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
it could easily, it's just only in a part of code for assetchains, not KMD itself


[14-Dec-18 12:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
i learned more about magic by reading code to answer your question


[14-Dec-18 12:29 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
the actual `"peerMagic":` I'm working out is  `9E2F478E`


[14-Dec-18 12:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
```printf "%x" 2387029918
8e472f9e```


[14-Dec-18 12:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
little endian vs big endian


[14-Dec-18 12:30 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yep, peerMagic uses little endian I think


[14-Dec-18 12:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
same number, different formats


[14-Dec-18 12:32 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
`[Pool]      [komodo] (Thread 1) p2p connection failed - likely incorrect p2p magic value` it doesn't like `9E2F478E` or `8e472f9e`


[14-Dec-18 12:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
try 8de4eef9


[14-Dec-18 12:34 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Nope

It's the little endian


[14-Dec-18 12:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
ok, `0x8de4eef9` appears as the magic in KMD source code, but for whatever reason you need to specify it in other format


[14-Dec-18 12:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
i will blame javascript


[14-Dec-18 12:39 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Where did you pull that hex from?


[14-Dec-18 12:42 AM] dukeleto#7326
```uint16_t komodo_assetport(uint32_t magic,int32_t extralen)
{
    if ( magic == 0x8de4eef9 )
        return(7770);
    else if ( extralen == 0 )
        return(8000 + (magic % 7777));
    else return(16000 + (magic % 49500));
}```


[14-Dec-18 12:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
from src/komodo_port.c


[14-Dec-18 12:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
straight from the horses mouth


[14-Dec-18 12:44 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Woh nice one


[14-Dec-18 01:55 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
when all else fails, look at the output of running the daemon
You'll see something like:
`>>>>>>>>>> CHAIN: p2p.15586 rpc.15587 magic.e0a98e56 3769208406 999999 coins`
just flip the pairs (`e0a98e56` becomes `568ea9e0`) and you're golden

This is an interesting idea about removing pool operators as a source of centralization, and claims to enable pooled mining directly on-chain. This coin aims to only allow solo CPU mining, which is also an interesting idea: https://github.com/nithronium/pondmining/blob/master/pondmining.pdf

you can't mine 20 pirate
you have submitted enough shares to earn 20 pirate when the pool you mine for pays you that 20 pirate (payout minimums and frequencies are decided by each individual pool)

@Captain_Jack nothing in particular


[16-Dec-18 02:24 AM] Alright#0419
you can set the diff higher on one of the stratum ports, but it's only necessary if you want to save bandwidth


[16-Dec-18 02:24 AM] Alright#0419
so in pool_configs file, you would adjust this 
```
         "4552": {
            "tls":false,
            "diff": 40,
            "varDiff": {
                "minDiff": 1,
                "maxDiff": 1000,
                "targetTime": 15,
                "retargetTime": 60,
                "variancePercent": 30
                }
            }
```

is this normal, that Block #1142408 has a timestamp of Dec 16, 2018 2:20:07 PM & Block #1142409 has a timestamp of Dec 16, 2018 2:20:06 PM ?

so, i did the update to my daemon, Do I need to generate new addresses for the wallet in the daemon in order to mine on my private pool? Also what if any changes to my kmd.json in S-nomp do I need to do?


[16-Dec-18 09:46 AM] Captain_Jack#0015
@Alright Thanks!


[16-Dec-18 11:33 AM] skyguynca#0562
hey guys, before the update I was finding blocks pretty regularly. Since I did the sapling update I am  not finding blocks.


[16-Dec-18 11:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe you were on a fork before updating?


[16-Dec-18 11:45 AM] skyguynca#0562
but when I updated shouldn't my daemon be on the correct fork?


[16-Dec-18 11:45 AM] SHossain#0007
what blockheight you are at?


[16-Dec-18 11:47 AM] skyguynca#0562

[16-Dec-18 11:47 AM] SHossain#0007

[16-Dec-18 11:51 AM] SHossain#0007
how much hash your pool has?


[16-Dec-18 11:53 AM] skyguynca#0562
300k, I used to see a block every hour to 2 hours up to the 14th Dec, now not a single one since


[16-Dec-18 11:54 AM] SHossain#0007
try renting some hash to test. maybe 300k is low


[16-Dec-18 11:55 AM] SHossain#0007

how can I tell if the cain is out of sync?


[16-Dec-18 12:16 PM] skyguynca#0562
ok, so the error I am getting as you can see @SHossain  it is plainly says the chain not in synce, there are peers connected


[16-Dec-18 12:17 PM] SHossain#0007
`./komodo-cli getinfo`


[16-Dec-18 12:17 PM] skyguynca#0562
so that leaves chain not in sync, and my question was how can i check, I was  not asking about the pool


[16-Dec-18 12:18 PM] skyguynca#0562
after I updated with the sapling to the daemon, was I supposed to get new addresses like I had to with ARRR, or will the current addresses still be ok?


[16-Dec-18 12:19 PM] SHossain#0007
current R address should work


[16-Dec-18 12:19 PM] SHossain#0007
last time i asked you which block height you are at, you posted `1142784`. that means you should be in sync.


[16-Dec-18 12:21 PM] SHossain#0007
the message you are posting is not from komodo daemon, but the pool software itseld. you need to make sure you have set up your pool properly. if not, ask for help from other pool operators. they can help you./


[16-Dec-18 12:22 PM] SHossain#0007
if you can post the output of `./komodo-cli getinfo`, that could help understanding your wallet issues

@Cryptoon but big players must pay back all the people they owe, I think is the big factor. People borrowed money thinking BTC would go from 20K to 100K and now it's at 3K. They are in the deep red and can't afford to keep going in that direction. People who grew "smart" and didn't overextend, can follow your advice

Aussie miners, I'd like to introduce https://minethechains.com/ 
This pool provides easy to switch KMD & Pirate mining(just change the port), with more KMD assetchains being added soon!
Please consider us if you'd like a low latency connection(compared to pools hosted in NA or EU). We offer a 1% fee and quick payouts (~3mins for ARRR & ~10mins for KMD).
The website is currently in construction, and if you join, have any feedback, or request a specific assetchain to be added, please let me know.

Hey guys, I have had a private pool for about a month, it is doing good. I had some problems but I believe they are all worked out. It is just a basic S-NOMP pool, still the included pages from the download. I am looking for some  asic miners to come and try it out, give it a good testing. Today just concentrating on KMD and looking for some of you to jump on and load it with hashing power. 1% fee to  cover the server and you get everything else you earn. I provide all testers with my contact info including text number if you need to contact me while you are testing. Plus i will be monitoring my PM on the discord. Please come and help me test and let's make some coin,  I have not gotten a URL yet so still using ip address+port for main page. There you will get the coins and ports for mining. Please behave yourself I will ban all IP's immeadiately attempting to poke around where you don't belong. PM me for details,  Thanks David

[17-Dec-18 11:23 PM] skyguynca#0562
well that was a bust, thanks everyone for participating.....now on to the problem ok, so something is dreadfully wrong. on the 12, 13, 14th DEC I was averaging 25 blocks a day KMD, that is 25 x 2.97 = 74.25 KMD a day in block rewards. Have screen shot can show you. 15th did sapling upgrade and not a single block since. I figured I missed something or messed something up. So I completely wiped the server and reinstalled all the daemons. I let all of them sync, KMD - ZEC -ZCL all done but ZEN is still working on it...22 hours later. Anyway for the past 5 hours myself and a friend put all our asics on KMD, mined hard at 600k+ kh/s.....we should have blocked in under 3 hours, we let it go to 4 hours and 15 minutes ......no blocks at all, The diff was only 720k and we have over 900k in shares when we gave up. ......help me out please, something changed drastically with the sapling upgrade and my pool is not mining KMD now.


[17-Dec-18 11:55 PM] Deleted User#0000
you need a pool that works with sapling


[17-Dec-18 11:56 PM] Deleted User#0000
the answer will be in debug.log when the pool tries to submit a block


[18-Dec-18 12:38 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You may have a pool configuration issue too, it could be loads of things. You've given us no technical information about your problem, I.e, pool outputs, debug.log outputs from the daemon. That info would be handy to help out


[18-Dec-18 05:17 AM] skyguynca#0562
no pool outputs out of the usual, nothing to show that it ever found a block and rejected it........just never found a block. Before I did the sapling update I was finding blocks np. in 9 hours usually 19-25 blocks, after the update nothing at all, I could mine with all 300kh/s for 24 hours and nothing. I am sure it is a setting or a problem with the daemon itself, if I had something to show then I would not have to ask what could be the problem.


[18-Dec-18 05:24 AM] bishop#9773
You updated your pool config to support how blocks are created in sapling, correct? Not just updating the daemon


[18-Dec-18 10:05 AM] skyguynca#0562
yep


[18-Dec-18 02:18 PM] skyguynca#0562

`what are your tips and tricks or some hacks :pirate~1: for better mining efficiency ?`
1) don't use a GPU


[19-Dec-18 05:42 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
2) Overclocking is only a gain if you test rages (ironically, some modern GPUs are actually more efficient if you __under__clock them)


[19-Dec-18 05:45 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
3) If you live in the US (many other countries already use 200+) - run at 220v and not 110v (the power curve is less efficient on standard "110" [which is actually 115-120- but I digress])


[19-Dec-18 06:21 AM] actionslacks#4072
that a good point about the 220v.


[19-Dec-18 08:34 AM] gzezo#2697
Agree, we have 220v here by default. Overall I am trying to figure out what is the most efficient things to focus on, if on contacting power plant owners, some software,firmware hacks or what


[19-Dec-18 09:02 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
honestly, all of the above
If you're big enough to be contacting power co, then imo nothing should be running "stock" settings
But that's also kind of a "coin-flip" depending on *how big* (past a certain point customization man-hours are a wash to the write-off of any "losses" of not doing so)

Yet I have been on my pool for 20 hours with 300k h/s and no blocks. I have not found a single block since the 14th of DEC....something has to be wrong since I did the sapling upgrade

It will just require a daemon update when they release it and then restart the pool at the block height it activates

`I need help understanding what the sapling upgrade is? will the upgrade be easy to do on the 4 coins I run on my pool ZEC ZCL ZEN and KMD? Do you have to do it?`
Zcash planned "growth stages" along the lines of a tree's growth (sprout, overwinter, sapling), sapling is the current growth stage and encompasses many changes
if you keep your coins in transparent addresses, updates for all coins should be almost seamless; if you keep them in private/z addresses, you'll need to migrate from stage to stage however each coin decides


[19-Dec-18 02:47 PM] skyguynca#0562
when you tell me you helped write the sapling upgrade, then you should know how it works, if you tell me it will work when I tell you what coins I am using, then I believe you

this address seems to mine less than 3KMD

interesting. maybe they are subtracting txfees instead of setting it to 0

the lowest seems to be 2.994 which is missing 0.2% of 3KMD

on pirate, when I add it to my pool do I still modify the  PIRATE.conf  file with the rpc port of the pool and rpc username and password of the pool like I did with KMD or do I leave it alone. It does not say on the pirate git


[21-Dec-18 06:35 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
You'll need to change the username/pass to whatever you have set in your .komodo/PIRATE conf file


[21-Dec-18 06:48 PM] skyguynca#0562
but i leave the rpc port allong? ex for KMD i put rpcport=15993 for ARRR I want rpcport=15994


[21-Dec-18 06:49 PM] skyguynca#0562
so it will match the pool config file


[21-Dec-18 06:57 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
check the daemon for the rpc port. `getinfo` will tell you what it is


[21-Dec-18 07:02 PM] skyguynca#0562
oh, I had been specifying the RPC port for all the coins in the ./ *.conf files. I did not think you were supposed to use the default port

Pirate mining question - Does anyone know if the pending sprout balances on PiratePool will be paid out if we switched over to sapling pool? Or I should re-connect to that port and mine it until I get paid out. I have a couple hundred pending and just wanted to get the migration out of the way

[28-Dec-18 05:15 AM] $tefano.#3560
Hard maintenance done on komodomininpool ( miningpools.cloud )  after 150K kmd paid.
Many tasks done and others features added during this night to keep pool updated, fast, secure and  first of all scalable  
- added mysql support to store all datas with redis db sync and nodejs, in this way if redis will be huge and huge like now, it's possible to flush it without lost datas 
- separate stratum from frontend on another independent server and speed up realtime datas 
- sync redis across other 2  servers to save data using sentinel ( master, slave x3  ad db replication) 
- pool run with minimal requirements but now it's more power with half of resources 
Sorry for some downtime during this night but it was necessary to keep pool up and fast 
Enjoy

[28-Dec-18 07:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie it somewhat depends on which node frameworks are in use


[28-Dec-18 07:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
for instance, hush-ng uses Vue, and Vue has a specific way of setting global state


[28-Dec-18 07:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
11.5


[28-Dec-18 07:21 AM] radix42#3743
The old saw about ‚Äúif it compiles, it‚Äôs correct‚Äù abt Haskell is only half way a joke


[28-Dec-18 07:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
your node framework might have special setters/getters for global state


[28-Dec-18 07:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
allowing the setting of global variables can cause race conditions


[28-Dec-18 07:21 AM] radix42#3743
Yeah rtfm and pray


[28-Dec-18 07:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
so with hush-ng, i had to read all about global state in Vue


[28-Dec-18 07:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
@radix42 i knew people that maintained a real live working dynamic web app, all written directly in Haskell. Blew my mind

`allowing the setting of global variables can cause race conditions`
I think that might be the issue I'm having because any print finishes before the inner function print

@ComputerGenie maybe search your codebase for `mutate` or `state` and see if there is something special, usually you must define some methods as wrappers for the global state

gosh interesting chat about haskell, yes need more haskellers.   got an enquiry about a project from eth->kmd on the grapevine.  2nd one in a month.

but to the channel topic, over xmas i dabbled with a bit of miningrigrentals to see the state of mining other coins, and tried out zpool (i like it!) after getting sick of blackjoker's zex  pool not accepting an inno 50k overclocked thing and leto's polly having very low ARRR hashrate.

what i discovered was the way pool operators in this ecosystem allow the links from the worker tabs to see what a miner has earned is handy.   the digihash.io pool of digibyte disable this, presumably to protect miners.

also, 1 minute blocktimes are pretty good for miners.   the 2-10minute blocktimes is not cool for 3 hour mining contract experiments üòÉ

with many kmd solo mining pool I think that is it is no longer necessary to maintain pool open. 
4.48 MSol/s hashrate from know pool against 33.88 MSol/s of solo hidden pools

imo, both are needed
I think that anyone that can solo should, but anyone that feels they benefit from a group pool should do that too

I'll always have mixed emotions/beliefs about solo vs public, but other than the pool fee they are kinda moot for KMD itself


[01-Jan-19 01:21 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
more solo = more nodes being still true, though


[01-Jan-19 01:29 PM] $tefano.#3560
keep more solo ( or future masternodes? ) could be better for stability against public pool, global hashrate is the demonstration. 10% of hashrate of 10 know pools against 90% of hidden pools( how many?)


[01-Jan-19 01:30 PM] ComputerGenie#7004

hi guys, I'm very sorry about this news but it's time to shutdown my pool.üòî 
Costs to maintain pool up ( 5 dedicated servers) it's more expensive. 
I supported Komodo project since start with my pool but keep it open for 30 miners it has become unsustainable.
Shutdown planned on 4th ( tomorrow morning ) at 11:00 AM  - CET
Thanks to all those who supported the pool and komodo developers for this big project 
‚úå Enjoy

@„ÉÑ‚£†#7004 you can shut down RKT chain if you want. there is no need for that chain anymore

Thank you very much for helping with the sapling testing on that chain


[03-Jan-19 06:08 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@SHossain I had it running there and still using it here working on pool stuff for PIRATE; much easier to hit a GPU block than a 95M sols chain block üòõ

BEAM mining started, and they integrated GPU mining directly into their full node


[03-Jan-19 11:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
they are using equihash (150,5) and Zcash is thinking of adopting that as their new PoW that will be phased in

@$tefano. it's not changing algos, they want to have 2 PoW algos, at first the new algo will only be 5% and phased in to 50% after 2 years, is what they are currently talking

Mmh okay. I've only had a quick look, but are they selling themselves as a privacy currency?

what RPC calls do explorers use to get the coinbase amount generated per block?


[05-Jan-19 02:22 PM] BlackJesus#6161
What they want to do just honestly seems stupid. They are trying to make some kind of hierarchy of mining like GPUs/FPGA's are pure bloods and ASIC's are lower class citizens. When they are both doing the same job just one of them is specifically designed for it.


[05-Jan-19 02:47 PM] Alright#0419
@NutellaLicka there is `getblocksubsidy`, but I'm not sure if that's what they use


[05-Jan-19 02:47 PM] Alright#0419
They are likely just using the block template?


[05-Jan-19 02:47 PM] Alright#0419
Ah read that as pools instead of explorers for some reason


[05-Jan-19 02:48 PM] Alright#0419
if you're talking about where insight says "Block Reward", I believe that's a static value set it a config file somewhere


[05-Jan-19 03:30 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah okay, I guess I am wondering about the transaction amount (cb) that is the first transaction to every block.


[05-Jan-19 03:31 PM] Alright#0419
it's reading the data from chain?

Yeah I didn't know if there was a single RPC call. But I guess it's tx 0 in the block aha

[08-Jan-19 12:49 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It's primary purpose is 100% ztransactions. Meaning there is no data in the block Explorer. Nobody can see how many coins your have in total, or what transactions to whom that you have conducted


[08-Jan-19 12:49 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Zcash, Komodo and other coins have opt in privacy, and only a minimal amount of users actually use the features.

[08-Jan-19 12:50 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
The only transparent addresses are for Notary Nodes (it is also secured by dPoW) and for coinbase transactions(mining rewards) which can only go to Z addresses


[08-Jan-19 12:52 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It's only about 4 months old, and has a fairly big following at the moment. There is a lot in the works too. It's currently only on 1 exchange, but they have a couple others in the works, and they're looking into zSPV and Web shop plug-ins for commercial use


[08-Jan-19 12:53 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It is a pretty unique currency. It is completely decentralised as well. No premine, no founders rewards, nothing. There is a marketing donation address, and currently they are asking for donations which will be used for exchange listing fees

[08-Jan-19 04:01 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I've never mined a cpu coin. Do you just have a bunch of motherboards with cpus in them? Surely that'd be fairly expensive hey?


[08-Jan-19 04:04 PM] SHossain#0007
VRSC was CPU mining only


[08-Jan-19 04:04 PM] SHossain#0007
and is again


[08-Jan-19 04:06 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I know, I've not mined it :P I was more asking about how there would be "CPU farms" do they have a bunch of mostly complete computers just buzzing away with amazing CPU's?


[08-Jan-19 04:23 PM] Alright#0419
@NutellaLicka basically a bare headless motherboard


[08-Jan-19 04:23 PM] Alright#0419
duke has a decent setup for CPU mining


[08-Jan-19 04:40 PM] Mink#9547
Yea you basically run a ton of 2U racks with xeon's and go to town


[08-Jan-19 04:42 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Have any photos? Sounds interesting aha. Is the idea to maintain a cpu mineable algo all to do with maintain decentralisation because more people have access to them?


[08-Jan-19 04:44 PM] Alright#0419
I believe the only sensible option for "decentralization" is an algo with a widely available ASIC. Otherwise, once the coin has value, someone will stealth mine with FPGAs defeating the whole purpose of more people having access to mining hardware


[08-Jan-19 04:46 PM] Alright#0419
Take for example, 144,5 coins. They all lost their minds when ASICs were announced for 200,9. Now they have FPGAs on their network and no one seems to care? The FPGAs are significantly less widely available than 200,9 ASICs


[08-Jan-19 04:48 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I agree, anything that has a lot of options to mine it is a good thing. Evolution/technological advancements mean people are going to build things that are better and more efficient then what is currently available. So it doesn't really matter what you opt for, eventually it will be superceded


[08-Jan-19 04:49 PM] Mink#9547
So I referenced it above but a privacy project i really like that's acutally a DEX is Resistance, which utilizes Yespower script (fork of Yescrypt)


[08-Jan-19 04:49 PM] Mink#9547
They haven't launched yet but basically will work hard to being GPU / ASIC resistance @NutellaLicka


[08-Jan-19 04:50 PM] Alright#0419
anything that can be CPU mined can also be mined by FPGAs. It's just a matter of time

[08-Jan-19 04:51 PM] Mink#9547
Don't think its' tehir main prioroity, they're a DEX so focus is on UI/GUI (which is seriously gorgesous) and one-click full privacy features


[08-Jan-19 04:51 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
VerusHash is putting a lot of effort into being temporarily  FPGA resistant. Maybe that effort could have been put elsewhere, but that is what they value I guess


[08-Jan-19 04:52 PM] Mink#9547
Yea joined their discord a bit ago to check up on it. My main thing is, what are you shooting for?


[08-Jan-19 04:52 PM] Mink#9547
Where is your revenue model? If you ahve one. Or are you more a research project?


[08-Jan-19 04:53 PM] Mink#9547
I guess its the nature of being in a space this early where it's all in the ether


[08-Jan-19 04:54 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
I guess a project needs to have a solid algo before they can put work into their other products, because the blockchain is the backbone of what they're doing. So if their original algo is compromised against their values and what they stand for, they will try to fix it


[08-Jan-19 04:54 PM] Mink#9547
Right which is interesting because what algo in your opinion is *done* lol

it is not from your node. those printouts from other nodes. they get sent over the network


[09-Jan-19 10:56 AM] SHossain#0007
i meant to say the cause of those printouts are other nodes üòõ


[09-Jan-19 10:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
The reason for those prints is mempool transactions propagating out of order. There is nothing to worry about, if you let them all in, then there would be big problems. Once you receive the tx that comes before it, then your node will let it into your mempool.

out of order mempool is not chain split


[09-Jan-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it is that many tx are being generated that are using unconfirmed outputs


[09-Jan-19 11:19 AM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
the tx input?

in BTC


[09-Jan-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
but anytime you spend an output from your mempool, that tx might be invalid on a different node that doesnt have the first one in the mempool


[09-Jan-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it just indicates that mempool are not 100% in sync across the network

you are incorrect


[09-Jan-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
while that could be a reason for it, in 99.99% of the cases it is out of order propagation of mempool dependent tx


[09-Jan-19 11:51 AM] Jules - coinblockers.com#8043
@Deleted User and sometimes you trap into operational blindness. just because something occur in a stress test, it doesnt mean it will be right :-D
Dont get me wrong. i just seen this behavior recently at KMD which werent the case previously and we had some similarities in another coin i better dont name, so if such things pop up i better double check, since it caused infrequently orphaned miner payouts.

I tried both ways for gaming in linux


[09-Jan-19 06:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
In the end I had to pass through GPU to win10... While this is 100x better than having to reboot, and also means that with a good enough computer you can run Linux VMS for other things and games at the same time, it also means u need 2 GPUs. My vega64 is not avalibe in Linux it only works when I boot the windows VM. 
Some games work natively, but I can't play them because my GPU is disabled on Linux... I guess a better way is using a Vega for Linux and a 1080ti for the windows VM, but it all gets very expensive hardware wise to set up.

this is almost 100% why BEAM chose (150,5) and why Zcash is following them, mostly because "BEAM did it"


[11-Jan-19 08:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
the paper also slaps the hand of Equihash, basically saying it assumes it's built on the strength of a well-known math problem, but because they slightly modified things, it's actually not. It could be in a much simpler "complexity class"


[11-Jan-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
now there are appliance ASIC for it along with nicehash, it seems a decent enough PoW


[11-Jan-19 08:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c they "pay their respects" in the article, say that it is a good PoW for many applications


[11-Jan-19 08:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
it could be that in the future, a very large speedup is found for Equihash, is what I take away from reading it


[11-Jan-19 08:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
Equihash told everybody "we rely on the hardness of the generalized birthday problem", but that is wrong


[11-Jan-19 08:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
so you can't assume all the math that studied that


[11-Jan-19 08:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
nobody knows how "easy" equihash might be found to be

[11-Jan-19 08:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
the paper is from Nov 2017, so it's not anything new. But Daira mentioned it, when deciding on new (N,K) params, and I found it interesting

it's only really effective with existing hash


[14-Jan-19 04:55 AM] jorian#4555
can you use NH's API? i wonder how fast NH starts mining for you, once you submit an order


[14-Jan-19 04:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
It will "work", but not very well with 1 minute block times and new orders, the longest I've seen is 2 mins 19 secs from seeing tx to a block with it and NH spin times usually take much longer than that for any significant hash to spin up on a new order

tried that domain earlier, wasn't showing any website, like few months ago I guess...


[16-Jan-19 01:40 AM] jansako#3330
How about 'internal' auto-trade? (Checks prices & allocates mined currency to user per their preference). With the understanding that it can only pay out what is mined... then maybe every 24 hours it pays out the rest in whatever was mined... and takes a reasonable fee in the process. Avoids all the hassle with sending to exch etc


[16-Jan-19 01:41 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Yes, @grewalsatinder it was down for a while, since no one was mining there anyway, I used it for sapling tests and then kept it down while working on the backend some

Somehow with that one I more often end up net negative... tried but too much of a hit & miss.


[16-Jan-19 01:46 AM] jansako#3330
mostly because he can push hash to coins that have huge nethash so it can take longer than my order length to find a block...

Thats not bad. Verus Hash that KMD has in it is one super crazy powerful algo on CPU. My test chain here 51% PoS64 with verushash is over 2 billion diffuculty with just 3 CPU cores of a RYZEN 2700X.

I figure that our chains have 0 block reward so no FPGA miner will mine them. VerusHash solved a huge issue with PoS64 chains, took 4 days to get it working.. but it works mint.

My calculations aren't making any sense for KMD. Anyone care to tell me where I am going wrong?

Using the standard equihash calculation gives me a way higher expected coins per day.
I assume the komodo stake is messing me up


[30-Jan-19 04:17 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`the standard equihash calculation` assumes you have a possible 1440 blocks per day to get, but you only have 25-30% of that


[30-Jan-19 04:18 PM] sandsandwich#3906
Due to the notary nodes correct?


[30-Jan-19 04:18 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
yes


[30-Jan-19 04:18 PM] sandsandwich#3906
if that's the case, then is there any accurate way to adjust my calculations? Do the normal equihash calculation then times it by 0.25/0.3 for my coins per day?


[30-Jan-19 04:20 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
if you have small amount of hash, lean more towards calc * 0.2 if you have large lean more towards 0.25 or 0.28


[30-Jan-19 04:21 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
on average the blocks come out to be about 25% for miners, but with reward blocks, we tend to get another 3-10% over a year

[11-Feb-19 10:53 AM] jansako#3330
you are kinda soloing if it is just your hash... I would point my rentals there if you were to get the profit switching set up & include Pirate & the other traded ecosystem coins. I am sure there would be others as well.
I understand you are already being pulled in many directions & at some point the time & infrastructure investment may be out of proportion to the results.


[11-Feb-19 11:03 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
The substantive difference between between soloing and mining alone in the public pool is a question of latency and how many of those 5 orphans may have been recognized. Obviously a small percentage, but still a measurable difference.


[11-Feb-19 11:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
profit switcher being functional is 2-3 weeks out depending on a couple current involvements.
That being said, it will not ever include pirate because that would involve accounts and I have objections to using logins/accounts


[11-Feb-19 11:05 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
` & at some point the time & infrastructure investment may be out of proportion to the results.`

[11-Feb-19 11:10 AM] jansako#3330
Right, Pirate has it's own addresses. The more (somewhat) liquid ones of the other coins in the ecosystem you can include... then connect that 'transaction watcher' that some people are running on the asset chains.... hmmm now I am dreaming, I know but... how else would you know that someone appreciates your work if you never get an attaboy for it?


[11-Feb-19 11:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
` Pirate has it's own addresses.`
It's not about the address, itself; it has a different key structure so you can't use a shared key address to mine across other coins and it at the same time


[11-Feb-19 11:13 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
as far as the mechanics of the switcher, it's a combination of current block diff and current market price

It's not profit switching. But all you have to do is change the port number. It's super simple


[12-Feb-19 05:21 AM] BlackJesus#6161
@ComputerGenie you could just code for it's different key structure. Make your username an integer that defaults to the string of your shared key wallet if nothing is entered otherwise specify it.


[12-Feb-19 05:22 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@BlackJesus I've given it thought and imo, it would be too confusing for users to have a username that is 2 pubkeys or even using 1 of them as pw


[12-Feb-19 05:22 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Your the only person using the code right? I mean worse comes to worse someone doesn't change your default public key and they mine to you lol.


[12-Feb-19 05:23 AM] BlackJesus#6161
Just store a default string pub key and call it when the field is empty


[12-Feb-19 05:24 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
each miner has their own pubkey


[12-Feb-19 05:24 AM] BlackJesus#6161
You're mining to multiple pub keys?


[12-Feb-19 05:24 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
1


[12-Feb-19 05:26 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
with profit-switch, instead of address, you use a pubkey that works across multiple different coins
z addys and transparent addys don't even share the same *type* of keying, so it will not work the same way


[12-Feb-19 05:26 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

@SHossain depending on your batch, they have diff shelf-lives. You should be able to either 1) underclock all hashboards so that they all run OR 2) remove one hash board and then run the others at normal/OC/etc speeds


[14-Feb-19 10:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
they will run with either 1, 2 or 3 hashboards inside. CG probably knows much more


[14-Feb-19 10:08 AM] dukeleto#7326
sometimes people burn a hashboard and still run it with 2. And somepeople re-organize the hashboards in many miners, so that they can OC some miners more, and concentrate hashboards that will only run slower into a few miners. that shit is beyond what i do, but i know people do it

[15-Feb-19 08:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
FPGA's are much more power efficient, too. So if some miners are not mining because your power is too expensive, FPGA's change the numbers. The people who sell the blackminer F1 have a hosted solution where they charge 10 cents per kw/h for power and evidently it's still profitable and many people go that route

because not everyone always has the "whole" mempool


[18-Feb-19 02:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Mempool isn't as sending around so well I think, I've been noticing this more and more, not sure of how its supposed to work, but it appears that txs don't really propagate once they have been sent the one time... I had to fetch them with raw tx and then resend on another node to get them to actually propagate to a node that was restarted. Dunno if this is expected behaviour or not, but its darn annoying when trying g to test mining prioritys n things.


[18-Feb-19 06:49 PM] Alright#0419
@Deleted User I noticed this too, seems it started around the Dec hardfork


[18-Feb-19 06:50 PM] Alright#0419
I haven't been able to pinpoint what exactly changed, but spamming transactions that spend the previous tx's outputs causes problems now

usually comes before it... It seems like some nodes are a few vblocks behind or something and trying to rebroadcast... Also I found a bug, where on node start it spams the wallet txns into the local mempool. but those are rejected.... locally so dont think its that.


[18-Feb-19 07:35 PM] Deleted User#0000
maybe we need to add some extra info to those debug prints saying why they are expired... like the times etc?

ok I'll ask around as I'm not an expert in this


[22-Feb-19 05:05 PM] phm87#7395
before sapling (and overwinter), I think that ccminer was not able to work on kmd-nomp or z-nomp so miners can't be compared directly


[22-Feb-19 05:06 PM] phm87#7395
I had a look at the commits about sapling in kmd-nomp it doesn't seem very complicated on pool side


[22-Feb-19 05:08 PM] phm87#7395
but I don't know for miner's side : there is a miner included into komodo daemon itself, I had a look at the sapling code inside it but it is still hard to know exactly what to do into ccminer


[22-Feb-19 09:55 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@phm87 for CPU, the one in the daemon is pretty well your best bet

@phm87 what are you actually trying to do?


[23-Feb-19 04:21 AM] phm87#7395
I am trying to add sapling into yiimp mining pool (on zpool) to be able to mine kmd/zcash again


[23-Feb-19 04:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
yiimp is some crazy ass C++ stratum code. I understand stratum protocol, but writing it in C++ makes me un-understand it. Maybe something to do with the fact that I maintain a Perl stratum implementation, which is used by hushwebminer. It's just a few lines of Perl to implement stratum, C++ implementation is a monstrosity to behold


[23-Feb-19 05:05 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@phm87 if you want to add sapling to yiimp, how does the miner come into play? Or are you wanting that also?


[23-Feb-19 05:20 AM] phm87#7395
I think that with sapling the miner receive the finalsaplingroothash given by stratum. But then I am not sure what calculation the miner must perform with the finalsaplingroothash


[23-Feb-19 05:23 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
ahhhh


[23-Feb-19 05:25 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the miners do not need any change from sprout to sapling
the stratum itself need the update and the changes are small enough that the miners will not be effected


[23-Feb-19 05:26 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
nothing in the algorithm changed, just the design of the block template


[23-Feb-19 05:29 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

[23-Feb-19 05:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
a buddy of mine suggested some home automation tool, to turn appliances on/off, hooked up to the power strip/etc


[23-Feb-19 05:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
let's just say, my DC is not easy to get to, and everything possible needs to be remote.


[23-Feb-19 05:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
and i don't want to use AC, but i might need a way to turn AC on and off, when it's fucking 110F outside


[23-Feb-19 05:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
43.3 C outside, for everyone else in the world


[23-Feb-19 05:57 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
It might sound trite, but the honest answer is:
Use enough ventilation to where you never need to think about that.
As far as being OCD and micromanaging goes, I modded and updated https://github.com/cryptoGlance/cryptoGlance-web-app as my "remote control"

I started with a massive AC unit and quickly abandoned the idea for dehumidifier units
I did shut down my personal sha units last summer because of heat costs, but that more due to my being too lazy to fix one of the exhaust fans than anything else
The real key is getting hot,stale air __out__, even if it's replaced with only slightly cooler fresh air, it will make a massive difference to get all the "used" air out ASAP

for testpools, I run a virtualBox with a VM with ubuntu where I install yiimp. You can split yiimp on several servers/VM for a production pool (more secure and best performances) but for a testpool, you can run everything on 1 VM. Yiimp is composed of several components:
- webpages that can be used for the front-end (you can use apache, nginx or whatever web server)
- the same webpages that must be used for back-end (some scripts are launched inside screens) to perform payments and trading is enabled
- a MySQL database
- coin daemons running and synced
All the above is pretty much standard and the only component that require chosen dependancies is the stratum. Yiimp stratum require a dozen of packages on ubuntu and I think that finding these things in debian can be done.

@phm87 my problem isn't what to do once installed, my problem is everyone builds everything for Ubuntu (which is by its very nature less stable than Debain) so I can't ever get it to install.
I guess I can spin up a 90 gajillionth machine and put Ubuntu on it, I'd just rather that people wrote "Linux" stuff for Linux and not write Ubuntu stuff and call it "Linux"

[23-Feb-19 06:55 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
do you know of a step-by-step install doc for yiimp?
I'm not opposed to installing manually, it's just that the manual instructions I've seen assume you already know certain things that I do not


[23-Feb-19 06:56 AM] phm87#7395

[23-Feb-19 09:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's very hard to manage the risk of maintaining internal forks versus collab'ing with open source libraries, sometimes it could go either way

Maybe crackers can share with you his equihash code (and ZEC rpc stuff). You can ask him

[23-Feb-19 09:32 AM] phm87#7395
I agree with you about that writing everything is difficult: I failed during months on adding equihash myself but tpruvot/epsylon3 developed equihash into yiimp/ccminer in 2 or 3 days (crackers told me this)


[23-Feb-19 09:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
an update would be a nominal cost because it's a relatively minor amount of changes
a full write would take much time away from existing projects and as such cost significantly more
it's not a matter of "difficult" as much as time invested (which as duke pointed out is also time invested in creating competition against myself)

@ComputerGenie  about equihash implementation that @! zpool.ca | crackers  is running, I think that he could share it with you. I am not sure but we can ask him


[23-Feb-19 09:46 AM] phm87#7395
Equihash is part of the secret sauce as explained by @dukeleto  but this implementation is dying (not maintained) and I think that no coin without equihash and without ZEC rpc encoding added sapling


[23-Feb-19 10:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
if you think about the maintainers of open source software, trying to support hundreds of different coins, the sapling upgrade is a huge pain. no one is motivated to do it for free, because it just helps your competitors. It's specialty software, completely un-related to any "normal" Bitcoin fork


[23-Feb-19 10:26 AM] ! zpool.ca | crackers#9719
@ComputerGenie you don‚Äôt need equihash for sapling. You can try with the coin KOTO which changed the algo to yescrypt. @dukeleto I‚Äôve offered a bounty for 1000 kmd but no takers


[23-Feb-19 10:27 AM] phm87#7395
I disagree with you @! zpool.ca | crackers : koto is still using ZEC encoding stuff and I read comments on their githubs saying that the koto sapling implementation is not standard


[23-Feb-19 10:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
@! zpool.ca | crackers it's a reasonable bounty for somebody really knowledgeable about that stuff and C++ json parsers, and that is not me üòÉ


[23-Feb-19 10:33 AM] phm87#7395
But koto is a good starting point if someone can do the zec rpc stuff + koto adapted a nomp and I found a ccminer for koto with sapling. But ccminer coding is new for me and koto ccminer is different from tpruvot ccminer


[23-Feb-19 10:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
i did go so far as to read the source of yiimp and ccminer, both are not easy to "slip into"


[23-Feb-19 10:35 AM] phm87#7395
I agree


[23-Feb-19 10:35 AM] dukeleto#7326

I am still learning a lot


[23-Feb-19 10:37 AM] phm87#7395
In ccminer of tpruvot there is an equi folder where you can find equi-stratum.cpp in which coinb2 is filled. I think that the hashfinalsaplingroot (coming from getblocktemplate of kmd) should arrive in coinb2


[23-Feb-19 10:39 AM] phm87#7395
I used WireShark to analyse packets when mining equihash on zpool (equihash coins without sapling) and the parameter value related to coinb2 is 32 times 0. In komodo code I read sth similar: hashfinalsaplingroot wad many 0 before the sapling upgrade


[23-Feb-19 10:40 AM] phm87#7395
I should mine kmd on a kmd nomp pool and analyze packets and compare


[23-Feb-19 10:45 AM] dukeleto#7326
that fact that you need wireshark to figure out how to write the code, is telling. There is no documentation for this stuff


[23-Feb-19 10:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
which is another moat against competitors


[23-Feb-19 10:59 AM] phm87#7395
I am not a developer (professionnally) but some yiimp pool operators who are developed were able to add an algo easily by copypaste c++ of coin into stratum and ccminer. I was never able to do it (except few easy changes of existing algos such as yescrypt variants)


[23-Feb-19 10:59 AM] phm87#7395
I agree that it is sad that there is no documentation


[23-Feb-19 11:01 AM] phm87#7395
A guy made a PR into yiimp to add a poor, bad and unreliable documentation. I replied to many PR to help a bit but not this one (because there was too much to say)


[23-Feb-19 11:02 AM] phm87#7395
But to compare, I found no documentation on nomp and related miner (closed source for all kmd miners I found until now)


[23-Feb-19 11:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@! zpool.ca | crackers Not sure why you'd suggest KOTO when you already have ZEC working, the ZEC bits are the exact bits that need to be duplicated/changed


[23-Feb-19 11:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
it might just make sense, for a few pools to come together and pay a 3rd party dev to write open source code everybody uses and maintains together. Everybody gets less technical debt, but no one mining pools pays the entire "help your competitor" fee, it's shared


[23-Feb-19 11:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
just a thought


[23-Feb-19 11:05 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

This is where there seems to be a communication breakdown...
When you 1st posted, I has mistakenly assumed that's the point you were at as well
If I had those bits and a working set of instructions to install yiimp **and** those bits it would take hardly any time to update it to sapling
Crackers seems to want someone to reinvent what he already has ü§∑üèΩ


[23-Feb-19 11:28 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
from something that works and can be tested, the conversion from sprout to sapling isn't that massive of a thing to do
starting from scratch is


[23-Feb-19 11:36 AM] phm87#7395
As equihash implementation on zpool is old and not maintained, maybe it can be better to run a nomp for kmd and adapt nomp to allow bitcoin addresses and make nomp fills yiimp db (for trading). Then you won t need equihash into yiimp. Honestly I think that adding nomp within yiimp is more work than adding sapling


[23-Feb-19 11:37 AM] phm87#7395
About equihash, as I suggest earlier, I think that crackers could share with you his equihash implementation to let you have rejected blocks of zec/kmd (point where I am)


[23-Feb-19 11:37 AM] phm87#7395
Sorry for the communication problems


[23-Feb-19 11:40 AM] phm87#7395
Zergpool did it: he is using nomp pool within yiimp but he share nothing as opensource. Zergpool have the other equihash variants. If you are able to do this, I am pretty sure that it is worth much more of 1000 kmd but we should ask crackers


[23-Feb-19 11:42 AM] phm87#7395
I hope that you understood that I don t want that you code the whole equihash and ZEC rpc encoding (block headers ...). And I think that koto coin is using ZEC rpc style so yiimp stock cannot mine it whatever if koto is on yescrypt (opensource algo)


[23-Feb-19 11:44 AM] phm87#7395
I will ask @! zpool.ca | crackers  about sharing equihash with sapling devs and what price he would pay for the code to add nomp into yiimp. I made some small adaptations of yiimp to display nomp api data but crackers would require code for trading and graphs

[23-Feb-19 12:13 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
` I think that crackers could share with you his equihash implementation to let you have rejected blocks of zec/kmd (point where I am)`

`I imagined that you know equihash is not opensource when you said this...`
equihash is massively open sourced, the yiimp/yaamp module for inside the stratum isn't


[23-Feb-19 12:14 PM] phm87#7395
Yes


[23-Feb-19 12:14 PM] phm87#7395

[23-Feb-19 12:15 PM] phm87#7395
I explained few days ago in private to @metaphilibert  that zpool equihash stratum implementation is not opemsource

(Sorry a few words were missing in my sentence)


[23-Feb-19 12:17 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`zpool equihash stratum implementation is not opemsource`
Correct; for whatever insane reason, @! zpool.ca | crackers would rather have just ZEC than share it and have a full setup

I will share with you what I found on github (koto nomp, koto ccminer, equihash old ccminer) but I cannot decide to share with you equihash zpool stratum code (but I will ask crackers several times)

`Was this supposed to be asic resistant?`
The "ASIC resistance" of equihash alone is the cost and throughput of RAM and nothing more.
The "ASIC resistance" of Komodo is 'we don't need to resist growth and technological advancements' because of intelligence, NNs, and dPoW

[26-Feb-19 09:32 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
depends on how close your miners are to your box
if they are close, you just need different breakers, heavier wire, and 15 or 20 amp outlets

@ComputerGenie at 5c/kwh, how big would the difference of 220 vs 110 be? I can see adding 220v, and  transitioning all miners to it over the next 2yrs, but not redo-ing my current 110v stuff


[26-Feb-19 09:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
that partially depends on the PSU, but with "average" that I've used there's a 20-25% increase in max watts per PSU and iirc 8-15% in effeciency


[26-Feb-19 10:01 AM] FishyGuts#5085
Must have been an old link I ended up at.


[26-Feb-19 10:50 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@dukeleto  a couple of things if you are residential that 5c/kWh  is probably supply side only , make sure you add up all the costs (distribution, transmission,  fees etc.)  it‚Äôs not too hard to run a 240v circuit run. Need 10 AWG 3 wire .  30A double pole breaker and outlet and PDU with appropriate plug.   The main benefits of running at higher voltage is that you can get more miners in per circuit ( I=V/R). and efficiency increase,  Current generates heat ( W=I ^2*R)  , conductors like copper increase their resistance based on heat resulting in less efficiency.


[26-Feb-19 10:52 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Tldr: costs are a little bit higher with electric company with 110v, generates more heat and run less miners per circuit


[26-Feb-19 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog very good details, thanks. There is a $30/month "service fee" and 5.11 cents/kwh, so yes, my monthly cost approaches 5.11 cents/kwh with more power use, averaging the total cost. It's cheap hydro power from a dam a few miles away üòÉ


[26-Feb-19 01:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
i will definitely add a 240v circuit in the near term, now that I see all the benefits


[26-Feb-19 01:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
mostly, for the room to expand, on a fixed amperage, but the efficiency and less heat is really nice too. just makes sense

[26-Feb-19 01:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog is the breaker the same, just needs to be double pole 30amp, correct? Or are there 110 breakers and 240 breakers?


[26-Feb-19 01:44 PM] dukeleto#7326
i installed the breakers and gfci outlets of the 110v, so i know the basics


[26-Feb-19 01:45 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, i hate how there are proprietary breaker types, ugh. Just wanted to complain about it.


[26-Feb-19 01:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just double pole 30amp is right,  don‚Äôt think there is a double pole for 110v because that would be ungrounding the circuit ( cutting it off entirely but could pose a safety hazard if somehow device is energized despite switch being off ) ,  your panel manufacturer should have its recommended breaker.


[26-Feb-19 01:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Neutral goes to bar so not sure how it would work on 110v double pole tbh lol


[26-Feb-19 01:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Double poles are 240v so no worries

[26-Feb-19 01:56 PM] dukeleto#7326
sounds like i need new breakers, thick cable, PDU and compatible PSUs (some do both)

Hi, I really like this project; bitcoin level security, blockchain and Dapp development .. just too much to list.  I have a GPU garden, ( little smaller than a farm ), but found it unproductive to GPU mine KMD.  Can anyone tell me what I prospectively could expect if I pickup a used Z9 mini to start off with?  Please advise .. thank you.  Respectfully, George


[26-Feb-19 01:57 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Psu is probably compatible already most are 120-240v .

@WX2 welcome. You found the right place. Get comfy and learn from all the smart people in here

i thought so, but my brain always assumes worst case üòÉ


[26-Feb-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
i try to buy quality PSUs, EVGA and Corsair for deskstop stuff. I still have more CPU miners than ASICs, but that will change soon


[26-Feb-19 01:58 PM] dukeleto#7326
also, PSUs rated to 50F, because i have issues with overheating. My biggest concern is overheating in summer


[26-Feb-19 01:58 PM] WX2#7746
Thank you Duke; I have been lurking for a while .. it just took me to long to mine a handful of KMD with 32 GPU's


[26-Feb-19 01:59 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@WX2  kmd is strange with mining because notaries mine the majority, better to mine something like pirate and convert in.


[26-Feb-19 01:59 PM] dukeleto#7326
@WX2 1 or 2 z9m are fine to dip your toe, but otherwise, they are inefficient, and you want a9 or a9+

which gives you dozens of options


[26-Feb-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
what @polycryptoblog is saying, is you want to speculatively mine a KMD AC, and then sell it for KMD, versus mining KMD directly


[26-Feb-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
it's like mining other coins and trading for BTC, instead of mining BTC directly


[26-Feb-19 02:01 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can also do all of the above


[26-Feb-19 02:02 PM] WX2#7746

some are external coins, but most are KMD ACs, that is probably the best list of them all


[26-Feb-19 02:03 PM] dukeleto#7326
HUSH is currently an external coin, but it's becoming an AC. Either way, you can mine it with same HW


[26-Feb-19 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
you can also mine ZEC/ZEN/VOT/SAFE(!) and maybe a few other coins with the same equihash (200,9) variant


[26-Feb-19 02:04 PM] dukeleto#7326
KMD is indeed one of the most attractive, tho. that is why we are all here üòÉ


[26-Feb-19 02:05 PM] dukeleto#7326
GPU mining on KMD is in the past, i don't recommend it. ASICs are here, and they prevent secret FPGA mining


[26-Feb-19 02:06 PM] WX2#7746
Does ARRR obfuscate with mixins and rings like LOKI or XMR, or more like ZEC?

So, based on the suggestion, ( not financial advise ) if I am mining ETC at 1,003 Mh/s pulling down 77.33953 ETC / 0.086233 BTC = estimated $337.973 a month; it would be better just to flip that into KMD then to dip my big toe in with a Z9 mini .. trying to run the numbers and get a little smarter.

you can probably mine VRSC on those GPUs, but you want asics for equihash

also, there are FPGAs on VRSC now, at least 2 kinds


[26-Feb-19 02:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@WX2 and yes, you could buy $337 in KMD per month, and start getting 5% kmd apr on that, and mine KMD and/or ARRR/HUSH/ZEC/etc...

I was also looking into a low voltage FPGA called an atom miner; but I cannot find any feedback on it; so I am not sure if it is a scam, and have not been able to get a reply from the website but if it is true; it wouldn't take a large solar setup to run.  About a six AGM battery bank to run 64 FPGA atom miner cards.

Hiya, when setting up znomp/kmdnomp, does it need to be installed on a different pc from the pc you are mining on or can you just run ccminer/whatever on the same instance? At the moment im trying to mine from the same pc that ive installed it on, but it doesnt seem to connect properly :)


[01-Mar-19 05:34 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
firewall would be the only thing stopping it on same or different PC

that is a beast, for 1500 sq ft. I am dealing with 100sq ft and it must be on a wall, about ~9ft high near the interior roof line


[07-Mar-19 09:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
I have been reading a lot about hot isle containment, that datacenter people write about. It's fascinating stuff


[07-Mar-19 09:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
so the plan is to suck in cold air from under the building at the floor, and push the hottest air out at the top near the roof line


[07-Mar-19 09:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
and i will have some kind of tent/containment system to isolate hot exhaust air and funnel it up and out


[07-Mar-19 09:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
it can easily get 110F outside here, and unfortunately my structure gets full sun during part of the day. Heat is my biggest issue


[07-Mar-19 09:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
when I started, it was a 6'x12' room with 1 for intake and 1 for exhaust :troll:


[07-Mar-19 09:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
i am dealing with 8x14'


[07-Mar-19 09:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
but before amps or physical space, or ethernet ports, cooling is my biggest limiting factor


[07-Mar-19 09:57 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I like the idea of using floor air, but my personal building is on a slab ‚òπ


[07-Mar-19 09:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
i must lock down a better cooling system before i can scale up


[07-Mar-19 09:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
i never insulated the floor of this structure, so it has very accessible cool air, that I can suck up thru the floor, into miner intake fans


[07-Mar-19 09:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
sweet


[07-Mar-19 09:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
i plan to suck in air on the north side as well, to get the coldest air from under the building


[07-Mar-19 09:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the key to remember that exhaust volume is pretty much the main importance


[07-Mar-19 09:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
how do i calculate how much CFM exhaust I should have?


[07-Mar-19 09:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

Hi, I'm having some problems with finding ZEX blocks on my mining pool. All other coins are working fine including KMD, ARRR, ZCL and HUSH. I'm using S-NOMP with the following config file for ZEX:{
"name": "ZADDEX",
"symbol": "ZEX",
"algorithm": "equihash",
"sapling": true,
"requireShielding": true
}
My komodod command line is: ./komodod -ac_founders=1 -addnode=5.9.102.210 -ac_name=ZEX -ac_reward=13000000000 -ac_pubkey=039d4a50cc70d1184e462a22edb3b66385da97cc8059196f8305c184a3e21440af -ac_cc=2 -ac_halving=525600 

The error that NPM throws is  "We thought a block was found, but it was rejected by the daemon"

The matching error line in the debug file is ERROR: ProcessNewBlock: CheckBlock FAILED

My guess is that something is wrong with one of the config files above. Just to add tried the same thing with knomp and got the same errors

P.S. -NPM isn't throwing that error, your pool software is


[16-Mar-19 05:57 AM] dukeleto#7326
@newvulcan probably related to your pool not dealing with founder reward correctly


[16-Mar-19 05:58 AM] dukeleto#7326
@newvulcan if your pool wants to support the new KMD AC version of HUSH, plz join Hush discord and I can add you to a channel for pool ops:  http://myhush.org/discord/

Show foundersreward in getblocktemplate if ac_founders enabled by ...
This enables mining pools to have KMD AC daemons tell the pool software which blocks contain the FR, instead of it being something hard-coded by admins in a config file.
This was suggested by LuckPool

@dukeleto  
I already made a pool and all that that does all of that automatically... although it might not be what you want, because it limits everything to Knomp only.


[16-Mar-19 07:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User it sounds nice to be able to give potential pool ops a known-working setup with Knomp


[16-Mar-19 07:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
i will also make sure snomp works ok, because that is used a lot

[16-Mar-19 07:40 AM] Deleted User#0000
It depends what coinbase your going to use.. .just founders reward, I think its ok to use your fix, but anyhting more complicated, the pool simply cant take its fee from the coinbase reliably.

The only way to do that is to put calls back into the daemon

I was reffering to the part where it takes the fee from the coinbase ... the rest of it is kind of required


[16-Mar-19 07:47 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@dukeleto There's no real way to "drop in" to s/z/k/nomp that allows pool fees (that's always been the inherent issue) without adding to the daemon template


[16-Mar-19 07:48 AM] Deleted User#0000
Using just the founders rweard and burning fees, you can usea normal pool... provided it can build the right signatures

[16-Mar-19 07:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
imo, one of the major issues is that most folks don't really understand where "stratum" ends and "a pool" begins, so it's all just a jumbled mess that needs to be redone from the ground up with no care or concept of the notion of "backwards compatibility" with s/z/k/nomp
And as I read that it makes me cringe that there are an ever growing number of letters to / as well as giving me a sense of deja vu

well, in trying to perfect payments on pirate solo, I've been toying with both the idea of polling back in daemon as well as just going back to slush's original py stratum and starting over


[16-Mar-19 08:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
When I started with the knomp coinbase thing .. my idea was to offload basically everything (includeing verify hashes) back to the daemon


[16-Mar-19 08:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
that way a pool would work with litterally every algo

it would be standard ... and "just work" with every Assetchain any one could ever invent


[16-Mar-19 08:04 AM] newvulcan#9571
I've implemented that change to mining.cpp, so I'll see what happens. Currently s-nomp is giving a "Error, founders reward missing for block template!" every now and then - not an error or warning just appears to be a statement of fact.

I just couldnt figure out how to connect them together at the time ... maybe I could do it now


[16-Mar-19 08:08 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
well, eq verify is more about share counts and "fairness" in payments than anything else


[16-Mar-19 08:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes... .which is why I couldnt work it out ...


[16-Mar-19 08:08 AM] Deleted User#0000
I thaught it was just veriifying a found block...


[16-Mar-19 08:09 AM] Deleted User#0000
but its not... That would be something I need help with, as Im not sure how it works or what exactly it does


[16-Mar-19 08:10 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the short answer is that it verifies that a share is a legitimate solution 
if yes, then share counts
if no, then miner gets no credit for the share


[16-Mar-19 08:11 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
deep in the math there are shares that are "valid" but not legitimate üòï


[16-Mar-19 08:11 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
so without it a "miner" could just send "fake" shares and get credit over and over


[16-Mar-19 08:11 AM] Deleted User#0000
I see my pool sometimes rejects shares from it, not sure if thats a miner problem though... my guess is that its a miner submiting an invliad share


[16-Mar-19 08:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
So basically the RPC has to do equihashverify on a share?


[16-Mar-19 08:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
just return true or false?


[16-Mar-19 08:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
as long as there wasnt too many flooding... it would be ok... but daemon RPC gets overloaded easily


[16-Mar-19 08:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
Also needs a way to choose what hash algo to verify ... wihout just moving all the complexity to the daemon side


[16-Mar-19 08:13 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yeah, I think flooding was the reason they offset it to it's own executable, because the larger the pool the more demand that would put on the daemon


[16-Mar-19 08:16 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`Also needs a way to choose what hash algo to verify ...`
that should be roughly "easy", the base is there already to support K,N and "networks", so in theory it would be just adding the new modules (obviously more in work than words, but in principle it should work)

Whoever is trying to mine KMD at chickenpool.com with address `RWdQye1bgJiwKcAFKgtX6fGure8JwDmVKN`, please let me know what miner you're using
`mining.suggest_target` is supported by almost no pool on the planet and your miner isn't connecting because of it; perhaps we can get together and find a work-around


[16-Mar-19 02:22 PM] vulcan#5394
@blackjok3r @dukeleto I've redone my knomp install and even rebooted so I've got a clean startup. No errors now, but no blocks found either. Beginning to think my copy of the blockchain might be corrupt. Is that a possibility, if so whats the best way to resync/reindex it ?


[16-Mar-19 02:23 PM] vulcan#5394
Btw Im hitting this server with 200kh/s, so i should be finding at least 1 block per hour of ZEX


[16-Mar-19 02:27 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
that you haven't found a block does not mean there is an issue
your "expected" is an "on average" basis and only comes true over a long term
there are times where chickenpool has went 10+ hrs without finding a KMD block with double the hashrate as it had when it was finding 1 every 1-1.5 hrs
bad luck factually happens (I recall slush hitting a BTC block last year at like 2000x expected)

did you start the daemon with `-pubkey`?

it's not the same

do `komodo-cli -ac_name=ZEX validateaddress $(komodo-cli -ac_name=ZEX getnewaddress)`


[16-Mar-19 02:38 PM] Alright#0419
take the `"pubkey"` from that and start the daemon with `-pubkey=<pubkey>`


[16-Mar-19 02:38 PM] Alright#0419
do not change ac_pubkey, you must leave that


[16-Mar-19 02:39 PM] Alright#0419
then in the `knomp/pool_configs/ZEX.json` file you must set the addresses to the address the pubkey is for

the one shown in validateaddress output


[16-Mar-19 02:40 PM] Alright#0419
you need `"disablecb":  "true"` in the `knomp/coins/ZEX.json` as well

I think this probably has a very quick answer. Can you run multiple instances of node. That's to say, can I run knomp and snomp simultaneously ? I've got KMD, ARRR and ZEX running successfully on knomp, and ZCL and HUSH running successfully on snomp. At the moment when I try, the second instance of npm I try and run fails.

Kinda answering my own question, but in case anyone is interested  - yes you can run k-nomp and s-nomp together. Just make sure the website ports are different and also the cli is listening on a different port too.

as far as I can tell, it's a GPU miner using BFG üòï


[17-Mar-19 09:15 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
they kept "pre-connecting" with `mining.suggest_target` and it was a pure flat value showing
once I nulled `mining.suggest_target`, that's the result
so either the shares math is off or `mining.suggest_target` allows for something funky
(and yes I have tolower)


[17-Mar-19 09:18 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

[17-Mar-19 09:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
they've found valid blocks, so I'm operating on the assumption that shares are factually valid (or at least that it's not an intentional "share scam")


[17-Mar-19 09:28 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
might be something different, I just assumed bfg because that silliness was luke's idea and bfg is his iirc

Their github would say diffrently üòâ


[19-Mar-19 03:43 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So if they change algo there is going to be a tonne of miners shifting their farms onto KMD and ecosystem. Hmm...


[19-Mar-19 03:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
That would require a higher kmd price to support mining costs


[19-Mar-19 03:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
More hash divided over same amount of rewards, so reward/hash lowers, so the value of rewards needs to increase in order for the miners to make it profitable?


[19-Mar-19 03:52 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It would. The miners with higher cost would be pushed out. But where else would the equihash farms go


[19-Mar-19 04:45 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
If the landscape changed and farms needed a new target, it's far more likely that they would pick PIRATE than KMD

hi all, let me try to ask here too... i am trying to figure out how exactly to calculate (average) kmd profit based on difficulty and variable hash rate?


[20-Mar-19 05:02 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
currently i am trying to use formula like: `input_hashrate / (current_net_difficulty * 8192) * block_reward * 3600` for hourly calculation, but comparing with some other calculators, my numbers are way too much lower...


[20-Mar-19 05:02 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
this formula is based on zcash and as far as i understood `8192` is some work size on zcash, not sure if that's the same figure for KMD too?


[20-Mar-19 05:11 AM] CHMEX#0686
I'm no miner but if I look at the pirate calc this should be the calculation:

input_hashrate / current_net_difficulty * 3 * 60 * 0.25

@CHMEX ok i see... didn't know about notaries part...


[20-Mar-19 05:13 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
let me try that out a bit


[20-Mar-19 05:13 AM] CHMEX#0686
also there are sometimes big blocks found


[20-Mar-19 05:13 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
but also, where did you see that pirate calcl?


[20-Mar-19 05:14 AM] CHMEX#0686
biggest so far 55k KMD


[20-Mar-19 05:14 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
55k KMD reward??

oh my!!


[20-Mar-19 05:15 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i didn't know it can escalate so much


[20-Mar-19 05:16 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
but is there a way to get info about block reward from daemon maybe?


[20-Mar-19 05:16 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i have noticed that Pirate for example has it in `getinfo` response, but i cannot find it for KMD


[20-Mar-19 05:17 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
also, sorry for noobish questions, equihash is something i never worked with, all this is fairly new to me


[20-Mar-19 05:18 AM] CHMEX#0686
the block reward is 3


[20-Mar-19 05:18 AM] CHMEX#0686
correct it does not have it in the response


[20-Mar-19 05:20 AM] CHMEX#0686
if you have questions just post them here 
There are some very knowlegable and professional ( equihash ) miner reading

üëç tyvm!


[20-Mar-19 05:48 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@CHMEX thanks for that calculations info, but it seems to me that this is also missing some part here...
```
input_hashrate / current_net_difficulty * 3 Block Reward * 60 Mins * 0.25 Free for all mining
1000/290852329*256*0.25 = 0.00022
```


[20-Mar-19 05:48 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
this is for pirate, therefore 256 block reward


[20-Mar-19 05:49 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
but anyways, if i multiply my result with 3600 seconds, i am nowhere close to what calculator you linked is suggesting (around 5 Pirate for 1ksol)


[20-Mar-19 05:50 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i made my calculations with 1kh/s actually, but i suppose that's the same thing?


[20-Mar-19 05:50 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
for PIRATE, remove the `* 0.25`


[20-Mar-19 05:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
for KMD, you `* 0.25` because Notaries create ~75% of the blocks, so you have a "max" of 25% possible


[20-Mar-19 05:51 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@ComputerGenie ok, i can do that, but still not even close to 5 Pirate :/ not even 0.5 with my calc


[20-Mar-19 05:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
290852329 is the difficulty


[20-Mar-19 05:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
not the nethash


[20-Mar-19 05:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
76.56Mh/s is nethash


[20-Mar-19 05:53 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@Cryptoon yeah, that's what i'm trying to use in my calculation... difficulty...

[20-Mar-19 05:53 AM] Cryptoon#3362
dont you need input hash/total hash instead of input hash/net diff?


[20-Mar-19 05:54 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
my only input is miner's hash rate... everything else should be provided by daemon...


[20-Mar-19 05:54 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
well, "everything" =) that's difficulty and reward only...


[20-Mar-19 05:54 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
let's say i can use constant reward...


[20-Mar-19 05:55 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
and diff is something i'm getting from daemon...


[20-Mar-19 05:55 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
as we speak, these are my numbers: `1000/303999827.12*256*3600*0.25`


[20-Mar-19 05:55 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
and that's around `0.75`


[20-Mar-19 05:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So the formula is: 1000/76560000*256*60*24


[20-Mar-19 05:56 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ah sorry for 0.25 again ^^


[20-Mar-19 05:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
1000/76560000 * 256 * 60*24


[20-Mar-19 05:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
which is 4,8


[20-Mar-19 05:57 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ah, so you are telling that i should use net hash instead of difficulty??


[20-Mar-19 05:57 AM] CHMEX#0686
Yes


[20-Mar-19 05:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think so?


[20-Mar-19 05:58 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902

[20-Mar-19 06:01 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
right! very similar to what i did, apart from my stuff being written in that javascript "programming language" =)


[20-Mar-19 06:01 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ok, yeah, i was using difficulty all the time, that's why all my calculations were off


[20-Mar-19 06:02 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
such calculations work for cryptonote coins, so i just tried to apply something similar here, but obviously it doesn't work that way...


[20-Mar-19 06:03 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`being written in that javascript "programming language" ` Oh that causes so much pain to my brain


[20-Mar-19 06:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the calc is the same for all coins (the only exception is ones that have designated block producers)
your block count will always be what your hash can get out of the total


[20-Mar-19 06:05 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
BTC, PIRATE, CoinX
will all use the same formula

@ComputerGenie lol sorry for brain pain, i totally feel you there =)) but when you say that "calc is the same for all coins", you refer to equihash coins, right?


[20-Mar-19 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
no, all coimns


[20-Mar-19 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
there it total hashrate


[20-Mar-19 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
X


[20-Mar-19 06:52 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i mean, for cryptonote coins for example, i am using difficulty for calculations... and net hash rate is nothing but difficulty divided by block time...


[20-Mar-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
you have some percentage of the total hashrate


[20-Mar-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
you will get that exact percentage of coins mined on a statistical basisi


[20-Mar-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
using diff makes things totally different


[20-Mar-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
use your hashrate and nethash


[20-Mar-19 06:53 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@jl777c yeah i realized that "using diff makes things totally different" just recently, but still trying to explain to myself why is that so


[20-Mar-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
because the diff cal from nethash is nonlinear


[20-Mar-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
diff calc


[20-Mar-19 06:55 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`i am using difficulty for calculations`
it's literally the same calculation
the only difference is the coin name, nothing else


[20-Mar-19 06:56 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
for example, my calc for cryptonote coins is simple as `(hr * 86400seconds / difficulty) * block_reward / coins_sig_divisor`


[20-Mar-19 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
and all you want to know is what percentage of coins you will get, then just calculate what percentage of hashrate you have


[20-Mar-19 06:56 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
which is pretty different from equihash


[20-Mar-19 06:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
what is `coins_sig_divisor` in "layman's terms"?


[20-Mar-19 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
you can use cryptonote nethash to calculate your percentage


[20-Mar-19 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
you are really overcomplicating this

{Reactions}
üëÜüèΩ 

[20-Mar-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
each hash has the same chance as another


[20-Mar-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
there are a total of T hashes in the network. you are doing X % of it -> you get X% of coins


[20-Mar-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
it is basic algrebra


[20-Mar-19 06:57 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@ComputerGenie it's a definition of the smallest coin denomination... e.g. daemon always treats values without decimals - 1 monero is actually 1000000000000 in daemon's terms... so you just use "sig divisor" to divide that raw value and you get amount in coins...


[20-Mar-19 06:58 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@jl777c well, that's what i thought too in the beginning :)) but using equihash numbers in same formula didn't actually produce desired result... but since i imagine that it should work the same, let me try it now again a bit just out of curiosity


[20-Mar-19 07:01 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`it's a definition of the smallest coin denomination.`
then the only difference between what you "normally" use and what I gave you is how many decimal places the result is
if that works for cryptonote, then it will work for sha255, eqiuhash, and/or newAlgoX


[20-Mar-19 07:03 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@ComputerGenie yeah, of course, i was trying to ignore that part of equation or "fake" it in some way to get proper result back.. but let me check a bit again now...


[20-Mar-19 07:03 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
but speaking of that "sig divisor" value...


[20-Mar-19 07:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
there's nothing to "fake"
if there are 1440 blocks per day and you have 10% of the hashrate, then you will get 144 blocks (on average)


[20-Mar-19 07:04 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i see that ARRR `getinfo` response has `"reward"` value in it, which shows `"reward": "25600000000"`


[20-Mar-19 07:04 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i wonder how can one tell which value should be used here for division?


[20-Mar-19 07:04 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
is that defined somewhere in source code?


[20-Mar-19 07:05 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
because for cryptonote coins it is... https://github.com/monero-project/monero/blob/master/src/cryptonote_config.h#L67

[20-Mar-19 07:05 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's in satoshis, so you move the decimal 8 places to get 256


[20-Mar-19 07:05 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ah, so in equihash it's always 8?


[20-Mar-19 07:05 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
cn can have different values there really, which renders out coin's value with more or less decimal places...


[20-Mar-19 07:06 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`is that defined somewhere in source code?`
it's defined in the params of PIRATE `-ac_reward=25600000000`


[20-Mar-19 07:06 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
alright, i understand it now


[20-Mar-19 07:06 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
thanks a bunch, let me try to play around with this calculator now a bit more


[20-Mar-19 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
it has nothing to do with the hashing algo, the number of decimals


[20-Mar-19 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
there are some coins that have 7 or even just 6 decimals and they could be using whatever hashing algo


[20-Mar-19 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
getblocksubsidy is what you can use to find the blocksubsidy for a height


[20-Mar-19 07:08 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
unless you mess it up like webby did :troll:


[20-Mar-19 07:09 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@jl777c i know it has nothing to do with algo, i was just curious if thing like this exists in equihash coins or not... i like the fact that it doesn't, it really just complicates things for no reason...


[20-Mar-19 07:10 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
`getblocksubsidy` you say? let me check what's that and where to get it


[20-Mar-19 07:11 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ah right, it's a command, not part of the answer...


[20-Mar-19 07:12 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ok, so this should give me the exact block reward value for given block, right? no need to deduct anything from that value?


[20-Mar-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
there will be txfees added to that amount


[20-Mar-19 07:14 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ok, and ofc, if some asset defined some custom rewards too, as per explanation in docs


[20-Mar-19 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
there are some chains where it wont be easy to calculate the blocksubsidy


[20-Mar-19 07:15 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i see, yeah, might get a bit more complicated...


[20-Mar-19 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
just let the daemon create the coinbase


[20-Mar-19 07:16 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ok, i hope this will be enough for the beginning until i learn a bit more about the philosophy of KMD platform


[20-Mar-19 07:18 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@jl777c does that mean that all assets on KMD platform have to be run with custom value in `-ac_reward` flag? otherwise it will inherit block reward amount from KMD itself?


[20-Mar-19 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
no


[20-Mar-19 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
the default is 0.0001 per block if not specified


[20-Mar-19 07:19 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ah ok! but how does komodo then has 3 as reward while i didn't use that flag at all?

[20-Mar-19 07:23 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i keep forgetting about those, as i said i'm fairly new in equihash world, and for cryptonote coins this thing simply doesn't exist... all is defined in a single file in source code and when you build your daemon, those parameters are applied...


[20-Mar-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
this has nothing to do with equihash


[20-Mar-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
KMD just happens to use equihash and KMD has added a lot of things to the baseline


[20-Mar-19 07:29 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ah right, equihash is just an algorithm, ofc


[20-Mar-19 07:30 AM] gcharang#6833

@gcharang ok i understand now about shell script... but still, i didn't run my kmd daemon with any flag at all.... does that mean that i'm using it wrong in the first place?

but sorry for dumb question again, can you explain where is for example KMD block reward defined then?


[20-Mar-19 07:35 AM] gcharang#6833
It is like a special case and is hard coded
For any other chain created using Komodo daemon, it will follow the flags


[20-Mar-19 07:37 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
understood!


[20-Mar-19 07:37 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
thanks a lot to all for helping out with clarifying things in my mind!!

@jl777c i was playing around with this basic algebra stuff but i still think that i cannot apply my CN formula for the same calculation in KMD (or any other equihash i suppose)... this is not extremely important tbh, i'm just trying to clarify things to myself, but allow me to explain... in CN coins, daemon never reports "network hash rate" in any response whatsoever... if one wants to calculate network hash rate, it's a simple division of difficulty by block time (e.g. current Monero diff is 36.5b, block time is 120sec, therefore net hash rate is ~300MH/s). so to calculate profit based on hash rate, it's simple as `(hr/diff)*reward`...


[20-Mar-19 10:42 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
however, the relation between difficulty and net hash rate for KMD simply doesn't add up in any way :/


[20-Mar-19 10:43 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
for example... current KMD diff is `212764720`, block time is `62`... that should give us that net hash rate is `3431689` Sol/s i suppose


[20-Mar-19 10:44 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
or `3.4MSol/s`.... but that's not the case... it looks like current net hash rate is `56` MSol/s


[20-Mar-19 10:44 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
and that's a huge difference there...


[20-Mar-19 10:45 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i know i am averaging some things here, but even with that the difference is way to big to be affected by my averaging...


[20-Mar-19 10:45 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i am missing some piece of the puzzle for sure


[20-Mar-19 10:49 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
before asking here, i tried to figure out why my calculations for KMD don't fit into CN formula and at one point i came across this forum thread (https://forum.zcashcommunity.com/t/help-calculating-profit-per-day-making-my-own-profitability-calculator/20151/9) where people are usually using this `sol/block modifier` or `work size` as they refer to it, with this magical number of `8192`... but to be honest, even with that, my calculation was never right... that's why after a while i came here to ask what am i doing wrong here...


[20-Mar-19 10:53 AM] Alright#0419
didn't quite do the math, but I think you can use 56msol in the calculation. This should include notary "hashrate"


[20-Mar-19 10:55 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@Alright yeah, that was apparently my main problem in my calculation, because i tried to use difficulty, not net hash rate... the moment i replaced difficulty with net hash rate, everything seems fine (comparing to other calculators around)


[20-Mar-19 10:55 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
but that doesn't somehow make sense in my mind... all this is based on same technology and after all it's not rocket science, just a simple math


[20-Mar-19 10:56 AM] Alright#0419
`networksols` is exactly what you described, a function of time and diff


[20-Mar-19 10:56 AM] Alright#0419
it's not exact at all


[20-Mar-19 10:56 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ok, but it should give you some "approx" number...


[20-Mar-19 10:56 AM] Alright#0419
yes


[20-Mar-19 10:56 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
however, with KMD, this doesn't work like that


[20-Mar-19 10:56 AM] Alright#0419
it *kind of* does


[20-Mar-19 10:57 AM] Alright#0419
that number includes the notary "hashrate"


[20-Mar-19 10:57 AM] Alright#0419
as if notaries were hashing normally if that makes sense


[20-Mar-19 10:58 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
wait a second =) so, if net hash rate is `difficulty / blocktime`....


[20-Mar-19 10:58 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
and if we take these numbers here


[20-Mar-19 10:59 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ah, cannot post screenshot here ^^

Difficulty:
205,047,128.563


[20-Mar-19 10:59 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
Nethash:
54.68 Mh/s


[20-Mar-19 11:00 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
so, `205047128` should be divided by block time which is for KMD `62` seconds, right?


[20-Mar-19 11:00 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
and that should give us net hash rate


[20-Mar-19 11:00 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
which is apparently 54MH/s at the moment


[20-Mar-19 11:00 AM] jl777c#5810
when i said hashrate to diff is non-linear, did you understand me?


[20-Mar-19 11:00 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
but `205047128/62=3307211`


[20-Mar-19 11:00 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
`3.3M` comparing to `54M`

@jl777c hm, well obviously not completely, sorry =))


[20-Mar-19 11:01 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
let me scroll back a bit


[20-Mar-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
being nonlinear means you can calculate it based on simple division


[20-Mar-19 11:01 AM] jl777c#5810
please ignore diff, and just use Msols


[20-Mar-19 11:02 AM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
lol i definitely will do that =)) but i despite living in ignorance and just "use stuff as i'm told to" =) that's why i'm trying to explain this to myself


[20-Mar-19 11:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
@–ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù diff/hash in CN coins is not quite the same as in BTC forks, is the first thing confusing you


[20-Mar-19 11:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
@–ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù use your hashrate to calculate your % of network hashrate, then profit based on that. Difficulty is never involved


[20-Mar-19 11:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
@–ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù another thing is that whattomine.com has KMD, but it doesn't take into account notaries getting 75% of block reward. So basically you can divide the whattomine rev/profit numbers by 4, since other miners get 25% of block reward


[20-Mar-19 11:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
so for KMD, you need to calculate that normal miners get 25% of block reward, on average


[20-Mar-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
you're sure about that duke?


[20-Mar-19 11:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe?


[20-Mar-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
divide by 4 thing


[20-Mar-19 11:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
depends where and when, order of operations matters


[20-Mar-19 11:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the effective hashrate would be accurate and alread includes notary


[20-Mar-19 11:24 AM] Alright#0419
Yea this is how I understood it


[20-Mar-19 11:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
profit calcuations for KMD on whattomine are not correct, I don't believe


[20-Mar-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
you can take that 56msol number and compare your hashrate against it


[20-Mar-19 11:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
but maybe that changed recently? Or maybe it's correct, and I am wrong


[20-Mar-19 11:25 AM] dukeleto#7326
whattomine doesn't take into account that only 25% of blocks can be mined at that diff


[20-Mar-19 11:25 AM] Alright#0419
Not sure, never used that, but that's always how I calculated it. I never paid close attention to it


[20-Mar-19 11:26 AM] Alright#0419
my miners default to KMD when I'm not using them for testing

[20-Mar-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
47Msols is a lot more than the sum of mining pools


[20-Mar-19 11:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
i was never sure if it took into account notary stuff


[20-Mar-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
almost like it is 4x the actual hashrate


[20-Mar-19 11:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
so the official answer is I am not sure. But don't use difficulty to calculate profit, it's based on hashrate not difficulty


[20-Mar-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure if you have 4.7Msols you would get 10% of the blocks and not 2.5%


[20-Mar-19 11:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
but if you had 4.7*3 Msols you would not get 30% of blocks


[20-Mar-19 11:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
because the max non-notaries can mine is 25% of blocks, I think. But I defer to James


[20-Mar-19 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, if you start getting close to 25%, the effective hashrate will adjust


[20-Mar-19 11:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i meant that if you have 4.7Msols now when the nethash is 47


[20-Mar-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
not about adding 4.7, as if you add 4.7, overall nethash would go up by 18.8 Msols


[20-Mar-19 12:12 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@dukeleto tyvm kind sir!! what you said about my confusion is 100% right =)


[20-Mar-19 12:13 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
and as jl777 suggested, i definitely will use net sols from now on... i am still trying to figure out how comes that diff is never involved because i was sure that net hash rate and diff are in direct relation


[20-Mar-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
they are related, but nonlinearly


[20-Mar-19 12:18 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
also, thanks for clarifying about `whattomine.com` calculator, i thought i am doing something wrong here again ^^ but yeah, taking notaries in account (multiply by 0.25) seems like a correct thing...


[20-Mar-19 12:21 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
@jl777c could you maybe explain me (in the simplest way possible) how does `komodod` calculate net sols which are returned in `getmininginfo` response?


[20-Mar-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
it is a 2 hour average of the implied amount


[20-Mar-19 12:22 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
i'm sorry for being pain in the ass, if you don't like to go in circles with this, just tell me that i'm pain in the ass and i'll shut up =)


[20-Mar-19 12:23 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ah so it is averaging by some time, not using "expected block time"?


[20-Mar-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it used the expected time vs actual time and averages over 2 hours


[20-Mar-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
the source code has the exact logic, i dont remember the details


[20-Mar-19 12:25 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
ok, ok i see... does that mean it follows the similar equation like bitcoin? for example `hash_rate = (blocks_found/expected_blocks*difficulty * 2**32 / 600)`


[20-Mar-19 12:25 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
(2**32 being something with `nBits` i think)


[20-Mar-19 12:25 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
and ofc, different block time...


[20-Mar-19 12:26 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
let me try to dig around source code myself!


[20-Mar-19 12:27 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902
thanks for being patient and helping out with understanding what i though will be a "simple" thing =)


[20-Mar-19 12:27 PM] –ë–û–ú–ë –û–ù#6902

hi all, anyone having problems with luckpool


[20-Mar-19 05:52 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
My problem is the lucky feks at luckpool get more reward blocks than I do ‚òπ


[21-Mar-19 11:44 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@polycryptoblog I was told that `RWdQye1bgJiwKcAFKgtX6fGure8JwDmVKN` might be you
if so, please use a miner/proxy that actually uses `mining.suggest_target` instead of just sending it (or take it out entirely)
After an annoying day and a half talking to people I don't like about an undocumented, silly-ass "feature" that no one but Luke actually wants, chickenpool supports it
However, whomever owns `RWdQye1bgJiwKcAFKgtX6fGure8JwDmVKN` uses something that, in fact, doesn't accept the "proper" response and is now getting 0 shares

to mine from agama


[21-Mar-19 11:54 AM] Cryptoon#3362
-setgenerate 1?


[21-Mar-19 11:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
setgenerate true


[21-Mar-19 11:55 AM] Cryptoon#3362
or is that one for staking?


[21-Mar-19 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
from the "cli" in settings it would be
`setgenerate true 1` for PoW and the 1 would be a 0 for PoS


[21-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and for 50/50 pos/pow?


[21-Mar-19 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
pick one (either PoS or PoW), you can't set both


[21-Mar-19 11:56 AM] Cryptoon#3362
the number is the amount of cores?


[21-Mar-19 11:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

a pubkey you control


[21-Mar-19 01:17 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
üëÜüèΩ that or if still an agama question, use `setpubkey` with the pubkey of the addy you want it sent to


[21-Mar-19 01:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Thanks @jl777c  & @ComputerGenie kind sirs


[21-Mar-19 01:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
pubkey or public addy?


[21-Mar-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the name of the parameter?


[21-Mar-19 01:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
setpubkey


[21-Mar-19 01:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
in agama cli


[21-Mar-19 01:39 PM] Cryptoon#3362
CLI response:

(make sure server is running and you are connecting to the correct RPC port)


[21-Mar-19 01:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
gonna see if restarting agama helps


[21-Mar-19 01:43 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
did you add an actual pubkey or just type 'setpubkey'?

[21-Mar-19 01:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm resyncing chain now, have to wait for it to finish before I use the command I assume?


[21-Mar-19 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
cli will deny most commands until synced


[21-Mar-19 01:51 PM] Cryptoon#3362
maybe before restart chain wasnt 100% sync


[21-Mar-19 02:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
ok so i tried setpubkey again


[21-Mar-19 02:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
after chain was 100% again


[21-Mar-19 02:28 PM] Cryptoon#3362
same error


[21-Mar-19 02:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
and chain goes back to loading best chain


[21-Mar-19 02:29 PM] Cryptoon#3362
is there a command to just leave it mining to new addys, but merge all balances to one?


[21-Mar-19 02:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@ComputerGenie  not me


[21-Mar-19 02:32 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
ok, tnks for the reply


[21-Mar-19 02:33 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Cryptoon only manually or running a cli script


[21-Mar-19 02:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
hmm and now it's resyncin wallet again from 30%


[21-Mar-19 02:35 PM] Cryptoon#3362
3rd time today

maybe this weekend


[21-Mar-19 03:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm sending manually, does it need to be sent to a different address than in your current wallet.dat?


[21-Mar-19 03:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
because when I send a blockreward to the first addy, it makes 4 tx, 2 out and 2 in...

[22-Mar-19 02:31 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ok, so best way to manually merge all the adresses? Have about 100 blocks mined... probably best to merge scripted?


[22-Mar-19 02:37 AM] Alright#0419
@Cryptoon genie has some decent scripts for combining them. I use to just sit there and do `sendtoaddress <address> 0.1` if that didn't work ``sendtoaddress <address> 0.09` and so on


[22-Mar-19 02:37 AM] Alright#0419
100 blocks should only take a tx or two to combine


[22-Mar-19 02:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm in cli then?


[22-Mar-19 02:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Guess I'm learning CLI later :p


[22-Mar-19 02:40 AM] Alright#0419
just do the equivalent in UI


[22-Mar-19 02:40 AM] Cryptoon#3362
and it aggregates the balances of all those different addresses?


[22-Mar-19 02:40 AM] Alright#0419

that screenshot above is from PTX?


[22-Mar-19 02:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Let's say I have 100 coins over 100 adresses, but when using gui, I must select the wallet needed to send from?


[22-Mar-19 02:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yes


[22-Mar-19 02:42 AM] Alright#0419
doesn't that shield indicate it's notarized?


[22-Mar-19 02:42 AM] Alright#0419
PTX is not notarized at all


[22-Mar-19 02:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yeah it's a bug I think


[22-Mar-19 02:42 AM] Cryptoon#3362

BEER and PIZZA have exceptions to fake notarizations I believe

`./komodo-cli -ac_name=CHAINX setgenerate true 0`

it will auto shut off any existing miner threads when you issue a new command


[23-Mar-19 03:49 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
if you're doing PoW and tell it to PoS, it will kill the PoW
you can run false in between if you like, but it's not necessary

@bishop one of the silliest things about a hybrid pos/pow is the difficulty adjustment üòÑ


[23-Mar-19 12:26 PM] Lumbi#8378
640 GH/s is less hard to achieve with v1 FPGAs than with GPUs


[23-Mar-19 12:29 PM] bishop#9773
I'm simply saying that to compare your v1 hashrate to other asset chains isn't apples-to-apples, especially when the pow side of things can be done with a handful of fpgas. This whole thing started because of your comments about 135 gh on lumber


[23-Mar-19 12:31 PM] Lumbi#8378
yes of course... I think the highest we had at any one time was 990 GH/s


[23-Mar-19 12:33 PM] Lumbi#8378
a decentralized mining base along with pos is more important than total hashrate at any given point in time


[23-Mar-19 12:35 PM] bishop#9773
So then you bringing up the nethash on your coin serves no purpose. Besides, lumber isn't decentralized from a mining perspective  üòõ

I calculated my daily KMD mining rewards but i am sure i am making a huge mistake. I should be able to do 29 megahash/s with my RX 480, according to a calculator i would be getting 1700 KMD PER DAY. That cant be right?


[24-Mar-19 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
only 1080 KMD per day for miners, so 1700 would indeed be impossible


[24-Mar-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
also impossible to get 29 Msols on any single ASIC, fastest is about 0.2Msols. maybe you are calculating SHA256 hashes? that has no use for mining equihash

Hi. I'm having an issue with mining Pirate and Komodo with komodod and knomp on my Linux server. I thought I had these working, but on closer inspection although my mining machines are being authorised, they keep coming up with a "re-joining" message and no shares are being recorded (no invalid ones either). I have another coin, Zaddex which is working fine.

My pirate.json file is:

{
"name": "PIRATE",
"symbol": "ARRR",
"algorithm": "equihash",
"txfee": 0.0001,
"requireShielding": true,
"sapling": true,
"disablecb":true,
"privateChain":true,
"burnFees": true
}


and my komodod start command is:

./komodod -addnode=136.243.102.225 -ac_private=1 -ac_supply=0 -ac_name=PIRATE -ac_reward=25600000000 -ac_halving=77777


[24-Mar-19 12:22 PM] Alright#0419
@newvulcan do not use `disablecb` for PIRATE


[24-Mar-19 12:23 PM] Alright#0419
That's basically the one exception that `disablecb` won't work for properly. You can use it for solo mining, but if you need to split the cb into multiple vouts, it will not work

My point is that the fact that s-nomp "official" works for anything inside the Komodo ecosystem is coincidental; whereas, miketout's fork of it, webby's pools, and my pools are specifically written to ensure that they do

@Lumbi Basically if a problem arises, you will already know the answer to your question ( upgrade to kmd developed pool software )


[25-Mar-19 09:50 AM] MyName#0491
but to the extent of equihash, there's something to be said for the fact that s-nomp "official" uses ZCL as their readme example and they didn't even fix sapling for ZCL until the day after it was fully activated (weeks after it was added to ZCL)

HUSH Announcement for Pool Operators, 

As you may be aware, HUSH is upgrading from Sprout to Sapling. With that upgrade HUSH will be converting to a Komodo Asset Chain as well. We've noticed that your pool supports mining of KMD, HUSH, or other Komodo Asset Chains and felt that we should make you aware of this change. We would like for you to consider adding or updating HUSH. We are offering bounties for pools both pre-existing and new. There will be bounties of 1,000, 500, 300, 200, and 100 HUSH for the first 5 pools to process any kind of payment on the new HUSH asset chain. There will also be an additional 250 HUSH for the first 5 pools to process Sapling payouts.

Our snapshot is taking place at block 500,000, and we are estimated for a snapshot date of April 14th. Please join us on Discord if you haven't already at https://www.myhush.org/discord and message me (Berg) or post in the #mining channel and I will have you added to our private Pool Operator channel where you'll receive news and support from our developers. 

Thank you for your consideration/support of HUSH. If you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out through our Discord.

current rate is 10-15 blocks per day, if you join and it takes days to find 1 then your hashrate is negative

@rob in summary, on average you should mine the same amount, regardless of the pool hash. A lower hash pool gets slower payments, but they're larger, whereas, a higher hash pool gets more frequent payouts, but are smaller.

VBK is run by a bunch of dudes that look like they just walked out of their MBA class and has a physical office in South Florida, I place I am familiar with. Lots of wealthy people by the beach. My gut tells me they are biz savvy and tech is just a way to get to the profits


[01-Apr-19 03:48 AM] jl777c#5810
what "tech"?


[01-Apr-19 03:49 AM] jl777c#5810
trying to find out if there is any actual tech that makes sense. so far I see a BTC spam machine that is certainly decentralized as it uses speculative miners paying the BTC txfee in hopes of a big VBK price. also a lot of the mining is likely veriblock themselves


[01-Apr-19 03:49 AM] jl777c#5810
you dont just go from zero to 100,000+ miners in a blink


[01-Apr-19 03:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
it sure does look like "tech" from the viewpoint of "normals" outside of cryptocoin world


[01-Apr-19 03:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
i don't understand their funding model


[01-Apr-19 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
so this could all be a big marketing stunt to get a lot of attention, sell at crazy valuation (more than KMD) and then realize it isnt cost effective to do 100,000 BTC tx/day notarizing a single chain


[01-Apr-19 03:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
who pays for their office by the beach?


[01-Apr-19 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
they raised $18 million


[01-Apr-19 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
$5 million paid to advisor/endorsers


[01-Apr-19 03:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe the devs actually think it's a good idea? It seems like wealthy biz-savvy people just doing their normal thing, but now with cryptocoins


[01-Apr-19 03:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
normal companies do this all the time, pretend to have a product


[01-Apr-19 03:52 AM] jl777c#5810
it is getting the attention of people, create a buzz, do the ICO, cashout, then let others worry about all the details

is VBK buying back VBK at a set price or something?


[01-Apr-19 04:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
who wants to buy VBK at these prices?


[01-Apr-19 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
$20 guaranteed!


[01-Apr-19 04:03 AM] dukeleto#7326

So OTC price was 5 cent with 50% lockup. IEO price was 10 cent. Is that true?
50% OTC token unlock = 100% IEO token with same price.
```


[01-Apr-19 04:03 AM] dukeleto#7326
trying to wrap my head around what VBK is trying to do


[01-Apr-19 04:04 AM] jl777c#5810
double money for OTC investors, and make a giant profit at the IEO


[01-Apr-19 04:05 AM] jl777c#5810
paying double what KMD raised at ICO for advisors.... efficiency is not really what VBK is about


[01-Apr-19 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
so if the mining calcs are using 10 cents, that seems unlikely to hold up when the OTC buyers dump and maybe even the insiders wont be long term hodl


[01-Apr-19 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
if they are subsidizing the 100,000 BTC tx per day, then it wont take long for it to burn through $18 million


[01-Apr-19 04:07 AM] dukeleto#7326
2X the daily profit of VRSC on a blackminer F1, but VRSC has a "stable" price right now. VBK seems like a house of cards ready to fall over at the first breeze


[01-Apr-19 04:12 AM] jl777c#5810
dont you have confidence in all their high price advisors to solve whatever problems arise?


[01-Apr-19 06:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
serious red flags in all directions with VBK, but I am slowly learning that sometimes it's just about churning profit and "believing" in the thing you are mining isn't really necessary. I prefer to mine and hold things I believe in, versus mining fly-by-night-coins and hoping to sell them on exchanges before they are dumped to oblivion. I am still finding the middle ground between each side of the spectrum

[01-Apr-19 09:37 AM] actionslacks#4072
And In a space where all exchanges are constantly doing extremely shady shit, Bittrex would likely emerge from a massive VBK pump and dump relatively unscathed and with a tidy pile of cash to add to the rest.


[01-Apr-19 09:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
wow, there is even a CPU mining pool for VBK, in addition to many GPU and a few FPGA pools: https://wiki.veriblock.org/index.php?title=List_of_mining_pools#FPGA_Pools

let that sink in. There are active FPGAs and people are still so desperate to mine it, that there is a CPU pool. Most likely from a smart pool op that just wants fees

i dont think many investors, most are in it for the flip from the expected pump. paying 15 cents via mining when IEO is at 10cents. thats speculative mining. and if it is what it looks like, the insiders wont be very long term hodling either. my prediction is that it will do the expected pump and dump and then the reality will set it. the part about no economically viable model

Anyone have a Blackminer for sale or trade?


[05-Apr-19 10:26 AM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog nope, but I like mine, bought it new. Not many used ones for sale


[05-Apr-19 10:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog are you on the HAC discord?


[05-Apr-19 10:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is where you would find any, I don't think they make it to Ebay


[05-Apr-19 10:28 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Actually just found one on eBay lol


[05-Apr-19 10:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
awesome! I haven't seen any, but the F1+ made some people sell their F1's


[05-Apr-19 10:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog are you going to mine VBK like a boss?


[05-Apr-19 10:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
get that sweeeeeeeeet tech


[05-Apr-19 10:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
I OC my F1 a bit and it makes me happy


[05-Apr-19 10:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
runs so cold anyway


[05-Apr-19 10:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
424 Mhz is the magic value


[05-Apr-19 10:31 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol and Verus ,  it has Verus hash2 right?


[05-Apr-19 10:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
VRSC only uses 200W iirc


[05-Apr-19 10:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
i mine VRSC with mine, for a while


[05-Apr-19 10:32 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
What algo is VBK


[05-Apr-19 10:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
not even sure


[05-Apr-19 10:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
I never even looked into loading that bitstream, not sure if it's only for hosted blackminers


[05-Apr-19 10:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
they give out bitstreams to hosted miners first


[05-Apr-19 10:33 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ah, it will eventually make its way to the wild


[05-Apr-19 10:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
it took them about a month to react to Mike having his "coming of age" moment of realizing he couldn't prevent FPGA's from mining VRSC


[05-Apr-19 10:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
they secretly mined at first


[05-Apr-19 10:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
then VRSC forked


[05-Apr-19 10:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
then HAC got a new bitstream in a few weeks


[05-Apr-19 10:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
and VRSC realized the cat and mouse game was not theirs to win


[05-Apr-19 10:35 AM] dukeleto#7326
VRSC did make their move, and made the ratios of CPU to GPU to FPGA miner something "more reasonable" than when FPGAs secretly mined


[05-Apr-19 10:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
but FPGA mining VRSC blows away CPU mining, still. If you are doing it for profit, as a business, it makes no sense to mine VRSC with a CPU. If you are just mining for fun or hobby, then you can still make a few pennies a day with a fancy CPU


[05-Apr-19 10:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
I will say that I do build CPU mining rigs, and you expect those to be able to mine various coins, so their lifecycle of use is different than ASICs or FPGAs


[05-Apr-19 10:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's smarter to mine Monero forks with CPU rigs, which aggressively go against GPUs and FPGAs


[05-Apr-19 10:39 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
I‚Äôm glad the monero crowd keeps forking,   Bitmain and others won‚Äôt put out another cryptonote miner because of it


[05-Apr-19 10:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
There are coins which are solo mining only CPU only, multiple ones


[05-Apr-19 10:39 AM] dukeleto#7326
they see pools as evil


[05-Apr-19 10:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
and constantly change their PoW so that a "middle of the road" decent CPU has a reasonable chance to find a block per week, something like that


[05-Apr-19 10:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's an interesting and different world. Refreshing, after seeing to many coins doing exactly the same fucking things


[05-Apr-19 11:57 AM] kremer#4440

Was looking at network hashrate for equihash coins across the board, seems like a massive drop lately. Zec down a gigahash .  Zen down like 30%, pirate down a bit and not too much on nicehash .Just let‚Äôs you know how many of those new machines were running beforehand


[07-Apr-19 09:46 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

That would be ideal lol.  Hopefully the Z11 last longer than the Z9s .  I did well with them but luck definitely had it‚Äôs part, early pirate mining and zex mining


[07-Apr-19 09:59 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`Hopefully the Z11 last longer than the Z9s .`
I've not had a problem with a single one of them üòï


[07-Apr-19 10:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Not any problems with them, just profitability going to tank here soon.

[07-Apr-19 10:03 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'm still banging out a couple hundred $ a day, so even if the 11s cut that in half I'm alright üòÑ


[07-Apr-19 10:03 PM] polycryptoblog#1173

[07-Apr-19 10:04 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
How are you doing a couple hundred a day?


[07-Apr-19 10:04 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's all in where you point them and what you do with it


[07-Apr-19 10:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Lol well you gotta drop me some hints, only getting like 130 at 1Msol ,  I‚Äôm mining zec so that had a huge part of it but still even mining pirate is only like 150 , not a couple hundred. Mind you that profit not the total .


[07-Apr-19 10:08 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
solo mining, automated profit-switching, and auto dumpers are a miner's best friends


[07-Apr-19 10:09 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
and never, never, never mine "the big coin" in the algo


[07-Apr-19 10:10 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
when I was sha mining, I made 1.4-3x mining other coins and dumping them for BTC than I'd have ever made actually mining BTC


[07-Apr-19 10:16 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I just switched it over to get a bag of zec before hashrate shoots back up, once I have a couple hundred I‚Äôm done with it.    Then it‚Äôs back to pirate til the halving . Probably even after the halving.


[07-Apr-19 10:18 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
when I use it, my switcher looks at current block diff and moving average of price carried out to moving average of BTC, literally whatever is the most profitable for that 9 minute window


[07-Apr-19 10:23 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I got to do some research never messed with profit switching.


[07-Apr-19 10:24 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
imo, it's well worth the time investment to do it in a purely for-profit situation


[08-Apr-19 10:22 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
If you're going to dump the coins and buy w/e coin you like most, that's the best way of mining


[08-Apr-19 10:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
My FPGA profits of VRSC are way up because everybody is mining VBK I guess. So nice to have a network with very few other FPGAs mining üëº


[08-Apr-19 11:43 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Damn, A9++ back up for sale, 300 dollars more üò¶ ,  looks like the rest will be z11 then


[09-Apr-19 02:21 AM] jansako#3330
@ComputerGenie if what you do with your miners is scalable, would it be worth for you to offer it as a service (via a public pool or something) & make (more) profit via the pool fee? Kinda like zpool does with their 'ninja' coins, except with them it mostly does not work for me (I am sure it is just my luck).


[09-Apr-19 02:45 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@jansako I'm not sure what you mean. What you're suggesting reads like something akin to Genesis Mining (a model I have been advocating for years that people *not* use)


[09-Apr-19 03:08 AM] jansako#3330
You are doing magic with your own hashpower. If the 'magic' is scalable, have others point their hashpower to you & take a fee off the top. You would probably want actual miners, not NH in order to get stable hash...


[09-Apr-19 03:09 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
math is not "magic"


[09-Apr-19 03:09 AM] jansako#3330
it is for some...


[09-Apr-19 03:09 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
LOL


[09-Apr-19 03:10 AM] jansako#3330
more like.. is it worth for me to do all that work when I have 1-2 Z9 minis? Probably not, but I can pay you for letting me make more money & point them to your 'pool' (for lack of a better word)


[09-Apr-19 03:11 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
and on the weeks where I make a bad call and the 'pool' takes a 20% loss?


[09-Apr-19 03:11 AM] jansako#3330
If it is not scalable, then obviously it won;t work


[09-Apr-19 03:12 AM] jansako#3330
Just put a disclaimer üòÉ


[09-Apr-19 03:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
yeah, because people read things üëçüèΩ


[09-Apr-19 03:13 AM] jansako#3330
I would think if you consistently make 50-100% over 'regular' mining, a 20% loss here and there is acceptable


[09-Apr-19 03:15 AM] jansako#3330
all about how you communicate the value of your service, but that is just me speculating.


[09-Apr-19 03:45 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
and who pays for all of the development and security of this service?


[09-Apr-19 04:02 AM] jansako#3330
The end users, through 'pool fees'...


[09-Apr-19 04:02 AM] jansako#3330
But then you already know that.


[09-Apr-19 04:03 AM] jansako#3330
Really, this was nothing more than a suggestion based on your earlier posts about how you can get much more out of mining than just a straight mine-dump cycle.


[09-Apr-19 04:29 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`The end users, through 'pool fees'...`
so, basically you're suggesting I drop $100k to *maybe* make some extra down the line? I'll pass


[09-Apr-19 04:31 AM] jansako#3330
Not at all. This was my initial statement:
_ if what you do with your miners is scalable, would it be worth for you to offer it as a service (via a public pool or something) & make (more) profit via the pool fee?_


[09-Apr-19 04:31 AM] jansako#3330
Seems the answer is 'No'.


[09-Apr-19 04:31 AM] jansako#3330
Good enough.


[09-Apr-19 04:32 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
"scalable" and "scalable for free" are differing concepts


[09-Apr-19 04:33 AM] jansako#3330
I don't know what the second one means... there is no such thing as 'free', I believe you pointed it out before :troll_cool:

[09-Apr-19 04:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
That's what jansako meant I think, if it works and if it's possible for jansako to also use it for a fee, that would be nice


[09-Apr-19 04:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
if not possible, too bad


[09-Apr-19 04:36 AM] jansako#3330
indeed


[09-Apr-19 04:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Cryptoon that I have something working with the only access being me and the security involved in and for outside users is an entirely different level and structure


[09-Apr-19 04:36 AM] jansako#3330
I do not want to cut into your profits.


[09-Apr-19 04:37 AM] jansako#3330
If synergy is not possible, let's move on.


[09-Apr-19 04:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's not that it's "not possible", it's that there's a huge cost and dev cycle with not a lot of upside


[09-Apr-19 04:38 AM] jansako#3330
Maybe let's call it 'realistic', instead of 'possible'


[09-Apr-19 04:38 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

```
a new Veriblock 9GH/s bitstream today to registered users in the Zetheron discord chat.  The new bitstream with extremely cold ambient and high voltages can hit 600MHz x 15 cores = 9GH/s local hash rate, though some is lost to nonce overhead poolside, and most people with 'normal' ambient probably only get 8-8.5GH/s.
```


[10-Apr-19 04:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c FPGA devs sure know their customer base, I think they charge 4% dev fee on those bitstreams


[10-Apr-19 04:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
that bitstream is about 50X more hashrate than blackminer F1

has a whopping 8VRSC to his name


[10-Apr-19 04:46 AM] dukeleto#7326
i caught the vrsc bug early and have lots of 384 timelocked blocks with my name on them, some mature, many not


[10-Apr-19 04:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
I have been making somewhere around $5-10/day on VRSC with the F1, depending on market insanity


[10-Apr-19 04:47 AM] dukeleto#7326
sometimes big FPGA people jump on and off of VRSC


[10-Apr-19 04:48 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
early vrsc I had no decent CPU and no liquidity to do AWS
by the time GPU was worthwhile, I was on other things üò¶


[10-Apr-19 04:48 AM] dukeleto#7326
14Gh/s miner keeps jumping on and off luckpool, really messes with my stats on vrsc


[10-Apr-19 04:49 AM] dukeleto#7326
I spent a few hundred bucks on AWS when there was 384 blocks and it turned out to be a decent investment. I still have various CPUs mining it, mostly because it's work to change them over to other stuff. But monero forks are way more profitable than VRSC on a cpu


[10-Apr-19 04:50 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the day before I was about to buy a thread ripper was the day all the FPGAs started being publicly known about LOL


[10-Apr-19 04:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
that news saved me a ton of $ üòõ


[10-Apr-19 04:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
I came pretty close to making a decent-sized vrsc CPU mining farm and ended up returning various HW that had already arrived but I hadn't unboxed yet


[10-Apr-19 04:54 AM] dukeleto#7326
in the end, it taught me a huge amount about CPU mining and all that knowledge translates to other coins, which are actually CPU-friendly


[10-Apr-19 04:55 AM] dukeleto#7326
If people want to try something totally different, I can recommend BLUR: https://blur.cash/


[10-Apr-19 04:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
This is a CPU-only solo-mining only coin, pools are aggressively worked against, and they are also interested to add DPoW. It's a friendly community

hard to control the hashrate delivered


[11-Apr-19 05:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog the plan was for BTCH to become CPU-mineable with verushash + 50% PoS, but I don't consider verushash to be appropriate for that anymore. BTCH + HUSH will both have cryptoconditions, jl777 has interesting ideas relating to that


[11-Apr-19 05:41 AM] dukeleto#7326

üêî ChickenPool is currently experiencing some "growing pains" and minor outages üêî 
This is part of the process growing and of welcoming a growing HUSH to the pool as seamlessly as possible.
KMDICE and RFOX show an incorrect number of orphans and those who mined during those blocks will be made whole before the end of the transition.
Also during this transition we will be removing 0.0001 block reward coins in order to fully implement "profit-switching" mode by the end of May.

there is a stats bug i found. if mining two coins, it seems to combine the reported amounts.

yes, that's one of the bits of NOMP that was never designed for multi-coin and needs more than one output

Hi Genie,
Yes not sure why that is showing somehow that ZMQ disconnects from time to time... Which than somehow results in negativ confirms.


[15-Apr-19 05:31 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
@CHMEX I'm guessing that the issue is whenever it comes back up it never checks a missing block and that block is never confirmed in its mind
<https://hush.explorer.dexstats.info/block/000000075ae177cb2e051449bd94dbbcf96060a22b535805305bc74c409c4b24>


[15-Apr-19 05:41 AM] CHMEX#0686
That is strange I build it now on a different system and same pattern.
@dukeleto  does hush3 was the same zmq? Implementation or did you change something?


[15-Apr-19 06:12 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
_tries really hard to not think about KMDICE hashrate being as high as it sometimes get from miners on chickenpool_


[15-Apr-19 06:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
@CHMEX i didn't change anything with zmq in hush3, it's exactly as it is in upstream KMD


[15-Apr-19 06:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
my guess is the wrong `komodod` or wrong port might be used somehow?


[15-Apr-19 08:10 AM] CHMEX#0686

and what comes to equi solving bits, seek for C solver. that's all you need. you can interface that to do 200,9 and rest of the variants. i proved it by writing those.

PRO Tip: Since KMD core will soon learn -ac_NK params and every new asset chain will be able to choose it's N,K values, it's smart for mining pool operators to plan on supporting any combination of N,K

Basically it works now as so; we could throw all equi coins into one kitchen sink and it will send via stratum the variant and needed personalization string and mine the most profitable from single port. Hopefully I didn't overdo it


[18-Apr-19 03:57 PM] phm87#7395
@dukeleto  as we'll have n,k params in -ac_ do you know if it will handle -ac_pers for a personalization string per AC ?

@Ondalf I'm not sure how/why you dragged yourself into an elongated months-long conversation, but....
While I always welcome valuable input, pointing to the pool that's the cause of the topic as an example isn't that. This entire feken conversation started because zpool had the equihash bits and crackerz wanted to pay someone to write KMD into his pool but he refused to share the equihash bits.
In other words, he wanted someone to start with less than he already and redo everything he already had, blind.


[18-Apr-19 04:45 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
And now, him and phm want to control 4 NNs between them and I asked if they were going to share those bits with the community they intend on benefiting from.....

K&N alone can do that

`it's much less change/work to keep N/K the same and just change ac_pers`

i heard rumors that they are being developed, maybe


[18-Apr-19 07:02 PM] dukeleto#7326
(150,5) is the new hotness, evidently


[18-Apr-19 07:02 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
afaik, they've been too stuck on making just 1 thing to bother, but who knows


[18-Apr-19 07:04 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
my point is/was that a variable string is wholly silly because if ASIC makers like BM alter their version of cgminer enough to make K&N variable, one more string isn't going to be an issue


[18-Apr-19 07:27 PM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie i agree that it's barely a band-aid, that newer miners will be able to deal with any pers string. It's really only useful for invalidating existing HW, does nothing to protect you against future HW

We have all nk params supported now, it would be trivial to height activate the number to change I think. Just keep rotating around... Basically means daemon solo mining is the only thing that works

jl777 and FSM has merged the -ac for N/K params 150,5 is supported. I guess any combination is supported? even ones that are nonsensical

nonsensical N,K support?!?!? I must be dreaming


[19-Apr-19 01:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
@ComputerGenie changing the pers string is a trivial way to change the output of all hashes without any real algo changes, so if you wanted, you could make a new 200,9 coin for which no currently available  ASICs would work for.


[19-Apr-19 01:50 AM] jl777c#5810
my understanding is that only a small subset of N/K values are valid


[19-Apr-19 01:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, and furthermore


[19-Apr-19 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
a list of all the valid ones would be very good to have


[19-Apr-19 01:51 AM] dukeleto#7326
only a very few combinations have the ratio between N/K optimize the ratio between GPU and ASIC mining efficiency


[19-Apr-19 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so some are GPU centric and others ASIC?

before 150,5, it was never true that N % 8 != 0

people didn't want to look at it

because unrolling 8 loops at a time, there was deep code about that

but beam I think decided to research N%8!=0 and found 150,5

@jl777c some combination are straight up invalid, I believe. K > N should give an error, for instance

can't remember if N = K is technically valid or just dumb


[19-Apr-19 02:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i think our NK support is based on beam, so maybe it isnt limited to n%8 == 0


[19-Apr-19 02:03 AM] jl777c#5810
would be nice to have something that lets people experiment with all the possible combinations


[19-Apr-19 02:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, I think allowing any "valid" combination of N,K, regardless of whether we think it's a good idea, makes our tool that more general


[19-Apr-19 02:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
Perhaps somebody wants to study all possible N,K values. The very best way to do that would be with KMD tools


[19-Apr-19 02:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c and yes, blackjoker ported beam code to support 150,5, i am not sure how "general" it is, I think it can support any N%5=0, but it doesn't support N%17=0 for instance


[19-Apr-19 02:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe it supports any N! that would be cool


[19-Apr-19 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i think efficiency doesnt matter much for the reference miner. just getting it to support all possible values alone is very cool

agreed

BTCH going to (150,5) sounds vaguely interesting


[19-Apr-19 03:28 AM] dukeleto#7326
(150,5) + 50% PoS would be what it migrates to, that would balance things


[19-Apr-19 03:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
no way to add mining to BTCH without increasing supply, and the super simplest thing that works is doubling it to 42M, which I call "Satoshi's Double Vision"


[19-Apr-19 03:29 AM] dukeleto#7326
if we did this


[19-Apr-19 03:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
the entire set of BEAM miners become potential BTCH miners, which is interesting


[19-Apr-19 03:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
i haven't heard of any publicly available bitstream for 150,5


[19-Apr-19 03:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
but obviously FPGA dev companies write bitstreams and run privately without ever telling their customers. They do have some transparency with customers, tho


[19-Apr-19 03:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
HAC tells me which bitstreams they are working, or will write soon, if price increases, things like that


[19-Apr-19 03:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
but they could just be running a BEAM bitstream in the back room for 3 months before ever giving it out to customers. Only makes sense to give it to customers if they can't make more money using it privately


[19-Apr-19 03:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
what I think is happening is this: ASIC companies have promised 150,5 asics


[19-Apr-19 03:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
this makes FPGA companies not consider it


[19-Apr-19 03:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
but some enterprising FPGA miners are probably running privately-funded BEAM bitstreams, which will never make it into the hand of a "customer"

does anybody know the ballpark range mergemining increases your BTC mining ROI?


[19-Apr-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
is it like a 1% boost to ROI or 0.01%


[19-Apr-19 10:06 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
depends on the value of the CoinX you pick, but @! zpool.ca | crackers would likely have the best set of numbers to give an answer


[19-Apr-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
couldnt you merge mine N different coins at once?


[19-Apr-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
and even a hashrate that is nothing compared to BTC hashrate, maybe it can find a lot of blocks in a smaller coin


[19-Apr-19 10:09 AM] phm87#7395
Ondalf tested merged mining he can help on this. I will ask him

Ok I will ask


[19-Apr-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
if you make $100 mining BTC with that hashrate will you make $1 in the merge mined coins or $0.01


[19-Apr-19 10:11 AM] phm87#7395
I heard between 2 and 3% but I will check


[19-Apr-19 10:11 AM] phm87#7395
With few coins it can be higher


[19-Apr-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
if it werent for the fact you might find 100x the blocks in the smaller coin, it seems like a rounding error, but 2% would be a good boost


[19-Apr-19 10:13 AM] phm87#7395

are there any merged mining profitability stats? i see a chart with revenue if mined directly. i wonder if merge mining approaches the same returns


[19-Apr-19 11:41 AM] Ondalf#1318
if i recall right, doge cannot be mined directly. it simply misses the getblock and getblocktemplate


[19-Apr-19 11:41 AM] Ondalf#1318
only getauxblock and submitauxblock stayed


[19-Apr-19 11:42 AM] Ondalf#1318
but if you look the profitability of pool, that has auxes listed in SHA256, the coins difficulty doesn't change, as aux is not separate chain, but the auxcoins main chain.


[19-Apr-19 11:43 AM] Ondalf#1318
most auxes still allows mining it straight, but since most are also listed at biggest pools to get small extra profit over normal coins, the auxes diff usually is high. seriously high


[19-Apr-19 11:43 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so the boost to ROI is fraction of a percent?


[19-Apr-19 11:43 AM] Ondalf#1318
yes.


[19-Apr-19 11:45 AM] Ondalf#1318
then there is this oddball called Globaltoken, which has ability to use it as auxpow for equi200,,9 and 144,5. best part, it needs own flags and version number to be able to work with them... haven't yet got it to work. shouldn't be hard though. this GLT also has ability to mine as an aux, when main coin is POS one (PoW+PoS one)


[19-Apr-19 11:46 AM] Ondalf#1318
there is extra timerolling param, which doesn't allow regular auxes to work with pow+pos coins

[19-Apr-19 02:54 PM] phm87#7395
About aux pow, I made the calculation based on zpool numbers and I found 6% for sha256. But it depends on price and difficulty.
If we read the code, it seems that aux mining is literally as an free addition. Aux is checked always first whenever submit is made and height of submit is higher than any aux. So if a submit happens for BTC, we could find a block of all aux coins on sha256

[19-Apr-19 03:11 PM] phm87#7395
and about profit switching (I read that jl777 and CG discussed about this subject), in the same repo, there is a good profit switch (it takes into account profitability of course but also the coin nethash to avoid to throw too much hashrate on a tiny coin and other parameters)


[19-Apr-19 03:16 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`to throw too much hashrate on a tiny coin`
imo, that's a bad idea
never underestimate the utility of 100M penny stocks that you can actively liquidate


[19-Apr-19 03:22 PM] Ondalf#1318
Then again, small in this means low diff coin. Not low on value


[19-Apr-19 03:24 PM] Ondalf#1318
Also, small diff coins gets slowly up in the difficulty scale, if there are miners with various speeds as it can allocate only single miner to mine coin X. By default, yiimp refuses to push more than twice the nethash speed into coin, UNLESS it's alone in the algo


[19-Apr-19 03:26 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
ahhh
I never had that restriction to deal with


[19-Apr-19 03:27 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`small in this means low diff coin. Not low on value` there does tend to be a correlation though

All n and k are supported already as long as k is bigger than n. However, to use large numbers of them u need to add more code as u need an equihsh solver defined for each value. I got around this by adding komodo_nk.h which can take any value and a recompile enables it. I've tested all the values hardcoded as well as 77/3

it's a cat and mouse game at that point, but many coins are playing this exact game right now

Also useful for chains that don't have value such as an oracles specific chain


[19-Apr-19 08:39 PM] Deleted User#0000
Also if you look at the code, I added a BEAM specific thing to the generatehash function, that is only active when using ac_nk... this *should* make BEAM miners and pools work with ac_nk but only for 150,5 values.


[19-Apr-19 08:40 PM] Deleted User#0000
I think it would also be possible to change that generate hash in some small way, to also fork each nk value from ASIC aswell, but not sure about that.,


[20-Apr-19 12:50 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Isnt the idea of having lots of miners/high hash rates to secure your blockchain ledger? If decentralisation is the reason you're changing algo, i dont think it is a valid point.
If your algorithm already has ASIC's on it that are widely available(such as equihash), surely this would be more secure, as well as more decentralised, than switching to another algorithm?
Once you switch to another algorithm, security is comprised by the first company to make an ASIC or FPGA code for it, as they will have access to a majority of the hash rate.
What are peoples thoughts on this?


[20-Apr-19 12:53 AM] jl777c#5810
dont you know that "decentralization" means "any algo as long as i have hardware for it already" otherwise its "centralized"


[20-Apr-19 12:54 AM] jl777c#5810
plz dont let the facts get in the way!


[20-Apr-19 12:55 AM] jl777c#5810
as the facts are BTC is the most secure as every efficiency is put in play and it requires maybe a gigawatt of power to attack it, not to mention all the hardware.


[20-Apr-19 12:56 AM] jl777c#5810
all these coins that switch away from algos with ASIC so it is for GPU and then the fpga drinks their milkshake. it almost seems like a marketing effort of the fpga outfits


[20-Apr-19 01:02 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It is perplexing. I dont particularly understand it. Dont get me wrong, I like that you are creating an ability to chose what algorithm people want when creating an assetchain, I just dont understand algo hoping and the ideology of remaining decentralised through running away from ASIC's.


[20-Apr-19 01:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
For me, it was msotly looking for a way to secure and mine chains with out a block reward... When you have ASIC values, then the cahins can be stopepd dead for maybe even weeks at a time. Byt using some obsucre values and being able to easiy change it, we can rely on dpow alone to secure the chains.


[20-Apr-19 01:05 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
What would the use case of such a chain be?


[20-Apr-19 01:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
It was msotly for LABS. VerusHash 1.1 and any nk value gives us a pretty solid way to prevent nasty miners breaking the LABS cluster just for lolz


[20-Apr-19 01:06 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah thats fair I guess, low difficulty chains can get screwed for a long time by ASIC's


[20-Apr-19 01:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
exaclty. Not that it matters, a determined person could still break it with massive amounts of AWS VPS's... but its not a bad as ASIC or as cheap.


[20-Apr-19 01:08 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I'd say that use case is fairly corner case though. Could you just not write in an auto difficulty scale up, say below a certain amount of hash, to stop that difficulty spike?


[20-Apr-19 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
people have been trying for years...


[20-Apr-19 01:09 AM] jl777c#5810
not much can gracefully handle a million times increase of hashrate, that then disappears


[20-Apr-19 01:10 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I was unaware, but not surprised somebody has already thought to find a solution for it aha


[20-Apr-19 01:10 AM] Deleted User#0000
hybrid PoS/PoW can kind ifo handle it, but introduces more problems as you need more nodes to keep the chains moving.

Like you say though, these kinds of chains and not really going to be used for much in the real world outsude of LABS.

until they are


[20-Apr-19 01:11 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I mean if a chain hasnt had much development in awhile, and are still being used, they could look at switching to a hybrid model


[20-Apr-19 01:11 AM] jl777c#5810
in the world of millions of chains, i think almost all conceivable variations will exist


[20-Apr-19 01:11 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
They do. But we could provide a solution to it


[20-Apr-19 01:12 AM] Deleted User#0000
This is true., I guess if LABS is sucessful with it, people will use it. I was hoping to be able to steal Verus's merge mining stuff so LABS main chain could secure the 0BR Chains, butr so far that hasn't proved withing my skills to do.

The KMD chain assurance. Below x amount of hash, we recommend switching to a PoS/PoW hybrid and use NN's as stakers.


[20-Apr-19 01:13 AM] Deleted User#0000
This was my plan in LABS ues... but for notary ndoe to effectivly stake and notarize at the same time, is quite a hard problem to solve.


[20-Apr-19 01:13 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
They wouldnt have to. You could give them a staking pubkey, to use on another node?


[20-Apr-19 01:13 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
So a NN would have two pubkeys added in the hardfork


[20-Apr-19 01:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
you can easily use 2 nodes. that is no problem. But running 2 of every node is not that easy.


[20-Apr-19 01:14 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Of every node?


[20-Apr-19 01:14 AM] Deleted User#0000
Most notary nodes would need a second server for this as they run bare metal machines with a single IP. I guess you can change ports n users n stuf but its hard to manage.


[20-Apr-19 01:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
I think I worked out how to make notaries be able to stake, but it required being able to load a second wallet.


[20-Apr-19 01:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
and the code change was too great...


[20-Apr-19 01:15 AM] Deleted User#0000
too many possible things to go wrong


[20-Apr-19 01:15 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I mean a staking node could be a cheap node, and we could just make it a requirement to do it?


[20-Apr-19 01:16 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
If KMD saw it as a valuable thing to offer chains


[20-Apr-19 01:16 AM] Deleted User#0000
wihout some solution like this, we end up with the situation now, where notaries who mine AC, are usually lower in counts... So competetive nodes either dont mine at all, or use a second node.


[20-Apr-19 01:17 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
I imagine if there are a million assetchains, a shitload may end up with small amounts of hash, but still require dpow

But how to you enforce a notary OP to mine/stake ?  Maybe it becomes some election pledge who knows.


[20-Apr-19 01:18 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
You could require it? Or offer a different reward for doing it. Two pubkeys, a notarising one, a staking one.


[20-Apr-19 01:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Maybe KMD could offer chain assurance as part of the dpow fee


[20-Apr-19 01:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
There is nothing to say a single notary doesnt require two nodes?


[20-Apr-19 01:20 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Or wont require more than one in the future

I messed around for litterally weeks on this problem lol... Tried hundreds of com,binations of hash algo, staking utxos and values... never really got anything to works quite right... Although I got VerusHash 1.1 chain taht can be kept moving with a difficulty over a billion using only 2000 coins and 2 CPU cores üòÇ


[20-Apr-19 01:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
Hovever the blokctimes were attrocious... block a bunch in a minute then stop for a while... All the time.


[20-Apr-19 01:23 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Surely something like 97% PoS/3%PoW would continue with such high hashing amounts?


[20-Apr-19 01:24 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
May as well just be PoS at that point maybe aha


[20-Apr-19 01:27 AM] Deleted User#0000
yep pretty much. I really depends on what you want to do. For LABS the issue is that if you use too much PoS% on the 0BR chains, people are losing out on staking rewards on the main chain, so its likely it will end up without enough staking utxos to keep it movning along. So my solution was to use 10-20%PoS so a very small value of coins would block enough to keep the chain moving along. But to do this you really need s CPU algo or make it so that only noaries can mine.  Which is still an option I may look at depending on how things trun out after launch and are tested in the real world.


[20-Apr-19 01:35 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It is a problem that will need to be addressed for assetchains. I think if KMD offered an official solution, it would be better for the community, rather than a 3rd party offer a solution.
Could you add a NN only staking mode. Where miners could mine PoW normally, and the chain can have dpow, with NNs only  PoS staking?


[20-Apr-19 01:37 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
This would incentivise NN's getting another node by accumulating the coin they stake?


[20-Apr-19 01:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
easily possible I think.


[20-Apr-19 01:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
Although starting to check vast numbers of address/pubkey at some point you will slow down things a bit much. I guess unless we try it we cant know though.


[20-Apr-19 01:41 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Im not sure how itd be coded, but could you just hardcode pubkeys in and allow only those addresses to stake. Meaning if any random person tried to stake, it would check against the pubkeys in the hardcode and either allow, or not


[20-Apr-19 01:43 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes made something exactly like this for the streamer chain, all that is needed is a loop isntead of checking a single key.


[20-Apr-19 02:34 AM] gcharang#6833
what about optional notary easy mining through an -ac option say from 5% to 75% does that help here?


[20-Apr-19 02:35 AM] gcharang#6833
instead of staking


[20-Apr-19 02:36 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Im not sure how notary 'easy mining' is affected by a massive increase in difficulty. Im not sure if its even been tested as KMD has a stable hash rate


[20-Apr-19 02:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it has been tested


[20-Apr-19 02:45 AM] jl777c#5810
no effect


[20-Apr-19 02:45 AM] jl777c#5810
there can be a terahash, still the notaries will mine, the problem would be that the non-notary blocks will be hard to find


[20-Apr-19 02:51 AM] gcharang#6833
@jl777c 
`optional notary easy mining through an -ac option say from 5% to 75%` for a low hash rate assetchain that is dPoW'd can help with censorship resistence correct?
If say 95% mining hash wanted to censor some transactions, notary easy mining can come in and let them through


[20-Apr-19 02:55 AM] jl777c#5810
95% hashrate can reorg at will


[20-Apr-19 02:55 AM] jl777c#5810
anything sustained over 51% can censor


[20-Apr-19 02:56 AM] gcharang#6833
95% or even 100% of the miners want to censor but if the chain had 51% notary easy mining and it is dpow'd , there won't be censorship?


[20-Apr-19 02:58 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as the "notary" group is not compromised, no censorship is possible


[20-Apr-19 02:58 AM] jl777c#5810

[20-Apr-19 03:48 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
The whole idea of NN's is that they can't do anything if "compromised" other than not notarise. Also ac easymining could be an alternative to founders rewards


[20-Apr-19 03:52 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why i dont want to give the easy mining power to notaries, but rather to a list of pubkeys


[20-Apr-19 04:00 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah makes sense.
-ac_easymining=25[] 
You could add a % of blocks in there as well. 
If there was 1 pubkey in that list, do you think this would effectively mitigate difficulty spikes?


[20-Apr-19 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as that pubkey mines, then it mines at easy diff

You can ask around about me and also find my proposal (node-9) here: `https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/notarynodes/node-9`
I'd be grateful for any VOTE2019 you send. `RBDivEArcb7aRsYTvtN5MRnaxeDAepSNmW`
Figure I can do a good job as a Notary Node op.

my main motivation was to keep CHIPS mining going on while the miners runs quiet. in a crowded neighbourhood the noise  is really loud i feel. not looking forward to get the money back.


[27-Apr-19 03:39 AM] SHossain#0007
in summer everyone will keep their windows and doors open and when they do it the noise is kinda bothering. no neighbour complained yet. but, this will help not to get complains.

he may be right if you remove the fans. fan requires some power


[27-Apr-19 04:10 AM] SHossain#0007
antminers wont start if the mainboard doesn't detect their high-quality(!) fans. there are some circuit boards which you can plug-in into fan slot, remore the fans and the mainboard will think fan is there and the miner will run without spitting error

[01-May-19 06:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
@polycryptoblog i haven't done the hard math on why i would want a grin asic instead of an fpga


[01-May-19 06:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
but one cool thing I see is that the grin asic can do various cuckoo variants, I think, so it's a "flexible asic", not totally hardcoded to one exact pow algo


[01-May-19 06:32 AM] dukeleto#7326
the cuckoo variants may be done in firmware, not hardware, haven't looked into it much

@polycryptoblog an F1+ seems like the more flexible HW, haven't looked at current breakeven numbers, as they are very fuzzy and hard to estimate

can I get some feedback on real world avg power consumption of the z11 at stock speeds.
The hosting facility I'm using is saying the power consumption is around 1510-1530 on average and that just sounds awfully high at stock speeds.


[01-May-19 08:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
@LoPhatMelk | CEO of $ARRR that number will depend on 110v vs 220v

@LoPhatMelk | CEO of $ARRR  that‚Äôs about right spec sheet says like 1480 with 10% variance


[01-May-19 09:58 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@dukeleto   They had a crazy deal,  preorder price nearly half the actual price , some mystery ROI feature , PSU included , 3 more months of warranty, multi-algo like you mentioned, starts shipping 2 months before Obelisk and a refund if they don‚Äôt make their target.  Obelisk only manufactured 2500ish machines and they are only good for cuck31+ , April 2020 grin switches to cuck32+ which inno has built in already so a little bit of future proof .    I am looking at getting some FPGAs , A few Blackminers for Verus and this other one I found for Equihash(n,k) , especially since it looks like that will be an additional assetchain parameter soon.     After that should complete my downsizing build out


[01-May-19 10:09 AM] LoPhatMelk | CEO of $ARRR#9055
@polycryptoblog  "Reference power on wall, Watt  1418" Where are you seeing the 1480 -/+10%?


[01-May-19 10:15 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
1418 sorry not 1480,  on the spec sheet  they posted . Typical condition: (typical power) = (min power)/90%, leave power output margin for PSU.   Wall power will always be a bit more than machine consumption


[01-May-19 10:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just saying the consumption is still in the ballpark of what it‚Äôs supposed to be

@phm87 still working on upgrading everything to sapling, then ARRR and any AC's with zaddrs will be able to do hushlisty things. the goal is that it's a protocol any compatible chain can use

I though it was n k parameters as ac params for future/new assetchains. I will read more about hush, it is in my todo list. I hope that every altcoin with custom n k pers will be able to become an assetchain


[01-May-19 01:15 PM] Ondalf#1318
@phm87 nope. it doesn't interest me. although it might change in future. i'm more worried about the coinbase tx entries of the new coins, which have been completely unnatural and off standards...


[01-May-19 01:21 PM] phm87#7395
@Ondalf   all these coins may risk or experience 51% or consensus pbs then (I hope) they may migrate to the kmd standards (kmd ac params are developed by experts, tested heavily with bounties). If coinbase entries are standard (according to ac params), we should take this future into account


[01-May-19 01:34 PM] Ondalf#1318
what's there to take in account? from pool perspective, nothing changes? its just wallets and chains that tries to keep up with the hashpower attacks and such things


[01-May-19 01:37 PM] phm87#7395
Few changes should be required. It is good as there is a standard (or future standard). As recently for some coins (emc2 and I don t remember the others)


[01-May-19 01:53 PM] phm87#7395
@Ondalf  do you prefer standard that are very well developed and tested or do you prefer custom code that break once a week ? (Some guys begins again their blockchain once week due to bugs. It won t happen with kmd AC)

somehow PIRATE is avoiding this effect


[07-May-19 06:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Because of community I believe,  pirate is one of the largest active privacy coins under monero .  When people believe in a project they will hold


[07-May-19 06:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Does ZEC have a lot of adoption?


[07-May-19 06:21 AM] dukeleto#7326
I also think that a much larger % of ARRR miners are mining for a longer time horizon, while 90+% of ZEC miners sell at the end of the day/week

Imagine if it only increases to 10% the following XMR/ZEC has


[07-May-19 06:23 AM] dukeleto#7326
ZEC had a huge, still has, a massive GPU miner community. They mostly feel left out of the ASIC world, many went to mine other GPU coins


[07-May-19 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
ARRR seems about 30% of ZEC tx activity


[07-May-19 06:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
also remember, ZEC forces every utxo to be shielded


[07-May-19 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
coinbase


[07-May-19 06:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
doesn't that double what their tx activity should really look like?


[07-May-19 06:24 AM] jl777c#5810
which is by and large immediately sent to exchange


[07-May-19 06:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
right, i am saying that ZEC tx activity will look bigger, because of the shielding rule


[07-May-19 06:24 AM] dukeleto#7326
"organic" ZEC xtns are actually fewer


[07-May-19 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is likely PIRATE already has the largest zaddr tx pool


[07-May-19 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
making it a much better "mixer" even without accounting for the massive privacy leakage zcash has from optional privacy

depends on what you mine, when you mine it, and what "a good deal" means to the individual

Do you have an actual, specific question?


[10-May-19 09:33 PM] AALEXJ#5233
If you are finding it difficult to figure out how to find the information on how to mine, let alone mine its self its just going to be easier to buy komodo instead of mining it.


[12-May-19 07:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I wonder if miners can expect relatively more big blocks when binance deposits/withdrawels open.


[12-May-19 07:17 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Should cause for more big wallet movements, no?


[12-May-19 07:20 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Cryptoon do you mean blocks with more fees since more xtns will be trying to happen?


[12-May-19 07:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Blocks with unclaimed intrest


[12-May-19 07:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Usually days with high volatility have more blocks with unclaimed rewards in them


[12-May-19 07:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
yes, i would agree to that


[12-May-19 07:34 AM] dukeleto#7326
high volatility makes the sleepers awaken, and some of them have lots of interest that goes unclaimed


[12-May-19 07:36 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Just a small tip, might be interesting to point some hash to kmd and cross fingers you get lucky...

üêî ChickenPool has been intentionally restarted üêî 
This was to change the number of blocks per payout for KMDICE to reduce the backlog of waiting payments created by some notarization timetable issues and a wait that seemed to create an exponentially growing number of waiting payments.

pretty interesting to see pools working with Efudd firmware


[18-May-19 03:27 AM] dukeleto#7326
article also mentions Pirate and KMD by name


[18-May-19 03:34 AM] jl777c#5810
20% more hashrate from same hardware!?


[18-May-19 03:36 AM] dukeleto#7326
Efudd firmware usually takes a % dev fee but evidently they have something worked out with Luxor, I think the default is 4%


[18-May-19 03:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
so on Luxor people will only pay 1% dev fee, and 0.5% to start. It's an interesting way to attract miners to your pool and your hashrate-boosting firmware


[18-May-19 03:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
I think because they let you adjust hashrate + voltage on each board, that let's it squeeze more hash out. Default UI must run all boards at the same speed/voltage


[18-May-19 03:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
it's especially good for later batches, which often just have 1 "bad" board that makes the entire rig run slower


[18-May-19 03:41 AM] dukeleto#7326
I am not sure it's worth it to run efudd firmware on batch 1's, they can run at max speed already

payouts to sapling zaddrs, to clarify


[19-May-19 03:31 PM] dukeleto#7326
there are 5 250 HUSH bounties for pools to add sapling zaddr payouts

there is no order, just the first 5 pools

or the transaction version

What'd you have to do to it?


[24-May-19 10:35 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Also why is it hard coded to reject absurd fees? To protect people from fucking it away with fat fingers?


[25-May-19 07:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka it's meant to protect average users from paying fees larger than the amount they are sending


[25-May-19 07:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka z_sendmany also has similar code


[25-May-19 07:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
I can see it's value to attempt to prevent users from making xtns


[25-May-19 07:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
But once it's in the mempool, the code seems misguided. Of course mining pools are going to comment that shit out


[25-May-19 07:17 AM] dukeleto#7326
I feel that it should be a CLI option, so KMD pools don't have to patch their code


[25-May-19 07:18 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
It protects average users through stopping other nodes accepting your transaction?


[25-May-19 07:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
If I were a pool op, I would run the code that makes me the most money


[25-May-19 07:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka if everybody followed the rule, yes. But obviously, that is not going to happen


[25-May-19 07:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
It only takes one person to comment it out, then everybody else is incentivized to do the same


[25-May-19 07:19 AM] dukeleto#7326
@NutellaLicka some RPC's prevent transactions from ever getting to the mempool, because fee > amount. I think that is reasonable


[25-May-19 07:19 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah that is


[25-May-19 07:19 AM] dukeleto#7326

@Deleted User at attempting what?


[26-May-19 08:50 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
estimating for PoS/PoW hash rate?


[26-May-19 08:52 AM] Deleted User#0000
yes. 
The RPC that does it, uses the block ahshes, and making it simply skip the PoS blocks, made it so that it had either the wrong amount of blocks to calc average, or resulted in some ridiculuosly large number because the expected time was longer than it rally was if that makes any sense.


[26-May-19 08:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
in short block times change a lot on staking chains, becaus stakers stake blocks 60s into future.... so you need a whole new diff calc algo, and I just dont know how to do that tbh.


[26-May-19 08:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the only way I could see doing it would involve an identifying tag on the block and a bunch of math that would likely create more lag than it would be worth


[26-May-19 08:56 AM] Deleted User#0000
there is a flag for POS vs POW blocks in the block index, doing that would be extremly fast. The entire chain of OUR takes less thana  second to loop whole index.


[26-May-19 08:57 AM] Deleted User#0000
If someone else can tell me in psudo code what math needs to be done.... I can try it. 
Somethign like 
`if PoS block skip this block... while still counting 100 blocks.`


[26-May-19 08:58 AM] Deleted User#0000
and then each block that was skipped you need to afjust the time... its never going to be 100% right becuiase the block times are all over the place.


[26-May-19 09:06 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
```time =0, lastBlockTime=time_of_last_block, PoWblocks=0
for x = 1 to 100
get block info
if PoS then
    lastBlockTime = ThisBlockTime
    next x
else
    PoWblocks += 1
    some var/array about diff
    newTime = timeNow - lastBlockTime
    totalTime = totalTime + newTime
    lastBlockTime = newTime
next x
do math of num PoW blocks over PoW active Time with stored diff info```
ish


[26-May-19 09:17 AM] Deleted User#0000
ok once I finish beating my head into the C++ compiler I'll see if I can work it out.


[26-May-19 09:19 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
basically it's the same as it would be done if PoS never existed nor did the time that PoS took up


[26-May-19 09:20 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
if the last 15 minutes were all PoS, then that 15 minutes never existed

so you're saying normal diff calc but completely ignoring pos blocks?


[26-May-19 09:35 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

I think they want the average actual PoW difficulty. There is only one way to do that and thats with genies algo above. Deosnt look that bad, I just need to skip the PoS blocks, and then remove the time between each of those also in the total.


[26-May-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it prints the actual PoW difficulty

I can use the fuinction that calcs the pow diff for last 100 blocks... but it will take some mods so it always return the average... Hopefully this small edit to the RPC is all thats needed.

We need some people to help out in mining the CHIPS chain with their asics. Does anyone have unprofitable miners that are shutdown at the moment that they can lend towards this effort? Can pay the electricity costs if not too crazy

@hyperDEX what is up with CHIPS? does CG keep stalling the chain?


[29-May-19 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
why would it ever be the responsibility of a single person to keep the chain running?


[29-May-19 05:10 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i meant to say that CG *purposefully* stalls chains to teach "lessons", which he has described before. Not that it was his job to keep it unstalled


[29-May-19 05:52 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
CHIPS is dealing with a problem not many, if any, chains have had to deal with yet


[29-May-19 05:52 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
That is, being at the point where the rewards are tiny

@ComputerGenie you have every right to switch to and from any coin you choose, i wasn't saying it disrespectfully. But I vaguely remembered some AC's which would stall whenever your rigs switched away or did something else. It's a great way to point out that a certain network is not decentralized enough


[29-May-19 07:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the AC issues were more of the fact that I was free-mining them with a GPU while most folks were set to on-demand via daemon and any time I went offline it took a while for CPUs to hit that diff after a tx existed


[29-May-19 08:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's just a simple fact that when no one mines a chain, the chain doesn't move ü§∑üèΩ

[31-May-19 04:30 PM] bishop#9773
LN is dependent on SHA256? Doesn't sound right


[31-May-19 04:35 PM] daemonfox#6136
Sounds like a solution to be had... a KMD coin with LN integration running the CPU, GPU and ASIC equalizing Verushash


[31-May-19 05:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
Verushash is already in chips, but its not activated and is the old version. So its no longer CPU only.


[31-May-19 05:05 PM] Deleted User#0000
I can easily finish that off and go to 1.1, which is the version labs fungible chains use. No GPU miner for it, bit can easily be made.


[31-May-19 05:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
FPGA I think could also, but as chips br is so small I don't see that happening.

But asic and stop chain dead if sha256 CPU mined chain.


[31-May-19 05:22 PM] phm87#7395
I put few cpu threads on Chips and my gpu when the chain stalled but my hashrate was not enough to make the chain move again

With no block reward its pretty hard to fix, I think a 30s block time with some CPU alto would be OK, then some notaries can just mine if no miners are interested.


[31-May-19 05:51 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Merged mining solves the low reward problem however will require some coding and dedicated  pool operator to add chips, and then getting enough hashrate on the main coin to make it attractive .


[31-May-19 06:14 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Could even make it so that payouts of auxpow coins is all done in chips.  Just swapping on Dex .  Kill a couple birds there


[31-May-19 06:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Don't over complicate it, make it impossible for rogue miner to stall the chain and be done with it. Who cares if block reward is small. It has dpow for security, although slowing block time and reducing dpow to every 10 blocks is likely a good idea too.

[01-Jun-19 07:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
@AALEXJ not sure what you are asking. z9m's are 300w at stock hashrate, overclocked they are more like 450w I think


[01-Jun-19 07:52 AM] dukeleto#7326
batch 1 z9m's can be OC'ed by 50% (500 Mhz to 750 Mhz)


[01-Jun-19 08:00 AM] AALEXJ#5233
Ok


[01-Jun-19 08:33 AM] dukeleto#7326
@AALEXJ very roughly, a z9m will probably mine you about 20 LABS/day, with current hashrate. Obviously hashrate can change drastically at any moment, but that is a data point

So many used A9's are hitting the streets. People are preparing for their A9++'s arriving

if you can ctrl +c to stop a daemon from running, then you're not properly running it to begin with
because, "daemon"

@here - i am not sure if you miners do taxes, but i do .. and tax season is a bitch...

I have a solution, YOU HEARD  THIS IDEA HERE FIRST FROM ME

`miningfool.com`

 i am working on a great new feature.

soon you will be able to download an excel or spreadsheet file that has a history of all your payouts ... (PURPOSELY BUILT TO MAKE TAXES EASY)

For a year you choose..... i support 7 years of data in the past...

you will be able to download a spreadsheet with your payout history for that entire year by month by day.. payouts will be rolled up for each day.. just the way the tax man likes them...

for each day of there year where you had atleast one payout,  you will have the Coin Name, Coin Amount, US Dollar Amount, DATE
in a nice PERFECT spreadsheet FOR TAX PURPOSES

obviously the link to download will be on your miner page... so its a a spreadsheet report PER address..

but this will make doing taxes SUPER EASY

soon this feature will be available...

YOU HEARD THIS IDEA HERE FIRST

Does anyone have a public API that tracks blocks that contain unclaimed rewards? I've got personal tools that I use, but I was wondering if there was anything for the general public to see...

I store each block and it's reward what are you exactly after I'm sure if I have the data I can publish it

@Pool-Operator Please update your pool daemon with latest Komodo source ASAP. You can use https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo or https://github.com/jl777/komodo . For branch, we suggest to use `master` branch for pools. However, if you know what you are doing, you can also use `beta` branch. As soon as you finish updating, please ping us here with your pool name. If you need help please ask here. @ComputerGenie @webworker01 @NutellaLicka @mrlynch are experienced pool operator and are ready to help you.

Update process is simple. You can issue the following commands to compile updated `komodod` (change branch name if needed). These commands to be used as general guidance and to keep compile issues at minimum level. If you want to update using your own method, please go ahead.
```
cd ~/komodo
git reset --hard
make clean
git checkout master
git pull
./zcutil/fetch-params.sh
./zcutil/build.sh -j$(nproc)
```
Once you finish updating, `getinfo` call should display `"KMDversion: 0.4.0a",`

Note: This is a hardforking update to include next Season 3 Notary Node keys and must be carried out before 15th July. Thank you very much for your co-operation.

but on the agama wallet the erros how to fix or how it works is difrent


[16-Jun-19 12:54 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
a qt wallet is just a daemon and a gui combined, if you can convert that then you can just convert the daemon


[16-Jun-19 12:55 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
chain-wise, there's nothing "special" that's in a qt wallet

[16-Jun-19 12:57 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I'm saying that there's nothing in a qt wallet that would convert to a pool that isn't in the non-gui daemon


[16-Jun-19 12:58 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
you asking about pool code and then saying you'd need a gui to do it doesn't make sense


[16-Jun-19 12:58 PM] zaza68#4573
no i did not say i want a qt wallet


[16-Jun-19 12:59 PM] zaza68#4573
i say i would be easy if zaddex had a qt wallet


[16-Jun-19 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`if zaddex had a qt wallet this was not a problem`
what does that have to do with pool code?


[16-Jun-19 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`i say i would be easy if zaddex had a qt wallet`
no easier than a non-gui daemon


[16-Jun-19 12:59 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's the same code


[16-Jun-19 01:00 PM] zaza68#4573
its not about the code its about the wallet setting up


[16-Jun-19 01:00 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
you set up the wallet the same as komodo or any other equihash coin

Hello, has anyone tried mining KMD token on a raspberry pi?


[17-Jun-19 08:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
kmd is ASIC minable, so doubt you will get many blocks on a raspberry pi?

Yes

Aha, not sure komodod is runable on a raspberry, I think @radix42 made some ports, but not sure if it applies to mining as well


[17-Jun-19 09:00 AM] radix42#3743
you can only theoretically run it on a rasp pi 3B+ if you load a 64bit OS and add a lot of swap

@dukeleto equihash


[17-Jun-19 09:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
Equihash is the algorithm behind ZEC/KMD/HUSH and many chains


[17-Jun-19 09:11 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is what we are talking about, Equihash (200,9) mining

[17-Jun-19 09:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
Learning about mining basically means becoming part sys-admin


[17-Jun-19 09:14 AM] dukeleto#7326
If that doesn't interest you, you probably don't want to be a miner


[17-Jun-19 09:15 AM] StEvUgnIn#7116
I see


[17-Jun-19 09:15 AM] dukeleto#7326
Or you can use GUI programs that will take a large % of your earnings. I don't use those


[17-Jun-19 09:15 AM] radix42#3743
heh, I'm all sysadmin, I just never have the money for the mining gear lol

or current whatever


[17-Jun-19 09:16 AM] dukeleto#7326
yeah, usb C maxes out at 2.5amp but it can pull 4amp when all cores are in use


[17-Jun-19 09:17 AM] dukeleto#7326

[17-Jun-19 09:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
@StEvUgnIn learning still costs money, is my advice. z9 mini's are the cheapest way to learn to mine Equihash coins. You can use GPU's, but they will never be profitable on Equihash ever again. Your learning adventure is up to you


[17-Jun-19 09:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
z9 mini's cost less than almost all GPU's now, which is really funny


[17-Jun-19 09:19 AM] StEvUgnIn#7116
ok thankks


[17-Jun-19 09:20 AM] StEvUgnIn#7116
can you interface it to your board?


[17-Jun-19 09:22 AM] dukeleto#7326
no comprendo


[17-Jun-19 09:22 AM] StEvUgnIn#7116
it requires a high current of 25 amp?


[17-Jun-19 09:22 AM] StEvUgnIn#7116
*do you interface your z9 mini to a single board computer?


[17-Jun-19 09:23 AM] StEvUgnIn#7116
* can you actually power it with a external power source?


[17-Jun-19 09:26 AM] pinkcookie#4334
@StEvUgnIn  z9 mini utilizes roughly 300 watts which equates to close to 1.4 amps and there are power supply‚Äôs available for a power source


[17-Jun-19 09:32 AM] StEvUgnIn#7116
the voltage source is 12 Volts


[17-Jun-19 09:32 AM] StEvUgnIn#7116
*okay got it


[17-Jun-19 09:33 AM] StEvUgnIn#7116
have you ever experimented using renewable energy for mining?


[17-Jun-19 09:33 AM] pinkcookie#4334
on a 120 voltage source you‚Äôre looking at 2.3 amps


[17-Jun-19 09:43 AM] dukeleto#7326
with efficiency losses, is more like 2.5amps on the wall


[17-Jun-19 09:50 AM] dukeleto#7326
PSU efficiency depends on 120/220v and ambient temp


[17-Jun-19 09:51 AM] StEvUgnIn#7116
okay thanks


[17-Jun-19 09:53 AM] dukeleto#7326
@StEvUgnIn you are early in your journey, just keep learning as much as you can. Having a journal where you right down what you learn and what is not making sense also helps you learn faster

I‚Äôm sure all of you guys already know this, but let me tell you about my scam experience on eBay. First off never send any crypto to eBay sellers! I‚Äôm sitting chomping at the bits to get a Z11 because I want to my mining op to grow, so I venture over to eBay because all z11‚Äôs are sold out. I see this ad and buy the machine because this guy has great reviews but he wants to be paid in crypto, at first I find it strange but then again I have bought so many machines from bitmain that it doesn‚Äôt seem that odd. Long story short this guy says the listing was never his and basically I sent my btc to a scammer address either it be him or someone that ‚Äúhacked‚Äù his eBay account. So let me lose out on money so you don‚Äôt! Don‚Äôt send crypto to eBay sellers, bad idea friends!

that may well be true, but that doesn't counter-balance an "asic resistant" chain and my ability to drop $400k on GPUs and you can only buy 2


[18-Jun-19 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
in fact, it doing it makes your barrier to entry greater than on an "asic friendly" chain

seems a 1.5mil utxo depositned 250k into binance, it was one months of rewards!


[19-Jun-19 03:03 AM] CHMEX#0686
yes correct just noticed Vo9KWjXT was the deposit so RqqkQmi was a cold store
So maybe they claim rewards only on the hotwallet


[19-Jun-19 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought it was a user that deposited to the binance address?


[19-Jun-19 03:10 AM] CHMEX#0686
I dont think so Vo9KWjXT is the hot wallet and got 250k it did not go to a user deposit address which than would be swept to Vo9KWjXT

@jl777c did they use "shared" keys or something?


[19-Jun-19 04:26 AM] jl777c#5810
they support delegating your stake to another pubkey


[19-Jun-19 04:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so address X -> gives stake power to Y


[19-Jun-19 04:26 AM] jl777c#5810
when Y stakes it uses Y + sum of all Xi as its staking power


[19-Jun-19 04:27 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
sounds nice but also sounds like a code nightmare


[19-Jun-19 04:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it would be much harder for a utxo based coin. i think DCR solves it via creating "ticket"


[19-Jun-19 04:28 AM] jl777c#5810
so each ticket has equal weight and has an owner and a staker

@Pool-Operator  friendly reminder to update your pool daemon to `KMDversion 0.4.0a` ASAP if you haven't done yet. Otherwise, you will be on fork on 15th July. Please post here or ping me as soon as you have updated. More than half of the pools are not updated according to our knowledge. So far the following list of pools already updated.
```
http://chickenpool.com/
https://minethechains.com/
http://luckpool.org/
http://zpool.ca/
http://www.kmdmonster.com/
http://kmd.altpool.pro/
http://solo-kmd.altpool.pro/
https://kmd.coinblockers.com/
https://mining-dutch.nl/
```
If your pool is on the list, please ignore my message. If your pool is not on the above list, you need to update. If you have updated and your pool is not on the list, please let us know.
Thank you very much for your support.

You could use nicehash and rent the hash.
There is also mining rigs rental is you google.

[28-Jun-19 08:38 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`Just looking for someone to set up and mine the coin. `
right, but what I mean more specifically:
1 GPU? 10? 100?
what split percentage are you seeking on the rewards? Or are you looking for all of the rewards it brings and they just get the $2k?
etc.


[28-Jun-19 08:43 AM] rainbro7#4735
Ah, I understand. Is payment of 1.35 electricity costs fair? Or at cost payment and a coin split of 70 30. Something like that.


[28-Jun-19 08:45 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
"fair" is relative, that's why I'm saying your best bet is to be specific and see if what you want is attractive to folks


[28-Jun-19 08:47 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
example:
```
I want to rent 15 GPUs for an entire month to mine CoinY.
I have a $2,000 budget and I expect:
x
y

[07-Jul-19 07:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Ederwa  please try to update the daemon to latest source if pool has issue. This was a known bug I think, which has been fixed. 
That message is ambigious. With the fixed I submitted just after th hard fork, it will now say "Create block failed" Which still isnt great, but at least it tells you what the issue is. 
It seems that sometimes a block is built that fails `TestBlockValidity` we couldnt work out why this was happening so I changed the error handling so that it will just keep trying to make a block until it gets a valid one.


[07-Jul-19 07:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
Before it would either lock up or crash the daemon.


[07-Jul-19 07:50 PM] Ederwa#9659
@Deleted User thanks for your information. I got the code modified, recompiled the latest source, removed block and database data and tried to resync the whole blockchain 6 hours ago. The sync is still in progress now. I'll update here if the problem is gone.


[08-Jul-19 12:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
thanks, the issue on KMD was somehting to do with FinalTx being wrong, but it seems after a while that it wil make a block without that tx in it. Still cant work out why it happens. If there is problem maybe we cna work out exactly what tx is doing it some how, that will at least help try to fix the issue properly.


[08-Jul-19 12:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
Other option is after a block has been created that fails, remove the broken tx from mempool.


[08-Jul-19 12:36 AM] Deleted User#0000
that will alow a block to be created right after.


[08-Jul-19 03:54 AM] Ederwa#9659

What do you get when you getblocktemplate direct through cli?


[08-Jul-19 03:57 AM] Ederwa#9659
Even though I modified the code, removed all of block data and re-synced the blockchain, both KMD and ARRR pool don't work properly.

then the issue is in your pool code


[08-Jul-19 03:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
if the daemon ever gives you a reply but the pool says it doesn't, then the issue is in the pool

@webworker01 It's been stuck in "Activating best chain" for two hours. I have nothing can do.


[08-Jul-19 07:09 AM] Ederwa#9659
I think so, too. Both of the KMD source and pool software were up-to-date. I have no idea what else I should do.


[08-Jul-19 07:10 AM] jl777c#5810
stop mining until it is in sync


[08-Jul-19 07:27 AM] Ederwa#9659
@jl777c I didn't mine since Knomp kept throwing "create block failed". Then I stopped  pool software  and restarted daemon but the ARRR daemon was stuck in "Activating best chain".


[08-Jul-19 07:29 AM] Ederwa#9659
That's why the block height is inconsistent and I really don't know what else I can/should do.


[08-Jul-19 07:33 AM] Deleted User#0000
wait until its finished activating best chain. pirate is very slow


[08-Jul-19 07:40 AM] Ederwa#9659
Yup, I knew. I did the first resync 18 hours ago and the height was updated at #444651. After restarting the daemon, I got nothing different but notarizations just kept going (now is at ht. 338455).


[08-Jul-19 09:51 AM] Ederwa#9659
Failed again. I started second full sync of whole blockchain of ARRR and KMD. Hope this can fix everything.


[08-Jul-19 10:06 AM] Ederwa#9659

[08-Jul-19 06:53 PM] Ederwa#9659
Guys, after second full sync of ARRR blockchain, the block height is up-to-date and a new block can be mined (found). But I still got the same error "getblocktemplate call failed for daemon instance 0 with error {"code":-7,"message":"Out of memory or no available utxo for staking"}"


[08-Jul-19 06:59 PM] Ederwa#9659
By using cli command, getblocktemplate is working fine. However, this exception looks being thrown from the daemon code - mining.cpp. I'm using beta branch, but it doesn't include the fix of TestBlockValidity. Should I revise the code with the fix manually?


[08-Jul-19 07:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
Really not sure man, I would need to actually check this actual machine, Im totally lost oas to what your problem is


[08-Jul-19 07:16 PM] Deleted User#0000
The mining fix should be pushed, you should not be changing the code, unless you really know what your doing. Thats likely the issue here üòÑ


[08-Jul-19 07:51 PM] Ederwa#9659
I'm sure what I've done. The first issue and the last are the same ...about TestBlockValidity. And between two sync of full ARRR blockchain, one issue is that the sync was stuck in "Activating best chain" over 2+ hours and the other is peer connections were refused.


[08-Jul-19 07:52 PM] Ederwa#9659
I followed SHossain's recommendation, checked out the beta branch, recompiled the code and did the 3rd full sync.


[08-Jul-19 07:54 PM] Ederwa#9659
But the situation seems going back to the beginning.


[08-Jul-19 08:10 PM] Deleted User#0000
I dont know what branch the mining fix for KMD is in, but it really should not affect PRIATE in any case.


[08-Jul-19 08:11 PM] Deleted User#0000
PIRATE is just very slow. There is no reason to keep syncing chains, you are just wating time


[08-Jul-19 10:17 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
@Ederwa 
send
`setgenerate true 1

and see if that changes it

@Deleted User I still got "CreateNewBlock(): create block failed" errors from both KMD and ARRR daemon. However the pools are working fine in mining now except those annoying messages. Blocks keeps being dug out. Maybe the issue will be resolved in next release. I don't know but currently I won't try any fixes in the short period of time.

complete mining noob here, but is cloud mining something worth investing time in to consider doing in your opinions?

or are it mainly ripoffs?


[12-Jul-19 07:17 AM] Alright#0419
generally if a "cloud mining" site doesn't allow you to freely direct the hashrate to any pool you choose, it's a *literal* ponzi

each of those sites can be profitable if you have a decent strategy or just plan to spec mine something

but if you're just blindly renting hash, you're going to lose money


[12-Jul-19 07:24 AM] Alright#0419
recommend using MRR over the other two, nicehash has high diff requirements, meaning you're wasting hashrate if you're mining a (relatively)low diff coin and I haven't used hashtap at all

the `nodl` could be mining which could explain the diff.

on a non-mining node i get:

In terms of tx fee, how is KMD protocol ?

KMD and all assetchains has 0.00010000 default txfee


[14-Jul-19 06:54 AM] Lordus Dicrurus#7491
But in BTC or KMD ? Because it's dPoW right ?


[14-Jul-19 06:54 AM] Alright#0419
can send 0 tx fee txes just fine almost always though


[14-Jul-19 06:54 AM] Alright#0419
you pay tx fees in the chain you're using


[14-Jul-19 06:54 AM] Alright#0419
so if an asset has their own chain, you tx fees in that asset


[14-Jul-19 03:49 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
BTC has nothing to do with the average user of Komodo @Lordus Dicrurus 
The only BTC involved is for Notary Nodes to notarise the chain onto the BTC chain.

for deep reasons, rasppi doesn't have the correct ARM stuff, and it's just not a great piece of HW for the cost

@Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r very interesting, welcome to the community. Is this the private or public sector that is funding this?


[17-Jul-19 02:58 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
@dukeleto its private. Blockchain tech is kinda still a mystery in Nigeria. I'm most likely one of the few miners here in Nigeria.


[17-Jul-19 04:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r you are on the bleeding edge! Very nice to hear from you. Are there any cryptocoin exchanges based in your country currently or would you be building the first?


[17-Jul-19 04:18 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
@dukeleto We don't have any indigenous exchange. There's Luno, they only offer BTC and ETH


[17-Jul-19 04:18 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
Luno is a multinational


[17-Jul-19 04:37 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r sounds like you have good timing to launch a proper exchange that is geared towards your country. Are the local laws favorable towards cryptocoins?


[17-Jul-19 04:38 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r also, to keep it a bit on topic, may I ask what kind of electricity rates people in your country would pay for mining? I haven't heard much statistics about Africa


[17-Jul-19 04:47 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
About laws. There isn't much regulation in the space right now. I guess the government is still trying to understand it all.  About electricity, its not so favourable on this front. There's no steady power supply, most times, we have to run our own generators. I'm lucky though, my mining facility has free electricity from a multinational my family leased land to. Lol. @dukeleto


[17-Jul-19 04:51 AM] hyperDEX#6586
haha nice


[17-Jul-19 04:53 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
@hyperDEX  yeah. I'm certain there aren't much miners in Nigeria because of the hassle and cost of running a farm


[17-Jul-19 04:54 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
I spend about $10 per month. That's cost for internet.


[17-Jul-19 04:55 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Wow that is pretty cool. Is solar an option for a more stable electricity?


[17-Jul-19 05:00 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
Nigeria is pretty hot. Solar is a solid option. That's for private individuals though. My country has really poor governance. Corruption.


[17-Jul-19 05:03 AM] hyperDEX#6586
The problem with solar is you would need to store it overnight too.


[17-Jul-19 05:05 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Batteries cost is crazy, unless you can capture that power it would be wasted effort. I saw a video once where during the day, solar panels excess power was used to pump water up to a dam. During the night, the water was released from the dam to generate hydro power and the cycle repeats.


[17-Jul-19 05:08 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
@hyperDEX  that's really smart.


[17-Jul-19 05:18 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741
I can't really imagine that happening in Nigeria now. According to our government, the problem really isn't power generation. Its more of a distribution problem. This generation of leaders seriously have no interest in solving the power issues.


[17-Jul-19 05:21 AM] hyperDEX#6586
That sucks, all politicians get into politics for money/power or fame. not to help its population.


[17-Jul-19 05:38 AM] Ralphie_Alld3stroy3r#4741

Iran Legalizes Crypto Mining - CoinDesk
Iran is officially recognizing bitcoin mining as an industry it will regulate and for which it will set electricity rates.

@matt_odell I'm not so sure... 5 years without updating your cold storage method is a long time in Bitcoin. Imo most of these coins are likely lost.

above is the pool, if you can point hash to it in the next half hour or so and push the hashrate up as high as possible, we can see how well it does

We will start in about 40 mins. pool is ready. if you are interested, please prepare your miners to point to the above pool at the same time. @mrlynch is also participating at that time with us.


[31-Jul-19 11:32 AM] SHossain#0007
if you have over Z11 or renting from nicehash, please use port 3033. e.g: `stratum+tcp://178.159.11.114:3033`

we just need about half an hour to max the difficulty and then we will use a single CPU core to recover the chain back to normal!

it would be great if someone can make a detailed blog post about this test, with all the details. it does solve a very large problem for all the smaller blockchains

recording the times the blocks start coming in and diff would be very useful, though it would be onchain evidence anyway

would be interesting to calculate how long adaptive takes, versus estimate of average time on default DAA

would give a ratio of how much better it is

did James give an estimate for how long it would normally take? without adaptive?

normal DAA does not adjust until the next block


[31-Jul-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
if it takes a year to mine the next block, this is a problem


[31-Jul-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
a fast DAA will get the diff back to hashrate in about 50 blocks


[31-Jul-19 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
but if the average is 6 months per block, then we are talking 25 years

the gap between blocks are getting closer


[31-Jul-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
yes and the time for the six blocks longer


[31-Jul-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
seems pretty constant 16 minutes per 6 blocks!


[31-Jul-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
this is a fantastic result. still at 400000x, but as long as it continues 2/3 reducing the diff every 2 hours, it should be to 14k in 8 hrs from stranding


[31-Jul-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
and from there still another 8 hours before it gets to anything reasonable for a single CPU to mine normally, 170 diff after 16 hrs, so probably needs another 8 hours to get to a diff of 2. so estimate is 1.3 million diff down to 2 in 24 hours with a single CPU

I just wonder how fast the difficulty would drop if none were mining....

once CHMEX makes an explorer, it will be even easier and charts witll be there


[31-Jul-19 02:52 PM] SHossain#0007
without mining the diff wouldn't drop


[31-Jul-19 02:52 PM] SHossain#0007
it will just hang in the last known diff until the next block mined

Any way to integrate this 'extra blocktime governor' into the standard blocktime governor in such a way that the difficulty of the next block does also factor in the adjustments made by AdaptiveDPoW? That would reduce the time to get to an acceptable difficulty even more.

@SHossain `it will just hang in the last known diff until the next block mined` if this is the case, stalls would still need manual fixing, no?


[31-Jul-19 05:18 PM] SHossain#0007
every chain will stall if no one is mining.


[31-Jul-19 05:19 PM] SHossain#0007
single CPU thread mining will not keep it stalled at all with adaptivepow


[31-Jul-19 05:19 PM] Alright#0419

[31-Jul-19 05:20 PM] Alright#0419
it will lower the diff between blocks?


[31-Jul-19 05:20 PM] SHossain#0007
30 mins to an hour max for the first 6 blocks and then it will continue

then, started CPU mining 25 mins later which got blocks almost instantly as it was about 30 mins since we mined the last block

[31-Jul-19 05:25 PM] SHossain#0007
it's going down with every block


[31-Jul-19 05:26 PM] SHossain#0007
it automatically activating for 100% PoW chains that are started on october 31st or later


[31-Jul-19 05:26 PM] SHossain#0007
by that time it should be merged into beta even master branch

`Even if there are miners that are willing to rescue a stranded chain once, what if it happens again, and again` <- me for the last year


[31-Jul-19 05:28 PM] SHossain#0007
by that time James might figure out something for existing chains hopefully


[31-Jul-19 05:30 PM] SHossain#0007
this would fix all your issue with unstalling a stranded chain just using 1 CPU thread only


[31-Jul-19 05:30 PM] SHossain#0007
i would be happy to see this working by default for all existing 100% PoW chain from next hardfork


[31-Jul-19 05:31 PM] SHossain#0007
from over a million diff to under 50,000 diff in less than 5 hours is pretty cool


[31-Jul-19 05:32 PM] Alright#0419
you chain params for this?


[31-Jul-19 05:32 PM] Alright#0419

[31-Jul-19 05:33 PM] Alright#0419
time warps


[31-Jul-19 05:34 PM] SHossain#0007
i'll post the param after about 18 hours later. until then, i want to have controlled mining to bring the diff down with single thread. but, you can start a new 100% PoW chain with `-ac_adaptivepow=1` using `nSPV` branch to test


[31-Jul-19 05:34 PM] Alright#0419
did he make it intentionally time warp similar to pos64?


[31-Jul-19 05:35 PM] SHossain#0007
what is time wrap?


[31-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Alright#0419
push timestamps into the past or future to mess with the diff


[31-Jul-19 05:35 PM] Alright#0419
take a look at a pos64 chain, you'll see what I mean


[31-Jul-19 05:36 PM] Alright#0419
look for a POW block followed by a POS block and you'll see that the POS block will be submitted with a timestamp in the future


[31-Jul-19 05:37 PM] SHossain#0007
didn't have any explorer to check the timestamp and i am monitoring only debug.log

[01-Aug-19 02:26 PM] zawy#5864
I've been discussing with @jl777c how to do this.  Quick drops like this after hash attacks without symmetrical ability to increase causes too many coins to be issued, if the large miner wants to come back as soon as it is low again. BCH's asymmetrical EDA was a famously bad example and we're trying to do something 10,000x more extreme.   If you try to make it symmetrical with fast rises when the attacks begin, you end up in persistant wild oscillations as as the big miner comes and goes.   However this is an extreme situation where coins get stuck, so it's hard to imagine it being worse.   To test the theory this will issue too many coins, model for a 1000x miner to start mining if difficulty drops < 5x the  basiline miners' hashrate, and then stops when difficulty reaches 100x

I guess the primary risk is causing problems for coins that were not at risk of getting stuck, opening a door for more profit, pulling an attacker into existence.


[01-Aug-19 02:30 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
in theory, the CPU additive would reduce the large miner's ability to do "as much" damage (in what you're saying) because the chain keeps moving, which in turn stops the diff from reaching the mega-drop levels


[01-Aug-19 02:31 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
It's not a "fix all", but it seems to me like a great additive for chains that have prolonged times of non-movement

[01-Aug-19 02:41 PM] zawy#5864
The problem is not that the difficulty drops too low, but that a big miner oscillates on and off without letting it drop back down to baseline..  A symmetrical DA will keep the correct average solvetime.  This kind of design is not supposed to.   I'm curious how bad it can get.   I'm posting to share a note of caution.   I'll probably be in private conversation with @jl777c for a few days.

[01-Aug-19 02:46 PM] zawy#5864
I have not changed my mind on anything since our last conversation.  If you can send it through rigorous testing and it works OK, then great.  It will be nice if you can simply change the MTP =11 to MTP = 1  and everything works as I hope, fixing at least 2 things at once by changing only 1 byte


[01-Aug-19 02:48 PM] zawy#5864
Once out of sequence timestamps are prevented, the main dangers are oscillation and too many blocks issued per day.

@CHMEX normal utxos become spendable by the wallet with just 1 confirmation (by default, some RPCs will allow you to spend 0 confirm utxos), but coinbase utxos must become "mature" which means 100 confs


[02-Aug-19 05:40 AM] dukeleto#7326
I don't know of any wallets that prevent a transaction with only 1 conf and require 2 confs, to spend. 2 confs is mostly for exchanges/pools to know that something is notarized

@dukeleto  if a zcash miner is profitable mining ZEC, does he revolt if he mines the most profitable coin (whatever if it is ZEC or not) and ask to be paid in anything except ZEC ? Mining rewards will be sold on exchange (dump of ZEC) and buy orders will be added on the payment coin
Because if many ZEC miners begin to mine Kmd or Hush, Kmd/hush nethash will increase and profit will decrease

@jl777c  Taking 150 blocks to rise 10,000x is too long when it can recover after an attack in maybe 30 blocks.  The following rises 1/2 way to 10,000x in 15 blocks, replacing the trigger with  3 simple moving averages with windows N=4, 7, and 12. 
```
bnTarget =min(bnTarget, sum(past 4 targets)*T/(nTime-B[-4].nTime)/5, sum(past7 targets)*T/(nTime-B[-7].nTime)/3, sum(past12 targets)*T/(nTime-B[-12].nTime)/2);
```
Difficulty algorithms have a choice between speed of reponse and stability.   When triggers are added to a moving average of any sort (Digishield, SMA, LWMA, or EMA) as a way to deal with sudden large changes in hashrate, you have to choose between bad oscillations if the miners come and go (causing long delays) and  blocks being issued too fast or too slow. If the rise and fall are done "symmetrically" the solve times come out good and the worst case is oscillations with long delays. I always do symmetrical algos. If you rise faster than you fall, too few blocks are emitted if the attackers are persistent.  Falling faster than rising leads to too many blocks.  We should attempt faster rises than falls, but also avoid the long delays.   I have done mild versions of what we're attempting here and in about 25% of the cases it makes things noticeably worse.  Each time I think "hmmm, this looks like it will really work" to be disappointed later.  Miners find that sweet spot.   I can't predict what this is going to do.  I don't know if it can be said to rise faster than it falls.  There is the risk of trying to prevent problems from a few coins that have >100x attacks and making things worse for a lot more coins with <10x problems.  This algo's behavior depends completely on miner behavior.    You won't see a difference from digishield if the hashrate is relatively stable, except for about 5 spikes per day that  last 1 or 2 blocks each.  About once a week you'll see a 4x increase for 1 block.

[02-Aug-19 04:21 PM] zawy#5864
In terms of miner motivation, an increase in difficulty is supposed to be exactly equal to the same percent decrease in reward.  Miner motivation is what difficulty targets and miner motivation is proportional to reward/difficulty.  We could change reward, but if we change reward and difficulty at the same time, the adjustment factor determined by the algorithm must  be  equal  SQRT(difficulty/reward).    Changing only reward/time would target a difficulty in the way changing difficulty targets a reward/time.  Is it reasonable to target a difficulty?   If we target difficulty and knew what moore's law is going to do, can it achieve a constant value coin?    If we're not attempting something special like this, then the reward would have to be like a capacitor or an escrow account that stores up excess reward when it can, then releases it later to keep difficulty more stable.  And if the estimates are wrong, and you want to follow a certain emission rate, then it would have to revert to difficulty when the artificial bank account runs out of the reward savings.

[02-Aug-19 05:32 PM] zawy#5864
We're changing the difficulty during the block.  I guess we could change the reward based on when the block is submitted.  For example if it's submitted at 6 seconds, then reward is 1/10. If it's submitted at 120 seconds then reward is 2x.  ( We're also making thenodes keep precise time which means the miners can't cheat with a forward stamp. ) The linear function  may not be good.  There's a function I developed that may relieve some of the miners' burden of trying to decide  if and when to mine.   It would be about 1/2 reward for fast solves and 4x reward for some of the late solves, being symmetrical in a way that follows the poisson probabilities.  With or without that,  I think it can be done by making the difficulty window > 2x longer than the reward averaging window, if you want reward to smooth out difficulty.  But I don't know offhand how to do that, keeping the SQRTrequirement in mind.


[02-Aug-19 05:33 PM] dukeleto#7326
@zawy my hunch is that ` Miners find that sweet spot. ` is related to finding resonances/eigenmodes/zeros of the function which describes the DAA

[02-Aug-19 06:04 PM] zawy#5864
The worst problems occur when a big miner wants  the coin 50% more than anyone else,  constantly drives it up 50%. then leaves and no one mines it.  This is seen by tight sawtooth patterns (block number on x-axis, not time).   Since we're changing the difficulty during the block  it's not going to get stuck.  The only way to stop too many blocks from being found is to increase difficulty quickly....very quickly if  big miners are going to come back as soon as it drops back down. Since we can change difficulty during the block, it might be possible to prevent all problems. And maybe reward can do it.   For example, if last block was found in 20 s then maybe difficulty increase some and reward increases from 0 to 1x  at 60+20, and then difficulty drop if it takes longer to solve.  Then if it took  100 seconds the reward in next block will increase from 0 to 1x at 60-20 second while keeping the  difficulty half way between the avg and what it was at when the previous block was found.  Getting this working requires some thought.

How accurate can the timestamps be?


[02-Aug-19 06:17 PM] zawy#5864
I've told them I do not see a problem with the FTL being 4 seconds and changing Zcash's MTP from 11  to 1.  By doing this, everyblock is required to be timestamped 1 second after the previous one.  By tighting the allow rand of tmiestamps forwarding only 4 seconds (the only way to profit a little more) they can't profit hardly anything and risk nodes with slight time errors rejecting them.  BTW, this means if median node peer time is > 2 seconds off from a node's system tiem, the node should revert to system time. system time is the ultimate independent oracle that secures the blockchain against miners trying to increase block emission.  No central server for time should be used.


[02-Aug-19 06:17 PM] zawy#5864
I mean, yes NTP is probably good and can keep everyone accurate, but technically it is a centralization that should be avoided.  Ideally everyone uses a variety of accurate sources

@zawy i really like the three MA approach as this makes it impossible for attacker to just timestamp + 15 and bypass the single 4x trigger. not sure why you have 4, 7, 12, in the past i had good luck with prime based filters for noise reduction which makes it hard to find any pattern that isnt caught by them, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17 would be the choices, but maybe it is all overkill and there is some better reason for 4, 7, 12. I implemented it as above and just have the exponential calc left to do. the way i implemented it, having 6 MA wont be any trouble.

one idea to make it symmetric is to use a max() on all the above and use it to reduce diff in the event recent blocks are too slow. so an overall trigger as to the direction and then choosing either min() or max() of the same MA values. I think that would make it symmetric, but then biased overall toward dropping due to the diff stranding handling. maybe that can be balanced out by making the max() side take into account one fewer MA. 

without modeling, it is just guesswork, but it seems that it would be pretty symmetric other than the diff stranding recovery


[03-Aug-19 01:05 AM] jl777c#5810
if you think the symmetric min/max has merit, I can enable that for todays test


[03-Aug-19 02:29 AM] jl777c#5810
the exponential is working much gentler than the N^2, as expected. however, i tried without a compare of the time for the last12 blocks < 11*T, and the problem was that it was still boosting diff from the earlier hashrate, it seems to take several blocks for the diff from stop increasing, even after the hashrate is gone. of course after passage of enough time, the exponential kicks in.
still it seems better to have an additional test of <11T before making it harder and i also added a >13T before making it easier; the latter should give it an extra kick to the exponential decay, which feels slow, but only in comparison to the N^2.


[03-Aug-19 02:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i have only tested with CPU so far, but it is responding much faster to even just having 12 cores mining as compared to before. and after reducing to 1 core, within 15 blocks, the diff comes down to where it is getting one block per minute. before, it took a long time before the blockrate was the target rate, so your magic MA is working fantastic!


[03-Aug-19 02:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i still havent seen the max() side kick in yet, likely will need ASIC testing to trigger that side. my prediction is that it will just enhance the exponential decay a bit. i think this assymettry of the downward adjustment having an exponential decay might create some opening for miner games, but without the max() side to push down the diff, it seems there is far more room for games as the exponential decay doesnt kick in without a very long block.


[03-Aug-19 02:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so currently, unless the last 12 blocks happened faster than 11T or longer than 13T, nothing happens, other than exponential decay that is triggered with any long gap. the exponential is always the highest priority. if most recent 12 blocks are <11T, the min of the MA and bnTarget is used, if >13T then the max is used. i see many cases where it is <11T but there is nothing smaller than bnTarget, so it doesnt look like it has much noise.


[03-Aug-19 02:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so far it feels quite responsive and adjusts very fast to any new hashrate, and also back down when the hashrate is removed

[03-Aug-19 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
just did another test. diff was at 4 with one core, started 15 and in 18 minutes it got 21 blocks and the diff is now 20


[03-Aug-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
to have only 3 extra blocks as the diff rises from 4 to 20, that seems pretty good, not sure how it would translate to an ASIC starting up, but it seems that CPU mining tests are all working quite well.


[03-Aug-19 03:35 AM] jl777c#5810
as expected the exponential decay kicked in to drop the diff from 22 down to 8, but it is still double what it should be and the >13T side is activated now reducing the diff a bit faster as the exponential decay is not activating


[03-Aug-19 03:49 AM] jl777c#5810
20 blocks in about 30 minutes diff 5.7, so not bad at all.


[03-Aug-19 05:07 AM] zawy#5864
As someone pointed out to me last year, a symmetrical DA function F(t/T) to make this correct is  integral(F(t/T)\*e^(t/T))  = 1    This will result in the correct average solvetime.   I'm trying to figure out how to merge that idea with  a max of several functions that trigger on the upper and lower bounds.  I'm also thinking adjusting reward in some way along with difficulty has the most potential.


[03-Aug-19 05:59 AM] dukeleto#7326
@zawy it's possible to make piece-wise defined functions "smooth" and differentiable


[03-Aug-19 06:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
maybe you can create a function which is that integral, except on certain points/ranges


[03-Aug-19 06:00 AM] dukeleto#7326
and make it smooth


[03-Aug-19 06:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
Adjusting reward sounds like it makes predicting the emission schedule hard, like if I wanted to know how much coins have been emitted at time/block X


[03-Aug-19 06:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
that integral definition of F(t), where is that from?


[03-Aug-19 06:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
I might have to bust out some diff-eq moves on it


[03-Aug-19 06:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
to confirm, that integral is `dt` and not `dT`, correct ?


[03-Aug-19 06:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
I have done some math on an index card


[03-Aug-19 06:04 AM] dukeleto#7326
just like old times


[03-Aug-19 06:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
the integral you state above, it also implies ` F' = -F`


[03-Aug-19 06:05 AM] dukeleto#7326
which means `F(x) = C1*e^(-k*x) + C2`


[03-Aug-19 06:06 AM] dukeleto#7326
all you said was "it must be an exponential", with that integral, but you also said something about those constants. I could tell you what they are in terms of T


[03-Aug-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
changing reward is too big a change to the codebase to make it practical to implement


[03-Aug-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
with ASIC test it took 22 minutes for 100 blocks to get to 15k diff, so todays is slower than yesterdays


[03-Aug-19 06:18 AM] zawy#5864
@jl777c I chose the 3 based on intuition.  most of the benefit is achieved by using any 1 of them.  The N=4 catches big attacks early, but it also catches smaller attacks by some luck.   Conversely, the N=12 catches smaller HR increases, but also catches big ones before 12 blocks.  Also, notice the divisor can get smaller as N goes from 4 to 7 to 12, so if an attack is sustained to >= 12 blocks, the  N=12 SMA gets the difficulty 1/2 way to where it needs to be.....in only 12 blocks, sort of.   The faster SMAs are to jump-start it. Being within 1/2 , I then left it up to the conservatism of Digishield to slowly get to where it needs to be, taking maybe another 60 blocks.  Primes are too frequent.   The 5, 3, and 2 divsors are as small as possible without causing false triggers during normal hashrate.....and not overshooting difficulty if it is a false positive.  I estimate the divisor (before testing to refine it for stability) with divisor = N / (N-2\*SQRT(N) )   This is based on the rough basic 95% probability that N samples will be within have 2 std devs of the true average.   Std Dev of N sample is roughly SQRT(N).  For this reason it's not about primes, and as you go to higher N you see less benefit.   More roughly, the idea is to nearly double N before you see noticeable improvement, hence 4, 7, 12..  Doing it again with  N=20 is feasible to help digishild be faster. The divisor would be about 1.5.


[03-Aug-19 06:18 AM] zawy#5864
To make this symmetrical following the SMA route, the following is what i'll do today:   For each N-window SMA find the 0.25% per block probability that the SMA would be triggered if hashrate is constant and difficulty is correct. This means I find the  lambda for a given N=k window until the probability is 0.0025\*N.  The divsor is k/lamba.    The divisor is > 1  as above when blocks are being solved too fast and < 1 when they are coming too slow.  In this way I believe we will have a  symmetrical  and  very fast response.  I believe it will require only N=1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 windowns for fast and slow block times (12 total).  So the  highest-level of the  DA I think would be:
```
bnTarget = min( fast-solve SMAs , max( slow-solve SMAs, digishield));
```


[03-Aug-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
makes sense about the MA sizes. i used the same MA sums for both directions, just used min vs max to change direction. anyway looking forward to the ideal fast/slow MA parameters. in the meantime, we will test adding the 4x < T in addition to the current symmetric to try to get it to respond faster to the rise, the reduction in hashrate was slower than N^2, but still a lot faster than the ramp up


[03-Aug-19 06:29 AM] zawy#5864
@dukeleto The integral is d(t/T).   That equation shows that F(t/T) might be a lot more analyzable if it is of the e^x form instead of trying to use SMAs.


[03-Aug-19 06:30 AM] jl777c#5810
i know this is a "frankenstein" hybrid nowhere as elegant as the fast/slow symmetrical, but experimentally i think it can do quite well


[03-Aug-19 06:35 AM] jl777c#5810
also for the fast/slow, even if a MA is needed for every N, that is ok, the overhead wont be large at all


[03-Aug-19 06:37 AM] zawy#5864
I haven't looked at your code yet.  What's frakenstein?  mixing  e^x on one side and SMAs on the other?    Yes that's a bit frakenstein, but it could work because e^x at small x is approximately 1+x so the linearity of the SMAs could be mathematically very close to the needed e^x functions.   So it may be that we need several EMAs on the  other side.  But I want to work out the symmetrical SMAs on both sides.

The path I've described above is a postulate. I'll eventualy do modelling to check the theory.   Trying different things by modelling until they work is a risky path. I have  used modelling only to refine constants because my estimates of the probabilities have some error.


[03-Aug-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
ZAWY7 will have e^x on one side and 4blocks < T/2 on the other side (ZAWY5) and the 3/7/12 SMA on both sides


[03-Aug-19 06:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is the e^x and 4x <T/2 deals with large changes and the 4/7/12 SMA deal with midrange


[03-Aug-19 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
i am hoping that anybody that raises the hashrate will very quickly drive up the diff and without worry about being stranded, with ZAWY6, it only took 20 blocks for the diff to reduce from 22000 to 6, but 100 to go to 15k. i guess the e^x + SMA makes it adjust pretty well, and reasonably smoothly


[03-Aug-19 06:52 AM] zawy#5864
Let me first try to determine the "divisors" you need on the high side (they will be multipliers)


[03-Aug-19 06:59 AM] zawy#5864
For example, for N=4, it's either 10 or 13.6....there's a statstics thing I haven't figured out yet....that means the divisir is about 0.35, or about 3 as a multiplier.


[03-Aug-19 07:01 AM] zawy#5864
Oh, wait I'm thinking in terms of difficulty......a lot of my divisor discussion was a multipler in terms of target


[03-Aug-19 07:03 AM] zawy#5864
```
bnTarget =min(bnTarget, sum(past 4 targets)*T/(nTime-B[-4].nTime)/5, sum(past7 targets)*T/(nTime-B[-7].nTime)/3, sum(past12 targets)*T/(nTime-B[-12].nTime)/2);
```
The above is wrong.......that's difficulty instead of target and if it's in difficulty the min should be a max


[03-Aug-19 07:03 AM] zawy#5864
Corrected:


[03-Aug-19 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
strange as it worked as expected, where the min made it harder and max made it easier


[03-Aug-19 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i only work with bnTarget


[03-Aug-19 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe that is why it was slow though!


[03-Aug-19 07:07 AM] zawy#5864
```
bnTarget = min(bnTarget, avg(past 4 targets)*avg(nTime-B[-4].nTime)*5/T, avg(past7 targets)*avg(nTime-B[-7].nTime)*3/T, avg(past12 targets)*avg(nTime-B[-12].nTime)*2/T);
```


[03-Aug-19 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
oh the T went from numerator to denominator


[03-Aug-19 07:11 AM] zawy#5864
But I'm working on N=2, 4, 8, 16 for symmetically  high and low triggers.


[03-Aug-19 07:11 AM] zawy#5864
N=1 for the low side will not work.


[03-Aug-19 07:12 AM] zawy#5864
But it will not be a problem losing that case on the high side.


[03-Aug-19 07:12 AM] jl777c#5810

its fixed now, and explains the worse than expected behavior when the numerator was used as a divisor


[03-Aug-19 07:29 AM] zawy#5864
you might need an SMA function that allows you to   send   timestamp vector and  target vector (if they're not "globally" available) and  pass N and a float or 2 integers for a fraction that is close to the float value  that will determine  the "divisor".   I think there should be a global variable that determines the aggresiveness of these modifications that new coins can choose. It will will adjust the float or fraction before passing it because it's invertde depending on if it's on the high side or low side.  Perfectly happy coins can effictively cancel this modification.
```
k = aggressiveness factor
bnTarget = max( SMA(N, divisor*k) for N=2, 4, 8 16 & their divisors,  min( SMA(N, divisor/k) foreach N and divisor, Digishield ));
```


[03-Aug-19 07:40 AM] jl777c#5810
what are the typical aggressiveness factors ?


[03-Aug-19 07:45 AM] zawy#5864
k = 1  could be what we think will be the fastest response while safe.  lower  k  in what I have above would be to make it less aggressive.


[03-Aug-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
if k is an integer, it is already configurable between 1 and 126


[03-Aug-19 07:46 AM] zawy#5864
You could scale the divisor to 1/10 if you want k=10 to be our default


[03-Aug-19 07:46 AM] zawy#5864
By 1/10 i mean of the values I'm trying to determine now


[03-Aug-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will wait for the modeling results, dont worry about implementation side, just the magic formula


[03-Aug-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i have all this data readily available, so just need to clearly understand what the algo needs to calculate


[03-Aug-19 07:48 AM] zawy#5864
OK, if you're going to do an SMA function like this, post it here for me to check.


[03-Aug-19 07:49 AM] zawy#5864
Since I messed up your last test with my formula above


[03-Aug-19 07:49 AM] zawy#5864
This will also help me speak in your terminology


[03-Aug-19 07:55 AM] zawy#5864
My take on it
```
SMA ( numerator, denominator, N)  {
    return   (sumNtargets/N*
              (nTime-timestamps[-N+1])*
              numerator/denominator)/N/T;
}
```


[03-Aug-19 07:55 AM] zawy#5864
To do away with floats


[03-Aug-19 07:57 AM] zawy#5864
So....
```
k = aggressiveness factor
bnTarget = max( SMA(numerator, denominator*k, N) for N=2, 4, 8 16 & their divisors,  min( SMA(numerator*k, denominator, N)  foreach N and divisor, Digishield ));
```


[03-Aug-19 08:02 AM] zawy#5864
Actually, I'm about to edit that to invert the use of the integer k where k=1 is    our aggressiveness ,and they can't be more aggressive, but they can be less aggressive.


[03-Aug-19 08:02 AM] zawy#5864
that way I also don't have to scale my divisor = numerator/denominator


[03-Aug-19 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i think i understand, i will code this and post it here.


[03-Aug-19 08:22 AM] zawy#5864
I have have aggressiveness factor inverted, and I can do away with denominator....just a sec


[03-Aug-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
ZAWY10 did the best so far, it is super aggressive on the rapid rise, i just 4x, 7x, and 12x the diff if 4,7 or 12 blocks come in T/3, T/2, T


[03-Aug-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise it does the symmettric (and exponential)


[03-Aug-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the actual diff ends up being harder than the stated diff and the ASIC is slowed down. instead of 100 blocks in a minute, it is at 70 blocks after 10 minutes, diff got to 5000 within 50 blocks, but even at 2000 had an effective diff of 10000+ at times


[03-Aug-19 08:34 AM] zawy#5864
```
k = aggressiveness factor = 100 default
bnTarget = max( SMA(numerator*k, 10000, N) for N=2, 4, 8 16 & their divisors,  min( SMA(numerator, k, N)  foreach N and divisor, Digishield ));

SMA ( numerator, denominator, N)  {
    return   (sumNtargets/N*

[03-Aug-19 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
i assume factor goes from 100 down to 1, where 1 is the most aggressive?


[03-Aug-19 08:52 AM] zawy#5864
no, i fixed that so that k>100 is more aggressive and highly discouraged


[03-Aug-19 08:52 AM] zawy#5864
k can't be 0


[03-Aug-19 08:52 AM] zawy#5864
So k=1 should disable it


[03-Aug-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so what range should the chain be able to be tuned with?


[03-Aug-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
k 1 to 100?


[03-Aug-19 08:53 AM] zawy#5864
k=100 is my defaul setting, being as aggressive as possible while usually being safe


[03-Aug-19 08:54 AM] zawy#5864
My target audience is the most desperate small coins, but to make it tolerable for big coins


[03-Aug-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, then it seems no need to have ability to tune it as it needs to be done at chain creation


[03-Aug-19 08:54 AM] zawy#5864
without modification


[03-Aug-19 08:55 AM] zawy#5864
when you fork this, existing coins can't change k?


[03-Aug-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
not without a hardfork


[03-Aug-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
but we create chains left and right during the testing process. when it is all happy, then we make it into a mainchain


[03-Aug-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
we can always do a hardfork to change, as with any coin


[03-Aug-19 08:56 AM] zawy#5864
OK, then k is still useful for final tweeking....assuming this current path is going to work


[03-Aug-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
that is why we are up to ZAWY10, ie. 10 different chains so far


[03-Aug-19 08:56 AM] jl777c#5810
yes i will just make it so k is based on -ac_adaptivepow=<value>

19:12:30 - Diff 14167 at block 79 by Z9 Mini.

19:28:08 - Diff 2.56 at block 93 by CPU
```
This is crazy improvement. In 12 minutes the diff is brought down completely. Now, let's get a Msol test and abuse the chain as you like. This is the 12th ZAWY chain we landed on excluding the initial test chain ADAPT.

```
./komodod -ac_name=ZAWY12 -ac_adaptivepow=1 -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_reward=10000000000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=5.9.109.210 -addnode=178.159.11.114 &
```
**Pool:** 
Port 3033 maxdiff set to 16 for normal ASIC.
```
stratum+tcp://178.159.11.114:3033
```
Port 3034 maxdiff set to 292 for NH
```
stratum+tcp://178.159.11.114:3034
```
Any hash is welcome for this test. If you want an co-ordinated attack please point your miner at the above pool at 20:00 UTC.

Special thanks to @zawy @jl777c


[03-Aug-19 11:38 AM] zawy#5864
It's possible @jl777c are close to completing it.    It's a tremendous advancement in DAs for 3 reasons.  First, I'm happy someone like JL was familar with my work on changing difficulty during the block. This idea goes back to a medium article by Andrew Stone (BTC Unlimited).   This was  the only way to unstick  1E6 hashrate increase problems.  1E6 required a lot more than a linear downward adjustment for long solvetimes. So JL was trying N^2.  But that decreases too quickly.  I knew to use 2^x aka e^x aka 3^x.   But like I was saying, things need to be symmetric which means we need to be able to rise as fast as we fall or a big attacker can get too many blocks way too quickly with persistent oscillations.  The 2^x function  can resolve enormous jumps in only 30 or so bocks.  I thought of small-window SMAs thought could do it without causing other problems.  I spent a lot of time in the past on these kind of increases  So we can rise and fall in response to any size hash attack in about 30 blocks, apparently being pretty symmetrica (30 blocks to rise, 30 blocks to fall) .  By any size I mean a 1 billion times increase in hashrate takes 50 blocks to fix whereas Zcash's default digishiled (that this still uses for normal hashrates) takes 500 blocks to address a 1000x increase.    It's nice working with JL because I didn't have to look at the code.


[03-Aug-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
actually i didnt know about any of the prior work, when i first came up with my N^2 solution, it was similar to something i did with PoS to adjust stakeweight on chain with supply ranges of billions and active stake amounts unknown


[03-Aug-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
i was of course aware of your work, but with so much data, my response to changing DAA used to be to not mess with them as  i saw how complex and easy to break it is


[03-Aug-19 11:42 AM] jl777c#5810
a billion times stranding, even that is recoverable now!

By prior work I mean changing the difficulty during the block which I think you said was my idea (that I got from Andrew).


[03-Aug-19 11:45 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i discovered the TSA when you mentioned it, and then realized this was all done before, the concept of changing diff during the block


[03-Aug-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
what that does is makes the effective diff harder than the stated diff, sometimes significantly. not sure that matters much, but in reality the effective diff is rising faster than the 30 blocks


[03-Aug-19 11:49 AM] zawy#5864
The main thing is that it gets the chain unstuck.   I'm not aware of any other coin with an "active" difficulty like this.  I got XCG to do it, but they messed up otehr parts of their code and is now defunct.


[03-Aug-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
now all the 100% PoW chains will be able to add this, after october it will be the default for new chains and all the small chains definitely need this. for now just 12 ZAWY coins, in the future, likely to be thousands

First stop when difficulty is matcing 20k Sol/s then stop and wait until last 12 difficulties are  < 1 ksol/s, back up to 20k.   That should cause a fast block emission rate

this is why i had the boosters


[03-Aug-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
it really made the diff jump up pretty fast


[03-Aug-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
and it didnt allow so many blocks so fast


[03-Aug-19 12:51 PM] zawy#5864
I don't have booster and it jumps that fast


[03-Aug-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
instead of 30 fast blocks, would be 15 slower blocks with the booster

[03-Aug-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the booster combined so when blocks are really fast it made the effective diff 100x higher and slowed the blocks down. it doesnt solve at those times, so you dont see the effect onchain but it does prevent the 30 blocks in 5 minutes


[03-Aug-19 12:55 PM] zawy#5864
most of them are 1 second


[03-Aug-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810

[03-Aug-19 12:56 PM] jl777c#5810
the boosters all combine, so if 1 second per block it can be a 300x multiplier

[03-Aug-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
as time passes, the boosters drop out during the block, so the eventual solved diff is about the same, but it prevents the crazy fast blocks, after 4 of them


[03-Aug-19 12:57 PM] SHossain#0007
those are debug prints @mrlynch

[03-Aug-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810

[03-Aug-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
5 minutes


[03-Aug-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
@zawy no idea how you would model the boosters


[03-Aug-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
but what i saw was after a few fast block, the much higher effective diff, at least slowed it down so was taking 10 seconds per block


[03-Aug-19 12:58 PM] zawy#5864
mine's 400x in 8 blocks


[03-Aug-19 12:58 PM] jl777c#5810
the booster is in addition to


[03-Aug-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
so with 8 fast blocks it would be 280x 400x


[03-Aug-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
over 112k


[03-Aug-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
which would take a lot more than a 400 diff to solve


[03-Aug-19 12:59 PM] zawy#5864
ok, how does the boost work?


[03-Aug-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i detect 4, 7, 12 blocks that come in fast and if so 4x, 7x, 12x


[03-Aug-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
all combined


[03-Aug-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i used T/3, T/2 and T as the time window for 4, 7, 12 to reduce noise


[03-Aug-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
but those are just guesses. i figured if 12x the rate of blocks are coming in, then 4x the diff is not a big gamble


[03-Aug-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
but it decays during that block, so it is just a delaying effect, but that seems to be exactly what we need, we need to slow the blocks during the fast rising times by 2x to 4x


[03-Aug-19 01:03 PM] SHossain#0007
down


[03-Aug-19 01:03 PM] SHossain#0007

fire it up?


[03-Aug-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
like if you get 10 blocks all 1 second apart, why monkey with 10x, that is 600x the implied rate,


[03-Aug-19 01:04 PM] SHossain#0007
wait for jl777 to announce for ASIC mining


[03-Aug-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we will see the same double the overall block production


[03-Aug-19 01:04 PM] zawy#5864
```the booster is in addition to
so with 8 fast blocks it would be 280x 400x
over 112k```  But if that were what it is, you would have seen 112k in 8 blocks


[03-Aug-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but the 7 blocks all happen very fast


[03-Aug-19 01:05 PM] SHossain#0007
285: 1.88


[03-Aug-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
as the diff is at very low levels, it is very easy to solve, so when there is big hashrate, best to make it take as close to a minute as possible


[03-Aug-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
before we know exactly how much hashrate there is


[03-Aug-19 01:06 PM] jl777c#5810
say after 4 fast blocks, it does an exponential decay from very high diff down to where it should be


[03-Aug-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
at some point we get the next block and that diff goes onchain to help us


[03-Aug-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
as it is now, all we get is some very low diff that goes onchain


[03-Aug-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
so 10000x the diff, exponentially decay it down, at some point it is solved, and we get an idea of the actual hashrate, onchain, on block 5


[03-Aug-19 01:08 PM] jl777c#5810
if it solves immediate at 10000x, then next time start at 100000x


[03-Aug-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the way to look at it is that if the recent solve times are fast, we have a time budget available to check the "blood pressure", so boost the pressure way up, then reduce it until the next block is solved. somehow calibrate the range of diff and exponential decay to fit in the time budget we have


[03-Aug-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
if we are wrong and slow down the block by 2 minutes, that is actually good as we just had 4 blocks in 8 seconds


[03-Aug-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
i can just guesstimate this, but if you can work out the math to make it ideal, we could see no net increase in coin emissions


[03-Aug-19 01:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
left 1 cpu thread mining.. ping me when asic is required please


[03-Aug-19 01:12 PM] jl777c#5810
@mrlynch since zawy isnt saying i am crazy it seems there is  a chance the booster trick will solve the fast blocks. will need ZAWY13 before the next ASIC as we have shown ZAWY12 is subject to double coin emissions


[03-Aug-19 01:12 PM] mrlynch#5735
ok


[03-Aug-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
thanks for the hashrate!

anytime!


[03-Aug-19 01:13 PM] zawy#5864
I forgot how much benefit we can get from measuring current solvetime.  I think I can do 10x increase per block after 3 blocks, so 1E6 possible in 10 blocks


[03-Aug-19 01:13 PM] hellcatz#5825

[03-Aug-19 01:13 PM] mrlynch#5735
pleasure


[03-Aug-19 01:14 PM] SHossain#0007
ZAWY13 maybe tomorrow?


[03-Aug-19 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, the miners proved we still dont have things perfect, yet


[03-Aug-19 01:14 PM] zawy#5864
oh, what's the problem?


[03-Aug-19 01:14 PM] jl777c#5810
problem is double coin emissions doing what you suggested about the 100k miners going on and off


[03-Aug-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
3 fast blocks can imply 1000x the hashrate, so i think we need to temporarily boost the hashrate 1000x and exponentially drop it to 10x or whatever the normal calc would be


[03-Aug-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
then when it solves we get a much more meaningful onchain diff than the current gradually increasing diff


[03-Aug-19 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
even if we 10x it, if there is 10000x the hash, it still finds a block in a second and we emitted coins we didnt have to


[03-Aug-19 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
so maybe calculate the max possible hashrate, based on recent blocks


[03-Aug-19 01:16 PM] jl777c#5810
exponentially decay from that, to the current calc


[03-Aug-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as the estimate is above the actual hashrate, then we can get a real valid diff sample


[03-Aug-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
which will then make the estimate for the max possible hashrate more accurate, though maybe we double it as we are dropping exponentially back to normally increasing diff


[03-Aug-19 01:18 PM] jl777c#5810
and not much harm in overestimating the max possible hash


[03-Aug-19 01:19 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess the question is, based on current solve times, how to calculate the max possible implied hashrate


[03-Aug-19 01:21 PM] jl777c#5810
well all denominated in bnTarget


[03-Aug-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
I am viewing the time less than expected for the recent blocks as a resource that we really want to spend. and the best usage of that is to get as close to the real hashrate as possible with the next sample. not sure on the math of how to calibrate the exponential decay to use up as close to all the time possible on the next block. but we now can temporarily have very large difficulty, but still decay it fast enough so it can be solved normally


[03-Aug-19 01:29 PM] zawy#5864
Just thinking out loud......
if sum last 3 block < 0.2xT then bnTarget = (bnTarget \* min(1000, 1000*tipdiff/180)) / 1000;


[03-Aug-19 01:30 PM] zawy#5864
to be done at very end, after min()


[03-Aug-19 01:31 PM] zawy#5864
sum 3 blocks < 0.2T is almost 3 blocks behind, so don't let anyone have a block for 3 minutes even if they have the hashrate the SMAs have estimated.


[03-Aug-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
but SMA estimate is how close to reality?


[03-Aug-19 01:32 PM] zawy#5864
close.....it's always an underestimate


[03-Aug-19 01:32 PM] zawy#5864
by those factors


[03-Aug-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
at first, it will be grossly underestimating as it only has the most recent low diffs


[03-Aug-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so 17 blocks zoom by


[03-Aug-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we need a time based estimate, which will naturally decay as time passes


[03-Aug-19 01:33 PM] jl777c#5810
need to overestimate


[03-Aug-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
then let the decay find the actual


[03-Aug-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
this is what i see when CPU is mining


[03-Aug-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
the mult value ticks up each second, but until it is easy enough, nothing happens


[03-Aug-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
same thing, just in reverse


[03-Aug-19 01:35 PM] zawy#5864
tipdiff is decaying


[03-Aug-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
yes but above is max of 180x, right?


[03-Aug-19 01:35 PM] zawy#5864
yes, in 4th block of the attack


[03-Aug-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
too slow


[03-Aug-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
10 blocks almost for free and this extra coin emission cant be recovered


[03-Aug-19 01:36 PM] zawy#5864
let me run the test


[03-Aug-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
can we use all extra time, start at crazy high diff, exponentially decay down to normal, with 10 seconds left in the budget


[03-Aug-19 01:37 PM] jl777c#5810
like a Sphygmomanometer


[03-Aug-19 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
where the high pressure is the higher than blood pressure diff


[03-Aug-19 01:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it is released until it can be solved. then immediately we have a valid estimate of actual hashrate, on block 4


[03-Aug-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
and maybe only 3 easy blocks are lost, regardless of how much hashrate. since we recover in 5 blocks, but 10 to 15 minutes, the coin emission is preserved


[03-Aug-19 01:39 PM] zawy#5864
600 seconds to get 5 blocks


[03-Aug-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, so we can lose only 5 fast blocks


[03-Aug-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i know this is close to impossible, yet it shouldnt be impossible


[03-Aug-19 01:41 PM] zawy#5864
I'm saying that's the result of my test


[03-Aug-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
oh! thats a perfect match


[03-Aug-19 01:41 PM] zawy#5864
100000 can't get the 6th block in less than 10 minutes


[03-Aug-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
```if sum last 3 block < 0.2xT then bnTarget = (bnTarget * min(1000, 1000*tipdiff/180)) / 1000;```


[03-Aug-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
that?


[03-Aug-19 01:41 PM] zawy#5864
yes


[03-Aug-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
so calculate this after the min() triggers


[03-Aug-19 01:42 PM] zawy#5864
yes


[03-Aug-19 01:43 PM] zawy#5864
this is crazy shit üòÉ


[03-Aug-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
before the averaging with prior bnTarget


[03-Aug-19 01:43 PM] zawy#5864
no, after


[03-Aug-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
ok


[03-Aug-19 01:44 PM] zawy#5864
but it needs some work.  An attacker will just make sure it's 4 seconds per block  to avoid this trigger


[03-Aug-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
yes


[03-Aug-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
that is why i had multiple boosters


[03-Aug-19 01:44 PM] zawy#5864

so a bit more time due to the 12 second delay, but the booster isnt active for long enough to be effective and/or it is too strong for the current hashrate

yes, that would work much better


[03-Aug-19 02:23 PM] zawy#5864
I want sum  of -1, -2, and -3 for left side


[03-Aug-19 02:23 PM] zawy#5864
only tipdiff has nTime in it


[03-Aug-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it would be constant as block4diff and tipdiff both grow at the same rate, yes block4diff includes tiptime, block3diff subtracts out tipdiff


[03-Aug-19 02:23 PM] zawy#5864
sum of last 3 solved blocks < 0.2T


[03-Aug-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be time of prev block - time of block[-4]

[03-Aug-19 02:28 PM] zawy#5864
There is an equation, 1  line of code, that will do everything we want. It's something like this:  
```
currentTarget = previousTarget * 1/e * e(^(t/T)^2)
that is,   1/e * pow(e, pow(t/T, 2))
where t = nTime-previousTimestamp
```


[03-Aug-19 02:30 PM] zawy#5864
That equation does not work at all, but maybe that gives the flavor of what i'm thinking


[03-Aug-19 02:30 PM] jl777c#5810
block3diff is staying constant as expected, tipdiff is increasing and it factor gradually getting to 1000


[03-Aug-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is working! just with 15 CPU cores, so a 15x attack


[03-Aug-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
but this logic, the ASIC will find a boosted diff block!


[03-Aug-19 02:31 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe 14th time is the charm


[03-Aug-19 02:32 PM] zawy#5864
it needs another to target smaller miners


[03-Aug-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
but this just might prevent the doubled coin emission


[03-Aug-19 02:35 PM] zawy#5864
one thing to be weary of is a 15x miner  forcing this trigger all the time just to mess a coin up


[03-Aug-19 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is temporary


[03-Aug-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
15 blocks in 4 minutes


[03-Aug-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
better than without, but that is 11 extra


[03-Aug-19 02:37 PM] zawy#5864
how big an increase in hashrate is it


[03-Aug-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
it starts at diff of 1,  i estimate will reach equilibrium at about 25 to 30


[03-Aug-19 02:37 PM] zawy#5864
oh, right, if it works, then 3 more blocks come in easy


[03-Aug-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
diff is 9 at height 42


[03-Aug-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
started at 17


[03-Aug-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
finally it is taking a minute on a block


[03-Aug-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe that is another trigger? if no blocks are taking more than T?


[03-Aug-19 02:41 PM] zawy#5864
oh no, it causes HUGE spikes on accident


[03-Aug-19 02:41 PM] jl777c#5810
only if it is solved


[03-Aug-19 02:43 PM] zawy#5864
oh right, i keep forgetting my modellign is not set up for live difficulty adjustment


[03-Aug-19 02:44 PM] zawy#5864
the computer that has that is down


[03-Aug-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
it is working like it has to, in order for this trick to work. we just need to see more than 10x hashrate that can solve the boosted diffs to ratchet up the onchain diff that much faster


[03-Aug-19 02:45 PM] jl777c#5810
are there any downsides to doing this?


[03-Aug-19 02:46 PM] jl777c#5810
the funny thing is that i think the 15x CPU cores will get more fast blocks than an ASIC


[03-Aug-19 02:49 PM] zawy#5864
if sum last 6 < 2T then 
```
 nbTarget =  nbTarget min(1000, 1000*tipdiff/180) /1000;
```


[03-Aug-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
in addition to , or instead of existing booster?


[03-Aug-19 02:51 PM] zawy#5864
I guess that equation is wrong...do it same way.  In addition to


[03-Aug-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
so just an additional trigger for the same code, as tipdiff is the same for both


[03-Aug-19 02:53 PM] zawy#5864
oh, ummmm, i guess do if sum 3 else if sum 6


[03-Aug-19 02:56 PM] zawy#5864
I think it  catches 3x miners 1/2 the time


[03-Aug-19 02:57 PM] zawy#5864
I didn't realize live-difficulty could do something like this.


[03-Aug-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
it is much easier to see the possibilities with a live chain


[03-Aug-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
most people think blockchain and realtime are mutually exclusive


[03-Aug-19 02:59 PM] zawy#5864
We could stop 100,000x attacks in 5 blocks


[03-Aug-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
i knew you would solve the math !

the 15x is stopped in its tracks on block 18


[03-Aug-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
it got a block


[03-Aug-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
diff is already 1.39


[03-Aug-19 03:02 PM] zawy#5864
took 18 to stop only 15x?   How long did it take to get them?


[03-Aug-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt start doing any DAA until block 18


[03-Aug-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
took no time for first 17 and then tipdiff kicks in


[03-Aug-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
it might go the full 3 minutes without a block


[03-Aug-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
on 19


[03-Aug-19 03:03 PM] jl777c#5810
so 1 block a bit faster than a minute


[03-Aug-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
amazing


[03-Aug-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
after 3 min tipdiff turned off


[03-Aug-19 03:04 PM] jl777c#5810
it got 3 fast blocks

diff 1.7


[03-Aug-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it needs to find a boosted block


[03-Aug-19 03:06 PM] zawy#5864
I can use the sum of last 6 values to adjust the tipdiff aggressiveness ......this way it will not shut on and off as much, and replace the sum of 3

seems to come in triplets


[03-Aug-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
still 3 minutes for 4 blocks is pretty good


[03-Aug-19 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess it is more like 2 minutes, so still double the rate

ht 33


[03-Aug-19 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
diff only 2.11


[03-Aug-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
22 blocks in 10 minuts


[03-Aug-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
and the diff is still only 2, so we slow it down but not enough and the diff isnt rising very fast at all


[03-Aug-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
ASIC wont behave this way


[03-Aug-19 03:11 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is just the 15x attack it is weak against


[03-Aug-19 03:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
@zawy in your equation, T is a constant, so I just defined a new variable u=t/T, with du=dt/T


[03-Aug-19 03:17 PM] zawy#5864
yes


[03-Aug-19 03:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
differentiated both sides, and then solved the simple DE that came out


[03-Aug-19 03:18 PM] dukeleto#7326
the solution has 2 constants that can be tweaked to get different behavior. Is 3^(-x) being used now?


[03-Aug-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i need to call it a day, but we made fantastic progress. it seems this extra emission problem is solvable if we can just make it easier for the higher hash rate to solve, or maybe just boost it a bit regardless if these triggers are happening. maybe at least a certain amount that would compound quickly should just be added to the diff and not decay totally away with tipdiff


[03-Aug-19 03:21 PM] jl777c#5810
and the good new is that simple 15 core CPU mining duplicates the bug

{Reactions}
üëç 

[03-Aug-19 03:22 PM] jl777c#5810
currently the solve times are slowed down, but that slows down the diff growth, even as the hashrate is constant and at 15x starting levels


[03-Aug-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
it might be as simple as just boosting the diff 10% each time tipdiff is triggered? not sure if that is fast enough, but to compensate for the slowdown due to tipdiff


[03-Aug-19 03:23 PM] zawy#5864
hmmmm


[03-Aug-19 03:24 PM] zawy#5864
The miner's avg difficulty is higher than the DA realizes because we only store the final difficulty


[03-Aug-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, if there was a way to store the actual difficulty


[03-Aug-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
without breaking all sorts of backward compatibility


[03-Aug-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we can interpret the onchain diff as lower than it is if we know it is being boosted


[03-Aug-19 03:27 PM] zawy#5864
@dukeleto  he's using 3^(t/T - 7) to lower really high difficulties that are delayed > 7T


[03-Aug-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
but not sure how to keep it straight when it is the real diff vs inflated/deflated diff


[03-Aug-19 03:28 PM] zawy#5864
Maybe we store the actual avg difficulty on chain


[03-Aug-19 03:29 PM] zawy#5864
That brings up the harder non-linear question of what difficulty to assign the drops....and why the drops are not having a similar problem


[03-Aug-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i think it is because tipdiff only allows a few chances to solve it before it changes


[03-Aug-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe this is only a CPU mining issue and ASIC will work much better


[03-Aug-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
so @SHossain when he gets back should test with ASIC to see how many easy blocks it gets


[03-Aug-19 03:30 PM] zawy#5864
OK, I'm about to go exercise

the tipdiffs are making the already more difficult blocks that much more difficult. maybe it is just too steep

maxdiff is 8 in the pool settings


[03-Aug-19 03:45 PM] jl777c#5810

actually 14 minutes to get 30 blocks , 9400 diff


[03-Aug-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
so really it is much better than the 15x CPU attack


[03-Aug-19 03:51 PM] jl777c#5810
9 extra minutes and diff of ~10k vs ~15k

132:12394


[03-Aug-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
a net win, but it feels as if we can really fully solve this. it was just the first attempt. seems will be 40 blocks in 20 minutes or so to get to the stable diff


[03-Aug-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
so 20 blocks too many, we only gain 5 back on the downside, still 15 lost


[03-Aug-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
better than 20 to 25 lost

I have a good method now.  It's simpler and faster than the SMAs


[04-Aug-19 12:59 AM] jl777c#5810
good news! all i could come up with so far was to make the booster actually boost the diff


[04-Aug-19 01:00 AM] jl777c#5810
so far its doing a bit better on the 15x


[04-Aug-19 01:00 AM] jl777c#5810
but still allowing 2x coins for a bit


[04-Aug-19 01:01 AM] jl777c#5810
you figured out how to prevent the extra coins?


[04-Aug-19 01:06 AM] zawy#5864
Yes, I think I have a good plan.


[04-Aug-19 01:08 AM] jl777c#5810
ready to implement!


[04-Aug-19 01:16 AM] jl777c#5810
15x attack: 13 blocks in 9 minutes and counting, stated diff 6, actual diff higher. the 13th block is taking quite a while


[04-Aug-19 01:17 AM] jl777c#5810
so just using the same triggers to boost the diff for sure, appears to stop the 15x attack, though for the first 10 blocks it was getting them in half the time


[04-Aug-19 01:18 AM] jl777c#5810
got the 13th block after 12 min, stated diff of 8


[04-Aug-19 01:19 AM] jl777c#5810
20 seconds for a block, diff is 12.6 (estimated 20 worth of hashrate)


[04-Aug-19 01:19 AM] jl777c#5810
15th block in 13 minutes, diff of 13.5!


[04-Aug-19 01:19 AM] jl777c#5810
so diff is rising, without allowing too many extra blocks


[04-Aug-19 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
first time i have seen a 15x converge close to actual hashrate in 15 blocks


[04-Aug-19 01:21 AM] jl777c#5810
the earlier long block is triggering the max() side now, 18 blocks in  16 minutes, diff of 12.7


[04-Aug-19 01:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is definitely possible, if my random guessing is getting this sort of result


[04-Aug-19 01:25 AM] zawy#5864
You  need a program that tests ideas before going through the whole chain process.  I need to get mine running again. You pretend you're a miner with  ``` solvetime = -ln(rand())/hashrate/target*T```  But programming it with intr-block difficulty changing is tricky


[04-Aug-19 01:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i was thinking to calculate the implied hashrate of recent solves and making an aggressive feedbackloop on that if it is significantly different than the current diff


[04-Aug-19 01:29 AM] jl777c#5810
relying on the exponential in case it overestimates. for whatever reason the exponential decay ends up at the actual hashrate in 5 blocks


[04-Aug-19 01:30 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe we can just 100x the difficulty and let the e^x calibrate


[04-Aug-19 01:30 AM] jl777c#5810
let me try that, it will be easy enough


[04-Aug-19 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it detected and stopped on on block 18, second block with DAA active


[04-Aug-19 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
have to clear the precedence flag so the e^x can kick in even if min() was triggered, but only if the 100x booster was triggered


[04-Aug-19 02:04 AM] jl777c#5810
now it should be like the blood pressure measuring process, where hashrate is the "blood pressure" and the 100x is the very tight armband, the e^x will reduce this until it is solved. not sure why the e^x converges so fast to actual hashrate, but since it does, might as well take advantage of it.
with the first 17 blocks mined at diff of 1, immediately on block 18 it is stuck with a 100x harder diff.
after 7 minutes the e^x starts and when it solves, it is a decent estimate of actual hashrate, so instead of free blocks here, it is immediately taking longer very immediately. i guess for a more normal test, i need to ramp up to 15 after it has stabilized with 1 core in the previous 17 blocks, but i want to see the blood pressure result


[04-Aug-19 02:05 AM] jl777c#5810
strangely it found block 18, and diff only went to 1.38, its the strange relation between bnTarget and diff, especially when starting at easy diff. but 19 is also triggered the 100x boost. curiously it took just about a minute to solve 18, just coincidence it seems


[04-Aug-19 02:21 AM] jl777c#5810

it worked as it should have, but error in doing the e^x calc. this next one could be the one


[04-Aug-19 03:38 AM] zawy#5864
I think the jumps are going to work really well.  I'm reducing the code as much as possible. It's going to use prevTarget a alot, no SMAs.  It should reach 1000x in 5 blocks if the attacker is 1 E6, and 500k in 2 more blocks.  It should catch smallish attackers.  When the triggers stop, digishield will have 17 good targets and solvetimes to take over from there.  There can't be any excess blocks emitted.  The only attack  without having to pay a much higher difficulty is to get 3 blocks faster than others once every 6 block.


[04-Aug-19 03:39 AM] zawy#5864
smaller attackers will take longer to detect.


[04-Aug-19 03:40 AM] zawy#5864
It seems like using the current solvetime to adjust difficulty prevents the need to match rises and falls mathematically.  They can do their job independently.


[04-Aug-19 03:42 AM] zawy#5864
I mean my concerns for symmetry may go away if  the rises and falls inherently and independently prevent too many or too few  blocks from being emitted.


[04-Aug-19 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
sounds great!


[04-Aug-19 05:50 AM] zawy#5864
Is chain work calculated in the database, not in the header?  If chain work is only in the database  and calculated from past  nBits, I think it will be safer to not mess around with adjusting it.


[04-Aug-19 05:52 AM] zawy#5864
On the other hand, not having the actual chain work available is risky.


[04-Aug-19 06:44 AM] jl777c#5810
it is in RAM, derived from the nBits


[04-Aug-19 06:45 AM] jl777c#5810
as long as the nBits represents the actual work, it should be fine. now we are making sometimes different work than should be, but then it goes onchain, so i think it is close enough


[04-Aug-19 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so the e^x seems ok as the actual work performed goes into the nBits


[04-Aug-19 06:52 AM] zawy#5864
To decide longest chain, it's good to be precise about the chain work to avoid manipulation


[04-Aug-19 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the more the effective work deviates from onchain work, the more chances for manipulation


[04-Aug-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
in any case the e^x works so much faster by putting the solved diff onchain


[04-Aug-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
given two forks of equal length, the one with more work should win, which means the e^x that is solved with an earlier timestamp


[04-Aug-19 06:55 AM] zawy#5864
I guess what they solve is what they solve and that is the actual work, so I should not worry about the actually avg difficulty they saw


[04-Aug-19 06:56 AM] zawy#5864
I'm slowly getting there.  It really confusing trying to make sure my loops are correct.


[04-Aug-19 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
probably in some sort of edge cases it would matter what they were trying to solve vs, what actually got solved, but with the actual solving going onchain, it should protect us from most all manipulations


[04-Aug-19 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
if you can describe your algo clearly, i can deal with all the loops but it sounds like you are trying to get the simulator working


[04-Aug-19 07:46 AM] zawy#5864
I can't describe it because it's a concept I'm trying to program into existence with pseudocode.

i tried dozens of boost variations and while it improves things a bit, it feels a deadend that wont reach the full goals, so however long it takes, it is worth it. also the more functionality in the fewest lines is always difficult.


[05-Aug-19 04:52 AM] zawy#5864
@jl777c On numerator and denominator, why do you use int32_t instead of int?


[05-Aug-19 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
it is best to know 100% of the time the size of all variables


[05-Aug-19 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if different instances use different int sizes and there is an over/underflow, then we get a consensus problem


[05-Aug-19 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
by always using intXX_t, then no matter what OS, compiler, CPU, the size is the same, so as long as there are no critical bugs in the OS, compiler, CPU, the code will be in consensus


[05-Aug-19 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
defensive technique


[05-Aug-19 04:56 AM] jl777c#5810
for test code it isnt needed, this level of paranoia


[05-Aug-19 05:01 AM] zawy#5864
All systems should view int as int and if it's a constant so that under/over is known to be impossible.  Using int on any signed  integer type like int64_t should always be OK. The only problem I can remember is if you do a conditional on signed verses unsigned.  For example, I wuold not have thought this was necessary, but only because it's not a conditional   
```bnSum *= arith_uint256(int32_t numerator);``` I'm wanting to write the code where you will not want to do any type changes within the algorithm so it remains more clear.


[05-Aug-19 05:02 AM] zawy#5864
but I was reluctant to make everything  arith_uint256


[05-Aug-19 05:03 AM] zawy#5864
but doing it that way would not hurt anything


[05-Aug-19 05:04 AM] zawy#5864
There are some big C++ gurus that say always use the same type everywhere if at all possible.


[05-Aug-19 05:08 AM] zawy#5864
I'll use arith_uint256 everywhere


[05-Aug-19 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
you can mix the sizes, just specify what it is. i know for a fact some windows compilers default int to be 32 bit even on 64-bit CPU


[05-Aug-19 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
so depending on how your compiler is setup, it will work or no


[05-Aug-19 05:11 AM] jl777c#5810
that is a chance i dont want to take


[05-Aug-19 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
recently we were bitten by this exact issue on windows with an unexpected 32 bit size in windows


[05-Aug-19 05:12 AM] zawy#5864
OK, I'll make literally everything arith_uint256


[05-Aug-19 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
that is overkill though, people might think it is needed to be so big. maybe int64_t is a good default to use, with arith_uint256 for only when it is needed. but whatever is comfortable for you is fine


[05-Aug-19 05:18 AM] zawy#5864
```
arith_uint256 zawy_targetMA(...int32_t numerator... )
{
    bnSum *= arith_uint256(numerator);
}
```


[05-Aug-19 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is perfect!


[05-Aug-19 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
defines the range of numerator, converts only as needed. clear and efficient


[05-Aug-19 05:21 AM] zawy#5864
lol, I'm complaining about that which is what you did....seeing that makes me want to make everything arith_uint256


[05-Aug-19 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
should minimize the number of conversions


[05-Aug-19 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
probably not that much of overhead, but still moving about 32 bytes vs 4, is 8x the memory movement


[05-Aug-19 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
but these are implementation things


[05-Aug-19 05:23 AM] zawy#5864
it had to convert  because you didn't go ahead and declare it like that


[05-Aug-19 05:24 AM] zawy#5864
Yes, but see, I can't read other people's programming.  I do not read other people's progamming.


[05-Aug-19 05:24 AM] zawy#5864
I can't figure it out. I can write a compression routine faster than I can read the same algo in someone elses code


[05-Aug-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
defining the algo shouldnt get too involved in all these details, let the coders deal with types, conversions and overflows


[05-Aug-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess, just go ahead and make everything arith_uint256 is a good solution for you


[05-Aug-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
no need to worry about any type issues


[05-Aug-19 05:26 AM] zawy#5864
Right, but I do not even know what your boost is doing because it takes me a lot of work to read code.  So if you have any trouble with my code or want to change it and then show me how your changes affected the results, I'm clueless about the discussion


[05-Aug-19 05:29 AM] jl777c#5810
best to just ask me about any details that are not making sense


[05-Aug-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i disabled all the boost stuff as it slowed down the diff adjustment, and the net gain wasnt enough


[05-Aug-19 05:48 AM] zawy#5864
I can't form much of an opnion on anything because I don't know exactly what you've got.  I want to get code correct and ask for minimal changes so that I can participate better.  I will need to see sovletimes (or timestamps) and difficulty (or targets) in CSV.  Try not to change variable names.  I have not complied what I'll give you.


[05-Aug-19 05:56 AM] jl777c#5810
ok


[05-Aug-19 05:57 AM] zawy#5864
I like using only 1 or 2-character variables because  math is restricted to 1 character per obect. Math does this so that names do not cloud the logic.


[05-Aug-19 05:59 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will keep it as similar as possible, just to make sure it compiles


[05-Aug-19 07:04 AM] zawy#5864
I have N=3, 6, 12 windows to replace the SMAs.  Do testing with only N=3 at first because it's most likely to have oscillation and emission rate problems.


[05-Aug-19 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
ok

[05-Aug-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i think i can understand most of what the code needs to do, just a few things:
```    for ( int j=past-1; j<= 1; j--) {```


[05-Aug-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
i think that should be j>=W, as you are using ts[j]-ts[j-W], so j needs to be at least as big as W


[05-Aug-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
i assume ts[0] is the most recent solve time, ts[1] the second? or does it start with the nTime in the current block


[05-Aug-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
also ```            for ( int i = j; i <= 0; i-- ) {```


[05-Aug-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
seems i>=W instead of i<=0. maybe the j should start with past+W-1 ?


[05-Aug-19 08:05 AM] zawy#5864
Yes to all questions. I had changed the sign at some point. Also the TS are timestamps not solve time.


[05-Aug-19 08:08 AM] zawy#5864
Notice that there are no constants in the algorithm except for what the poisson distribution required which is the numerator and denominator for the given window size. This means I was not able to inject an opinion or tweak it. So it is something like a deep fundamental solution if it works.


[05-Aug-19 08:24 AM] zawy#5864
I think a 1000x attack is supposed to see 600x difficulty on 4th block


[05-Aug-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i hope you dont mind, but i will need to change to C for efficiency and change a few data types, but i will keep the variable names the same. i see nTime is used as the currently mined blocks time, so all answers i have. now just need to fit it into ZAWY16


[05-Aug-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i will just use W=3 for now instead of the symmetric SMA?


[05-Aug-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
but later we can combine multiple W values via min()/max()


[05-Aug-19 08:26 AM] zawy#5864
yes, and no average.  It is like the SMAs with the tipdiff I already showed you, but it's refined to trigger more easily and jump a lot more,  and  to stop excess block release


[05-Aug-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
very cool! I will just pop it in there in the control flow as that is already working framework.  so the exponential decay is still needed


[05-Aug-19 08:27 AM] zawy#5864
With multiple W's, select min bnTarget that they reutn


[05-Aug-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
this is just for the min() case then? and we rely on exponential for the max() side?


[05-Aug-19 08:28 AM] zawy#5864
this has the potential of jumping way too high, so exp definitely


[05-Aug-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
the exponential is the safety net


[05-Aug-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
allows to be super aggressive. i like it


[05-Aug-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
also your assumption that blockchain cant store state is maybe something we can change, if storing state would make things better


[05-Aug-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
how much state info is needed?


[05-Aug-19 08:29 AM] zawy#5864
yes, it would prevent need for the loops.


[05-Aug-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
already there are things like nHeight that is not onchain, but in the in-memory CBlockIndex data


[05-Aug-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
loops of 50 is no big deal though


[05-Aug-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, i see a ts[-1], by that you mean nTime of mined block?


[05-Aug-19 08:31 AM] zawy#5864
We need to know block number of of most recent, most aggressive trigger., and then loop through 3 or more Ws to determine which one


[05-Aug-19 08:32 AM] zawy#5864
oh, if I have a ts[-1] it needs correcting...probably suppoed to be 1

[05-Aug-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i've been burned before by a MAX that was a macro which ended up behaving differently, since it boils down to an if, simpler to use and if and be 100% sure what the code is doing


[05-Aug-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
only one usage of K could have been saved, the other time it is scalar multiplied and actually at compile time as K is a fixed value


[05-Aug-19 09:34 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe i should #define K to 1000000, then the compiler can optimize the arith_uint256 conversion


[05-Aug-19 09:35 AM] zawy#5864
I see BTG code does not worry about multiplying things like arith256 and int64.  It seems like there should not be an issue with mixing int types


[05-Aug-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
ooops. it crashed. debugging


[05-Aug-19 09:37 AM] zawy#5864
if ( altK < K )  should be >


[05-Aug-19 09:38 AM] jl777c#5810
but you wanted max,so if altK ends up less than 1 million, it should be set to 1 million?


[05-Aug-19 09:38 AM] zawy#5864
i messed up


[05-Aug-19 09:39 AM] zawy#5864
wait


[05-Aug-19 09:39 AM] zawy#5864
right, i should have said min.  if alt k makes it harder, (lower) use altk,   else use k


[05-Aug-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
fixed


[05-Aug-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
found and fixed the crash


[05-Aug-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
will mine with 1 core till there is 64 blocks and then ramp to 15x, i assume this logic will handle that case too?


[05-Aug-19 09:54 AM] zawy#5864
yes, it should start trigging on 6x or less, but 15x is needed to kind of start see flex more.  the 1x, 10x, 100x, and 1000x cases shoudl be tested, and that will show pretty much how the 1e6 case will go


[05-Aug-19 09:54 AM] SHossain#0007
i can start pool and a Z9 Mini whenever needed


[05-Aug-19 09:54 AM] SHossain#0007
just waiting for a GO signal


[05-Aug-19 09:55 AM] zawy#5864
let it go at 1x for awhile to cofirm it's not jumping aruond much.   Then 3x to see if it's too whacky for mild cases


[05-Aug-19 09:55 AM] zawy#5864
I'm more worried about 2x to 10x cases than anything


[05-Aug-19 09:57 AM] zawy#5864
or 1x to 5x


[05-Aug-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will test the <15x cases to make sure it is working as expected, did that 20 times yesterday so i know what a good test run should be like


[05-Aug-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
single core blazed through the blocks, already past 64. seeing altK, but diff is not really changing much at 1 core, though it is stuck on 68 for a 2 minutes now


[05-Aug-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
since it has 64 fast timestamps, i would imagine it is boosting the diff quite high. altK of around 100k


[05-Aug-19 10:01 AM] jl777c#5810
j is 33 and ii is 33, i also see 36 and 26


[05-Aug-19 10:02 AM] jl777c#5810
this seems like it stopped the "attack" 3 blocks after it "started" as the DAA only kicked in at height 64


[05-Aug-19 10:03 AM] zawy#5864
exactly


[05-Aug-19 10:03 AM] zawy#5864
4th block is when it kicks in


[05-Aug-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
with altK values of about 100k, that is a 10x increase in diff?


[05-Aug-19 10:03 AM] jl777c#5810
now 200k altK


[05-Aug-19 10:04 AM] zawy#5864
that's the bnTarget multiplier isn't it?  should be 100x decrease in diff


[05-Aug-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the single core will need the exponential to kick in to save it


[05-Aug-19 10:05 AM] zawy#5864
oh, right 1e6 divisor


[05-Aug-19 10:05 AM] zawy#5864
yes, 10x difficulty


[05-Aug-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
and then the average block time will be much closer to what it should be


[05-Aug-19 10:05 AM] jl777c#5810
and that is exactly what happened


[05-Aug-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
diff even went up very slightly 2.44 to 2.47


[05-Aug-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
will the altK kick in for 50 more blocks?


[05-Aug-19 10:07 AM] zawy#5864
No, the triggers can stop and you'll have difficulty driopping immediately back down to digi as before


[05-Aug-19 10:08 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i see, only W deep


[05-Aug-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
it finding blocks


[05-Aug-19 10:09 AM] zawy#5864
No, it's active for as long as too many blocks have been issued....the triggers stop when emission rate is corrected


[05-Aug-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is what it is doing. so far working good. boost to 5x?


[05-Aug-19 10:10 AM] zawy#5864
yes


[05-Aug-19 10:10 AM] zawy#5864
no


[05-Aug-19 10:10 AM] zawy#5864
try 2x for 30 minutes


[05-Aug-19 10:10 AM] jl777c#5810
it got 9 blocks in 11 minutes


[05-Aug-19 10:11 AM] zawy#5864
oh, heck,  do 5x for 30 minuite


[05-Aug-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
diff stable at 2.4 with 1 core.


[05-Aug-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
ok boosting to 5x


[05-Aug-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
ht 73 at 11 past


[05-Aug-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
found 3 blocks pretty quickly


[05-Aug-19 10:12 AM] zawy#5864
yeah, the triggers stopped and it's back to digi


[05-Aug-19 10:13 AM] zawy#5864
oh, no, the 5x boost


[05-Aug-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
triggers still going


[05-Aug-19 10:13 AM] zawy#5864
triggers are still active when i = 0


[05-Aug-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
i put a printout when it changes bnTarget


[05-Aug-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
making diff 3x harder


[05-Aug-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
which is pretty accurate


[05-Aug-19 10:14 AM] zawy#5864
I feel great that it looks like it will act like a precision machine


[05-Aug-19 10:15 AM] zawy#5864
for some reason it feels like a precision machine instead of software


[05-Aug-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
even when it makes to way too hard, after 7 minutes the exponential kicks in and blocks come out


[05-Aug-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
ht.83


[05-Aug-19 10:15 AM] zawy#5864
did that happen?


[05-Aug-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
yes a few times


[05-Aug-19 10:16 AM] zawy#5864
already?


[05-Aug-19 10:16 AM] zawy#5864
i mean in this sequence?


[05-Aug-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[05-Aug-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
that is how it got some blocks


[05-Aug-19 10:16 AM] jl777c#5810
10 blocks in 5 minutes


[05-Aug-19 10:16 AM] zawy#5864
I need to see the CSV


[05-Aug-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
i wasnt sure if exponential should have precedence, but it seemed that exponential would always be easier than otherwise, so if it triggers, it takes precedence


[05-Aug-19 10:17 AM] jl777c#5810
as max() involving the exponential would always be the exponential


[05-Aug-19 10:18 AM] zawy#5864
I want to avoid exp, especially at this low HR increases


[05-Aug-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
altK never makes it easier though? or should i make it so if altK triggers, exponential is disabled?


[05-Aug-19 10:18 AM] zawy#5864
maybe it should have hit once after startup, but not twice


[05-Aug-19 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
how will the diff ever go up?


[05-Aug-19 10:19 AM] zawy#5864
no no,  I should not have something that  causes  delays > 7 at < 20x increases in hashrate


[05-Aug-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
j and ii at 48 and 49


[05-Aug-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i know why!


[05-Aug-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
remember all the early blocks


[05-Aug-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
they are still in the past+W window


[05-Aug-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
we need to get past 120 to get beyond that


[05-Aug-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so it sees 40 fast blocks and is slowing things down


[05-Aug-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
for a proper test, we needed to run at 1x for 64+ blocks after it adjusted to 1 block per minute


[05-Aug-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
chain started at 18:30, now is 19:22, but there are 85 blocks


[05-Aug-19 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it got a few more blocks


[05-Aug-19 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
my guess is that it will need to get to where there are 60 blocks in an hour before it stops hitting the brakes


[05-Aug-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
so far this is working amazingly well


[05-Aug-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
14 blocks in 14 minutes at 5x


[05-Aug-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
not any extra blocks


[05-Aug-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
even with the exponential kicking in


[05-Aug-19 10:25 AM] zawy#5864
except for the first ones?


[05-Aug-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
87 blocks since chain start 55 min ago


[05-Aug-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so it will still need 32 more slow blocks


[05-Aug-19 10:25 AM] zawy#5864
hopefully the exp will stop kicking in under normal conditions.......you will never have 64 1-second blocks under normal conditions


[05-Aug-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe at that point, the diff will stablize at the 5x level


[05-Aug-19 10:26 AM] jl777c#5810
this looking at elapsed times is how i look at block production and now the blockchain is doing the same, but with algorithmic precision!


[05-Aug-19 10:27 AM] zawy#5864
what was avg solvetime for 1st 64?


[05-Aug-19 10:27 AM] zawy#5864
or, how long did they take


[05-Aug-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
25 minutes


[05-Aug-19 10:28 AM] zawy#5864
so it got 39 free and it's still 32 blocks behind


[05-Aug-19 10:28 AM] zawy#5864
but only because it did not kick in immediately


[05-Aug-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
it only kicked in at 64


[05-Aug-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
so in 25 blocks, it caught up by 7


[05-Aug-19 10:29 AM] zawy#5864
and as the 50 window passes, it will forget that the emission schedule is ahead


[05-Aug-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, the longer W will help a bit


[05-Aug-19 10:30 AM] zawy#5864
We just need to see it under non-genesis conditions to see if exp is kicing in too much.


[05-Aug-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
diff is up to 3


[05-Aug-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, need to get to 128 and wait for diff to stabilize


[05-Aug-19 10:30 AM] jl777c#5810
then the test to 15x, which would be a 3x test would have a stable starting point


[05-Aug-19 10:31 AM] zawy#5864
as soon as i does not reach 0, the triggers have stopped and we can begin better


[05-Aug-19 10:32 AM] zawy#5864
we need a plot of solvetimes, hashrate, and difficulty


[05-Aug-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
exponentials are not kicking in anymore


[05-Aug-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
its finding blocks via altK


[05-Aug-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
diff 3.8


[05-Aug-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
23 blocks in 23 minutes since 5x, which is spooky


[05-Aug-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
j is up to 49


[05-Aug-19 10:34 AM] zawy#5864
I'm afrad the genesis thing will not be the main reason exp was activated


[05-Aug-19 10:35 AM] zawy#5864
will you know if i does not reach 0 ?  Everything starts over when it does not


[05-Aug-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
the printouts should stop


[05-Aug-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
somehow it is slowing the blocks but the diff keeps rising


[05-Aug-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so that seems to be a big improvement


[05-Aug-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the genesis easy blocks made it boost the diff too much, which makes the exponential kick in


[05-Aug-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
in spite of all this is it making headway, thought the exponential kicking in allows a few easy blocks so really hurts things, if the exponential was just one block, we would be almost at 1 minute per block from genesis now


[05-Aug-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
i think as long as it works happy from a stable baseline, there is no need to worry about the genesis issue. we were just impatient to see it in action


[05-Aug-19 10:43 AM] zawy#5864
I need to see the solvetimes, targets, and ideally hashrate


[05-Aug-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
i will need to write some code to extract that from the blockchain, unless someone already has such


[05-Aug-19 10:45 AM] zawy#5864
i guess you can't know hashrate unless writing it down


[05-Aug-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
at height 73, i went to 5 cores. that is the only change, though there was some time no mining due to debugging. i will write the CSV generator


[05-Aug-19 10:46 AM] zawy#5864
I have a perl script for Zcash if that would help

[05-Aug-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
no need, this is easy enough and a useful rpc call to have


[05-Aug-19 11:19 AM] zawy#5864
In next version It should probably switch back to digi if current  solvetime is so long that excess blocks have been overcome (instead of letting it go to exp)


[05-Aug-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
but what if it is diff stranded?


[05-Aug-19 11:32 AM] jl777c#5810
and the excess blocks were never overcome when the exponential was triggred


[05-Aug-19 11:34 AM] zawy#5864
Yes and that case the exponential would still be active


[05-Aug-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
its still getting to 0, ht 163, diff 3.5 and diff is still about half what it should be


[05-Aug-19 11:34 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the 6 and 12 would help?


[05-Aug-19 11:36 AM] zawy#5864
No this should be working fine under these near normal conditions. I need to see the data to diagnose it


[05-Aug-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, will get you the .csv file as soon as the new daemon builds


[05-Aug-19 11:37 AM] jl777c#5810
it feels as if the diff adjustment is too steep, often it cant find a block


[05-Aug-19 11:39 AM] zawy#5864
Yeah, it's overshooting and going into the exp() which causes it to keep losing blocks


[05-Aug-19 11:39 AM] zawy#5864
(too man)


[05-Aug-19 11:39 AM] jl777c#5810
it hasnt gone into exponential for a while


[05-Aug-19 11:39 AM] zawy#5864
how many blocks per time now?


[05-Aug-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
its maintaining close to 1 minute . per block since it went to 5x, a bit faster


[05-Aug-19 11:40 AM] jl777c#5810
95 blocks in 90 minutes, something like that. the reason seems to be that the diff is still at 3


[05-Aug-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
with the delays, it prevents the diff from going up


[05-Aug-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
so while blocktimes are close to one per minute, the diff is artificially low. which i guess if blocks are at the target time, it doesnt really matter that much


[05-Aug-19 11:43 AM] zawy#5864
so it gets 2 or 3 blocks fast then has a longer delay?


[05-Aug-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, that is what it seems to be doing

diff rose a bit to 4.3


[05-Aug-19 12:00 PM] zawy#5864
it should stop triggering at about 191


[05-Aug-19 12:01 PM] jl777c#5810
199 and still triggering, with diff at half what it should be, it is able to mine faster on the blocks it doesnt kick in, which makes it kick in the next block


[05-Aug-19 12:02 PM] zawy#5864
an impotrant problem is digishield is getting the wrong avg target


[05-Aug-19 12:04 PM] zawy#5864
45 second solves in the past hour


[05-Aug-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
we could detect the difference between what digishield would have vs the actual for a block

The loop has to cal;culate  the corrected digisheild


[05-Aug-19 12:05 PM] zawy#5864
but it should still not stay in the triggered state as much as it does.


[05-Aug-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
it is basically always triggered


[05-Aug-19 12:06 PM] zawy#5864
yeah that not correct at all, and it's not merely because of digi


[05-Aug-19 12:06 PM] jl777c#5810
what about averaging the recent bnTarget? that would smooth out the very hard block followed by easy ones


[05-Aug-19 12:07 PM] zawy#5864
oh, wait, maybe it is because of that min function


[05-Aug-19 12:07 PM] zawy#5864
that causes it to revert to digi even in the triggered state


[05-Aug-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
i am never doing a min


[05-Aug-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
it is always doing the RT_CST_RST calc


[05-Aug-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
and using that bnTarget, unless exponential is triggered


[05-Aug-19 12:09 PM] zawy#5864
```        if ( altK > K )
            altK = K;```


[05-Aug-19 12:10 PM] zawy#5864
is reverting to digi


[05-Aug-19 12:10 PM] zawy#5864
but i guess that's only on the initial trigger that does not happen much


[05-Aug-19 12:10 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but i think it always gets to i == 0


[05-Aug-19 12:11 PM] zawy#5864
yeah, so that's not it


[05-Aug-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
long periods where it does not set the initial bnTarget


[05-Aug-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if it sets the initial altK, should it still go into the ii loop?


[05-Aug-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems then the bnTarget is changed twice and there is a compound increase of difficulty


[05-Aug-19 12:13 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe to return bnTarget if the first altK is less than a million?

[05-Aug-19 12:18 PM] zawy#5864
This is going to require some work and I need to do some stuff.   Both digi and the loop need     the avg  target, not the one they're using.  That might solve everything


[05-Aug-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
avg  target?


[05-Aug-19 12:19 PM] zawy#5864
The final target that they see is larger than the avg target the miner was facing during the solve


[05-Aug-19 12:19 PM] zawy#5864
that's why solves are too fast


[05-Aug-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
but what the miner solves is what goes onchain


[05-Aug-19 12:20 PM] zawy#5864
i need to do some integral of 1/x math to know, but it looks like the correction factor is about  45/60


[05-Aug-19 12:20 PM] zawy#5864
I guess we have to change that


[05-Aug-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
i can calculate the average amount the algo is making it harder than ordinary digishield


[05-Aug-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
and then add that again as a correction factor


[05-Aug-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
then smooth it out over last 3 blocks?


[05-Aug-19 12:23 PM] zawy#5864
I'm tinking only the exponential is going to be able to use tipdiff, or you have to have 2 nBit fields


[05-Aug-19 12:24 PM] zawy#5864
In other words, either 2 nBit fields, or go back to SMAs that do not use nTime


[05-Aug-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
CST_RST doesnt need to use tipdiff, does it?


[05-Aug-19 12:24 PM] jl777c#5810
only the initial test uses it


[05-Aug-19 12:24 PM] zawy#5864
it does use, i just didn't call it that...


[05-Aug-19 12:24 PM] zawy#5864
nTime-ts[0] shouold be it


[05-Aug-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
that is only in the initial if statement, not in the ii loop


[05-Aug-19 12:25 PM] zawy#5864
```altK = (K * (nTime-ts[0]) * (ts[0]-ts[W])) / (W * T * T);```


[05-Aug-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
if that is taken out, then the diff becomes deterministic unless exp kicks in


[05-Aug-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that line is the only place. what if that is disabled ?


[05-Aug-19 12:25 PM] jl777c#5810
or tweaked


[05-Aug-19 12:26 PM] zawy#5864
no, the "tipdiff" is everything to this methd


[05-Aug-19 12:26 PM] zawy#5864
and that's why the targets are not correct


[05-Aug-19 12:26 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, that was the issue i had with the booster method


[05-Aug-19 12:26 PM] zawy#5864
I mean why there must be two targets stored in the headers


[05-Aug-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
which 2 targets need to be stored?


[05-Aug-19 12:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the before and after the algo modifies it?


[05-Aug-19 12:28 PM] jl777c#5810
i can get the pure digishield value, as it applies to the onchain and have that for all the recent blocks


[05-Aug-19 12:28 PM] zawy#5864
the ones the loop is calculating and one that 's about 0.63......oh, actually.....it can be dtermined by the solvetime and the target


[05-Aug-19 12:28 PM] zawy#5864
maybe 1 target is enough and using the solvetime i think i can calculate the other target


[05-Aug-19 12:29 PM] zawy#5864
The one that goes no chain is the actual "avg" diff.   Validation would require calculating the acceptable target from that, solvetime, and the previous targets


[05-Aug-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
i can extract what digishield would have been, had there been no changes


[05-Aug-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
along with what ended up going onchain


[05-Aug-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
so you would have two arrays of targets


[05-Aug-19 12:31 PM] zawy#5864
digishield depends on past targets and solvetimes which were determined by the loop.  The loop needs to put what digishield needs on the chain


[05-Aug-19 12:32 PM] zawy#5864
It looks like too much work for us


[05-Aug-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, or we need to calculate what digishield needs and feed that to it, instead of the raw data onchain


[05-Aug-19 12:33 PM] jl777c#5810
so the problem is that what ends up on chain is too easy, and it needs to be increased in difficulty?


[05-Aug-19 12:35 PM] zawy#5864
YEs, but validators need to approve the nonce, so the validators need to figure out the acceptable target from the given past 3 (W) targets, and the past 3 (w) solvetimes.

....and the current solvetime and target


[05-Aug-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
all nodes will calculate the same values


[05-Aug-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
as long as the algo is deterministic, which it would be if only using the data that is onchain and the nTime


[05-Aug-19 12:47 PM] zawy#5864
acceptable target might be simply 1/2 the on-chain target


[05-Aug-19 12:48 PM] zawy#5864
we got 45 second solves instead of 30 because the trigger was working overtime


[05-Aug-19 12:48 PM] zawy#5864
I mean 2x the on chain target


[05-Aug-19 12:49 PM] zawy#5864
or something like 2/3 or 0.693


[05-Aug-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
so make it easier than it is calculating?


[05-Aug-19 12:58 PM] zawy#5864
Everything will be based on an actual average difficulty that goes on chain.  The loop will calculate based on that....it's been using the wrong targets......it's main calculation will also be that avg target.   but then a different routine that miner and validatorsuse will use will  calculate an allowed target ..... if the target was from the loop (it was the target that got on chain)....so it seems a  yes/no state variable is needed.


[05-Aug-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
given the original digishield target vs the onchain, we can determine if it was changed


[05-Aug-19 12:59 PM] zawy#5864
OK, yeah


[05-Aug-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
the state is already available (though i need to implement extracting the unmodified digishield), still not perfect as what goes onchain is the actual solved target, but at least we can detect when it is being adjusted, how often, even by how much


[05-Aug-19 01:00 PM] zawy#5864
This problem coming up makes me worred about the target that the exp reports


[05-Aug-19 01:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i think once this works stable, we wont need to worry about exp, as it wont be triggered very often at all


[05-Aug-19 01:02 PM] zawy#5864
We need to give it a decent calculation because digishield  and the loop depend on it.


[05-Aug-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
based on solvtimes, we know the range of tipdiffs that were being attempted


[05-Aug-19 01:03 PM] zawy#5864
I don't know if it's OK to leave alone or not....


[05-Aug-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so we would be able to calculate all the actual adjusted values that were not solved, but not sure all that work is needed


[05-Aug-19 01:04 PM] zawy#5864
We should not tell digishield it took 10xT to solve a really easy target


[05-Aug-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so the median target?


[05-Aug-19 01:06 PM] zawy#5864
for exp?  i don't nkow without some thought....it's sort of like what time we report to digishield for the solve is more important...maybe need to lower both target and solvetime


[05-Aug-19 01:07 PM] zawy#5864
it's very roubghlt 1/2 the target in 1xT


[05-Aug-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
do you know why the diff jumps way up and every 2nd or 3rd block?


[05-Aug-19 01:08 PM] zawy#5864
and maybe that is equal to 1/20 the target in 10xT


[05-Aug-19 01:09 PM] zawy#5864
i don't see that in the CSV


[05-Aug-19 01:09 PM] zawy#5864
i see about 1 jump per 6

1


[05-Aug-19 01:10 PM] zawy#5864
I sort of expected every 2 or 3 on intuiton


[05-Aug-19 01:10 PM] jl777c#5810
every other one during that period


[05-Aug-19 01:11 PM] zawy#5864
the if last 3 solvetimes are fast , target's goign to be hard from low RST value


[05-Aug-19 01:11 PM] zawy#5864
that will make it jump


[05-Aug-19 01:11 PM] zawy#5864
and require more time  in CST to bring it down


[05-Aug-19 01:22 PM] zawy#5864
are those timestamps the end of the previous block?


[05-Aug-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
each line is from the block at the height


[05-Aug-19 01:24 PM] zawy#5864
zcash RPC i think has a bug that delays timestamp 1 block

i wrote this today, i try to avoid off by 1 errors


[05-Aug-19 01:25 PM] zawy#5864
block 189  was fast?


[05-Aug-19 01:25 PM] zawy#5864
and low difficulty?


[05-Aug-19 01:26 PM] zawy#5864
i mean slow


[05-Aug-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
it was fast, 4 seconds, diff of 4

i have a test version that seems to be doing decently. still early, but within 10 blocks, the blockrate is close to a minute and diff is up to 11.4


[05-Aug-19 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
exp has not been triggered at all


[05-Aug-19 01:27 PM] zawy#5864
well, if it's always i=0, then you just have to look at the calculation.  I don't have an intuitive explanation for predicting what it does, especially with targets off


[05-Aug-19 01:28 PM] zawy#5864
if the last 3 solves were fast, then target will be low....which means current solvetime will be high which raises target back up


[05-Aug-19 01:28 PM] zawy#5864
all in the same block


[05-Aug-19 01:29 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems i need to feed the loop a different set of targets than what is onchain


[05-Aug-19 01:29 PM] zawy#5864
exactly, try 1/2


[05-Aug-19 01:30 PM] zawy#5864
that is the avg target it saw


[05-Aug-19 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, so just change the ct[] array!


[05-Aug-19 01:30 PM] jl777c#5810
that would be easy


[05-Aug-19 01:31 PM] zawy#5864
only if it's during an active trigger


[05-Aug-19 01:32 PM] zawy#5864
I think right after the break


[05-Aug-19 01:32 PM] zawy#5864
yeah, there


[05-Aug-19 01:32 PM] jl777c#5810
for now, since that is all the time, i can see how it does. then add the detection of active trigger


[05-Aug-19 01:33 PM] zawy#5864
but digishiled needs that correction too


[05-Aug-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
done


[05-Aug-19 01:34 PM] zawy#5864
validation and miner need that seperate  routine to say "this is not a digisheild or e^x target, so allow target\*2


[05-Aug-19 01:35 PM] jl777c#5810
you mean target/2, double the diff, right?


[05-Aug-19 01:35 PM] zawy#5864
and loop needs to calculate 1/2 its existing output


[05-Aug-19 01:35 PM] zawy#5864
loop says 2x difficulty


[05-Aug-19 01:36 PM] zawy#5864
validation say "this is not a digishield target, so allow 1/2 the difficulty that is on chain


[05-Aug-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i tried various mini-hardforks so i can use the same chain. for now all that is disabled


[05-Aug-19 01:36 PM] jl777c#5810
if ct[] is adjusted right, the loop should calculate adusted value?


[05-Aug-19 01:38 PM] zawy#5864
as long as digishield sees the adjusted values


[05-Aug-19 01:38 PM] zawy#5864
as is, the loop is not outputting the "adjusted" targets, because you're saying you adjust ct later


[05-Aug-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
yes both the loop and digishield see target/2 values, from what is onchain


[05-Aug-19 01:39 PM] zawy#5864
even if loop gets correct adjustments, it's output is 1/2 the avg difficulty the miner saw


[05-Aug-19 01:40 PM] zawy#5864
which should be the case if you're adjusting it for later blocks like you say


[05-Aug-19 01:41 PM] zawy#5864
output is 2x adjusted tager, and you're doing 1/2 target in future blocks, so it sounds ok


[05-Aug-19 01:41 PM] zawy#5864
i wonder if anyone's reading all our chat

[05-Aug-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
aha, due to the time i had the chain stalled, the exp is kicking in, but that seems ok, we just need to wait a few more blocks for things to settle down


[05-Aug-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810

You should stop work on KMD if and when yuo can to implement my reverse nakamoto coin idea to replace the need for BTC.


[05-Aug-19 01:49 PM] jl777c#5810
what is reverse nakamoto?


[05-Aug-19 01:49 PM] zawy#5864
it uses VDF fnuction and POs to replace hashrate with stake rate


[05-Aug-19 01:50 PM] zawy#5864
since stake capital is on the chain whereas equipment capital's presence is proven to the chain only after elections, the process has to be reversed to simulate POW


[05-Aug-19 01:50 PM] zawy#5864
But still use POW to generate and distribute coin


[05-Aug-19 01:50 PM] zawy#5864
with self-hashing txns


[05-Aug-19 01:51 PM] zawy#5864
where solo miners select the amount of coin they want to create


[05-Aug-19 01:52 PM] zawy#5864
and stakers adjust the difficulty of POW mining as they do consensus on the txns ....so that they can choose a stable value coin without reference to any fiat


[05-Aug-19 01:52 PM] jl777c#5810
probably can make an antara module to do this

yes, something for later. interesting idea


[05-Aug-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
the latest version is not getting the fast blocks, i think with enough blocks it will get to a non-activated state

[05-Aug-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
the stated diff is half the actual, so estimated 5 to 7 diff for the 10sols hashrate from 5 cores


[05-Aug-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
this is from a very ugly past 50 blocks with 6 mini-forks using my random hacking around tests


[05-Aug-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
so until about 400, it will be contaminated, but so far, most blocks appear to take about a minute. a few times the exp activated


[05-Aug-19 01:57 PM] zawy#5864
it's supposed to go inactive very quickly


[05-Aug-19 01:57 PM] zawy#5864
or maybe it's waiting for digishield to catch up


[05-Aug-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, with something like this, until all the data is normalized, it will have strange behavior. onchain diff is now having a different meaning than before 330


[05-Aug-19 01:58 PM] zawy#5864
ahhh, those high diffs must be the trigger


[05-Aug-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, but not seeing crazy high diffs anymore


[05-Aug-19 01:59 PM] zawy#5864
I'm taking a break....send me the new CSV later


[05-Aug-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
17 blocks in 17 minutes


[05-Aug-19 02:00 PM] zawy#5864
and start hitting it with whatever and write down block numbers for HR changes


[05-Aug-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
ok


[05-Aug-19 02:01 PM] zawy#5864
but I think final solution is to insert 1/2 in both parts of the loop and let validators and miners use 2x on chain target if CST_RST was used


[05-Aug-19 02:03 PM] jl777c#5810
basically what we have now, just to toggle it off if CST_RST wasnt active


[05-Aug-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
i will think how to detect CST_RST activation, but is that for the entire 50+ blocks, or just the W blocks . or most recent


[05-Aug-19 02:08 PM] zawy#5864
Every block needs the on-chain work to be accurate.   The miner proves he did it by proving he solved something 1/2 that difficult  based on his timestamp and evidence it was a CST-RST block.  This plan still has an error: miners who jump on for the late-time solves did not actually do all the work.  The actual work was actually less, depending on how much miners attampt that.


[05-Aug-19 02:12 PM] zawy#5864
A more proper method is to go back to SMAs without the final thing I did which was using nTime ( a tipdiff adjsutment)...we know it can result in too many blocks released due to e^x  and big miners.........but they have the perogative to get more coin becuase they have to pay a much higher difficulty than the miners getting the e^x.    So the ideal solution  may involve adjusting reward based on solvetime to get the stablie emission rate we are attempting with difficulty.


[05-Aug-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
SMA method has the same issue of onchain diff not matching the effective diff


[05-Aug-19 02:14 PM] zawy#5864
we can still do that method without the nTime aka tipdiff


[05-Aug-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
true


[05-Aug-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
can it be combined with this method?


[05-Aug-19 02:16 PM] zawy#5864
it can be  impressive but not the  same wow factor.    No this method's benefit is inherent to the problem of miners jumping on lat.....I am just saying there's a little problem here and I don't know the consequences.  I'm not saying to abandon this.  Just pointing that out.  The drawback if they do is that they're stealing coin from constant-on miners


[05-Aug-19 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
hard to switch on and off every 30 seconds


[05-Aug-19 02:17 PM] zawy#5864
Logic says (by what we saw today ) that if they do that, it should slow up coin emission instead of increasing it


[05-Aug-19 02:18 PM] zawy#5864
So they would have to wait longer before starting


[05-Aug-19 02:18 PM] zawy#5864
so blocks minght end up 2 minutes or 10 minutes if they are big enough


[05-Aug-19 02:19 PM] zawy#5864
and they only mine for 10 seconds if they don't have to compete with other big miners


[05-Aug-19 02:20 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think miners hopping in and out every half block is anything to worry about


[05-Aug-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
i encoded whether the CST was triggered or not in the least significant bit of nBits. it will change the diff very slightly, but will just be small noise. this gets us 100% certainity of whether a block was RST_CST or not and it is essentially free to calculate.
have a version in testing that will toggle whether it adjusts the ct[] array and digishield or not, based on that bit. i also added the averaging with prior bnTarget as that seems to prevent the very fast block followed by super hard one and seems to have more consistent results. maybe it slows things down a block or three on hashrate changes, but the volatility at steady hashrate is quite annoying.
assuming this runs stable and the diff converges and there isnt a lot of variance, i will test various changing of hashrate and see how long it takes to adapt


[05-Aug-19 03:27 PM] jl777c#5810
as of now, it isnt triggering and it is reflected properly in nBits.
it seems the max() side of SMA might be very useful as there is no mechanism other than exp() to bring the diff down quickly. so a 5x "stranding" would leave it at higher diff for quite a while. not sure if the RST_CST can be made symmetric, or if i should just add back the max() side SMA


[05-Aug-19 03:30 PM] jl777c#5810
also are you sure the test (ts[1] - ts[W]) < T*numerator/denominator is correct?, that would be the solve time for 2 blocks not including the latest. shouldnt it be (ts[0] - ts[W]) ?


[05-Aug-19 03:53 PM] zawy#5864
You're right, make the 1 => 0 and remove that avg because with steady hash rate, it should rarely trigger and be more stable. It will be a lot better


[05-Aug-19 03:53 PM] zawy#5864
Make the 1 0


[05-Aug-19 03:54 PM] zawy#5864
@jl777c


[05-Aug-19 03:55 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will make a fresh chain without all the height exceptions tomorrow. what about idea of adding in the max() side of the SMA


[05-Aug-19 03:57 PM] jl777c#5810
or is the RST_CST already symmetric? it doesnt look like it is as the ii loop is only checking for blocks too fast


[05-Aug-19 03:58 PM] jl777c#5810
i think using SMA to lower the diff would be fine as coin emissions are slower, and it catches up in 15 blocks


[05-Aug-19 03:59 PM] jl777c#5810
the exp() is wonderful. scaled back to 1 core and in 10 minutes diff is almost where it should be


[05-Aug-19 04:06 PM] zawy#5864
For the mid-high end an lwma or exp() would be better, or modify existing ema somehow. Current design has good clean clear reason for 3 distinct elements. Maybe replace digi to merge with the ends better.


[05-Aug-19 04:07 PM] zawy#5864
No, c-r is only low end. Good catch on that 0


[05-Aug-19 04:08 PM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will make a hybrid for testing the various scenarios and we can see how it does. i think i have a good idea of how to put it all together


[05-Aug-19 04:15 PM] zawy#5864
You could use a mild form of  TSA for midrange with LWMA. CR would then never trigger unless it's an attack. Mild attacks would not get anything. Solvetimes would  vary about 3x less than any other coin at expense of difficulty changing during the block. No 3x delays under normal conditions.


[05-Aug-19 04:16 PM] zawy#5864
I think there is a way to do everything with a single simple function


[05-Aug-19 04:24 PM] zawy#5864
I need 1000 blocks with knowledge of hashrate to see what we've got.  It's kind of funny to design a DA and not see any results from modelling. But it should be done that way for security. If you do not know what you are going to see before modeling, then you don't understand what you've got well enough to be sure there is not an attack that's possible.


[05-Aug-19 04:27 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems quite complicated to model this and not sure there can be 100% assurance the model is accurate, so a live test seems the way to go, at least from my implementors view. of course you probably have the opposite view. i will make the test results spreadsheet with various hashrates and we can see how the hybrid actually behaves


[05-Aug-19 04:47 PM] zawy#5864
I can model regular DAs to match any miner behavior.  But the way the intra-block adjustment works, I've had trouble coding it.  But the results on XCG were exactly as my modelling.


[05-Aug-19 05:47 PM] zawy#5864
Are you running digi, C-R, and ema without anything extra?


[06-Aug-19 03:17 AM] zawy#5864
@jl777c I'm like a father waiting to see the new baby. CSV?


[06-Aug-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
kept tweaking it to minimize things going offtrack, key changes are to put the exponential after the RST so it makes the harder diff easier, otherwise it was starting from the unmodified diff and easy blocks were spewing out


[06-Aug-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
the other change i just made was to make it so exp() only triggers based on tipdiff. the exponential side is so fast to adjust with it looking at recent 12, and it inteferes with the RST


[06-Aug-19 03:21 AM] jl777c#5810
i also use min(origtarget, RST) value as there were cases where the RST value was higher than the original target


[06-Aug-19 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
another strange thing that is making things act weird is that the target from the RST gets gradually easier as tipdiff increases, which is as expected, but then every so often it gets much harder. i cant see how that is possible, so it seems a bug.


[06-Aug-19 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i finally got a clean launchm but it is only to height 71


[06-Aug-19 03:24 AM] jl777c#5810
also my miners seem to be getting really lucky, solving 100 diff in a few seconds. i know it can happen every so often but seem to be happening a lot


[06-Aug-19 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, i also multiply the ct[] values by 2, 3, 4 depending on how long it took to solve. trying to approximate the effective diff during the block

first 64 blocks happen in 4 minutes, so it starts with 60 blocks surplus


[06-Aug-19 03:30 AM] jl777c#5810
after 9 blocks it is down to 54 block surplus. exp() kicked in once

between tipdiff 288 and 289, the target went from 00374... to 0000d6b....


[06-Aug-19 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
at tipdiff 290 it is back to 0004...


[06-Aug-19 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and rised from there, but no idea how it gets 256x harder between 288 and 289


[06-Aug-19 03:39 AM] jl777c#5810
another one changed between tipdiff 63 and 64, but the altK values, changed a lot too, it seems with the same j, ii, tipdiff, the altK should be the same, but i am seeing wildly fluctuating values. sure seems like a bug in the code


[06-Aug-19 03:42 AM] jl777c#5810
adding printouts to help debug


[06-Aug-19 03:46 AM] zawy#5864
You've mentioned a lot of things very clearly so I can respond to them:  
1) exp() was supposed to be last.   
2) Yes, I figured the exp() would need adjusting like you said.  Remember I suggested 2xT for each of the pruior 12 instead of 1xT if it became a problem.   
3) I would like to RST data before you did the min() inside the loop.  My comments there indicate I was expcting it to be a small problem but I wanted some form of not using min() to prevent it from accidentally going into the exp().   
4) The bug of gettnig much harder is expected if your miners are doing point 5) which is finding hard blocks strangely quickly.  The Poisson has has that kind of distribution and this may be a fundamental bug in RST.  I am thinking about how to merge everything into a single equation.  

Changing exp() is fine. But I need to see the RST data with the 2x harder difficulties (1/2 ct[]) stored on the chain before you made changes to it. What block times does that correspond to?    I don't understand what you're doing multiplying that by 2, 3, 4 because that makes it even easier than we had it before where the solvetimes were fast.


[06-Aug-19 03:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i am putting into ct[] targets that are 2x, 3x, or 4x harder


[06-Aug-19 03:48 AM] jl777c#5810
the logic is that for blocks that take a long time, most of the time the miners are trying to solve much harder targets


[06-Aug-19 03:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if it takes more than 3 minutes, i see it trying to to 10x harder than what it eventually solves


[06-Aug-19 03:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so i tried to put an in between value that is harder than what was solved, but trying to get closer to the average that was attempted


[06-Aug-19 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
this had a beneficial effect. making it easier, made blocks come out very fast


[06-Aug-19 03:50 AM] zawy#5864
You kept to my original code well, so I'll try to look at what you're doing.


[06-Aug-19 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, i also used the blockhash instead of the target as i see the blockhash being a lot closer to the hashrate solve strength


[06-Aug-19 03:51 AM] jl777c#5810
for the ct[]


[06-Aug-19 03:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i think there is definitely some implementation issue, as i am seeing data that should be the same generate different results, that could explain most all the problems, in spite of that it is working decently


[06-Aug-19 03:54 AM] jl777c#5810
as diff has increased from 4 to 11, first 20 blocks is taking 45 minutes, so it made up 25 of the 60 excess blocks


[06-Aug-19 03:55 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, i was calling the RST 6 and 12, just not using its data, that is why there is different data


[06-Aug-19 03:59 AM] jl777c#5810
think i found the bug


[06-Aug-19 04:01 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty sure this will make things work much better


[06-Aug-19 04:04 AM] jl777c#5810
indeed, it is a hardforking change, the calcs were all messed up with large tipdiff.


[06-Aug-19 04:04 AM] jl777c#5810
starting again


[06-Aug-19 04:05 AM] jl777c#5810
good thing it only takes 4 minutes for the first 64 blocks


[06-Aug-19 04:05 AM] zawy#5864
The avg target they faced is always 2x higher than the target they solved because target linearly increases.  The Poisson may do something to this perspective that messes it up, but I do not see an error in the reasoning.  Without a modelling program, it would take a lot of work to experimentally derive the correct function, if that reasoning is in error.    If RST W=3 is fixed, W=6 and 12 should be fixed.  W=3 problems can't be isolated if the are mixed together. Without the data,  I do not know if where we left it yesterday needs adjusting or not.


[06-Aug-19 04:06 AM] zawy#5864
I mean's 2x lower


[06-Aug-19 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
until now all data was contaminated


[06-Aug-19 04:06 AM] zawy#5864
lol, you mean you could not resist tampering with it?


[06-Aug-19 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
was an implementation bug


[06-Aug-19 04:07 AM] zawy#5864
oh, I did not yet read your last comments.....did you just now find something?


[06-Aug-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, just now


[06-Aug-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
fixed what is basically a data corruption bug


[06-Aug-19 04:07 AM] jl777c#5810
throw out all the past data


[06-Aug-19 04:09 AM] zawy#5864
Can you change  T to 15 so that we can have a first glance in 30 minutes?


[06-Aug-19 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
target linearly gets easier, so by the time it is solved, it is the easiest target the miners have seen. the actual solved target goes onchain and i make the ct[] array more difficult (lower target) to compensate, scaled by amount of time it took. as the longer it takes, the more the median target was difficult as compared to the solved


[06-Aug-19 04:10 AM] jl777c#5810
it is at height 68 now


[06-Aug-19 04:10 AM] zawy#5864
You can also reduce the 50 to 15


[06-Aug-19 04:11 AM] zawy#5864
I do not expect W=3 to need more than 10.  W=12 needs at least 24


[06-Aug-19 04:11 AM] zawy#5864
So the 50 was overkill


[06-Aug-19 04:11 AM] jl777c#5810
should we use different past values for the different W?


[06-Aug-19 04:13 AM] jl777c#5810
target is progressively getting easier, no retrograde. ht 68 tipdiff at 230


[06-Aug-19 04:14 AM] zawy#5864
Oh, doh, yeah, avg target is something else....let me see....


[06-Aug-19 04:15 AM] jl777c#5810
tipdiff 350


[06-Aug-19 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
when the RST doesnt adjust fast enough, the exp() now comes in and helps it reduce faster


[06-Aug-19 04:16 AM] zawy#5864
well, no, avg target seems to be 1/2


[06-Aug-19 04:17 AM] jl777c#5810
block found at 420


[06-Aug-19 04:18 AM] jl777c#5810
ht.69 in 22 seconds diff of 6, no RST (well there was but it was making it easier and that is why i added min(), without it could have been a very easy block)


[06-Aug-19 04:18 AM] zawy#5864
If it's working as good as I had hoped, RST should stop about 10 blocks after 64


[06-Aug-19 04:18 AM] jl777c#5810
ht 70 54 seconds 9.86 diff


[06-Aug-19 04:19 AM] jl777c#5810
ht 71 2 seconds, no RST


[06-Aug-19 04:19 AM] zawy#5864
and maybe turn off and on until digishield catches up, about 15 blocks later


[06-Aug-19 04:19 AM] zawy#5864
so far, working great?


[06-Aug-19 04:19 AM] jl777c#5810
made up 7 of the surplus blocks in first 8, so yes!


[06-Aug-19 04:20 AM] jl777c#5810
helps to not have horrible implementation bugs

[06-Aug-19 04:22 AM] zawy#5864
hmmm, if it has not made up all the blocks in the past 50, how can it turn off?


[06-Aug-19 04:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it cant


[06-Aug-19 04:23 AM] jl777c#5810
but it doesnt generate a target that is harder to solve


[06-Aug-19 04:23 AM] jl777c#5810
altK over 1 million


[06-Aug-19 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
most recent 3 solves were 236 seconds


[06-Aug-19 04:24 AM] zawy#5864
what's the needed difficulty?


[06-Aug-19 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
digishield


[06-Aug-19 04:24 AM] jl777c#5810
as adjusted by ct[]


[06-Aug-19 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
many moving parts


[06-Aug-19 04:25 AM] zawy#5864
i mean, what should the difficulty be right now to be perfect for your hashrate?


[06-Aug-19 04:25 AM] zawy#5864
if it were not trying to make up for lost blocks?


[06-Aug-19 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i think about 30


[06-Aug-19 04:26 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe 25


[06-Aug-19 04:26 AM] zawy#5864
are the diffs shown RST then Digi?


[06-Aug-19 04:27 AM] jl777c#5810
no, first is just converting the bnTarget


[06-Aug-19 04:27 AM] jl777c#5810
the second is calculating what a miner would need


[06-Aug-19 04:28 AM] zawy#5864
So current D is 2x that value?


[06-Aug-19 04:28 AM] zawy#5864
Can you get your script to output solvetimes so we don't need to do the subtraction?


[06-Aug-19 04:29 AM] zawy#5864
(and round off D)


[06-Aug-19 04:29 AM] jl777c#5810
it depends on how many of the past 17 blocks were RST, and what their solve times were


[06-Aug-19 04:29 AM] zawy#5864
or at least to 1 decimal place


[06-Aug-19 04:29 AM] jl777c#5810
ok.


[06-Aug-19 04:30 AM] zawy#5864
past 17 seems stable......I don't understant how it's catching up if the avg difficulty is 1/2 the needed difficulty


[06-Aug-19 04:30 AM] zawy#5864
past 17 D appears stable., so avg D seems to be about 2x7 = 12


[06-Aug-19 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
magic?


[06-Aug-19 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the diff is growing as the blocks are coming in slower


[06-Aug-19 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
made up 8 blocks now, at ht. 84


[06-Aug-19 04:33 AM] zawy#5864
let me see data


[06-Aug-19 04:33 AM] jl777c#5810
diff at 14, netdiff at 20.


[06-Aug-19 04:33 AM] zawy#5864
what's diff and netdiff?


[06-Aug-19 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
i am not sure why netdiff is off... i think it calculates the adaptive diff based on that block


[06-Aug-19 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure why it sometimes is way off


[06-Aug-19 04:35 AM] zawy#5864
I do not know what your difficulty values mean.  Are they 2x what the miner has solved or 1x or something else?


[06-Aug-19 04:36 AM] jl777c#5810
the first diff is what the miner actually solved

last value is solvetime


[06-Aug-19 04:40 AM] zawy#5864
avg diff for 9 blocks after 64 was 20.  wow that was close.....and better than close, that means avg actual difficulty was 40 because it's trying to slow them up.  Net solvetime time was 70


[06-Aug-19 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
somehow it got diff to 20+, while slowing down 11 minutes, in 26 blocks


[06-Aug-19 04:41 AM] zawy#5864
maybe it's perfect


[06-Aug-19 04:41 AM] jl777c#5810
even at current pace it wont recoup all the genesis surplus, but that is a very special case


[06-Aug-19 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810
it sure seems like magic


[06-Aug-19 04:42 AM] jl777c#5810
once the genesis 64 blocks gets out of the past window, i expect to see it go quite and just make blocks normally. then i will do a 2x test


[06-Aug-19 04:43 AM] jl777c#5810
what do you expect will happen when the W6 and W12 are activated?


[06-Aug-19 04:46 AM] zawy#5864
I only see it caught up 2 blocks


[06-Aug-19 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
its been 43 minutes since the chain started, at height 96


[06-Aug-19 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
at 4 minutes it was 64


[06-Aug-19 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
in 39 minutes it did 32 blocks


[06-Aug-19 04:47 AM] jl777c#5810
seems caught up 7, now it gets some faster blocks


[06-Aug-19 04:48 AM] zawy#5864
W=6 and 12 will only activate if the attacks are less that about 3x or 6x.   They are for the smaller increases in hashrate.  But  W=3 may make them pointless.


[06-Aug-19 04:48 AM] jl777c#5810
oh. yes, it is catching my 6x "attack", well i guess from genesis it might be a 10x


[06-Aug-19 04:51 AM] jl777c#5810
having the digishield and loop using the modified ct[] targets solved the problem of not being able to increase diff while slowing down for past blocks


[06-Aug-19 04:52 AM] jl777c#5810
and it hasnt activated for the last 6 blocks


[06-Aug-19 04:52 AM] jl777c#5810
diff is at 33


[06-Aug-19 04:52 AM] zawy#5864
5 of those 7 was just the last of the 64 coming in slower.  RST only slowed up 2 blocks.....hmmm, oh yeah.... that's the intention in normal conditions...see, it only activates when 3 blocks are suddenly  2.5 to 3 blocks behind.


[06-Aug-19 04:53 AM] jl777c#5810

[06-Aug-19 04:54 AM] jl777c#5810
in the third column, if the lowest 2 bits are 0, it is off


[06-Aug-19 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
90 was the only one RST triggered and it solved it when the diff was adjusted, from the pre-adjusted ct[]


[06-Aug-19 04:55 AM] jl777c#5810
adjustments on adjustments


[06-Aug-19 04:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the only problem spot would be that it will take a long time to adjust after being diffstranded 5x


[06-Aug-19 04:57 AM] jl777c#5810
though, maybe random variations will go past 7 minutes and trigger an exp()...


[06-Aug-19 04:57 AM] zawy#5864
not following


[06-Aug-19 04:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but the recovery time from diff stranding will be slower now, so we also make up excess blocks during the recovery


[06-Aug-19 04:58 AM] jl777c#5810
and since much less hashrate is getting the blocks, it seems ok that it is slower


[06-Aug-19 04:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but a 3x attack, wouldnt trigger exp(), so it would need to rely on digishield to adjust... the SMA was so much faster than digishield


[06-Aug-19 04:59 AM] zawy#5864
i see no 00, so it never turned off?


[06-Aug-19 05:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it is decimal,maybe i should display it in binary, but two lowest bits, so a multiple of 4 is disabled


[06-Aug-19 05:00 AM] zawy#5864
My SMAs were causing D to lower faster?  I only inteded for them to make it rise


[06-Aug-19 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
we had a symmetrical max() side after the initial min() only


[06-Aug-19 05:01 AM] zawy#5864
oh, so 2, 4, 8, 16?


[06-Aug-19 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
i propose to add back the SMA max() side in case RST and exp() dont trigger


[06-Aug-19 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
the nbits % 4 == 0


[06-Aug-19 05:01 AM] zawy#5864

[06-Aug-19 05:01 AM] zawy#5864
SMA


[06-Aug-19 05:02 AM] zawy#5864

3/10, 5/10, 6/10 for 4, 7, 12 SMA


[06-Aug-19 05:05 AM] zawy#5864
It might be better to replace  digi and these SMAs with LWMA


[06-Aug-19 05:07 AM] jl777c#5810
it will adjust faster than 15 blocks?


[06-Aug-19 05:09 AM] zawy#5864
To drop?  Under what conditions?  Post 3x attack or 10x?


[06-Aug-19 05:09 AM] jl777c#5810
post 3x to 5x


[06-Aug-19 05:11 AM] zawy#5864
No, it drops slowly.  But that's because it needs to stay on track and does not have RST.


[06-Aug-19 05:11 AM] zawy#5864
RST is damn confusing and damn good.


[06-Aug-19 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
yes!


[06-Aug-19 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
if it isnt active and the SMA kicks in, i would think it would work as well as when we testing it (before RST)


[06-Aug-19 05:12 AM] zawy#5864
3 days now, and I can't wrap my head around the consequences


[06-Aug-19 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
SMA only problem (allows on/off generating extra blocks) is solved by RST, at least it is looking like that will be the case, we do need to verify this


[06-Aug-19 05:13 AM] jl777c#5810
RST quiet for 8 blocks now


[06-Aug-19 05:14 AM] zawy#5864
let hashrate be  stable for 100 blocks....there should be only 25% change RST is activated


[06-Aug-19 05:14 AM] jl777c#5810
it made up about 25 blocks, during the 50 block window. so under normal circumstances it wont be able to get anywhere close to 25 blocks ahead.


[06-Aug-19 05:15 AM] zawy#5864
the way W=3 works, there may be no need for W=6 or 12.....


[06-Aug-19 05:15 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming it can stop a 1000x attack as well as it does for a 10x


[06-Aug-19 05:16 AM] jl777c#5810
and you said you were most worried about these low range attacks


[06-Aug-19 05:17 AM] zawy#5864
See, it only has 50% chance of detecting 6x in 3 blocks.    But it has something like a 50% chance of detecting a 3x attack in 6 blocks.....  which is exactly the chance W=6 has


[06-Aug-19 05:17 AM] zawy#5864
and it will be more aggressive than W=6


[06-Aug-19 05:18 AM] zawy#5864
The reason for W=6 is if the results from W=3 are too unstable


[06-Aug-19 05:18 AM] jl777c#5810
do you see anything wrong with using the solved blockhashes into the ct[] array instead of the nBits based bnTarget?


[06-Aug-19 05:19 AM] jl777c#5810
what that would do is if some ASIC is blasting away and solving much harder than the current diff blocks, it will go into the digishield and it will target the actually solved targets. basically the implied hashrate


[06-Aug-19 05:20 AM] jl777c#5810
many tweaks i put in to get it to work more consistetly, but the data problem was the biggest destabilizer


[06-Aug-19 05:22 AM] zawy#5864
Solving blocks faster does not result  in lower hash values.  You can't detect hashrate fom the hash values unless the target is actually harder


[06-Aug-19 05:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i mean if a miner can find a block starting with 00000... instead of just 000...


[06-Aug-19 05:23 AM] jl777c#5810
dont we know he has approx 256x more hashrate?


[06-Aug-19 05:23 AM] zawy#5864
yes, but he's not going to hash for the normal time to solve the target.....he's going to give you the first he finds which is a rand() value below the target


[06-Aug-19 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, but whatever he posts, we can see it is a good statistical change he has a lot more hashrate


[06-Aug-19 05:24 AM] jl777c#5810
at least that was my logic


[06-Aug-19 05:24 AM] zawy#5864
to do what you have in mind, he would have to hash the full T to find that 256x lower target if he is 256x the current difficulty


[06-Aug-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
ASIC have a mindiff setting


[06-Aug-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
they cant solve the lowest diffs that well


[06-Aug-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so usually even if the diff is much lower, they set it at a much harder level as that is what the ASIC starts at


[06-Aug-19 05:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so this is more a practical point than a theoretical one where miners have the perfect mining machine without any pesky mindiff/maxdiff settings


[06-Aug-19 05:26 AM] zawy#5864
WHy in the world would they need to start with a harder difficulty?


[06-Aug-19 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
for one, nicehash wont let you mine at anything other than very high diff


[06-Aug-19 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
a lot of ASIC just dont work very well at very easy diffs


[06-Aug-19 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
just some real world constraints


[06-Aug-19 05:29 AM] zawy#5864
nBits % 4?   tell me how to see in 3rd column if RST is active

[06-Aug-19 05:30 AM] zawy#5864
So I need to make RST symmetrical for the drops?    That would replace exp()


[06-Aug-19 05:30 AM] zawy#5864
and SMA


[06-Aug-19 05:30 AM] jl777c#5810
in hex now, much easier, 0, 4, 6, 8, a, c are off


[06-Aug-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
if RST was symmetrical, indeed it could be the only thing that is needed


[06-Aug-19 05:31 AM] zawy#5864
will it randomly misunderstand, or do you actively force digi and RST to not collide?


[06-Aug-19 05:32 AM] zawy#5864
on that 0, 4, 6, 8, a, c.  why not 2 and e?


[06-Aug-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i store 1, 2, or 3, depending on if <1 T, <2T or 3T+ for the solvetime


[06-Aug-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
a nonzero -> (val +1) divisor


[06-Aug-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
so if <T, it halves the target


[06-Aug-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
if 1T to 2T, it divides target by 3


[06-Aug-19 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
if more than 3T, it divides the target by 4


[06-Aug-19 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
just my seeing the targets for the 3 minutes, being on average much much harder than what is eventually solved


[06-Aug-19 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it is what allowed it to gain in difficulty, even while the blocks are slow


[06-Aug-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
and very roughly correlates to the average target for that block


[06-Aug-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
probably you can make a much more precise set of linear approximations. i found the elapsed time worked the best


[06-Aug-19 05:37 AM] zawy#5864
I am not following.  These devisions are the adjustment to ct[]?


[06-Aug-19 05:38 AM] zawy#5864
before RST? and digi, i guess, but only if they were RST blocks?


[06-Aug-19 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
you said to put into digishield and the loop as close to the actual difficulty


[06-Aug-19 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so they would retarget based on the most accurate dta


[06-Aug-19 05:39 AM] zawy#5864
which is strictly 2x what was solved


[06-Aug-19 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
but if it takes 3 minutes the average is a lot harder than double


[06-Aug-19 05:40 AM] zawy#5864
The average over the 3 minutes was 2x what was solved at 3 minutes


[06-Aug-19 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
i have it printing out and it might start at 50x harder rapidly reduce to 10x harder, but then slowly get easier


[06-Aug-19 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe i misunderstood


[06-Aug-19 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
but we needed to feed into the digishield and the RST, harder targets than was actually solved


[06-Aug-19 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise the diff never really went up


[06-Aug-19 05:41 AM] zawy#5864
Right, if they were RST targets


[06-Aug-19 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, only if RST


[06-Aug-19 05:41 AM] zawy#5864
and we feed 1/2 the target


[06-Aug-19 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
a 10 second RST solve would be very close to the average target during the entire 10 seconds


[06-Aug-19 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
a 600 second RST solve would be very far away, maybe 300 seconds away


[06-Aug-19 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so as a rough estimation, i increased the divisor based on solvetime


[06-Aug-19 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
and magically the diff is going up now even as blocks are coming in slower


[06-Aug-19 05:43 AM] zawy#5864
ok, right, yes your intiution correctly refused to go along with my logic.  I need to figure out what we need to have exactly


[06-Aug-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
I am always making errors going the opposite way, especially with diff and targets, so i usually try both and see which works better


[06-Aug-19 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
probably there is a way to calculate the exact divisor needed, but i only have 3 values inside nBits now. probably can get a few more if needed


[06-Aug-19 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
i was thinking of doing (1 << bits), to get up to 8x, but i noticed that the 100x period is very short, and it rapidly gets to 20x and below


[06-Aug-19 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
so i stuck with 2x, 3x, 4x. of course the 2x, 3x, 4x can be any divisor and the solvetime threshold can be at any fractional T


[06-Aug-19 05:52 AM] zawy#5864
actual target = solved target/(t/T) \* 0.693


[06-Aug-19 05:52 AM] zawy#5864
I thnik


[06-Aug-19 05:53 AM] zawy#5864
oh wait


[06-Aug-19 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
chain stabilized at diff of 35


[06-Aug-19 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
RST not triggering


[06-Aug-19 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
can do a 2x or 1000x test from here


[06-Aug-19 06:00 AM] zawy#5864
1000x


[06-Aug-19 06:01 AM] zawy#5864
no, have you done 3x?


[06-Aug-19 06:02 AM] zawy#5864
my estimate is that it will resolve in 8 to 11 blocks


[06-Aug-19 06:05 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i can do a 3x


[06-Aug-19 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
3x started for ht.150

[06-Aug-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
probably another implementation error


[06-Aug-19 06:13 AM] zawy#5864
10 blocks after RST stops, send me all the blocks


[06-Aug-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
it hasnt started


[06-Aug-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
shouldnt the above blocks have triggered it?


[06-Aug-19 06:15 AM] zawy#5864
no


[06-Aug-19 06:15 AM] zawy#5864
sum last 3  STs  < T/2


[06-Aug-19 06:15 AM] zawy#5864
50% chance of activating in 6 blocks


[06-Aug-19 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
so this is why we need the 6x and 12x!


[06-Aug-19 06:16 AM] zawy#5864
yes


[06-Aug-19 06:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess that was demonstrated


[06-Aug-19 06:17 AM] zawy#5864
really, even W=6 only has 50% chance in 6 blocks


[06-Aug-19 06:18 AM] jl777c#5810
what about W=12?


[06-Aug-19 06:18 AM] zawy#5864
~ 75% chance in 12


[06-Aug-19 06:19 AM] jl777c#5810
SMA wont work better for these smaller increases?


[06-Aug-19 06:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it seemed to adjust diff pretty fast. maybe we use the SMA to catch the smaller ones?


[06-Aug-19 06:20 AM] zawy#5864
SMA N=7 triggers if last 7 <  T\*7/3


[06-Aug-19 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess i was thinking more the 15x attacks...


[06-Aug-19 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810
26 blocks in 16 minutes


[06-Aug-19 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
its the same as boiling a frog. you get much better results with a gradual increase, than all of a sudden


[06-Aug-19 06:25 AM] zawy#5864
SMA triggers a lot easier, but it only increases a little


[06-Aug-19 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
a little is better than nothing (digishield)


[06-Aug-19 06:25 AM] zawy#5864
what's D now?


[06-Aug-19 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
44


[06-Aug-19 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
ht 180


[06-Aug-19 06:26 AM] zawy#5864
I definitely expected 3x to be detected in 12 blocks


[06-Aug-19 06:26 AM] zawy#5864
with W=3


[06-Aug-19 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
seems a bug


[06-Aug-19 06:26 AM] jl777c#5810
we had 5, 18, 8 -> 31 seconds


[06-Aug-19 06:27 AM] zawy#5864
It may be fixed with W=6 and 12.  Let me do a test.....make digishield stable as fast as you can...drop hashrate to about 1.5x


[06-Aug-19 06:28 AM] zawy#5864
maybe 2


[06-Aug-19 06:28 AM] zawy#5864
2x


[06-Aug-19 06:28 AM] jl777c#5810
reduced to 12 cores at ht 188


[06-Aug-19 06:29 AM] zawy#5864
once digishield is stable and average past 17 blocks is 60 seconds, do 6x attack.....if W=3 detects it in 3 to 5 blocks, all is well.


[06-Aug-19 06:29 AM] jl777c#5810
6x attack.. i need to reduce to 2 cores then


[06-Aug-19 06:29 AM] zawy#5864
That means W=6 would see 3x in 6 to 10


[06-Aug-19 06:38 AM] jl777c#5810
actual target = solved target/(t/T) * 0.693
that seems to mean my 2x, 3x, 4x at T, 2T, 3T is not so far off. probably makes it a bit more difficult for the smaller t, but much less so the larger t gets


[06-Aug-19 06:46 AM] zawy#5864
that eq doesn't work at t=1, but being like your method except linear with what I was trying to do


[06-Aug-19 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so i should set the thresholds at multiples of 1.44T?


[06-Aug-19 06:48 AM] jl777c#5810
or 0.693T


[06-Aug-19 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
it is taking forever for diff to come down. even if i mine with 1 core, it is finding blocks at diff of 30, sometimes in less than a minute


[06-Aug-19 07:04 AM] jl777c#5810
i have to turn off the mining for 7 minutes and let the exp() kick in. repeat, then i think in 5 blocks it will be at low diff


[06-Aug-19 07:15 AM] zawy#5864
I just want to see iteerspond to 3x        after        targets are stable for 17 blocks and timespan between them is about 17xT


[06-Aug-19 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
3x test or 6x test next?


[06-Aug-19 07:16 AM] zawy#5864
6x


[06-Aug-19 07:16 AM] zawy#5864
right


[06-Aug-19 07:16 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i think i got the diff down. now needs 17 stable blocks


[06-Aug-19 07:44 AM] zawy#5864
From what I can determine, the proper target is something I can't even plot in excel because it involves the  imaginary error function. ```adjTar = Tar*(ln(t) - sqrt(pi/2)*erfi(sqrt(ln(t)) / t )^2 / t```


[06-Aug-19 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe i just stay with 2x, 3x and 4x. imaginary numbers give me headache


[06-Aug-19 07:46 AM] zawy#5864
it's only called that because it can handle imagniary numbers.


[06-Aug-19 07:46 AM] zawy#5864
we do not input them


[06-Aug-19 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
good, i will only get an imaginary headache üòÉ


[06-Aug-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
i think we just need some rough approximation, as the feedback process will correct things if it overshoots


[06-Aug-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
but maybe it behaves totally differently at 10000x


[06-Aug-19 08:01 AM] zawy#5864
I need to redo the gernal loop idea of looking at past blocks and checking emission rate and adjusting based on CST  with an EMA difficulty algorithm


[06-Aug-19 08:03 AM] zawy#5864
so it would be 1 equation that would be more aggressive in proportion to number of blocks behind and faster recent solve speeds


[06-Aug-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
6x was detected on the 5th block


[06-Aug-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
but we got a 2, 5, 7 solvetimes, so pretty lucky miners


[06-Aug-19 08:06 AM] jl777c#5810
having the algo use "common sense" is what it sounds like, where the more you are behind and the faster the recent solves are, the more aggressive it needs to be


[06-Aug-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
the 6x only triggered a few times, the first time the exp came in, after that mostly just digishield and blocks are fast. 255 was first 6x block:

[06-Aug-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
which is why i guess you said "adjusting based on CST  with an EMA difficulty algorithm
so it would be 1 equation that would be more aggressive in proportion to number of blocks behind and faster recent solve speeds"


[06-Aug-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i think i will wait for the next algo as this one shows that the basic concept works (slowing blocks while increasing diff), but the triggers need to be tuned and something to bring down the diff if the exp() is avoided


[06-Aug-19 09:40 AM] zawy#5864
I need to first determine what the correct target correction is.  I can't trust it until it's theoretically correct.


[06-Aug-19 12:51 PM] zawy#5864
That mistake at the beginning where you said previous data was no good, did that apply to yesterday's data too where we got 45 s solvetimes from not changing target?


[06-Aug-19 01:46 PM] zawy#5864
None of that sequence above looks right.


[06-Aug-19 06:02 PM] zawy#5864
I found what I believe is the proper conversion for the targets.  The RST will probably have problems until that conversion is correct.


[07-Aug-19 12:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i think the data could have been valid at first, but the longer the RST block, the more likely it would retrograde.


[07-Aug-19 02:46 AM] zawy#5864
The 600 is way too high (target is too low)  and it does not seem it's working on the subsequent solvetimes (tey are too fast, target is high) .  My math is telling me something a lot different than my intuition that said lower all on-chain targets (to be used in all the DAs) to 1/2  (and different from your method of adjusting by solvetime).  It's tellign me targets the miners have to solve from RST should be adjusted to (nTime-ct[0])^2\*1000/784.  I need to see full testing on that or I have to abandon RST work until I get my computer that I used to use for modelling working again.


[07-Aug-19 02:48 AM] zawy#5864
By "600" I mean the 622 solve in block 259 @jl777c


[07-Aug-19 02:49 AM] jl777c#5810
RST does get some very high diff. i smoothed that out with averaging with the prior bnTarget, but you said to remove that


[07-Aug-19 02:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so change the new target to that equation when i == 0  in the ii loop?


[07-Aug-19 02:50 AM] jl777c#5810
wait! is that an N squared?


[07-Aug-19 02:50 AM] jl777c#5810
tipdiff * tipdiff * 1000 / 784


[07-Aug-19 02:51 AM] jl777c#5810
you mean ts[0] not ct[0]


[07-Aug-19 02:51 AM] zawy#5864
Yes, if my math is right, my intuition was way way off, and your intuition of what you thought i was saying was closer..    You've been looking at the data....does this feel like it would work better?


[07-Aug-19 02:52 AM] zawy#5864
I mean tipdiff.     yes, i meant ts[]


[07-Aug-19 02:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it would certainly adjust a lot faster than 600 seconds


[07-Aug-19 02:53 AM] jl777c#5810
tipdiff squared is a monster numerator


[07-Aug-19 02:53 AM] jl777c#5810
what about the initial setting at the top ? that one seems to have much less aggressive numbers, so it is probably ok?


[07-Aug-19 02:54 AM] zawy#5864
this should not affect the 622 because (i thought) the 622 was the adjustment outside the loop......


[07-Aug-19 02:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i will make this change and fire up ZAWY18


[07-Aug-19 02:55 AM] zawy#5864
We need to check on that.....You said we were lucky to get those 3 solvetimes which I thought meant the first trigger which means the eq before the loop


[07-Aug-19 02:55 AM] jl777c#5810
it triggered the ii loop also


[07-Aug-19 02:56 AM] zawy#5864
so the 3 fast were supposed to cause the 622.... the loop's not supposed to overwrite that......also, the loop should have immiedately stopped if it saw the 622....so my code is goign into the loop 1st time when it shouldn't....i think you asked me about that and i told you wrong


[07-Aug-19 02:57 AM] zawy#5864
see, 622 erases the 3 blocks lost to emissiona nd puts it 6 block behind instead of ahead so the loops not supposed to be active


[07-Aug-19 02:57 AM] jl777c#5810
you mean if the initial (ts[0] - ts[W]) < T*num/den is trigged, it should just use that and not go into the loop?


[07-Aug-19 02:57 AM] zawy#5864
yes, my bad


[07-Aug-19 02:58 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, changing the control flow to just return what the initial conditions does (unless altK > 1 million)


[07-Aug-19 02:58 AM] jl777c#5810
and the ii loop equation to tipdiff squared, instead of tipdiff * (ts[0] - ts[W])


[07-Aug-19 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
any other changes?


[07-Aug-19 03:00 AM] zawy#5864
I think this means erasing the -1 here


[07-Aug-19 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
this will definitely speed up the "unsolvable" blocks as the (ts[0] - ts[W]) is often much smaller than tipdiff


[07-Aug-19 03:00 AM] zawy#5864
```for (i=j-1; i>=0; i-- )```


[07-Aug-19 03:00 AM] zawy#5864
I mean make it -2?


[07-Aug-19 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
-2? or -W?


[07-Aug-19 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems maybe -W makes more sense as emission cant change until after its triggered


[07-Aug-19 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
and it cant trigger before W blocks


[07-Aug-19 03:01 AM] jl777c#5810
should i reduce past also?


[07-Aug-19 03:03 AM] zawy#5864
I want to be sure to tell you right.  Right now I'm thinking you only need to change the -1 to -2


[07-Aug-19 03:03 AM] zawy#5864
outer loop only tries to find the initial trigger


[07-Aug-19 03:04 AM] zawy#5864
inner loop determines if that trigger stayed active all the way to current block and then adjusts current block if it did


[07-Aug-19 03:04 AM] zawy#5864
if it does not find it lasted all the way, it looks for next possible trigger


[07-Aug-19 03:05 AM] zawy#5864
in outer loop


[07-Aug-19 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i will change the outerloop to stop when j hits 1, as if you -2, it will be illegal index


[07-Aug-19 03:05 AM] zawy#5864
yeah, I believe the -2 is needed..


[07-Aug-19 03:05 AM] jl777c#5810
should i change the 2x, 3x, 4x multipliers ?


[07-Aug-19 03:07 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe just always make it a 2x?


[07-Aug-19 03:07 AM] zawy#5864
yes, but if the equation fails, try your 1, 2, 3, (which should be linearized to use (nTime-ts[0])   instea dof my  (nTime-ts[0])\* (nTime-ts[0])    ) and then lastly try my initial resuce all miner RST  targets to 1/2


[07-Aug-19 03:07 AM] zawy#5864
I mean try my equation above first and test it good, and send me all output


[07-Aug-19 03:08 AM] jl777c#5810
so disable the 2x,3x,4x multiplier totally?


[07-Aug-19 03:08 AM] zawy#5864
no, replace  it with my equation


[07-Aug-19 03:09 AM] zawy#5864
A linear version of your equation (if I understand what you're doing ) is 
tipdiff  \* 1000 / 1000  as opposed to my tipdiff \* tipdiff \* 1000 / 784


[07-Aug-19 03:13 AM] jl777c#5810
a bit confused....
```altK = (K * tipdiff * tipdiff) / (W * T * T)```


[07-Aug-19 03:13 AM] jl777c#5810
that is for the ii loop, but you are saying there is a 1000 / 784 instead of K and (W * T * T)?


[07-Aug-19 03:14 AM] jl777c#5810
can you write the full altK = line, just to make sure i dont botch it


[07-Aug-19 03:16 AM] zawy#5864
No, it appears to me your "on-chain" targets (not actually on chain, but the ones being used for future RST and digi and exp) are not being creatde inside the loop.  Similarly, I am not suggesting any change to the loop if you have not changed it to do that.   I didn't understand how you're doing it outside the loop, but it sounded like we are on the same page about what we're doing......so I am only saying wherever you have the 2x, 3x, 4x, replace it with this.


[07-Aug-19 03:17 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, so the only change to the RST itself would be to make the initial check have priority over the ii loop and change j-1, to j-2


[07-Aug-19 03:18 AM] zawy#5864
yes.....let's make sure we're on the same page about "on chain.....


[07-Aug-19 03:18 AM] jl777c#5810
that is what goes onchain


[07-Aug-19 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
then offchain (just in the ct[] and digishield) to change the 2x, 3x, 4x to being (solvetime * 1000) / 784 ?


[07-Aug-19 03:19 AM] zawy#5864
targets the miners have to solve from RST are what the loop says....but future DA calculations are based on adjusting that RST value.  The future inputs to RST and digi and exp are my equation's adjustment to the RST value


[07-Aug-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, so if it was RST, adjust the values used to calculate


[07-Aug-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
but it seems there needs to be a / T in there?


[07-Aug-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
(solvetime * 1000) / (T * 784) ?


[07-Aug-19 03:20 AM] zawy#5864
yes


[07-Aug-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
and that is the divisor to the bnTarget


[07-Aug-19 03:21 AM] jl777c#5810
but it will make it easier if it solved it quickly?


[07-Aug-19 03:21 AM] zawy#5864
let me be more precise with it


[07-Aug-19 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, last version was using the blockhash as diff. i guess to undo that trick


[07-Aug-19 03:25 AM] zawy#5864
let's say there is a ctA[] that  has all the DA outputs and the RST values that the miners had to solve.   The on-chain  ct[] values will be ctB[].  This will be what all aspects of the DA uses.  
 if (ctA[i] is RST value) { 

ctB[i] = ctA[i]\* (( ts[i+1]  - ts[i] ) \* ( ts[i+1]  - ts[i] ) \* 1000 /T/T/784 

 }


[07-Aug-19 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
even if ctB[i] might end up easier to solve than ctA[i] ?


[07-Aug-19 03:27 AM] zawy#5864
Where my understanding is that you were doing this
if (ctA[i] is RST value) { 

ctB[i] = ctA[i] * (( ts[i+1]  - ts[i] ) * 1000 /T/1000

 }


[07-Aug-19 03:28 AM] jl777c#5810
what i was doing was far more caveman


[07-Aug-19 03:28 AM] zawy#5864
ctB is harder if  solvetime was < 1xT, else easier


[07-Aug-19 03:28 AM] zawy#5864
right, yuo did not linearize it


[07-Aug-19 03:29 AM] jl777c#5810
conceptually i dont understand why to make . it easier if it took 40 seconds to solve, the average target would be what the target was at 20 seconds


[07-Aug-19 03:30 AM] zawy#5864
no it's harder to solve if it's 40 seconds


[07-Aug-19 03:31 AM] jl777c#5810
whereever the cutoff is, 20 seconds


[07-Aug-19 03:31 AM] zawy#5864
The cutoff is 1000/784 x T.   solvetimes below that are harder


[07-Aug-19 03:34 AM] jl777c#5810
dont understand, but i will set it to ```ctA[i] * (solvetime * solvetime * 1000) / (T * T * 784)```


[07-Aug-19 03:34 AM] zawy#5864
yes


[07-Aug-19 03:34 AM] zawy#5864
you could do this to prevent overflow


[07-Aug-19 03:35 AM] jl777c#5810
int64_t wont overflow with solvetime squared


[07-Aug-19 03:36 AM] zawy#5864
```(ctA[i] /1e6)* (( (1e6* solvetime * solvetime * 1000)) / (T * T * 784)  )```


[07-Aug-19 03:36 AM] zawy#5864
I'm worried about arith256  in ctA


[07-Aug-19 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
good point


[07-Aug-19 03:37 AM] zawy#5864
you remember my k in the loop I think was a good idea


[07-Aug-19 03:37 AM] zawy#5864
I did it this way too


[07-Aug-19 03:39 AM] jl777c#5810
but putting the 1e6 in the solvetime squared wont prevent any overflow, so the multiply by 1e6 needs to happen last


[07-Aug-19 03:39 AM] jl777c#5810
basically scale down ct[i] by a million, do the original equation, scale it up by a million. that will avoid any bnTarget overflows


[07-Aug-19 03:40 AM] zawy#5864
I'm not following.  I think what I've got resolves everything, both potential overflows and round off error


[07-Aug-19 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
i missed the parentheses precedence. ok it works, but i split out each step so i can explicitly see there is no problem


[07-Aug-19 03:42 AM] jl777c#5810
```            if ( zflags[i] != 0 )
            {
                ct[i] /= arith_uint256(K);
                ct[i] *= arith_uint256((int64_t)(ts[i] - ts[i+1]) * (ts[i] - ts[i+1]) * 1000);
                ct[i] /= arith_uint256(T * T * 784);
                ct[i] *= arith_uint256(K);
            }
```


[07-Aug-19 03:42 AM] zawy#5864
I guess I have 1 excess pair of parenthesis


[07-Aug-19 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
you had right parens. without the second set, it would have overflowed any target less than a million


[07-Aug-19 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
from the max target


[07-Aug-19 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
but my way, it is clear there is no chance of overflow. all those parens can be a bit confusing


[07-Aug-19 03:43 AM] zawy#5864
all your conversions I would have thought is a lot more wasteful than simply doing the initial declaration as arith256


[07-Aug-19 03:44 AM] jl777c#5810
conversion is very fast


[07-Aug-19 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
getting the logic right is all that matters now


[07-Aug-19 03:45 AM] zawy#5864
in what way is it more efficient in computer usage?   Obviously it's in-efficient in code which I would think is the higher priority


[07-Aug-19 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
compilers will change a single complex line into multiple simple lines


[07-Aug-19 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
optimizing compilers are extremely good at taking a lot of simple lines and making it as efficient as possible


[07-Aug-19 03:46 AM] jl777c#5810
so as long as the net effect is isomorphic, the difference will be measured in microseconds, if even that much, likely nanoseconds


[07-Aug-19 03:46 AM] jl777c#5810
not worth the time to think which way is better


[07-Aug-19 03:46 AM] jl777c#5810
anyway, ready to start if all looks good


[07-Aug-19 03:47 AM] jl777c#5810
you want a 3x test?


[07-Aug-19 03:47 AM] jl777c#5810
after the initial targets stabilize


[07-Aug-19 03:48 AM] zawy#5864
You can change 50 to 20 to speed things up.  Even T=30 if the code is constant-independent everywhere


[07-Aug-19 03:49 AM] jl777c#5810
sounds good


[07-Aug-19 03:49 AM] zawy#5864
but do 1x   hashrate until difficulty matches hashrate and difficulty looks like it is staying constant and RST is not being triggered


[07-Aug-19 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
i know but depending on what the first test is, i like to use as many cores as possible to reduce variance


[07-Aug-19 03:50 AM] jl777c#5810
a single core has such a large range of solve times


[07-Aug-19 03:50 AM] zawy#5864
Then 3x then 6x if that was good, and then 100x


[07-Aug-19 03:51 AM] zawy#5864
ok, 3x, then 9x , then 27x


[07-Aug-19 03:51 AM] zawy#5864
wait....there's another issue


[07-Aug-19 03:53 AM] zawy#5864
when taking a random sample, hashrate is not sum of N Diff's / sum N solvetimess  but sum(D)/sum(ST) * (N-1) / N


[07-Aug-19 03:54 AM] zawy#5864
This is supposed to have a substantial effect on my initial trigger .  This may be why W=3 did not trigger on 3x


[07-Aug-19 03:54 AM] zawy#5864
This strange thing does not apply to rolling averages like inside the loop, but the initial trigger is a random sample of time


[07-Aug-19 03:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i sense a tweak in an equation coming up


[07-Aug-19 03:55 AM] jl777c#5810
line 109 altK = ...


[07-Aug-19 04:02 AM] zawy#5864
üòÉ   So I think we should change this
```if ( ts[1]-ts[W] < T*numerator/denominator )```
to
```if ( (ts[1]-ts[W] * W*100) / (W-1) < T*100*numerator/denominator )```
and
```altK = (K * (nTime-ts[0]) * (ts[0]-ts[W]) * denominator / numerator) / (T * T);```
to
```altK = (K * (nTime-ts[0]) * (ts[0]-ts[W]) * denominator / numerator * W / (W-1)) / (T * T);```


[07-Aug-19 04:03 AM] zawy#5864
If it starts triggering too much, then the first change is wrong


[07-Aug-19 04:03 AM] zawy#5864
and should be reverted


[07-Aug-19 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, adding these changes. i noticed that this condition did not trigger very often at all


[07-Aug-19 04:04 AM] zawy#5864
Even with 6x, you said it     took   5 blocks which was at the upper end of what I expectde, and at    3x      never, which was definitely not what I expected .  It took some really smart math people several years to realize this , and Pieter Wuille has had 2 polls 90% of people missed the answer to based on this


[07-Aug-19 04:05 AM] zawy#5864
If you pick a random time that is 2xT width you will find only 1 block, not 2


[07-Aug-19 04:05 AM] zawy#5864
if you pick 6xT you find 5 blocks


[07-Aug-19 04:08 AM] jl777c#5810
```altK = (K * (nTime-ts[0]) * (ts[0]-ts[W]) * denominator * W)/ (numerator * (W-1) * (T * T));```
just want to make sure this is the same as what you meant


[07-Aug-19 04:08 AM] zawy#5864
yes


[07-Aug-19 04:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i find that minimizing / operations is an old habit, but i like to put in parens as much as possible to avoid any reliance on precedence of operators doing exactly as remembered.

[07-Aug-19 04:12 AM] zawy#5864
When you give me all the CSV data, remind me of how to see what ctB ("on-chain" )value is being used.


[07-Aug-19 04:12 AM] zawy#5864
ok


[07-Aug-19 04:13 AM] jl777c#5810
if the nBits number is odd, then ctB is used, but its value is now calculated only internally, the rpc call doesnt have that data


[07-Aug-19 04:14 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is really important, i can try to externalize the ctB value


[07-Aug-19 04:14 AM] zawy#5864
so 3rd column 1, 3, 5...?


[07-Aug-19 04:14 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[07-Aug-19 04:14 AM] jl777c#5810
1, 3, 5, 7, 9, b, d, f


[07-Aug-19 04:14 AM] jl777c#5810
i only use 1 of the 2 bits now, so we have an extra bit to encode something else if needed


[07-Aug-19 04:15 AM] jl777c#5810
mining started at quarter past the hour


[07-Aug-19 04:15 AM] zawy#5864
It  is the only value the DA is seeing so I need to see ctB[] clearly and use it on my spreadsheet to confirm everything


[07-Aug-19 04:16 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i will extract (or duplicate it and add it to the CSV)


[07-Aug-19 04:25 AM] jl777c#5810
tipdiff for 65 at 260, but altK is almost at 1 million already, miners being unlucky


[07-Aug-19 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
i see the bnTarget was still very difficult as the prior 3 blocks had very close to the same target


[07-Aug-19 04:30 AM] jl777c#5810
so (ct[0] - ct[W]) was very small to begin with


[07-Aug-19 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
so exp() needed to kick in to solve in 577


[07-Aug-19 04:31 AM] jl777c#5810
then 6 second solve of diff 2.2, and a 27 second 3.8 diff


[07-Aug-19 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
what happens if ct[W] is bigger than ct[0] ?


[07-Aug-19 04:32 AM] jl777c#5810
it goes negative. that cant be good


[07-Aug-19 04:34 AM] jl777c#5810
also it seems some implementation issues. the ctB is not adjusting like it should

[07-Aug-19 05:10 AM] jl777c#5810
at least ctB is acting as it should


[07-Aug-19 05:10 AM] zawy#5864
OK, I'm going to do an edit on your file to make all the corerctions for this W-1 effect


[07-Aug-19 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand what happens when ct[0] is very close to ct[W], or if ct[W] is bigger, doenst that mess up the (ct[0] - ct[W])


[07-Aug-19 05:12 AM] jl777c#5810
should that be the average ct[] or sum of?


[07-Aug-19 05:14 AM] zawy#5864
ct[W] bigger than ct[0]?


[07-Aug-19 05:14 AM] zawy#5864
oh crap


[07-Aug-19 05:14 AM] zawy#5864
ct is supposed to be "cumulative targets"  in the loop, not targets


[07-Aug-19 05:15 AM] zawy#5864
Maybe I should not have not used ct[] but only made a tar[]


[07-Aug-19 05:15 AM] zawy#5864
or t[]


[07-Aug-19 05:16 AM] zawy#5864
but then the loop would need another loop to sum W t[]'s


[07-Aug-19 05:19 AM] zawy#5864
So my idea which that I never explained is that you were supposed to create ct[]  of size max(W+past+2)  from the targets before RST.     +2 because of something I need to do with W and to be sure

[07-Aug-19 05:21 AM] jl777c#5810
at least the ctB is working as you want, though not sure why it should be easier on the faster solvetimes


[07-Aug-19 05:24 AM] zawy#5864
It's supposed to be harder.      ST * ST / T /T for ST< T is a smaller target

so I was supposed to tell you the following  this morning instead of ctA and ctB which would have revealed what seems to be a big problem in my lack of communication about what ct[] is.  
``` tB[i] = tA[i]* (( ts[i]  - ts[i+1] ) * ( ts[i]  - ts[i+1] ) * 1000 /T/T/784 ```
where ``` tA[i] = ctA[i] - ctA[i+1]```


[07-Aug-19 05:25 AM] zawy#5864
Well, "i" needs to be back in time, so my ts[i] above is backwards


[07-Aug-19 05:26 AM] zawy#5864
OK, that's corrected


[07-Aug-19 05:27 AM] jl777c#5810
so longer times to make the ctB easier target (higher value)


[07-Aug-19 05:28 AM] zawy#5864
yes


[07-Aug-19 05:28 AM] jl777c#5810
and shorter times to make the ctB harder target (lower value)


[07-Aug-19 05:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont understand why, but will make the change


[07-Aug-19 05:31 AM] zawy#5864
yes, but     lets     make sure we haven't had a big mis-communication.  tB[] as defined above should be used in all parts of the DA.   ctA and ctB need to be created  at the beginning of the DA so that tB[] can be used in the DA.    do BTC/zcash block chains use 1 / (cumulative target) or  cumulative difficulty to measure chain work?


[07-Aug-19 05:32 AM] zawy#5864
or maybe tA[] and tB[] are not needed in the DA anywhere if it always uses ctB[i] - ctB[i+1]


[07-Aug-19 05:33 AM] zawy#5864
I mean somehow we must be approximately on the same page or ersults would be really bad


[07-Aug-19 05:34 AM] zawy#5864
What is digishield using?  A subtraction of cumulative targets or a sum of targets?


[07-Aug-19 05:38 AM] jl777c#5810
digishield is using the sum of ct[], which is the bnTarget or the ctB if RST was active


[07-Aug-19 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
the chain work is using only the actual bnTargets as the ctB[] is ephemerial in RAM only during mining diff calc


[07-Aug-19 05:39 AM] zawy#5864
ok, in my mind, the previous bnTarget  = ctB[0]-ctB[1]


[07-Aug-19 05:40 AM] zawy#5864
If that's not how the code is doing it, I don't nkow how anything's coming out right


[07-Aug-19 05:43 AM] zawy#5864
I mean that is the previous  bnTarget that I have been thinking is  used in the DA.....my understanding is that you have been putting the RST output (or digi or exp)   directly on chain


[07-Aug-19 05:43 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, what is onchain is the actual RST or digishield target which was solved


[07-Aug-19 05:44 AM] zawy#5864
so in my terminology, previous  bnTargetA = tA[0] = ctA[0] - ctA[1]


[07-Aug-19 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but if you go ctB[0] - ctB[W] there is no assurance that ctB[W] is less than ct[0]


[07-Aug-19 05:44 AM] jl777c#5810
each blocks bnTarget is derived from its nBits


[07-Aug-19 05:45 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no summing of all prior nBits at this level


[07-Aug-19 05:46 AM] zawy#5864
ct is cumulative targets  it can never be higher in the past


[07-Aug-19 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
that is what ct meant!


[07-Aug-19 05:46 AM] jl777c#5810
it is just bnTargets[] for now


[07-Aug-19 05:47 AM] zawy#5864
yeah, see how bad I've been in communicating...


[07-Aug-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so when you say ct[0] - ct[W] you actually mean ct[0] + ct[1] + ct[2] ?


[07-Aug-19 05:47 AM] jl777c#5810
when W is 3


[07-Aug-19 05:48 AM] zawy#5864
yes


[07-Aug-19 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, fixing. i should have asked what "ct" meant and would have caught this sooner


[07-Aug-19 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is totally wrong, yet still working halfway decently!


[07-Aug-19 05:48 AM] zawy#5864
I should have told you to read all my code comments very carefully


[07-Aug-19 05:49 AM] zawy#5864
it's only mentioned in 1 place what ct is


[07-Aug-19 05:49 AM] zawy#5864
yeah, I have not idea how it's even close


[07-Aug-19 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
(ct[0] - ct[1]) is just the last bnTarget


[07-Aug-19 05:50 AM] zawy#5864
yes....but it should be the corrected one when used anywhere in the da


[07-Aug-19 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i update the ct[] array at the very first. all calcs use the original bnTarget or the RST adjusted


[07-Aug-19 05:51 AM] zawy#5864
OK, while you're correct that disaster I'll work on W/W-1


[07-Aug-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
restarted ZAWY18


[07-Aug-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i only saw 2 places that did the ct[] - ct[]


[07-Aug-19 05:56 AM] zawy#5864
OK, undo my W/W-1 changes


[07-Aug-19 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
before we get new results?


[07-Aug-19 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i wasnt seeing it trigger that often


[07-Aug-19 05:58 AM] jl777c#5810
W-1 changes just affect the initial test and that seemed to trigger rarely. oh, i can set the other bit so we can see which part of RST is active


[07-Aug-19 05:58 AM] zawy#5864
hmmm, i don't see that you made that chage


[07-Aug-19 05:59 AM] jl777c#5810
line 105


[07-Aug-19 05:59 AM] jl777c#5810
nSPV branch


[07-Aug-19 06:00 AM] zawy#5864
yeah, undo 105 and 109


[07-Aug-19 06:00 AM] jl777c#5810
ii loop triggered on 64


[07-Aug-19 06:00 AM] zawy#5864
and restart


[07-Aug-19 06:00 AM] zawy#5864
are you at T=30


[07-Aug-19 06:00 AM] jl777c#5810
ok


[07-Aug-19 06:00 AM] jl777c#5810
T is 60


[07-Aug-19 06:00 AM] zawy#5864
OK


[07-Aug-19 06:01 AM] zawy#5864
whew...I'm glad the ct[] stuff wasn't so hard to fix


[07-Aug-19 06:06 AM] zawy#5864
selecting chain tip must be based on work determined by ctB


[07-Aug-19 06:06 AM] jl777c#5810
restarted


[07-Aug-19 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
what if we just put onchain the ctB?


[07-Aug-19 06:07 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, but then we end up where what was mined wont match what the diff is...


[07-Aug-19 06:08 AM] jl777c#5810
possible to do, but a bit more messy. more like the original implementation was, all offchain


[07-Aug-19 06:08 AM] zawy#5864
right, you previously realized that


[07-Aug-19 06:08 AM] zawy#5864
which is why you didn't do it which is what I was arguing for


[07-Aug-19 06:09 AM] zawy#5864
I was just thinking about the consequences and figured we could keep it your way as long as chain work is corrected instead of the validation process.  One of the two has to do the correction


[07-Aug-19 06:10 AM] jl777c#5810
to make chain selection based on ctB would be possible, would just need to recalculate the bnTargets used in the chainwork calc. never changed that code before, so not sure just what i would be up against


[07-Aug-19 06:11 AM] zawy#5864
if you redid the nBits compression, you could get both targets in the 4 bytes


[07-Aug-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems that is an optimization to prevent some attack scenarios, but it feels too complex to understand just how a miner would be able to take advatange of this easily, especially if there is a notarization every 10 blocks


[07-Aug-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i already did the nBits encoding, so it is possible to figure out what bnTarget was used


[07-Aug-19 06:12 AM] zawy#5864
You need 1 byte to determine the number the 2^(1 byte) exponent and 1 byte for the significant figure


[07-Aug-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
why not do it like now? just call the zawy_ctB(bnTarget,solvetime) function


[07-Aug-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
so the bnTarget to use is zawy_ctB is the lowest two bits are non-zero in nBits


[07-Aug-19 06:13 AM] jl777c#5810
i just need to make sure the chainwork logic uses this


[07-Aug-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
but it doesnt affect the mining algo, so it seems it can be done after the algo stabilizes

odds are RST?


[07-Aug-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
if the second hash value is non-zero, RST activated


[07-Aug-19 06:51 AM] zawy#5864
ok


[07-Aug-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
if all 0s, then just digishield. it corresponds to odd/even


[07-Aug-19 06:51 AM] jl777c#5810
those three fast blocks 12, 4, 4 got it triggered for a very hard target, exp() coming to the rescue


[07-Aug-19 06:53 AM] zawy#5864
the initial trigger seems to have stopped by ht 68 which means it should not have triggered on 72 if my -2 correction were right


[07-Aug-19 06:53 AM] zawy#5864
i mean 70


[07-Aug-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810

[07-Aug-19 06:54 AM] zawy#5864
ok


[07-Aug-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
since the digishield calc is based on the ctB, which goes "backwards" as far as raising the diff while slowing things down, the digishield target seems like it is becoming very volatile


[07-Aug-19 06:55 AM] zawy#5864
that is higher than it should be, and we need to figure out why 70 was activated


[07-Aug-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe i need to feed the inverse ctB into digishield


[07-Aug-19 06:56 AM] zawy#5864
I need to thnik about why 659 is high.  Yuo can try to find out why 70 triggered


[07-Aug-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
ht.70 was the ii loop


[07-Aug-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
j.19 ii.18


[07-Aug-19 06:57 AM] zawy#5864
yes, but the block before it was all zeros so inner loop should not have even been tried.  The pre-loop could have been calculated, btu the sum of 3 was < T/2


[07-Aug-19 06:58 AM] zawy#5864
the trigger stops if inner loop  stops being activated which is seen by all zeros....then outer trigger needs to first occur, then on next block inner loop applies for 1 or more blocks


[07-Aug-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no knowledge of whether RST was active or not in the loop


[07-Aug-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
am i supposed to disable activation if the prior blocks didnt have RST active?


[07-Aug-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
there is already an array of active/inactive for all the blocks


[07-Aug-19 06:59 AM] zawy#5864
in j loop sum of last 5 shold be < T/2 which is looking for a prior pre-loop trigger


[07-Aug-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
from the nBits


[07-Aug-19 07:00 AM] jl777c#5810
sum of 3


[07-Aug-19 07:00 AM] zawy#5864
ahh, yes, so the loop can be simplifed


[07-Aug-19 07:00 AM] jl777c#5810
ts[j]-ts[j+W]


[07-Aug-19 07:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the ii loop is confusing to me


[07-Aug-19 07:06 AM] jl777c#5810
it does seem to trigger if there were fast blocks in the past


[07-Aug-19 07:06 AM] zawy#5864
since there's something wrong with it i need to look at...now


[07-Aug-19 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
there is a zflags[] array, which if nonzero means RST was used and the ctB is in the ct[]


[07-Aug-19 07:07 AM] jl777c#5810
if zflags[j] is 0 the ct[j] is digishield


[07-Aug-19 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
i hope that allows you to define a logic that is easier to understand, current one seems very tricky


[07-Aug-19 07:12 AM] zawy#5864
if a nonzero occurs (blocks emission was corrected) inner loop should stop and not activate again until outer trigger......outer trigger needs a ctB value too which I guess means it is also an all zeros block.  So if a sequence of all zeros stops, then inner loop is not attempted until outer calculation was trigger, and it goes to inner loop only on the next block, but only if the 1 outer trigger did not slow it up so much that emission was corrected.  In other words if outer trigger caused > 2.5 to 3xT delay, inner loop will not be activated on next block


[07-Aug-19 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
let me try to restate.
it seems that you have two separate states. outer trigger happened or not. lets start with a quiet state where nothing has happened. in this case the inner loop should never happen.
once the outer trigger happens, then on the following block(s) the inner triggers will only happen as long as the block emissions from the outertrigger to current is still below what it should be. once that happens, it goes to a quiet state again?


[07-Aug-19 07:15 AM] zawy#5864
maybe that -2 needed to stay -1


[07-Aug-19 07:17 AM] jl777c#5810
so at a given height, we scan zflags to find the first time the outertrigger happened. any non-triggered block will stop the ii loop as that would have meant that it did catch up


[07-Aug-19 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i can encode the outer trigger in a separate bit from the loop trigger to make it easy to do this. it seems we can just scan from current height


[07-Aug-19 07:18 AM] jl777c#5810
this above logic is not what is happening now


[07-Aug-19 07:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it almost seems that if any fast sequence happened in the past window, it would trigger


[07-Aug-19 07:19 AM] zawy#5864
first 0 block does not even go into j.  Block after first 0 goes to j.   After first 0, outer equation is not applied until inner loops stop.  after inner loop stops, outer must be triggered first


[07-Aug-19 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a mutually exclusive 3 states


[07-Aug-19 07:20 AM] jl777c#5810
digishield only, outer trigger opened, then a bunch of ii loops (starting next block if needed), until it is happy


[07-Aug-19 07:21 AM] jl777c#5810
D, D, D, O, I, I, I, D, ... where D digishield, O outertrigger, I ii loop


[07-Aug-19 07:22 AM] zawy#5864
yes


[07-Aug-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
it always needs to follow a sequence like that. maybe there are no I at all, if the first O did the job


[07-Aug-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, I will implement this tri-state logic


[07-Aug-19 07:22 AM] jl777c#5810
will take a bit to add encoding for the O vs I


[07-Aug-19 07:23 AM] zawy#5864
you can allow for possibility of D O I I O but if I stops, I do not see how O will be able to trigger on next block


[07-Aug-19 07:23 AM] zawy#5864
Because i stoping means last 3 were at least > 3xT


[07-Aug-19 07:24 AM] zawy#5864
unless on that exact i block, a very big miner jumps on, then maybe O can trigger again


[07-Aug-19 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i think once i make things mutually exclusive and following the state transitions, DOO might be theoretically possible, but extremely unlikely


[07-Aug-19 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
DOIIIDOID type of sequences being more likely


[07-Aug-19 07:25 AM] zawy#5864
no,  OO should not happen


[07-Aug-19 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
O without I can happen


[07-Aug-19 07:25 AM] zawy#5864
I is substantially more aggressive


[07-Aug-19 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so if OIO can happen, then OO could ( as far as the statemachine is concerned)


[07-Aug-19 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
if the math prevents it, then even though it is legal state transition,it will never happen


[07-Aug-19 07:26 AM] zawy#5864
O gives it 1 more chance to be an accident before increasing a lot....and for 2 more blocks into I it is not at the full potential if it was an accident


[07-Aug-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i am just saying what the legal states could be, ignoring the trigger mechanics


[07-Aug-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
so if last block was a D, O is the only possibility


[07-Aug-19 07:26 AM] zawy#5864
If can be coded for OO but I should overwrite the 2nd O


[07-Aug-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
if the last block was O, then I or D are the only possibilities


[07-Aug-19 07:27 AM] zawy#5864
yes


[07-Aug-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
if last block is I, then I or D are the only possibilities


[07-Aug-19 07:27 AM] jl777c#5810
or is O possible, i guess O might be possible but wont due to math


[07-Aug-19 07:27 AM] zawy#5864
again, it might be possible for oio, but seems very unlikely


[07-Aug-19 07:28 AM] zawy#5864
and it is appropriate if it does


[07-Aug-19 07:28 AM] zawy#5864
so allowing it seems good


[07-Aug-19 07:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i could prevent it at the state machine level, but it sounds like after I, all three can happen


[07-Aug-19 07:28 AM] zawy#5864
this is all actually what I thought it was, and it might function like this if i replace -2 back to -1


[07-Aug-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it does, but to me i cant figure out what it does by looking at the code.


[07-Aug-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
let me code it so it does what you want in a way i can understand the code.


[07-Aug-19 07:29 AM] zawy#5864
oh, yeah, the -2 messed things up


[07-Aug-19 07:30 AM] zawy#5864
yeah, it needs you too so  at least 1 person understands it instead of 0 persons


[07-Aug-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
üòÉ


[07-Aug-19 07:31 AM] zawy#5864
I mean I understand what i want but you see it's been difficult to make the loops do it.  Our eyeballs look at past solvetiems and immiedately know where D needs to go....so all this is really copying what is so easy intuitively, but what no one so far has been able to incorporate into a DA


[07-Aug-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
the code just needs to have whatever data it needs to allow it to be coded simply enough that anybody can understand what the code is doing, simple C


[07-Aug-19 07:32 AM] jl777c#5810
give me an hour for this, i think i know what needs to be done now


[07-Aug-19 07:33 AM] zawy#5864

```            origtarget = bnTarget;
            past = 20;
            if ( zflags[0] == 0 )
            {
                bnTarget = RT_CST_RST_outer(height,pblock->nTime,bnTarget,ts,ct,1,2,3,past);
                if ( bnTarget < origtarget )
                    zawyflag = 2;
            }
            else
            {
                for (i=1; i<past; i++)
                    if ( (zflags[i] & 2) != 0 )
                        break;
                if ( i < past )
                {
                    bnTarget = RT_CST_RST_inner(height,pblock->nTime,bnTarget,ts,ct,1,2,3,past,i);
                    if ( bnTarget != origtarget )
                        zawyflag = 1;
                }
            }
```


[07-Aug-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810
above is what i think achieves the mutual exclusiveness. zflags[0] being 0 means last block was digishield, so we check to see if the outer trigger happened and if so mark it with a 2


[07-Aug-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is non-zero we scan to the past looking for the outer trigger and that is the block that came from this instance of the outer trigger


[07-Aug-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
the RT_CST_RST_outer function is just the same if statement that is currently there


[07-Aug-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
but not 100% sure what the RT_CST_RST_inner condition should be. we know when the outer was triggered, do we just see if the blocktimes from outer+W to now is > T ?


[07-Aug-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
that would mean that the block emissions from the start of the blocks that initiated the trigger (W past the trigger block) to now is back to an average of T


[07-Aug-19 07:46 AM] jl777c#5810
that at least makes sense intuitively, but i see the trigger is based on a W block window. so maybe i need to scan all the blocks from when the outer trigger happened? but in that case it would never stop until the outer trigger goes beyond the past window


[07-Aug-19 07:47 AM] jl777c#5810
i will code the outer function first as that is clear


[07-Aug-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810
is there any reason the outer RST calc uses ct[0] and not digishield bnTarget for the current height


[07-Aug-19 07:55 AM] zawy#5864
RSt needs to avoid using Digishiel'ds output


[07-Aug-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
ok


[07-Aug-19 07:55 AM] zawy#5864
it needs to figure the current hashrate on its own


[07-Aug-19 07:56 AM] zawy#5864
well, especially since it needs RST's previous output without digisheild diluting it for the current block


[07-Aug-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so now i just need to know the keep alive trigger for the inner RST


[07-Aug-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
given outer trigger happened at outeri


[07-Aug-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
is it if ( (ts[0] - ts[outeri+W]) < (outeri+W) * T )


[07-Aug-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
that would fit the "block production is back to normal" test

    return(bnTarget);
}```


[07-Aug-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
inner is the bnTarget calc function inside the test for normal block rate


[07-Aug-19 08:11 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it needs to use the sum of all targets to outeri+W


[07-Aug-19 08:12 AM] zawy#5864
i if   sum3 < T/2
o if prev block was i or o and if  sum (snice the very first block that triggered i)  is > N * T where N is blocks back to that i....which keeps it on track
o overwrites i.  it does not overwite initial i because the block before that was D


[07-Aug-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
```    if ( (ts[0] - ts[outeri+W]) < (outeri+W)*T || (ts[0] - ts[W]) < T/2 )```


[07-Aug-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
using numerator/denominator to get T/2


[07-Aug-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
so if either the most recent W blocks are fast, or if it is still not back to a block per minute since the outer trigger, the inner keeps on activating


[07-Aug-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810
we need both that the most recent 3 are > T/2 and cumulative blocks since outeri being T


[07-Aug-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
but shouldnt it recoup from outeri+W?


[07-Aug-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise it wont make up the deficit of the three blocks that triggered this


[07-Aug-19 08:17 AM] zawy#5864
No, i is not either sum3 <T/2    OR     sumT < T * N, but it is if  previous block was i or o AND sumT < T * N


[07-Aug-19 08:17 AM] jl777c#5810
the inner function is only called if the prior block was O or I


[07-Aug-19 08:18 AM] zawy#5864
that sum3 < T/2 was in my inner function, but only as a hard way of detecting if all previous blocks back to an original i were an o


[07-Aug-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
then my original if was correct


[07-Aug-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
``` if ( (ts[0] - ts[outeri+W]) < (outeri+W)*T )```


[07-Aug-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
that makes sure solvetime average is >= T since the W blocks that trigger the outer


[07-Aug-19 08:19 AM] zawy#5864
as long as outeri is  referring to the first block in the sum3 trigger


[07-Aug-19 08:19 AM] zawy#5864
I mean the block before that one


[07-Aug-19 08:20 AM] zawy#5864
But you have the idea


[07-Aug-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
outeri is when the outer was triggered, and outer triggers looking at W blocks, so it seems it is outeri + W is the start of the fast blocks


[07-Aug-19 08:20 AM] jl777c#5810
the actual bnTarget calc shouldnt just use ct[0] + ct[1] + ct[2] though


[07-Aug-19 08:21 AM] jl777c#5810
it might be 12 blocks of slowness, maybe do a min(W, outeri+W), ie calculate it both ways and use whichever is more difficult


[07-Aug-19 08:27 AM] zawy#5864
The whole point is to use very small number....I originally was trying to jump based on on the previous block.  The point of using tipdiff and all the trouble of getting the targets correct is so that only 3 previous blocks are needed, which in normal DAs would be unthinkably fast, getting stuck too much


[07-Aug-19 08:27 AM] zawy#5864
If this does not correct for 1E6 attacks in 10 blocks, I'll be confused


[07-Aug-19 08:29 AM] zawy#5864
it should sdo this without triggernig exp()


[07-Aug-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, so using the min() of W and outeri+W based calc would seem to still use the most recent 3 most of the time as they will most likely be the most difficult, but covers the case that some luck based fluctuation makes it so the cumulative is more difficult


[07-Aug-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
makes sense to me that if we want to be raising diff, to use the min()


[07-Aug-19 08:29 AM] jl777c#5810
code is updated


[07-Aug-19 08:30 AM] zawy#5864
i is always exactly 6x more aggressive than o.


[07-Aug-19 08:45 AM] zawy#5864
They might be combined into a single equation that will be more aggressive in the 2nd and 3rd blocks:  
```
nbT = avg(W ct) * avg(W st's) * current st *  denom/numer * (3, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1 ....)
```


[07-Aug-19 08:45 AM] zawy#5864
more aggressive than curernt method, but same on 1st and 3rd blocks


[07-Aug-19 08:47 AM] zawy#5864
Actually it's more like this:  
```
nbT = avg(W ct) * avg(W st's) * current st *  denom/numer / (1, 2, 3, ... W, W, W)
```


[07-Aug-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
need to get the state transitions working. was easier to require a digishield block before allowing O


[07-Aug-19 08:53 AM] zawy#5864
It seems like you still have to do the inner loop


[07-Aug-19 08:53 AM] zawy#5864
And like I'm saying, that equation could be the i and o equations combined


[07-Aug-19 08:54 AM] zawy#5864
you just have to find the distance back to the first trigger in the unbroken sequence


[07-Aug-19 08:55 AM] zawy#5864
Then apply my last equation above where 1, 2, 3, is 1, 2, 3 blocks into the trigger state


[07-Aug-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, first let me get the I state working, for some reason it isnt triggering when it should yet. i just use the first 3 blocks after outeri?


[07-Aug-19 08:58 AM] zawy#5864
what is outeri?


[07-Aug-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
the block that triggered the outer check


[07-Aug-19 09:00 AM] zawy#5864
first i is 
ts[0]-ts[outeri+w-1] 
 2nd is 
ts[0]-ts[outeri+w-2]


[07-Aug-19 09:00 AM] zawy#5864
and so on


[07-Aug-19 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so then there is the set of cumulative solvetimes for the entire range


[07-Aug-19 09:01 AM] jl777c#5810
average them all?


[07-Aug-19 09:02 AM] zawy#5864
1/W


[07-Aug-19 09:02 AM] zawy#5864
yes


[07-Aug-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
1/(outeri+W) ?


[07-Aug-19 09:03 AM] zawy#5864
see my last equation about and I think it will help enlighten what this thing is doing


[07-Aug-19 09:03 AM] zawy#5864
oh, no, misubnderstood your question


[07-Aug-19 09:04 AM] zawy#5864
you don't need to average, yuo already showed the correct check   
``` if ( (ts[0] - ts[outeri+W]) < (outeri+W)*T )```
The inner equation is only averaging W st's


[07-Aug-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
current version has a bug with seeing the first O, but from when it activates it seems to be doing reasonably well:

[07-Aug-19 09:09 AM] jl777c#5810
819 seconds over last 16 blocks vs T of 960


[07-Aug-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
now it is triggering in a way i can understand


[07-Aug-19 09:11 AM] zawy#5864
it looks like it's jumping up and down too much.   If there's not any error in the implementation, we may need to go back to your method by removing one of the solvetimes/T from the target adjusment


[07-Aug-19 09:11 AM] zawy#5864
but that's kind of a last resort....i want my math to be correct so we're not guessing


[07-Aug-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
1115 vs 1320, not closing the final gap


[07-Aug-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
but diff is up to 20!


[07-Aug-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
exp never triggered


[07-Aug-19 09:14 AM] zawy#5864
it did seem bizarre that my math was saying the actual target for 3xT was 4x easier.....intuitively, it still seems like the miner's hashrate is about 2x higher than the target implies, so it seems like my original ctB = ctA/2 is what it should be


[07-Aug-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
and it reached end of past


[07-Aug-19 09:15 AM] zawy#5864
how far back do you check for the original i?


[07-Aug-19 09:15 AM] jl777c#5810
within past (20 blocks)


[07-Aug-19 09:16 AM] zawy#5864
OK, let me see the rest of the blocks and let me think about it before youtweak


[07-Aug-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
the first outer trigger slowed the blocks down while the diff adjusted to where it should be


[07-Aug-19 09:17 AM] zawy#5864
I need to see all the blocks from at least 44

[07-Aug-19 09:19 AM] zawy#5864
can you modify the script to output target in decimal?


[07-Aug-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
sure. decimal in tenths, so just remove the . ?


[07-Aug-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
i saw a case where the outer triggered, but it couldnt be solved, so it was as if it didnt happen. i will add a special case for that to make sure if outer triggers, it will at least keep the bnTarget twice as difficult


[07-Aug-19 09:46 AM] zawy#5864
it's rpetty remarkable to have that and the solvetimes come out reasonably well


[07-Aug-19 09:46 AM] jl777c#5810
i think now it is finally working close to the way you envisioned it. no idea what it was doing before


[07-Aug-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i am seeing the time that it needs to make up and think maybe if that isnt shrinking, we can go more aggressive

averaging with previous one would smooth it out pretty well


[07-Aug-19 09:51 AM] zawy#5864
The last 3 are averaged already. This is the most difficult case to get right.  I want to do it from theory before any tweaking


[07-Aug-19 09:51 AM] zawy#5864
I expected it to be right in 4 blocks


[07-Aug-19 09:51 AM] zawy#5864
I mean, at block 68


[07-Aug-19 09:52 AM] zawy#5864
I mean 71


[07-Aug-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
problem i am seeing is that when the miners get lucky and quickly solve a high diff, it gets things a bit confused. there is a bug in the code with the early blocks


[07-Aug-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
until you see the RST activated in 2 or more, it seems it isnt working right in the state machine. my next run had the same problem with an isolated O at 65, and no I after, even though it should. not a problem with the math


[07-Aug-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it isnt catching up due to some crazy fast solves


[07-Aug-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i want to make the min diff increase get stricter based on the time deficit


[07-Aug-19 09:54 AM] zawy#5864
Actually, I cheated a little on that target adjustment......it's supposed to be a little slow catching up


[07-Aug-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i know the math is doing that, but if it isnt working, it needs more diff


[07-Aug-19 09:54 AM] zawy#5864
because I didn't let the math make it as difficult as much as it should be


[07-Aug-19 09:55 AM] zawy#5864
No, i deviated from the math a little to give the simple ctB adjustment....it deviates from that equation on the fast solves....let me look at the error.


[07-Aug-19 09:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i think it needs to be 50% more difficult and it should work very well


[07-Aug-19 09:56 AM] zawy#5864
OK, but I need to see good data.  Is that bug affecting what I see up to ht 92?   Can you give me all data back to 44?


[07-Aug-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
the next test run is almost done, i will get you complete data


[07-Aug-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
still has an inner detection bug, but other than the pre-68 blocks , i think it worked pretty well, against a 15 core mining


[07-Aug-19 09:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but a few lucky solves (6 seconds for 100 diff) made it fall behind and it couldnt catch up.


[07-Aug-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
diff is climbing and it is making slow progress, so that is fantastic


[07-Aug-19 09:59 AM] zawy#5864
solves faster than 6 seconds are where I cheated on the math


[07-Aug-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
but with 20 blocks i dont think it will close the remaining gap


[07-Aug-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
130 seconds to catch up, only 2 blocks to go


[07-Aug-19 10:03 AM] zawy#5864
Oh no, the equation adjustment is correct

I want W=3 to correct 1e6 attacks in   about 10  blocks.  It should go out of triggered state and revert to digishield, possibly even without triggering exp() due to the solvetime*solvetime.....which I just realized is like you were doing.  The difference is that solvetime is not just tipdiff, but tipdiff * recent solves.


[07-Aug-19 10:11 AM] zawy#5864
So if my math is correct, we have a proper way of using t^2


[07-Aug-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
probably it works much better for the 1E6 cases, than the 5x to 15x


[07-Aug-19 10:12 AM] zawy#5864
I need to fuigure out why it's not catching up better


[07-Aug-19 10:12 AM] zawy#5864
did you delete a CSV file?


[07-Aug-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem when it doesnt trigger is that it only has the turtle slow digishield, so by not adjusting the diff all the way during the inner RST, it ends up in a very bad place to rely on digishield


[07-Aug-19 10:13 AM] zawy#5864
oh, there it is


[07-Aug-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
mining.csv file is still there


[07-Aug-19 10:13 AM] zawy#5864
yeah, that's fine because once we get this right, W=6 and 12 should automatically correct


[07-Aug-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
i will add a panic factor to see if i can get it to converge faster while you work out the magic math


[07-Aug-19 10:14 AM] zawy#5864
Just change the divide by 3 to 4


[07-Aug-19 10:14 AM] zawy#5864
in i


[07-Aug-19 10:15 AM] zawy#5864
that will make it 33% harder


[07-Aug-19 10:15 AM] jl777c#5810
so (W+1) instead of W


[07-Aug-19 10:15 AM] zawy#5864
yes


[07-Aug-19 10:15 AM] zawy#5864
hmmm


[07-Aug-19 10:15 AM] zawy#5864
that's sort of like (W-1)/W


[07-Aug-19 10:15 AM] zawy#5864
but I'm not supposed to do that on rolling average


[07-Aug-19 10:32 AM] zawy#5864
The average of the 20 blocks was 57 seconds.  I just realized the math I used to write the equation was just to find the correct difficulty, not to catch up.  This is perfect......now we can decide how fast we want it to catch up


[07-Aug-19 10:33 AM] zawy#5864
It's possible that this will have the correct difficulty 2 blocks after 1  million x attack


[07-Aug-19 10:35 AM] zawy#5864
I mean the 5th or 6th block , 2 or 3 blocks after the 3 trigger it


[07-Aug-19 10:36 AM] zawy#5864
exp() may not be needed.  Digi may not be needed.


[07-Aug-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
RST seems like it matches how people look at solvetimes


[07-Aug-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
i like a 100% RST to calculate bnTarget for all blocks


[07-Aug-19 10:41 AM] zawy#5864
since it changes difficulty during the block, and it only needs 3 past blocks it's a lot smarter than people can be.


[07-Aug-19 10:42 AM] zawy#5864
Maybe W=4 is smoother will be less insane


[07-Aug-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, any single block can do stuff like solve a 1000 diff in 9 seconds


[07-Aug-19 10:43 AM] zawy#5864
This makes my warnings more serious.  Miners coming at the end of a block and messing with even 2-second difference in due to FTL  open  up loopholes


[07-Aug-19 10:44 AM] zawy#5864
Let me give example


[07-Aug-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
i understand


[07-Aug-19 10:45 AM] jl777c#5810
but the diff change over 2 seconds is not that bad. more concerned with backdating and gaining a lot


[07-Aug-19 10:46 AM] zawy#5864
Big miner capable of solveing a T= 4  will assign a T=2 which will make next difficulty 4x easier than his hashrate ....but it responds so fast....I'm not sure it's much of a problem.  The big risk is miners coming on for only 1 or 2 blocks and leaving for 1 or 2 blocks


[07-Aug-19 10:47 AM] zawy#5864
but it's so amazing somone has to give this a try


[07-Aug-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
i think we are well on the way to solving the DAA problem


[07-Aug-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
my next test run is catching up faster, just 90 seconds to make up, though only 3 blocks to do it in


[07-Aug-19 10:49 AM] zawy#5864
necessity is the monther of invention.  If you had not had such large problems, we would not have been pushed to work so hard


[07-Aug-19 10:50 AM] zawy#5864
The two equations can be reduced to 1.  That means when we make a tweak, the consequences do not have different effects in different areas.


[07-Aug-19 10:52 AM] zawy#5864
I can make it migrate to more stability.  W can be slowly increased if solvetime stays accurate


[07-Aug-19 10:53 AM] zawy#5864
then as solvetime has an error, W goes back to being small.  changing the 3 to 4 factor can be precisely determined without having to use our opinion


[07-Aug-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
found and fixed the detection of O state. was a silly off by one.


[07-Aug-19 10:54 AM] zawy#5864
so even when you;re very careful.... about those


[07-Aug-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
this test run should have clean data


[07-Aug-19 10:54 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, you have to be very careful and still verify each and every if statement is doing what you thought it would


[07-Aug-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why even after writing millions of lines of C code, i dont try to get it perfect the first time


[07-Aug-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
it never is


[07-Aug-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
get close and iterate is the only way


[07-Aug-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
otherwise you end up with thousands of lines of code and a bug(s) somewhere in there, but no idea where so finding it becomes a project in and of itself

yes, that's the one


[07-Aug-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
i think past of 20 is too short, the diff isnt adjusting to where it needs to be and it will end up in a bad place. my time deficit based tweaks seems to be working fine, of course it probably messes up the math a bit. I calculate a factor based on the number of T the time deficit is, should be 0, 1, 2 or 3


[07-Aug-19 11:13 AM] jl777c#5810
then if >=1 make the mindiff a bit more difficult


[07-Aug-19 11:14 AM] zawy#5864
you mean too short for digishield to take over?


[07-Aug-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
also if factor is 2 or more, to make the target 0.667, ie 50% more difficult


[07-Aug-19 11:14 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, 20 wont have the diff adjusted enough and digishield will need to take over and it wont trigger as it is within a factor of 2x


[07-Aug-19 11:15 AM] zawy#5864
You don't want to replace digishield?


[07-Aug-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
not today


[07-Aug-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe tomorrow


[07-Aug-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
just make it always triggered?


[07-Aug-19 11:16 AM] zawy#5864
Actually, 17 should be enough for digishield.


[07-Aug-19 11:16 AM] zawy#5864
if the adjusted targets are correct and if digishield uses them


[07-Aug-19 11:17 AM] jl777c#5810
but i think the diff adjustment is inverted for the digishield if we want it to make the effective hashrate


[07-Aug-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
what about if i feed the inverted ct[] into digishield


[07-Aug-19 11:18 AM] zawy#5864
digishield uses targets too


[07-Aug-19 11:18 AM] zawy#5864
I'm not following


[07-Aug-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, if the RST has a ctB as a target


[07-Aug-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
when tipdiff is 4, it is very hard target


[07-Aug-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
as tipdiff goes up, the target gets easier and easier


[07-Aug-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
but whenever it is solved, the average target during the block is ALWAYS harder than what was actually solved


[07-Aug-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
since the solved ctB is the easiest of that block


[07-Aug-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
so to me it only makes sense to feed in higher than ctB into digishield


[07-Aug-19 11:20 AM] jl777c#5810
the closer to 4 tipdiff is when it was solved, the closer the average target was to ctB


[07-Aug-19 11:21 AM] zawy#5864
Digishield should only get ctB[] and that test run i have should have digishield at the correct level at the end of the triggers.....let me do a calculation


[07-Aug-19 11:21 AM] jl777c#5810
case in point, latest test triggered O properly, the I followed properly, but it ended up at diff of 30


[07-Aug-19 11:21 AM] zawy#5864
it appear initial blocks said hashrate needed to be 10x higher

[07-Aug-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
diff is only at 30, instead of 90


[07-Aug-19 11:27 AM] zawy#5864
using ctB for digi gives a target that's 27x more difficult than it should be ..... so I need to think about it


[07-Aug-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
but i am giving ctB to digi if RST was active


[07-Aug-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i wasnt supposed to?


[07-Aug-19 11:29 AM] zawy#5864
yes, you are......I'm just trying to figuer out how to view things based on these runs....my calculation said this would have resulted in Dgigi difficulty being 27x too high, but apparently I'm doing something wrong


[07-Aug-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
let me test my idea


[07-Aug-19 11:48 AM] zawy#5864
There's a small possibility that since I used a linear function instead of a proper possion function  that the 2.72 difference I'm seeing is based on e=2.7182


[07-Aug-19 11:51 AM] zawy#5864
The poisson accicdentally has too many fast solves, so the applification of the estimated difficulty works with the RST but it's wrong adjustment for a "possion based" algorithm like digishield


[07-Aug-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe put a SMA of ct[] into digishield to smooth this out


[07-Aug-19 11:53 AM] zawy#5864
It needs a re-work of the RST.   A patch will be to apply  ctB/2.72 for the RST values that duigishield uses


[07-Aug-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i already have an alternate ct[] array and 2.72 seems like the right factor!


[07-Aug-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so just divide the RST targets by 2.72 and feed that to digishield?


[07-Aug-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
seems so easy

The 4 factor should probably change back to 3 after 3 blocks

But it should not give back the lost blocks like this.  That would be tempting someone to discover a way to send it into bad oscillations.....just losing the blocks seems safer


[07-Aug-19 12:09 PM] zawy#5864
so if the triggers are removed, the inner equation is all you use for a complete DA


[07-Aug-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
exp() feels like a very good safety net and if it is active block production is slow


[07-Aug-19 12:10 PM] zawy#5864
the inner equation just keeps correct solvetime, not trying to make up for too many or too few blocks, just like a regular difficulty algorithm


[07-Aug-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
true, it basically locked onto 60 seconds per block when it was active


[07-Aug-19 12:11 PM] jl777c#5810
but i dont let it make the target easier


[07-Aug-19 12:12 PM] zawy#5864
My TSA ran on top of a basic DA.  Actually, that TSA equation can respond 2x increase in difficulty per block (1E6 in 20)  and no adjustment to targets is needed


[07-Aug-19 12:12 PM] zawy#5864
That's probably the ultimate DA


[07-Aug-19 12:13 PM] zawy#5864
This......  
```
bnTarget = prevTarget*(T+(ST-T)*e^(ST/T) )/ST
```


[07-Aug-19 12:15 PM] jl777c#5810
is ST tipdiff?


[07-Aug-19 12:15 PM] zawy#5864
yes


[07-Aug-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
can we use 3^x?


[07-Aug-19 12:16 PM] zawy#5864
yes


[07-Aug-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
how do to 3^(tipdiff/T) ?


[07-Aug-19 12:17 PM] zawy#5864
you alreayd have it don't you?


[07-Aug-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
some polynomial approx?


[07-Aug-19 12:17 PM] zawy#5864
it's exp silly


[07-Aug-19 12:17 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, just use the zawy_exponential


[07-Aug-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
```bnTarget = prevTarget*(T+(tipdiff-T) * zexp(tipdiff) )/tipdiff```


[07-Aug-19 12:18 PM] zawy#5864
yeah  I'll run some tests to see what the avg solvetime error will be.  There's a slight error in it for an unknown reason when we make it aggressive


[07-Aug-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
seems simple enough, i will make a test for it after this one


[07-Aug-19 12:19 PM] zawy#5864
mult = tipdiff/T


[07-Aug-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the exponential does the /T and %T combining


[07-Aug-19 12:20 PM] zawy#5864
then mult=tipdiff?


[07-Aug-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
fixed


[07-Aug-19 12:20 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems it is all about tipdiff!


[07-Aug-19 12:20 PM] zawy#5864
I'll run some tests on that


[07-Aug-19 12:21 PM] zawy#5864
just a sec....


[07-Aug-19 12:21 PM] zawy#5864
oh, wait, i can't because it's tipdiff


[07-Aug-19 12:21 PM] zawy#5864
But I can do the same with a 1-block delay


[07-Aug-19 12:21 PM] zawy#5864
to kind of get a feel for it.


[07-Aug-19 12:21 PM] zawy#5864
hmmmmm


[07-Aug-19 12:22 PM] zawy#5864
no, this may not work well.


[07-Aug-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
seems too simple


[07-Aug-19 12:22 PM] zawy#5864
prevTarget is going to change too much


[07-Aug-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
so smooth it out a bit?


[07-Aug-19 12:23 PM] zawy#5864
make it avg past 4 targets


[07-Aug-19 12:27 PM] zawy#5864
it might need to be made softer response:


[07-Aug-19 12:29 PM] zawy#5864
use this


[07-Aug-19 12:29 PM] jl777c#5810
what do i do if (tipdiff - T) is negative?


[07-Aug-19 12:29 PM] zawy#5864
```bnTarget = prevTarget*(T+(tipdiff-T) * zexp((tipdiff+1)/2) )/tipdiff```


[07-Aug-19 12:30 PM] zawy#5864
it's supposed to be OK


[07-Aug-19 12:30 PM] zawy#5864
use previous target, and that +1 is to prevent  1/2 from being zero


[07-Aug-19 12:30 PM] jl777c#5810
multiplying a arith_uint256 by negative number -> bad things will happen


[07-Aug-19 12:31 PM] zawy#5864
break it apart?


[07-Aug-19 12:31 PM] zawy#5864
use exp twice


[07-Aug-19 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
the zexp is not the issue


[07-Aug-19 12:32 PM] zawy#5864
you can subtract the negative instead of multiplying it


[07-Aug-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
oh sorry, there is a T+(tipdiff -T)


[07-Aug-19 12:32 PM] jl777c#5810
that can never go below 0


[07-Aug-19 12:32 PM] zawy#5864
my notes say this is the version that does not go below zero if I divide by that 2


[07-Aug-19 12:35 PM] zawy#5864
```bnTarget = (prevT*T + prevT*st*zexp(max(2, st))/2 - prevT*T*zexp(max(2, st))/2 ) ) / st```


[07-Aug-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
but we know tipdiff is always 4 or more


[07-Aug-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
i think we are ok with the original simpler one


[07-Aug-19 12:36 PM] zawy#5864
why is tipdiff 4 or more?


[07-Aug-19 12:37 PM] zawy#5864
here it should be  nTime - TS[0]


[07-Aug-19 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
oh it could be 1, maybe we just set it to 4  if below 4?


[07-Aug-19 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
also T+(tipdiff-T) isnt that just tipdiff?


[07-Aug-19 12:37 PM] zawy#5864
no, this thing will jump around a lot each block.....


[07-Aug-19 12:38 PM] zawy#5864
no 1st T does not have the exp


[07-Aug-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
```bnTarget = prevTarget*(T+(tipdiff-T) * zexp((tipdiff+1)/2) )/tipdiff```


[07-Aug-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
```(T+(tipdiff-T) * zexp((tipdiff+1)/2) )```


[07-Aug-19 12:39 PM] zawy#5864
that's correct....exp is only on 2nd T


[07-Aug-19 12:39 PM] jl777c#5810
that looks like a scalar value


[07-Aug-19 12:40 PM] zawy#5864
i know you don't like the max, but this is what I'd do  ```bnTarget = (prevT*T + prevT*st*zexp(max(2, st))/2 - prevT*T*zexp(max(2, st))/2 ) ) / st```


[07-Aug-19 12:40 PM] zawy#5864
what do you mean scalar?


[07-Aug-19 12:40 PM] zawy#5864
negative problem?


[07-Aug-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
no problem, i can use the new equation. i assume prevT is ct[0], st is tipdiff, then all is well


[07-Aug-19 12:42 PM] zawy#5864
yes


[07-Aug-19 12:45 PM] zawy#5864
RST and this could possibly have an aggressiveness factor that is in proportion to the number of blocks it is getting behind.  In other words the 4 could be a variable based on how far behind it is.


[07-Aug-19 12:47 PM] zawy#5864
In this case, you could change the 2 to a 8  to make it a lot more stable almost like a normal DA and then if blocks start going imporbably fast, you reduce the 8 in proportion to the imprabability, potentially as low as 2.


[07-Aug-19 12:48 PM] zawy#5864
Now, that, finally, is what I think you should do.  If this channel allowed pictures I could show N=2 verses N=8


[07-Aug-19 12:50 PM] zawy#5864
So finally, in the most tortuous way, I'm back to an idea I already had....but I didn;t realize my old "dynamic" difficulty algorithms would finally work good by using tipdiff....which KMD will be the first to do. (other than XCG who soon after went defunct from trying too many things at once and the dev leaving)


[07-Aug-19 12:50 PM] zawy#5864
by soon, I meant I got a few days of TSA data and they were gone


[07-Aug-19 01:01 PM] zawy#5864
This is my dynamic idea, which goes back to Zcash threads in 2016, and EMA which Jacob Eliosoff discovered in 2017 as a possibility for BCH (that I showed him and Tom Harding was actually a really important thing...otherwise it might have gotten lost)  and TSA (which originated from Andrew Stone who showed it to me in BCH mail list).   By being a DA focal point the ideas come.  So  JL  recognized the ideas were legitimate and actually needed in KMD and very importantly he was to implement them so fast.    I was pushing TSA, but everyone said it was too difficult to implement.  It's getting close to a year old, and 2  years old going back to andrew.   A new thing here is that my dynmic ideas were to just notice higher hashrate and respond accordingly.  But here we're talking about responding enough to actively fix emission rate as integral to part of detecting and responding to higher hashrate, so it's symmetry is forced more locally.


[07-Aug-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
starting first test, likely will have some calc issues, and also i just start at height 64 to fit into existing structure. i know it can start at height 5


[07-Aug-19 01:12 PM] zawy#5864
Actually, this EMA is taking 15 blocks to respond to 1000x


[07-Aug-19 01:13 PM] jl777c#5810
i must have the math wrong as it isnt increasing diff

should be exp( st/ 2)


[07-Aug-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
for both?


[07-Aug-19 01:15 PM] zawy#5864
yes


[07-Aug-19 01:15 PM] jl777c#5810
ok fixing


[07-Aug-19 01:16 PM] zawy#5864
it turns the  3^x into 1.73^x


[07-Aug-19 01:17 PM] jl777c#5810
i have it setup so it can toggle between RST and TSA via launch parameters


[07-Aug-19 01:19 PM] zawy#5864
for some reason it's crapping out on me even with 50x attacks, and it greatly overshoots the attack


[07-Aug-19 01:19 PM] zawy#5864
but I'm not using tipdiff, so you might see thing a LOT better


[07-Aug-19 01:20 PM] jl777c#5810
in 3 minutes we will see the initial diffs


[07-Aug-19 01:21 PM] zawy#5864
I first thouht about TSA's EMA replacing RST, but it did nto rise fast enough


[07-Aug-19 01:22 PM] zawy#5864
it can only do 2x per block where RST can do 600


[07-Aug-19 01:24 PM] zawy#5864
If RST has five 1-scond solves in a row, it will be 2E6 higher....but only if you have > 600x on 1st 4 blocks and 2E6 on 5th block


[07-Aug-19 01:24 PM] zawy#5864
That's how powerful it is


[07-Aug-19 01:25 PM] jl777c#5810
even with tipdiff/2 it is not really adjusting


[07-Aug-19 01:26 PM] jl777c#5810
i will go back to RST and make sure i didnt break it with the latest fine tunings


[07-Aug-19 01:26 PM] zawy#5864
arith_uint256(360000);  ?


[07-Aug-19 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the 3^x divided by 360000 and then multiplied by the A*B value


[07-Aug-19 01:27 PM] jl777c#5810
the new function just returns the raw A*B value

            B = bnTarget * arith_uint256(tipdiff * zawy_exponential_val360000(tipdiff/2)) / arith_uint256(360000);
            C = bnTarget * arith_uint256(T * tipdiff * zawy_exponential_val360000(tipdiff/2)) / arith_uint256(360000);

[07-Aug-19 01:29 PM] zawy#5864
tipdiff does not belong next to T in C

            B = bnTarget * arith_uint256(tipdiff * zawy_exponential_val360000(tipdiff/2)) / arith_uint256(360000);
            C = bnTarget * arith_uint256(T * zawy_exponential_val360000(tipdiff/2)) / arith_uint256(360000);
            bnTarget = (A + B - C) * arith_uint256(K*T) / arith_uint256(tipdiff);
```


[07-Aug-19 01:34 PM] jl777c#5810
i scale by K*T so C wont overflow


[07-Aug-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
diff is going up this time, but compared to RST... slowish


[07-Aug-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe can remove the averaging


[07-Aug-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
```            bnTarget = (bnTarget + ct[0] + ct[1] + ct[2]) / arith_uint256(4);```


[07-Aug-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
that probably slows it way down


[07-Aug-19 01:40 PM] zawy#5864
Instead of this EMA, I'm going to work on e^x straght without the rest of it.  I think there might be a lot to gain by replacing RST with  an e^x

diff constantly rising, so that is a good behavior

[07-Aug-19 01:52 PM] zawy#5864
What do you like about it so much?


[07-Aug-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the diff is adjusting very fast


[07-Aug-19 01:53 PM] jl777c#5810
62 diff at 71


[07-Aug-19 01:53 PM] zawy#5864
RST wasn't faster?


[07-Aug-19 01:54 PM] zawy#5864
or did you not fully test it with the 2.72?


[07-Aug-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
RST was bouncing all around so 500 diff and 20 diff


[07-Aug-19 01:54 PM] jl777c#5810
TSA has much smoother response and this is without averaging


[07-Aug-19 01:55 PM] zawy#5864
yeah, this takes long but is more stable.  We could make RSt slower, but generally this one has the other feature of not needingo to mess with targets


[07-Aug-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
i think total deficit wise it might be about the same or a bit worse, but the problem with RST is when it stops


[07-Aug-19 01:55 PM] jl777c#5810
and this one is super simple


[07-Aug-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
i am thinking we can make it converge even faster by taking into account recent solvetimes


[07-Aug-19 01:56 PM] zawy#5864
Like I'm saying RST does nto need to stop and could be W=5, but this one has a purity advantage.  It craps out on me at times, so I need to found out why


[07-Aug-19 01:56 PM] jl777c#5810
and at 60 seconds the diff is unchanged and if it takes longer it makes the diff easier, so it seems to be working


[07-Aug-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
can we combine the attribute of RST of rapidly making up for lost time, with TSA smoothness?


[07-Aug-19 01:57 PM] jl777c#5810
what about simply using the recent implied hashrate?


[07-Aug-19 01:58 PM] jl777c#5810
if the solvetimes indicate there is N times as much hashrate as the bnTarget, then make it N/2 times as hard


[07-Aug-19 01:58 PM] zawy#5864
I don't know if this can be made faster


[07-Aug-19 01:59 PM] zawy#5864
The diff that miners face is jumping around a lot


[07-Aug-19 01:59 PM] zawy#5864
I mean, isn't it?


[07-Aug-19 01:59 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems quite constrained, 2x more diff to start, 1x after T


[07-Aug-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe the range can be increased?


[07-Aug-19 02:00 PM] zawy#5864
I thought the 2.72 fixed the stopping problem


[07-Aug-19 02:00 PM] zawy#5864
once target matches HR, this TSA is supposed to jump around a LOT


[07-Aug-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess we will find out soon


[07-Aug-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
the RST needs a averaging to smooth out the bouncing around of diff


[07-Aug-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
untuned TSA is quite good. i think with some tuning it can get the good parts of RST, it is just using the prev target, which seems very limited info


[07-Aug-19 02:02 PM] jl777c#5810
what about a TSA3 that looks at prev, prev+prev2, prev+prev2+prev3


[07-Aug-19 02:02 PM] zawy#5864
I guess the jumps  I didn't like about it were because it did not use tipdiff........you're going to really like this one once you look at solvetime stbility


[07-Aug-19 02:03 PM] zawy#5864
solvetime will be so close to target you're going to risk collisions


[07-Aug-19 02:03 PM] zawy#5864
I suppose now I can make my TSA article a lot simpler


[07-Aug-19 02:04 PM] zawy#5864
watach...I bet you have only some outside the 45 to 80 second range

hmm, guess i'm wrong


[07-Aug-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
the thing is that i see occasional crazy fast solves


[07-Aug-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
implied hashrate that solves 400 to 1000 diff


[07-Aug-19 02:04 PM] jl777c#5810
just due to randomness


[07-Aug-19 02:04 PM] zawy#5864
oh right..they will follow a slow solve


[07-Aug-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
no, i mean the miners get really lucky sometimes, and also really unlucky sometimes


[07-Aug-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
19 blocks and diff is at 85, which is close to what i think it should be


[07-Aug-19 02:05 PM] zawy#5864
You should only rarely see a > 2.5T which is very common in normal DA


[07-Aug-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but it just had a 15 second solve of a 200 diff, for implied 800


[07-Aug-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
TSA gets exponentially easier the longer it takes?


[07-Aug-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
so it solves the diff stranding too


[07-Aug-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
and its symmetric


[07-Aug-19 02:06 PM] zawy#5864
You should be seeing the green line in this chart

[07-Aug-19 02:09 PM] zawy#5864
That's with T=100


[07-Aug-19 02:10 PM] zawy#5864
So you basically won't hardly see tipdiff > 180


[07-Aug-19 02:10 PM] jl777c#5810
true, so far 134 is the biggest


[07-Aug-19 02:10 PM] zawy#5864
And with this distribution, yuo actually have fewer cllisions because it's not bunched at fast solves as much as regular DAs


[07-Aug-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
is there a way to make it do 10x when tipdiff is small?


[07-Aug-19 02:11 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems only 2x


[07-Aug-19 02:12 PM] zawy#5864
not messing with it is why you don't need to adjust targets


[07-Aug-19 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
that would give it the dynamic range to adjust very fast


[07-Aug-19 02:12 PM] jl777c#5810
talking about messing with the equation üòÉ


[07-Aug-19 02:12 PM] zawy#5864
uh oh


[07-Aug-19 02:12 PM] zawy#5864
yes, you can do it without messing up targets


[07-Aug-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
if it went from 10x at tipdiff 2 to 1x at tipdiff 60


[07-Aug-19 02:13 PM] zawy#5864
If you make it harder on fast solves, you have to make it easier on slower sovles


[07-Aug-19 02:13 PM] zawy#5864
so you can shift the curve to the right


[07-Aug-19 02:13 PM] jl777c#5810
doesnt it get exponentially easier the larger tipdiff gets?


[07-Aug-19 02:14 PM] zawy#5864
no, on both ends it is not as fast as straight simple e^x like the exp() drop


[07-Aug-19 02:14 PM] jl777c#5810
but it seems to start at 2x more difficult take 60 seconds to get to 1x, then i assume eventually will be able to get to 0.001x and smaller


[07-Aug-19 02:15 PM] jl777c#5810
otherwise it couldnt fix a diff stranding


[07-Aug-19 02:16 PM] zawy#5864
I think if you choose an e^x function on the high end, you can use a e^(-x) on the low end and targets might come out OK, but if not    experimentation can determine their exact k constants in e^(kx)


[07-Aug-19 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
need to think about all these results, i feel there is enough here to make a near perfect DAA


[07-Aug-19 02:17 PM] jl777c#5810
fantastic progress today! helps to properly implement things


[07-Aug-19 02:19 PM] zawy#5864
This one's  simple, does not need target work, and is theoretically very sound.      Yuo just need to see how long it will take to respond to 1000x    I myself don't know.....I did    not   check that when that computer was running


[07-Aug-19 02:20 PM] zawy#5864
OH, i'm not sure it can drop like exp()


[07-Aug-19 02:21 PM] zawy#5864
so you'll have an excess coin emission problem if it's not made symmetrical on the high and low ends by shifting to an e^x function


[07-Aug-19 02:22 PM] zawy#5864
i mean excess emission problem if you have to keep exp without making the equal and opposite function on the low end of this


[07-Aug-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
testing a TSA+RST hybrid


[07-Aug-19 02:23 PM] jl777c#5810
basically using TSA instead of digishield


[07-Aug-19 02:23 PM] zawy#5864
With this, you can make e^x weaker and start at 3xT so it merges smoothly with this ,then I can do experiments to find it's symmetrical solution on the low side.  To make 3^x in exp "weaker" use something like the 1/2


[07-Aug-19 02:24 PM] jl777c#5810
will keep the pure TSA chain running


[07-Aug-19 02:25 PM] zawy#5864
I do not think you need to make sure emission stays on track with this....it does it automatically.


[07-Aug-19 02:25 PM] jl777c#5810
how can it by looking at only prevtarget?


[07-Aug-19 02:27 PM] zawy#5864
the blocks after it are automatically penalized....I had to throw in the penalty in RST.  Similarly if you use 3^x on the ends of this to make it faster, I might have to use the RSt trick


[07-Aug-19 02:27 PM] zawy#5864
This EMA is special


[07-Aug-19 02:28 PM] zawy#5864
It's because it's a rolling average in disguise


[07-Aug-19 02:32 PM] zawy#5864
rolling averages make sure the window did not release too many blocks.  EMA is a moving average that gives expontially more weight to the most recent blocks.  Careful math shows how this results in only needing to adjust based on the current block


[07-Aug-19 02:32 PM] jl777c#5810
amazing


[07-Aug-19 02:37 PM] zawy#5864
The memory of the current adjustment lingers in future adjustments because if it was made higher, each of the next few blocks will be higher penalizing the later blocks for what was lost in previous blocks.....but the penalty exponentially decreases, so the big miner staying on a few blocks gets most of the penalty himself


[07-Aug-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
of course! ct[0]


[07-Aug-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
it is like X = (X * 0.9) + (0.1 * newval)


[07-Aug-19 02:39 PM] zawy#5864
It and LWMA are the most common method to estimate current stock price....but this ema is special and exactly like the stock emas.


[07-Aug-19 02:45 PM] zawy#5864
I mean NOT exactly like the one used for stocks


[07-Aug-19 02:47 PM] zawy#5864
After the fact, I found out this specific form was in wikipedia, almost like an interesting after thought applied to electronic equipment production.  Jacob was trying to derive something frmo wikipedia and his intuition, but I don't think he ever realized he had come up with what they showed about 2 sections after he stopped reading.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Application_to_measuring_computer_performance

Moving average
In statistics, a moving average (rolling average or running average) is a calculation to analyze data points by creating a series of averages of different subsets of the full data set. It is also called a moving mean (MM) or rolling mean and is a type of finite impulse respon...

[07-Aug-19 02:47 PM] zawy#5864
Their notation and stuff makes it hard to realize it's the same


[07-Aug-19 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
i have a lot of experience with time series, specifically forex


[07-Aug-19 02:48 PM] zawy#5864
then later tom harding made a simpler EMA and I was able to show them why it was almost exactly the same as Jaconds.


[07-Aug-19 02:48 PM] jl777c#5810
just didnt use such fancy maths with consensus requirements


[07-Aug-19 02:49 PM] zawy#5864
It goes deeper in this application because the poisson distribution is e^x


[07-Aug-19 02:49 PM] jl777c#5810
so basically TSA is a finely tuned magic math, so best to not mess with it


[07-Aug-19 02:49 PM] zawy#5864
it's automatically synmetrical ina  deeper sense than LWMA:  LWMA drops faster than it rises.  EMA rises and falls at the same speed if hashrate is constant


[07-Aug-19 02:50 PM] zawy#5864
EMA is.  TSA is just applying to to tipdiff


[07-Aug-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
you dont think TSA applied to more data points wont do better?


[07-Aug-19 02:50 PM] jl777c#5810
reduce the jumping around


[07-Aug-19 02:50 PM] zawy#5864
But amazingly we were able to make the RST work..


[07-Aug-19 02:51 PM] zawy#5864
you will lose response.  I've tried everything


[07-Aug-19 02:51 PM] zawy#5864
yuo can't average past targets or past solvetimes and do any better without losing something


[07-Aug-19 02:51 PM] zawy#5864
however............


[07-Aug-19 02:51 PM] jl777c#5810
not averaging


[07-Aug-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
taking min() if blocks have been fast, max() if blocks have been slow


[07-Aug-19 02:53 PM] zawy#5864
I've been wondering if I could replace the tipdiff in EMA with tipdiff * recent solve times like in the RST


[07-Aug-19 02:53 PM] jl777c#5810
using more info has to make it more stable


[07-Aug-19 02:53 PM] zawy#5864
.........based on if emission rate was behind


[07-Aug-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, two states, if behind min() the various bnTargets that are calculated, if ahead use max()


[07-Aug-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
the TSA is allowing many blocks <60 sec, it doesnt have to


[07-Aug-19 02:55 PM] zawy#5864
Do testing with EMA-TSA    (RST is a TSA)


[07-Aug-19 02:55 PM] jl777c#5810
but its output during the catchup is quite stable


[07-Aug-19 02:58 PM] zawy#5864
Your EMA will go from 1E6 to 1  in 25xT


[07-Aug-19 02:58 PM] jl777c#5810
thats not bad, but not great


[07-Aug-19 02:59 PM] zawy#5864
what do you want it to be


[07-Aug-19 02:59 PM] jl777c#5810
like with the exp() results, 10 to 15 minutes for any level of diff stranding


[07-Aug-19 02:59 PM] zawy#5864
15x for 4E6?


[07-Aug-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, maybe it was a bit more for the first block


[07-Aug-19 03:00 PM] zawy#5864
what?


[07-Aug-19 03:00 PM] jl777c#5810
1st block after the diff stranding might take 20 min for 4E6, but then the second, third come much faster


[07-Aug-19 03:01 PM] zawy#5864
see after 1 block.......it's at the right level immediately...no looking back at previous blocks needed


[07-Aug-19 03:01 PM] zawy#5864
so is 25x  then 1x, 1x, 1x  OK for 4E6?


[07-Aug-19 03:01 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess it would be ok


[07-Aug-19 03:02 PM] jl777c#5810
i still have implementation bugs


[07-Aug-19 03:02 PM] zawy#5864
That's what you have right now...you're finished

after solving 74 diff of 43.7 in 1 second, it lowered the diff to 17.5


[07-Aug-19 03:03 PM] zawy#5864
change 1/2 to  5/9


[07-Aug-19 03:04 PM] zawy#5864
lol, yeah, that's a bug


[07-Aug-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
something overflows


[07-Aug-19 03:05 PM] zawy#5864
yeah, that might be the same thing causing me problems


[07-Aug-19 03:05 PM] jl777c#5810
found one possible problem. fixing


[07-Aug-19 03:06 PM] zawy#5864
I guess my notes are wrong and it went negative


[07-Aug-19 03:06 PM] jl777c#5810
i can make tipdiff always be 4 or more


[07-Aug-19 03:07 PM] zawy#5864
Here's the problem with 1 second:   (60 + (1-60) * 3^(1/60/2)) = 60-59.5


[07-Aug-19 03:07 PM] jl777c#5810
tipdiff was always 2 or more in that version


[07-Aug-19 03:08 PM] zawy#5864
oh right


[07-Aug-19 03:08 PM] jl777c#5810
i will change it to 3


[07-Aug-19 03:09 PM] zawy#5864
still 2/60 gives 60-59.03    =  1 so target was not supposed to be changed


[07-Aug-19 03:09 PM] jl777c#5810
is 3 safe from overflow?


[07-Aug-19 03:10 PM] zawy#5864
I don't know what you're having problems now....so I can't know under what conditions it is safe


[07-Aug-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
i mean the equation with the -C


[07-Aug-19 03:10 PM] jl777c#5810
if tipdiff is always 3 or more, i hope to avoid negative stuff


[07-Aug-19 03:11 PM] zawy#5864
it's in the implementation of the exp()


[07-Aug-19 03:18 PM] zawy#5864
is tidiff = 3 going to result in 3/2 = 1?


[07-Aug-19 03:18 PM] zawy#5864
```zawy_exponential_val360000(tipdiff/2))```


[07-Aug-19 03:18 PM] zawy#5864
that causes substantial error


[07-Aug-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
the calculated value isnt monotonically increasing


[07-Aug-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
yes 3/2 -> 1


[07-Aug-19 03:19 PM] jl777c#5810
but it is 3*5/9 now, but that will also go to 1


[07-Aug-19 03:20 PM] jl777c#5810
so tipdiff needs to be even only?


[07-Aug-19 03:22 PM] zawy#5864
input to exp needs to be scaled up


[07-Aug-19 03:23 PM] jl777c#5810
i can just force tipdiff to increment by 2


[07-Aug-19 03:24 PM] jl777c#5810
instead of by 1


[07-Aug-19 03:24 PM] zawy#5864
whch means it needs careful scaling down in 2 places inside of it....but this is not a source of negatives, just a loss in precision response.....i think avg solvetime will be a little slower


[07-Aug-19 03:24 PM] zawy#5864
beig accurate on those small times is needed for the largest attacks


[07-Aug-19 03:25 PM] jl777c#5810
will 1 second matter so much?


[07-Aug-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
seems it will double diff each block under max hash attack


[07-Aug-19 03:26 PM] jl777c#5810
working much better with the fix to avoid tipdiff of 2

[07-Aug-19 03:28 PM] zawy#5864
OK, I'll talk to you tomorrow


[07-Aug-19 03:28 PM] jl777c#5810
ok


[07-Aug-19 03:51 PM] zawy#5864
The key is tipdiff....I've chosen LWMA over EMA in nomrla DAs for  slightly good reasons.  LWMA with low N  will probably drop better than EMA with a better stability and keep correct solvetime.


[07-Aug-19 03:52 PM] jl777c#5810
the TSA is really cool though, it basically adjusts diff in 1 block, during the block


[07-Aug-19 03:53 PM] jl777c#5810
the diff does bounce around due to miners luck, but i guess as long as average blocktime ends up at T, its fine


[07-Aug-19 03:54 PM] jl777c#5810
a lot of the variance could be due to low number of miners, will be interesting to see the ASIC tests on it tomorrow


[07-Aug-19 05:31 PM] zawy#5864
The exp mod portion might need expanding for better accuracy.  The variance is inherent to the speed.  Same as RST. I am curious if it will automatically keep correct avg solvetime.    KMD is a big coin that needs to be reliable.  It seems you have to use this EMA-TSA.  If stable difficulty is important, it has to do an RST-type trigger and response.  That is, it needs a 1/40 in place of the 1/2. But even with 1/40 it's not a pretty stability like digishield.


[07-Aug-19 06:03 PM] zawy#5864
If stability is key, and so is super-fast response to > 1000x then RST + digishield + ema is needed

[08-Aug-19 03:21 AM] jl777c#5810
RST is working so well, i have no words to describe it. i enabled the 6 and 12 and now they basically get the chain back to T per block since the O trigger, four times in a row, like clockwork, even as the miner luck sometimes solves at implied hashrate of 3000 diff and other times at 10, a 30x range seems normal


[08-Aug-19 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
the only problem so far is that the TSA EMA is pushing the digishield diff lower, so i just made it so we can tell if TSA is active and adjust the digishield by the 2.7 factor (i round to 3)


[08-Aug-19 03:23 AM] jl777c#5810
also in order to link the TSA into digishield, i use the average of the digishield target and ct[0], otherwise it just seemed that the digishield is ignored


[08-Aug-19 03:24 AM] jl777c#5810
the TSA only activates if neither the RST or the exp() triggers, but in normal circumstance it should be the one adjusting, so that should take care of the increase and decrease in the non-extreme scenarios, with the RST and exp() taking care of the extreme cases


[08-Aug-19 03:26 AM] zawy#5864
EMA does not need the 2.7


[08-Aug-19 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
i removed all my tinkering with the various internals, with the exception that if RST is enabled, it will always make it at least 10% harder, otherwise it looks like it went dormant


[08-Aug-19 03:26 AM] zawy#5864
to be applied to digi


[08-Aug-19 03:26 AM] jl777c#5810
experimentally it seems to need something


[08-Aug-19 03:27 AM] zawy#5864
Yes, maybe a 10%


[08-Aug-19 03:27 AM] jl777c#5810
4 times in a row, all is beautiful during RST, it gets things to normal, TSA kicks in and lowers diff


[08-Aug-19 03:27 AM] jl777c#5810
which then makes things unstable as we get fast blocktimes, then much higher diff, slow times, lower diff, etc


[08-Aug-19 03:28 AM] jl777c#5810
and the diff seemed to go to 30 vs 90


[08-Aug-19 03:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i am linking the TSA with digishield by setting prevTarget to (prevTarget + digishield bnTarget) / 2


[08-Aug-19 03:29 AM] jl777c#5810
that probably messes up the calibration. so maybe it is a 2x adjustment


[08-Aug-19 03:30 AM] zawy#5864
There's a big problem if avg solvetime is not correct with just digi and EMA running by them selves.


[08-Aug-19 03:31 AM] jl777c#5810
how to combine them?


[08-Aug-19 03:31 AM] jl777c#5810
right now digishield would be disabled unless i feed into the TSA the bnTarget


[08-Aug-19 03:31 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe i average the output of TSA using prevTarget and the digishield bnTarget?


[08-Aug-19 03:33 AM] zawy#5864
Oh, wait, I am thinking of my TSA  where EMA rides on top of digishield....my TSA only uses the digi output to adjust, and digi never uses the the EMA output as it's difficulty


[08-Aug-19 03:35 AM] zawy#5864
But that method was only to make a really good avg solvetime with less variaion than you are seeing


[08-Aug-19 03:35 AM] zawy#5864
Your need is to address the top and bottom and leave the middle alone


[08-Aug-19 03:36 AM] zawy#5864
So you activate EMA like RST and exp to replace them


[08-Aug-19 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought of triggering the TSA only after 2*T, but couldnt figure out when it should trigger on the min side, maybe between T/2 and T?


[08-Aug-19 03:36 AM] zawy#5864
And I think there should not be any need to adjust targets....digi just ueses its output


[08-Aug-19 03:37 AM] zawy#5864
Trigger is same as RST


[08-Aug-19 03:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i found whenever the miners are working for significant time on targets different from what they actually solve, the digishield target calcs need to be adjusted


[08-Aug-19 03:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont want to replace RST, RST is working the best


[08-Aug-19 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
and exp() is proven, so just when neither of those are active


[08-Aug-19 03:38 AM] jl777c#5810
just need a way to calibrate the TSA and digishield and how to run them together


[08-Aug-19 03:39 AM] zawy#5864
Yeah, if 1E6 attacks, it seems like it should have the correct difficulty in 6 blocks and recovered the lost 4 blocks in by the 10 th block.


[08-Aug-19 03:39 AM] zawy#5864
I have an idea for that 4


[08-Aug-19 03:40 AM] zawy#5864
adjust the 4 based on how many blocks behind you are


[08-Aug-19 03:40 AM] jl777c#5810
that should speed up digishield converging when we have the 2x to 4x cases that avoids triggering RST and exp()


[08-Aug-19 03:40 AM] zawy#5864
or maybe just 4 to get it out of RST more quickly......


[08-Aug-19 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
unless RST fails the ASIC test, it seems to handle the 10x + cases, so the TSA is just to help digishield converge faster while maintaining its stability


[08-Aug-19 03:41 AM] jl777c#5810
for the 2x to 4x cases


[08-Aug-19 03:42 AM] zawy#5864
You have the 4 in place of 3 in RST?


[08-Aug-19 03:42 AM] jl777c#5810
no, its still 3


[08-Aug-19 03:42 AM] jl777c#5810
3, 6 and 12 are active and working very well together


[08-Aug-19 03:43 AM] zawy#5864
It's noticeably better with all 3?


[08-Aug-19 03:43 AM] jl777c#5810
yes! they do get the diff up to close where it needs to be


[08-Aug-19 03:43 AM] zawy#5864
does 12 over-ride 6 which overrides 3?


[08-Aug-19 03:44 AM] jl777c#5810
not always


[08-Aug-19 03:44 AM] zawy#5864
it's min target rule?


[08-Aug-19 03:44 AM] jl777c#5810
usually 3 is the dominant one, but really depends on the specifics


[08-Aug-19 03:44 AM] jl777c#5810
yes usually all three have very close values


[08-Aug-19 03:44 AM] jl777c#5810
sometimes 3 is much lower target (higher diff) than the other two, but after a bit, they are essentially the same


[08-Aug-19 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
i have seen some cases where 6 was the lowest target, and even 12


[08-Aug-19 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
didnt find any pattern, numbers flying by so fast


[08-Aug-19 03:46 AM] zawy#5864
if RST is active >20 blocks, is digishield automatically close when it takes over?


[08-Aug-19 03:47 AM] jl777c#5810
with 3, 6, 12, it lasts closer to 40 blocks and probably that is why the diff is closer


[08-Aug-19 03:48 AM] zawy#5864
From the 1 run of TSA  I've looked at so far that lasted about 20 blocks, average solvetime was correct which means targets was correct.  Digi looks at only past 17 blocks.  It should be adjusted so that it is on target in a case like that


[08-Aug-19 03:54 AM] zawy#5864
I'll look at what you got.  My plan today is to start modelling this. All the DA needs to abstracted away from programming and look like math.     What kind of efficiency is lost declaring everything arith256?   A nanosecond?  Is lack of RAM a problem for KMD nodes?


[08-Aug-19 03:55 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess a few nanoseconds, this is just local variables so RAM usages is not an issue


[08-Aug-19 03:55 AM] jl777c#5810
in a couple hours i will have data from the new test run. the RST phase is working wonderful as usual


[08-Aug-19 03:56 AM] jl777c#5810
probably the high variance of the TSA is what maybe just made the diff go lower


[08-Aug-19 04:08 AM] zawy#5864
So it seems declaring everything arith256 is better because it increases clarity   ctA is what miners solve and validators validate, ctB is what RST sees.  Adjusting ctB by 2.72 is not enough for digi to be on track immediately after a long RST run?


[08-Aug-19 04:09 AM] zawy#5864
Do i have that wrong?  what's ctA?


[08-Aug-19 04:16 AM] zawy#5864
OK, ctA is RST and digi output.  ctB is the adjusted RST output or zero if digi was in use.  RST uses ctA if ctB is zero, else use ctB.  Digi should be using the same thing, except divide the ctB[i]-ctB[i+1]  values by 2.72


[08-Aug-19 04:16 AM] zawy#5864
Right?


[08-Aug-19 04:31 AM] zawy#5864
What are the last 2 columns in the CSV?


[08-Aug-19 05:01 AM] jl777c#5810
correct. last two columes are diff of ctA and solvetime for that height


[08-Aug-19 05:04 AM] zawy#5864
avg D for digi right after RST is the same as avg D for RST....I thought you said there was a problem?


[08-Aug-19 05:05 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that after RST ends, the diff goes low, even to the point of triggering RST again, so clearly something is wrong. i am sending the new test results, which at first look seems much better


[08-Aug-19 05:05 AM] jl777c#5810

{Attachments}
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/456900588018597918/608994315154227200/TSA_div3.csv


[08-Aug-19 05:06 AM] jl777c#5810
this is with a div3 for digishield, even for the TSA. also the way the state machine works, the TSA ended up alternating turns with digishield


[08-Aug-19 05:07 AM] jl777c#5810
so the pattern of alternating ctB/000000000 is when TSA was active, the lower two bits for nBits are set when TSA did the block


[08-Aug-19 05:07 AM] zawy#5864
digi needs to avg a few of the RST's.   Let me think about how to do that


[08-Aug-19 05:07 AM] jl777c#5810
so ending in 3, 7, b, f


[08-Aug-19 05:08 AM] jl777c#5810
RST finished on ht.95


[08-Aug-19 05:08 AM] zawy#5864
digi is not stable after RST because RST targets jump around so much


[08-Aug-19 05:10 AM] jl777c#5810
then 56 minutes for the next 50 blocks, no RST triggered, so even though the math is wrong, it avoided the problem of earlier versions


[08-Aug-19 05:25 AM] zawy#5864
When I do digishield on ctA values, the difficulty is correct as if no adjustment is needed


[08-Aug-19 05:25 AM] jl777c#5810
but without correction, then the diff cant go up as the blocks come out slower


[08-Aug-19 05:28 AM] jl777c#5810
found a place where it was overcorrecting, which might explain the 10% slower than expected blocks, also trying to smooth out the TSA a bit more, i remember it was working quite smoothly with a 4 block SMA, but it was too slow, so trying a 2 block + digishield average


[08-Aug-19 05:30 AM] zawy#5864
The 4th column is RST output?


[08-Aug-19 05:31 AM] jl777c#5810
height, timestamp, nBits in hex, bnTarget based on nBits, ctB, diff, solvetime


[08-Aug-19 05:33 AM] jl777c#5810
next test run with the above changes RST kicked in an in 2 blocks it slowed it way down, only some big miner luck prevents it from making up time, one block had an implied hashrate to solve 350 diff


[08-Aug-19 05:34 AM] jl777c#5810
so the RST continues to amaze and if the TSA cant be stabilized, maybe it just needs to be removed. i do like its much faster than digishield behavior though


[08-Aug-19 05:35 AM] jl777c#5810
we will do an ASIC test in 2 hours to verify it works as well with 1000x attacks


[08-Aug-19 05:36 AM] jl777c#5810
or maybe will do it so it is  a 10000x


[08-Aug-19 05:38 AM] zawy#5864
I'm having trouble keeping track of what we're doing because there are 3 difficulty and 3 different algorithm, not counting exp()


[08-Aug-19 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, probably nearly impossible to model this accurately


[08-Aug-19 05:39 AM] jl777c#5810
any model becomes as complex as the actual implementation


[08-Aug-19 05:39 AM] zawy#5864
no, modelling simulates mining perfectly.


[08-Aug-19 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
there are actually 5, counting the 3/6/12 RST


[08-Aug-19 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
I check for RST.3 to trigger, if not check RST.6, if not check RST.12


[08-Aug-19 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
then if any RST was triggered, calculate all 3 inner values and take the min


[08-Aug-19 05:42 AM] zawy#5864
You do W=6 inner if W=3 triggers?


[08-Aug-19 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
when all three are done, it goes into an alternating digishield/TSA mode, was unintentional side effect of how i integrated the TSA


[08-Aug-19 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont have enough bits to encode which trigger triggered


[08-Aug-19 05:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so it sees that some RST triggered and checks all three


[08-Aug-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
i think i see what might work to transition from RST to digishield cleanly. like you say the onchain values are very good, but we cant use them when RST is active


[08-Aug-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
however, i can just use ctA if RST isnt active


[08-Aug-19 05:52 AM] zawy#5864
diff column is input to RST?  What is input to digi?


[08-Aug-19 05:52 AM] jl777c#5810
diff is just the diff that derives from nBits, nBits -> bnTarget -> diff


[08-Aug-19 05:53 AM] zawy#5864
that's the 6th column?


[08-Aug-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, diff is sixth column


[08-Aug-19 05:53 AM] zawy#5864
I don't have headers


[08-Aug-19 05:53 AM] jl777c#5810
height,timestamp,nBits,bnTarget,ctB,diff,solvetime


[08-Aug-19 05:55 AM] jl777c#5810
with RST3/6/12 it gets the diff all the way where it needs to be, so if i just toggle what digishield sees to just ctA when RST not active, it could just work


[08-Aug-19 05:55 AM] zawy#5864
OK, so nBits, nbTarget and diff are same thing.


[08-Aug-19 05:56 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, just different formats


[08-Aug-19 05:57 AM] zawy#5864
and ctB is nBits (if it's not zero) that is adjusted by my time^2 equation?

[08-Aug-19 05:57 AM] zawy#5864
what is the input to digi for RST blocks?  yours looks like it's varying too much


[08-Aug-19 05:58 AM] jl777c#5810
very simple code change to toggle digishield to use only ctA when RST is not active. i will test that next, it feels very promising as you already verified ctA is correct for digishield. digishield is currently getting ctB if nonz, all the time, even when RST is not active


[08-Aug-19 05:58 AM] jl777c#5810
so for 17 blocks after it ends it is still seeing the ctB that is very volatile, that could be the reason for the problems


[08-Aug-19 05:59 AM] zawy#5864
ctA is same as nBits?


[08-Aug-19 05:59 AM] jl777c#5810
sorry, the digishield gets ctB/3 for an RST active block. that was needed to adjust the diff


[08-Aug-19 06:00 AM] zawy#5864
using nBits, digisheild seems about right


[08-Aug-19 06:01 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it looks very clean and should make a nice transition. will test that soon. current test is 10 blocks away from RST having fixed things and then going into the chaos of alternative digishield/TSA_EMA


[08-Aug-19 06:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it is at least better than without the /= 3 into the digshield data, but it feels too random. i think there is no big need for TSA_EMA with RST working so well


[08-Aug-19 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so the only weakness would be the small hashrate boost and "strandings", will need to recover via digishield only


[08-Aug-19 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess all things considered that is not so bad a weakness as it just means lower coin emissions


[08-Aug-19 06:03 AM] jl777c#5810
and occasionally exp() will trigger, even with a 3x stranding


[08-Aug-19 06:04 AM] jl777c#5810
your baby has come a long ways in the last week!


[08-Aug-19 06:08 AM] zawy#5864
so  digi needs  ctA and RST needs ctB and we don't need the 2.72 .


[08-Aug-19 06:08 AM] zawy#5864
Right?


[08-Aug-19 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
the 2.72 wont ever kick in, correct


[08-Aug-19 06:09 AM] jl777c#5810
much cleaner

[08-Aug-19 06:19 AM] zawy#5864
My plan was for RST to catch up and stop  triggering in W  blocks, which might occur by replacing the 1/W in "i" with 1/(W+1).  This has the problem of digishield not seeing 17 blocks, so Diff will drop back down almost to where it was......but you see it is supposed to drop down if it was an attack and if  RST stops the attack.....and if RST did not stop the attack, it triggers again after 3 block.....after 3 repeats digi gets close to correct target as it should becuase it seems the attacker is refusing to leave.   But this motivates him to attack 3 on and 3 off until digishield rises beyond his comfort zone.  So he leaves long time and digi slowly falls. Then he returns.  There is no solution to this except to make D rise in first block based on TSA-EMA so that he is at least paying 2x more difficulty than average.


[08-Aug-19 06:21 AM] jl777c#5810
but the 6 and 12 kicking in will prevent a 3 on/3 off pattern


[08-Aug-19 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810
once the 6 or 12 kickin, then a long stretch will be a bit slower than T


[08-Aug-19 06:23 AM] zawy#5864
No because it catches up so 6 never triggers


[08-Aug-19 06:23 AM] zawy#5864
6 is supposed to tigger if the attack was too small for W=3 to see


[08-Aug-19 06:23 AM] jl777c#5810
so a 3 block attack with 3x hashrate? or much bigger?


[08-Aug-19 06:24 AM] zawy#5864
W=3 won't see it.   W=6 will, pretty soon


[08-Aug-19 06:25 AM] jl777c#5810
so a few times of 3on/3off, seems small potatoes


[08-Aug-19 06:26 AM] zawy#5864
Yes, what I'm saying is that we should get the above plan working before addressing smaller attacks.


[08-Aug-19 06:27 AM] zawy#5864
sequence is D, E, R, D or D, E, R, E


[08-Aug-19 06:27 AM] zawy#5864
where D= digi, E=ema, R = RST


[08-Aug-19 06:27 AM] jl777c#5810
how do i know when to use E ?


[08-Aug-19 06:30 AM] zawy#5864
Always, if R is not triggered.....but the diff it uses post-R should not be such a wild value as R, but what D outputs at that time.  Actually, D is never used in this idea since I want a penalty on attacker's first block....this means every block has to vary a lot based on tipdiff


[08-Aug-19 06:31 AM] zawy#5864
but have digi in background as input to RST for non-RST values (else RST uses ctB), and always as input to E


[08-Aug-19 06:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i tried E active priot to RST, but it adapted pretty fast and RST rarely triggered. probably need looser triggers in that setup


[08-Aug-19 06:32 AM] zawy#5864
nBits should remain like it is.


[08-Aug-19 06:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i mean the RST outer numerator/denominator trigger


[08-Aug-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
it seemed to do better with 3/4 instead of 1/2


[08-Aug-19 06:33 AM] jl777c#5810
but then i switched to all three RST active and it worked so well, i put the EMA at the end to not change the good RST behavior


[08-Aug-19 06:36 AM] zawy#5864
We need my TSA model working for these ideas, immediately see the results and we would remain  on the same page.   With the math working, you would then turn it into code


[08-Aug-19 06:36 AM] jl777c#5810
yes!


[08-Aug-19 06:36 AM] zawy#5864
If live testing gave results differnt than math modelling, then you track down the error in implemantation


[08-Aug-19 06:37 AM] jl777c#5810
in the meantime, i think it is time for some ASIC testing


[08-Aug-19 06:40 AM] zawy#5864
Yeah.  OK, I'll try to get the model working.  Then you can modify it to do what you're doing.

[08-Aug-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
have been running 9 cores since genesis, at height 126 will go to 1 core, i think by 130 diff will be down to 2 or 3 and we can start ASIC


[08-Aug-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
10 blocks, but probably 20 minutes or so


[08-Aug-19 07:27 AM] SHossain#0007
as soon as i get ping, i'll start the ASIC. all settings and pool ready


[08-Aug-19 07:29 AM] jl777c#5810
transition from RST to digishield was near perfect as it started with 35 diff, which seems to be pretty close to what 9 cores should be. so that fix worked!


[08-Aug-19 07:30 AM] jl777c#5810
reduced to 1 core at height 127


[08-Aug-19 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
so this single CPU should be the only CPU miner and it will run while the ASIC is on and will rescue the stalled chain. the big test is how fast it will stop the fast blocks from ASIC


[08-Aug-19 07:33 AM] jl777c#5810
diff should start reducing in 5 minutes


[08-Aug-19 07:33 AM] SHossain#0007
my CPU mining is off


[08-Aug-19 07:37 AM] jl777c#5810
exp() is helping the single CPU get the 9x core mined chain back to diff of 2


[08-Aug-19 07:39 AM] jl777c#5810
diif 4


[08-Aug-19 07:42 AM] jl777c#5810

at block 135


[08-Aug-19 07:43 AM] jl777c#5810
starting from a baseline of diff 5 to 9, so ASIC will be a 1000x to 3000x increase


[08-Aug-19 07:44 AM] SHossain#0007
kicked off


[08-Aug-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
138 was the first block it mined


[08-Aug-19 07:44 AM] jl777c#5810
then diff went to 587!


[08-Aug-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
it still found it so it made it even harder, now ASIC is struggling to find a block


[08-Aug-19 07:45 AM] jl777c#5810
so 3 fast blocks and brick wall

[08-Aug-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
diff 40k


[08-Aug-19 07:48 AM] jl777c#5810
deficit down to 350 for W.3


[08-Aug-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
interestingly the deficit for W.6 is 432 and for W.12 is 383


[08-Aug-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess the non-genesis pattern is the reason why it isnt in order of W

[08-Aug-19 07:50 AM] jl777c#5810
only profitable on/off would have been to stop after the first 3 seconds (3 blocks), but with 5 minutes time to turn on, this is not a good strategy

no, i was wrong about my last sentence


[08-Aug-19 07:52 AM] jl777c#5810

if it is using 11k sols, that is close to full output?


[08-Aug-19 07:53 AM] jl777c#5810

yes, i didn't overclock. it's using factory settings


[08-Aug-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810

[08-Aug-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
145k diff, but it solved it in 73 seconds


[08-Aug-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess the ASIC diff is much higher than 30k, just before we never saw it get much past 20k as it took so long for it to adapt


[08-Aug-19 07:57 AM] SHossain#0007

getinfo


[08-Aug-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
i know getmininginfo is different, but while RST is active, that value is pretty bogus


[08-Aug-19 07:58 AM] SHossain#0007
i see


[08-Aug-19 07:58 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[08-Aug-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
only when RST is not active is it valid


[08-Aug-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
and it is usually just offset by one block for the getinfo difficulty


[08-Aug-19 07:58 AM] jl777c#5810
when the two are very close together, that means hashrate is stable and diff has likely adjusted properly to it


[08-Aug-19 07:59 AM] jl777c#5810
right now they are off by 10x, so clearly things are not anywhere close to adjusted, though after 17 blocks of slowed ASIC blocks, we might see the two values get much closer


[08-Aug-19 07:59 AM] SHossain#0007
diff going down


[08-Aug-19 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
145k was a lucky solve


[08-Aug-19 08:00 AM] jl777c#5810
probably 50k is where it will stabilize?


[08-Aug-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
another lucky solve 7 seconds for 338k diff


[08-Aug-19 08:01 AM] jl777c#5810
but the mining diff is now at 26k vs 50k, since we have 17 slowed ASIC blocks


[08-Aug-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
deficit is still 400+, we didnt catch up, but that is due to a sillybug in this version. already fixed. now we will see digishield take over with diff of 26k


[08-Aug-19 08:02 AM] jl777c#5810
which is not far off from the equilibrium diff


[08-Aug-19 08:04 AM] jl777c#5810
996 seconds for blocks 138 to 160, 83 seconds per block average, which includes the first 3 blocks at 1 seconds each. so it slowed things down to 83 seconds per block, while diff went up from 10 to 25k


[08-Aug-19 08:05 AM] jl777c#5810
seems quite a successful prevention of excess coin emission, even with a 10000x attack

digishield is giving up some extra blocks, but with the next version it wont have to adjust as far, current one is limited to 20 blocks past window, even for the RST.12, due to sillybug

so just randomness


[08-Aug-19 08:12 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why whenever there is some streak of good results (or bad), people want to find some reason for it, when usually it is just how the statistics works


[08-Aug-19 08:13 AM] jl777c#5810
100k diff is too hard to solve consistently for Z9 mini


[08-Aug-19 08:13 AM] SHossain#0007
yes. and the pool can't set more diff for the miner as maxdiff is set to 8


[08-Aug-19 08:14 AM] jl777c#5810
this time the time deficit is 100, 200, 350 seconds


[08-Aug-19 08:14 AM] SHossain#0007
just found a block and diff down to 53k


[08-Aug-19 08:15 AM] jl777c#5810

[08-Aug-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
and now over 2 minute block, so the second extra block is being recouped


[08-Aug-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
and after this block W.3 made up its time deficit


[08-Aug-19 08:16 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty amazing after just 7 blocks from the first fast block


[08-Aug-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
W.6 made up its deficit


[08-Aug-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
5 minute block and now the "attacker" is behind 1 block per minute


[08-Aug-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
only 98 seconds to make up for W.12 and this round of RST will stop

yes, it will be the shortest RST activation i have seen, just 6 blocks to fully recoup all time from the fast blocks in a 12 block window


[08-Aug-19 08:23 AM] jl777c#5810
and digishield starts with 22.5k diff... i guess having 3 of 4 blocks take 2 to 5 minutes adjusted it down


[08-Aug-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
but exp() is kicking in compensate for the slow blocks that resulted from the good luck, so it all seems to fix itself pretty fast


[08-Aug-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
a few more exp() assisted blocks and diff at 28k


[08-Aug-19 08:26 AM] SHossain#0007
exp() to the rescue üòÉ


[08-Aug-19 08:27 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems maybe exp() kicked in a few too many times. i think i will reduce its activation window from 12 to 6


[08-Aug-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, it got too fast again, due to exp() invoking too many times. i updated it for ZAWY20, for now stop the ASIC


[08-Aug-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
lets see what happens if the hashrate goes away in the middle of an RST


[08-Aug-19 08:30 AM] SHossain#0007
shall i stop ASIC?


[08-Aug-19 08:30 AM] jl777c#5810
yes


[08-Aug-19 08:30 AM] SHossain#0007
done


[08-Aug-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
i predict the exp() will need to kick in and immediately the RST phase is over, then the CPU will mine a few blocks and diff is down to 10 or less


[08-Aug-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming that works, then plz make a copy of the .csv and post it here


[08-Aug-19 08:31 AM] jl777c#5810
then update to the bugfixed code and make a ZAWY20


[08-Aug-19 08:32 AM] SHossain#0007
my CPU miner is off until you say to turn it on


[08-Aug-19 08:32 AM] jl777c#5810
first CPU mine with max cores you have available until it gets to a stable diff. RST should start at 65, then go for 30 to 40 blocks, then it will stop and the second hash in the mining printout will go to 0


[08-Aug-19 08:33 AM] jl777c#5810
i am talking about ZAWY20, the plan for testing so you can do it on your own


[08-Aug-19 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
you see in the .csv, there are two hashes, the one on the right means RST is active and things go in slow motion. after the deficits are caught up (or 40 blocks), it will stop and the second hash will go to 0. at that point it is just the normal digishield on its own. after 17 blocks of 0s, we hope nothing triggers and the hash rate is reasonably stable. assuming it is, then reduce to 1 core mining


[08-Aug-19 08:34 AM] jl777c#5810
wait for diff to stabilize.


[08-Aug-19 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
from this point, we can do ASIC test, 5x test, 10x test, etc. basically a variety of increase in hashrate from a controlled baseline


[08-Aug-19 08:35 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[08-Aug-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
does this make sense?


[08-Aug-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
plz ask if any questions. when we are changing the hashrate, the moment it is active, needs to be marked in the spreadsheet as there is no way to know otherwise


[08-Aug-19 08:37 AM] jl777c#5810
so we can do a 2x test, a 4x test, 10x test, 1000x test and get a clear record of it in the .csv


[08-Aug-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure the exact tests @zawy needs, he says there is some way to attack this with an on/off pattern.


[08-Aug-19 08:38 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe CPU 10x attack for 3 blocks and off, wait till diff comes down and 10x again for 3 blocks. this might be the attack that is possible


[08-Aug-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems the high hashrate attack and diff stranding are fully solved. you just cant turn on and off ASIC (or nicehash) quickly enough for it to make sense


[08-Aug-19 08:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so after the controlled tests, the area to focus on is the on/off attacks, specifically 3 blocks and off, wait, repeat


[08-Aug-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
3 blocks is not a lot, especially if you need to wait 20+ blocks to do it again, but this is getting so close to perfect, we might as well duplicate this coin emission attack and fix it (without breaking any of the existing amazingness)


[08-Aug-19 08:42 AM] SHossain#0007
- start the chain #20
- mine with 50 threads till height 65, after that RST will kick in
- continue mining about 40 blocks until the second hash is 0
- mine more 17 blocks with second hash 0
- then, start single thread to stabilize diff


[08-Aug-19 08:42 AM] jl777c#5810
its not so exact.


[08-Aug-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
first of all, nothing happens until height 65


[08-Aug-19 08:43 AM] jl777c#5810
with 50 threads, you will get there in less than a minute


[08-Aug-19 08:44 AM] jl777c#5810
then RST kicks in and things will slow down. keep things until the second hash goes to 0 AND hashrate stabilizes, making sure after it goes to 0s, that exp() or RST doesnt kick in again. it isnt a fatal thing, but nice if RST kicks in and fixes things and there arent any echoes, ie, other triggers after it goes to the 0s


[08-Aug-19 08:45 AM] SHossain#0007
what shall i look out in stdout for the second hash 0?


[08-Aug-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
stdout will be making all the RST prints, during that time the CSV file will have non-zero hashes for the second one


[08-Aug-19 08:46 AM] jl777c#5810
when the RST prints stop, then there will be 0s


[08-Aug-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is either flooding the screen or quiet


[08-Aug-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
if quiet it should be 0s and that means nothing is being adjusted


[08-Aug-19 08:47 AM] jl777c#5810
and the normal digishield should get the diff stable, the big question is will it do it in 17 to 20 blocks, or will it take 100+


[08-Aug-19 08:48 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. let me update to your latest fixes


[08-Aug-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
now once things stabilize, then you can do a controlled hashrate increase test


[08-Aug-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
wait. found another bug


[08-Aug-19 08:48 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[08-Aug-19 08:48 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, its updated.


[08-Aug-19 08:49 AM] jl777c#5810
and just post the CSV with the comments about when hashrate was changed in a column


[08-Aug-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
so if the standard launch goes from genesis to RST triggered, to off and 0s and a stable hashrate. then you can test an increase from there via ASIC, but other than that test of 50x to ASIC, really you need to downshift to much less cores


[08-Aug-19 08:50 AM] jl777c#5810
with 50, i guess downshifting to 3 cores is a good number to reduce variance a bit


[08-Aug-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
then with 3, you can do 2x, 3x, 5x controlled tests with 6, 9, 15 cores


[08-Aug-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
each time going back down to 3


[08-Aug-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
or wait! you have 50 cores!


[08-Aug-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
so you can go from 3 -> 6 -> 18 and get a 2x and 3x test without reducing


[08-Aug-19 08:52 AM] jl777c#5810
see how it works, at any given hashrate what matters is how much more hashrate you add, not what the exact number of cores is


[08-Aug-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont foresee any issues with the 2x, 3x, 5x, tests but post the CSV so i can review it for any funny effects


[08-Aug-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
assuming nothing needs fixing, then the 3 on and stop attack is the one which it seems is the only bug left, but first we need to make sure all the normal cases are ok


[08-Aug-19 08:56 AM] SHossain#0007
updating 2nd node now


[08-Aug-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i want you to understand the reasons behind the procedures


[08-Aug-19 08:57 AM] jl777c#5810
and not just follow them blindly.


[08-Aug-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
exact results will likely vary, especially due to the built in randomness to all this


[08-Aug-19 08:58 AM] jl777c#5810
just always think about what the current hashrate is and what the diff should be and how far away is it, and whether the DAA is confused about what it should be doing


[08-Aug-19 08:59 AM] SHossain#0007
still trying to understand fully tbh


[08-Aug-19 08:59 AM] jl777c#5810
i know, not any questions. you must ask to clarify


[08-Aug-19 09:02 AM] jl777c#5810
if you watch the printouts and the gradually increasing targets, update the csv with each block, i do a tail -17 to see the most recent 17 blocks (input for digishield), you should get a good feel for how it all works


[08-Aug-19 09:03 AM] jl777c#5810
please ask if any questions. i dont think there has ever been a DAA like this other than in zawys imagination! so having a live chain doing what seems like magic is a bit strange at first, but soon you get used to it


[08-Aug-19 09:07 AM] SHossain#0007
preparing the steps again for you to review


[08-Aug-19 09:07 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, it is bit difficult :abused_smiley:


[08-Aug-19 09:09 AM] zawy#5864
the only reason it takes two blocks instead of one block after the initial 3 block trigger to respond to a 1 million times attack is because there's not enough precision in a 60 second block


[08-Aug-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
still it is working so much better than anything else i know of, the 3 on/off attack seems like a minor issue


[08-Aug-19 09:10 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is a surgical way to detect just that without affecting the rest that is working so well, that would be great


[08-Aug-19 09:10 AM] zawy#5864
I am going to have to work on it. It's not supposed to trigger the exponential


[08-Aug-19 09:10 AM] zawy#5864
Unless the attack stops


[08-Aug-19 09:11 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, so a tipdiff > T*2 sort of trigger might work


[08-Aug-19 09:11 AM] zawy#5864
I mean it is supposed to be the stopping of a very large attack that should trigger the exponential.


[08-Aug-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought the 3 block attack was only practical via CPU


[08-Aug-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
where you can precisely control when to start and stop mining


[08-Aug-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
so more in the 5x attack realm?


[08-Aug-19 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
any large attack will be stopped by RST after 3 blocks


[08-Aug-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
and just the cost of renting nicehash is getting very expensive and impossible to control any precise timing


[08-Aug-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
even with your own ASIC, you would need a custom pool that can redirect hash on a moments notice. just using the normal interface to change the pool is too slow for 3 block attack


[08-Aug-19 09:14 AM] jl777c#5810
so it could be the 3 block attack is only an issue for chains with < ASIC of hashrate


[08-Aug-19 09:17 AM] zawy#5864
I have been told by someone who does attacks that you can do on and off for three blocks all the time. A pool or miner can withhold 3 blocks then release them.


[08-Aug-19 09:18 AM] zawy#5864
But I don't know any details on what it takes to switch from one point to another within one block, which is what you really need to do to be able to profit without enough money when there's only three blocks like this


[08-Aug-19 09:18 AM] SHossain#0007
- start the chain #20
- mine with 50 threads till height 65, after that RST will kick in
- continue mining about 30-40 blocks until the second hash on mining printout is 0
- mine more 17 blocks with second hash 0
- then try to stablilize the diff by starting 1 thread
- once the diff is stable start 2x, 3x, 5x test
- keep a record of hash increase and decrease with block number
does these steps looks ok?


[08-Aug-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
you missed one step


[08-Aug-19 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
after mine 17 blocks with second hash 0, you also need to keep mining until the hashrate is stable


[08-Aug-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i have seen that post-RST having some undesirable behavior, like triggerting another RST or exp(). ideally it stays quiet and the diff quickly gets to where the hashrate indicates it should be.


[08-Aug-19 09:20 AM] jl777c#5810
once there are 17 blocks that are stable hashrate (diff and miningdiff would be very close), diff for past 17 blocks reasonably close, but randomness can create some variance


[08-Aug-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is a judgement call whether the diff is stable and reflecting the hashrate


[08-Aug-19 09:21 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. adding that up in my note.


[08-Aug-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
reaching this state of stability is something that is needed at various times


[08-Aug-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
basically from the moment to change the hashrate to when it reaches stability, that is really what this is all about


[08-Aug-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
and we want that to be in as few blocks as possible, but we cant tell for sure until after the fact that it was indeed reached stability


[08-Aug-19 09:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so it might take 20 extra blocks to realize it was actually stable 20 blocks ago


[08-Aug-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
ideally we want to reach this hashrate/diff stability before changing the hashrate


[08-Aug-19 09:23 AM] SHossain#0007
it would be great if you can monitor ZAWY20 just by running it.


[08-Aug-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
but sometimes it might end up just going in circles of not being stable. ping me if that happens. yes i will monitor


[08-Aug-19 09:25 AM] zawy#5864
You need to do 10 * attacks several times to see what is going to happen after RST stops. Mainly to see if Digi Shield does not need a correction to the nBits


[08-Aug-19 09:26 AM] jl777c#5810
wait for diff to stabilize in between, or just do 10x, wait for hashrate to drop 90% and do 10x again?


[08-Aug-19 09:27 AM] zawy#5864
Wait for Digi Shield to stabilize


[08-Aug-19 09:28 AM] zawy#5864
Ideally you won't did you Shield soft X to be exactly correct as soon as rst finishes


[08-Aug-19 09:28 AM] SHossain#0007
starting to mine ZAWY20 with 50 threads


[08-Aug-19 09:28 AM] zawy#5864
The above is voice recognition errors


[08-Aug-19 09:28 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain does this make sense? do a 10x, reduce back to 1x, wait for stable diff, then 10x, reduce back to 1x, repeat. basically try to confuse the DAA


[08-Aug-19 09:28 AM] zawy#5864
It should be fun what that sentence that starts with the ideally is saying


[08-Aug-19 09:29 AM] SHossain#0007
yep. it does.


[08-Aug-19 09:29 AM] SHossain#0007
then, how about 2x, 3x and 5x?


[08-Aug-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
if 1x is 3 cores, it is 3 cores, 30 cores, 3 cores, 30 cores, ...


[08-Aug-19 09:29 AM] jl777c#5810
i think this 10x on/off test is more important


[08-Aug-19 09:29 AM] zawy#5864
Yes that is a good attack, but I would like to see if Digi Shield is getting the right difficulties from rst. You will not know that unless Digi Shield difficulty is immediately correct after rst and does not change assuming you do not change the hashrate


[08-Aug-19 09:30 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. i'll reduct 2,3,5 and use 1x & 10x


[08-Aug-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
the last test showed it was pretty close to digishield diff


[08-Aug-19 09:30 AM] zawy#5864
But I am supposed to be working on the modeling and not getting into your tests


[08-Aug-19 09:30 AM] jl777c#5810
but the past window was too short due to a bug and exp() too hyperactive


[08-Aug-19 09:30 AM] SHossain#0007
so, i can start with 30 threads, then back to 3, wait till stable, then increase to 30 again


[08-Aug-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
just wanted to know the tests that will give us the most useful data


[08-Aug-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
30x back to 3x, 30 back to 3


[08-Aug-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
we want a 10x test, not 30x


[08-Aug-19 09:31 AM] SHossain#0007
oppsss. yes


[08-Aug-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
let me know when you think it is stable, and i will confirm


[08-Aug-19 09:32 AM] zawy#5864
It's not a bad idea for us to diverge right now to see what we can dream up and then compare results at the end. But as soon as I have a testing program that you can use I'll send it to you.


[08-Aug-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
ok


[08-Aug-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
i need to see the actual attack we need to defend against, then i am pretty sure i can devise some sort of special defense for it


[08-Aug-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
so many DAA tools in the toolkit now

you see the deficit prints?


[08-Aug-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
there are three RST, RST.3, RST.6 and RST.12, each has a different deficit it is trying to make up


[08-Aug-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
each block < 60 seconds the deficit goes up, above 60 seconds it goes down


[08-Aug-19 09:42 AM] jl777c#5810
RST.3 has 20 blocks to run, RST.6 has 30 blocks and RST.12 has 40 blocks before it expires


[08-Aug-19 09:43 AM] jl777c#5810
of course if the deficit is completely wiped out, it stops


[08-Aug-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
though in rare cases, like a zombie it can come back to life, but i wouldnt expect that to happen regularly

pretty easy to see when the RST kicked in


[08-Aug-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
deficit 217


[08-Aug-19 09:47 AM] SHossain#0007
yep, stdout is prting that since block 65


[08-Aug-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
you can see it is printing a hash that is gradually getting bigger


[08-Aug-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
that is the ever changing new target


[08-Aug-19 09:47 AM] SHossain#0007
yes


[08-Aug-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
i know why there are a seemingly disproportionate number of fast solves for high diffs!


[08-Aug-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
that is because all fast solves have much higher diffs

[08-Aug-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is just a matter of the probability of a fast solve and if it happens, it has to be a high diff

seems the deficit wont go to 0 for RST.3, but it is good it is on the slow side,

almost halfway through until 0 hash

found a bug, not major but all RST.* have past of 40, small tweak to make it 20, 30, 40 will be in next version


[08-Aug-19 10:14 AM] jl777c#5810
usually the smaller RST make up their deficit any go away before 40 anyway, like now, only RST.12 is alive

To get really fancy, make it a DAG.  Make max block size 1/6 as big and allow each block to reference 6 parent blocks and make solve time 10 seconds.  Your mempool needs to place a 1 or 2 minute hold on txns before miners randomly choose them so that they don't choose the same txns too often.   Since you now have 6 blocks per minute  you can adjust difficulty 6x faster, or have it SQRT(6) more stable. Double-spending solution for DAGs that I came up with is that 1st txn (the valid one) is the one with the most decendant work, not the one with the most ancestor work.  Someone should do a patent on that.  There is a no-incest aka no triagles rule in the connections. I think that means primarily  parents of the same block can have the each other as a parent.  to get even more fancy, each miner chooses his own target but the amount of coin he gets is determined by the DA.  The DA erward is per hash instead of per block.  So no need for pools.  Then you use VDF-POS to make it constant value and not need a bunch of mining equipment to be secure, but only use POW for generating and distribution coin with the above self-hashing txns.  Then put a bunch of these coins under the KMD umbrella so that merchannts only need to communicate with KMD, so all the sub coins are shards.  20 seconds txns, unlimited txns, no wasted minning for consensus, constant value, secured by BTC.


[08-Aug-19 10:22 AM] zawy#5864
But with VDF-POS you don't need such a fast DA.  But you do need the DAG to prove the VDF-POS network was intact.


[08-Aug-19 10:22 AM] jl777c#5810
that sounds cool, but it would take more than a few weeks to do


[08-Aug-19 10:22 AM] zawy#5864
So that you get the fast confirmations


[08-Aug-19 10:23 AM] zawy#5864
lol.....yeah, I suppose a year with 3 people like you and 2 people like me but a little smarter


[08-Aug-19 10:23 AM] jl777c#5810
i toyed with a way to basically build the mining pool into the blockchain, this is a better way


[08-Aug-19 10:24 AM] SHossain#0007
2nd hash is now 0


[08-Aug-19 10:24 AM] jl777c#5810
if i had nothing else to do, it seems like a 3 month project

Yeah, it's an anti-pyramid scheme, so no one is going to invest in it


[08-Aug-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
digishield takeover was seamless


[08-Aug-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
but the blocktimes are fast


[08-Aug-19 10:25 AM] jl777c#5810
diff is constant

[08-Aug-19 10:27 AM] zawy#5864
But I supposed the coin providing the umbrella would need to charge txn fees to get locked on BTC.  The sub-coins (shards) are inherently not supposed to reward the VDF-stakers that secure consensus.

Anyway, you now have the idea and can implement it if you have time.   My work  on difficulty is just a way to  advertise this more important idea. I don't consider difficulty important because it's POW for consensus

17,13,22 is just  below the triger

and there is chance of triggering another RST if the miners get lucky

this is why i say it feels that the digishield needed to be boosted

remeber if digishild is issuing blocks too fast, first try reducing target to 0.693 of ctA

[08-Aug-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
92 / 0.88 = 104


[08-Aug-19 10:36 AM] SHossain#0007
21 blocks with second hash 0


[08-Aug-19 10:36 AM] SHossain#0007
till now


[08-Aug-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, lets wait for the hashrate to stop increasing


[08-Aug-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
it definitely seems to be increasing


[08-Aug-19 10:38 AM] zawy#5864
90 / 0.693 = 130

[08-Aug-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems it is 0.88 or 1


[08-Aug-19 10:38 AM] zawy#5864
About 130 would ocincide with my original guess as to what the ctA adjustment shuold be.  I first said 1/2, but was really thinking 0.693


[08-Aug-19 10:39 AM] zawy#5864
but them later math said 0.88


[08-Aug-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt seem it will go to 130


[08-Aug-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
so for post-RST put in to digishield (ctA/8) * 7 ?

if several tests confirm it


[08-Aug-19 10:40 AM] jl777c#5810
it was too fast, RST triggered


[08-Aug-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
this is like the 6th test where the digishield diff was too low


[08-Aug-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
never higher


[08-Aug-19 10:41 AM] zawy#5864
RST triggering is supposed to be 1/200 blocks if hashrate is stable


[08-Aug-19 10:41 AM] zawy#5864
for W=3, 6, 12 if you did not change outer equation


[08-Aug-19 10:41 AM] zawy#5864
even used together, just 1 per 200


[08-Aug-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
unless digishield diff values are too low and it makes it 1/20


[08-Aug-19 10:42 AM] zawy#5864
that's right, if digi needs that 7/8 then chances are increased some


[08-Aug-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
i will add the 7/8 factor

diff down to 120


[08-Aug-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
once RST kicks in the diff will bounce around a lot


[08-Aug-19 10:45 AM] zawy#5864
1 per 100 if 7/8 is missing


[08-Aug-19 10:45 AM] SHossain#0007
shall i start with 3 thread (1x)


[08-Aug-19 10:45 AM] zawy#5864
is HR nkown to be stable?  How often are the triggers with stable HR?


[08-Aug-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
no, we found an issue. will need to do ZAWY21


[08-Aug-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
after digishield goes stable, i dont see RST trigger much at all, actually i dont think it has yet, but not many 200 block stretches.


[08-Aug-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
is that every 200 blocks has a 50% chance?


[08-Aug-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
or each block has a 0,5% chance?


[08-Aug-19 10:47 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. shall i stop this test and wait for your fix?


[08-Aug-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
no.


[08-Aug-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
it is almost caught up


[08-Aug-19 10:47 AM] SHossain#0007
cool. it's continuing with 30


[08-Aug-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
so we can see another transition into digishield


[08-Aug-19 10:48 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, started

at 92 again


[08-Aug-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
last time was 91.8


[08-Aug-19 10:49 AM] SHossain#0007
81.7


[08-Aug-19 10:49 AM] zawy#5864
0.5 % per block


[08-Aug-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
so a 40% chance it can happen in 100 blocks


[08-Aug-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
64% chance it happens in 200 blocks


[08-Aug-19 10:50 AM] zawy#5864
If you are saying my statistics thinking has an error then I need to tell you that the precise thing I am saying is that it is 1.5% per 3 blocks


[08-Aug-19 10:51 AM] zawy#5864
I was just thinking that means a 50% chance in 200 blocks. Am I wrong?


[08-Aug-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
.995 ^ N


[08-Aug-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
or .985 ^ (N/3)


[08-Aug-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
both are very close at 100 and 200


[08-Aug-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
and that is the probability that no RST is triggered for N blocks


[08-Aug-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
about 140 blocks is the 50% probability


[08-Aug-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
but this will get a lot of variance


[08-Aug-19 10:53 AM] jl777c#5810
still chance of happening within 25 blocks is only 12%, and it happened twice already


[08-Aug-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain code is updated for ZAWY21


[08-Aug-19 10:55 AM] jl777c#5810
do the exact same thing, we need to get a clean transition and hopefully have the digishield start with a diff of 100 instead of 90


[08-Aug-19 10:56 AM] SHossain#0007
ok. stopping ZAWY20 and updating


[08-Aug-19 10:58 AM] jl777c#5810

[08-Aug-19 11:00 AM] SHossain#0007
sure. will do

@SHossain stop!


[08-Aug-19 11:04 AM] zawy#5864
W needs to be 4 to get what I intended with 3


[08-Aug-19 11:04 AM] jl777c#5810
@zawy you sure? you said to remove it


[08-Aug-19 11:04 AM] SHossain#0007
stopped


[08-Aug-19 11:04 AM] zawy#5864
I know I just found an error in my spreadsheet that was testing the theoryu.  turns out theory is right


[08-Aug-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
what exact change does this indicate?


[08-Aug-19 11:05 AM] jl777c#5810
there is no dividing by W


[08-Aug-19 11:06 AM] zawy#5864
It means use   sum(W+1) < T/2


[08-Aug-19 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
aha


[08-Aug-19 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
so (ts[0] - ts[W+1])


[08-Aug-19 11:06 AM] zawy#5864
It's possible that the inner equation doe snot have an error


[08-Aug-19 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i set expected to be (width+1)*T


[08-Aug-19 11:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i noticed it was off by one


[08-Aug-19 11:07 AM] jl777c#5810
didnt think to check the outer for the same issue


[08-Aug-19 11:07 AM] zawy#5864
It may also mean that there is a way to be more precise about the inner loop


[08-Aug-19 11:08 AM] zawy#5864
did you make a change to the inner that I don't know about?


[08-Aug-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain just need to update as we are before height 65


[08-Aug-19 11:09 AM] SHossain#0007
fix pushed?


[08-Aug-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
well i noticed that the expected amount of time needed an extra 60 seconds


[08-Aug-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain wait a bit, maybe another change coming


[08-Aug-19 11:09 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[08-Aug-19 11:09 AM] jl777c#5810
so i set the expected to (width+1) * T


[08-Aug-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
and compare (ts[0] - ts[width]) < elapsed


[08-Aug-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
it just keeps the inner loop alive, doesnt change the bnTarget calc


[08-Aug-19 11:10 AM] zawy#5864
You wanted it to stay live longer?


[08-Aug-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
i wanted it to make up all the time deficit


[08-Aug-19 11:11 AM] zawy#5864
the way to do that was change 1/3 to 1/4


[08-Aug-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
and when RST is active, the blocktimes are very predictable, so i dont mind it is on longer than it has to


[08-Aug-19 11:11 AM] jl777c#5810
i also wanted to get it closer to the digishield diff


[08-Aug-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
most of the time 20 blocks is close to catching up on the RST.3 deficit


[08-Aug-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
for RST.6 i set past to 35


[08-Aug-19 11:12 AM] jl777c#5810
and 50 for RST.12


[08-Aug-19 11:15 AM] jl777c#5810
so any critical changes?


[08-Aug-19 11:16 AM] zawy#5864
A proper way of doing it in my mind is  past=W  and change the 3 to 3 * (numer/denom)^(1/W)          This is basically saying I believe RST is perfect and it's going to recover all the lost blocks in exactly W and therefore it needs to quit, unless a higher W window wants to take over when this W quits


[08-Aug-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
exponentiating by a reciprocal... this will take time. @SHossain update and start miners


[08-Aug-19 11:18 AM] SHossain#0007
ok


[08-Aug-19 11:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i will try to understand what you said @zawy


[08-Aug-19 11:19 AM] jl777c#5810
so reduce past from 20, 35, 50 to 3, 6, 12?


[08-Aug-19 11:20 AM] SHossain#0007
got 3 connections now

started mining


[08-Aug-19 11:22 AM] zawy#5864
you're implementing my ideas faster than I can be sure they're good, but I can't be sure unless I run 10 tests.   It's just that intra-block testing is on the broken computer


[08-Aug-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
we are testing to make sure they are good and so far they are VERY good!


[08-Aug-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
but sometimes, there are some math errors which experimentally contradict the initial expected


[08-Aug-19 11:22 AM] jl777c#5810
just like science


[08-Aug-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
iterate till it is all happy


[08-Aug-19 11:23 AM] zawy#5864
The past=W idea is based on the plan I described early today


[08-Aug-19 11:23 AM] jl777c#5810
it will be difficult to implement

[08-Aug-19 11:25 AM] zawy#5864
it's a hard decision to leave RST easrly because we want digi to be stable.......but I want to be prepared for miners doing on-off in W.    oo00oo00oooooo i have an idea


[08-Aug-19 11:25 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess i can grab another bit from nBits and have one bit per RST


[08-Aug-19 11:26 AM] zawy#5864
I don't like that 1/W root either, so you would need to hard code it for now.  BTW, our exp function can be generalized to do it..........


[08-Aug-19 11:27 AM] jl777c#5810
so you are talking about changing the 3^x


[08-Aug-19 11:27 AM] zawy#5864
but anyway, if you want to try this past=W, then to fix digishield, do this.   Change digi N from 17 to  2xW  üòÉ  or maybe 3 * W / 2


[08-Aug-19 11:27 AM] zawy#5864
or maybe W


[08-Aug-19 11:28 AM] jl777c#5810
i will be happy if we can get the transition to digishield to match up


[08-Aug-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems to be working pretty well and not broken, why to fix it?


[08-Aug-19 11:29 AM] zawy#5864
Yeah, .....OK, definitely do not change anything until you know very clearly how ti works right now


[08-Aug-19 11:29 AM] jl777c#5810
it feels like there is this digishield transition problem and a theoretical 3 block attack


[08-Aug-19 11:30 AM] zawy#5864
but my digi idea is probabyl not good because it hurts regular miners if  attacker leaves.....


[08-Aug-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
this is the time to minimize changes to only what is needed


[08-Aug-19 11:30 AM] jl777c#5810
what i like about having digishield most of the time, is that is a well known thing, its weakness is that it is very slow to adapt, but RST is basically instant


[08-Aug-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
and there is the exp() safety net going the other way


[08-Aug-19 11:31 AM] jl777c#5810
so maybe not reducing diff when 3x to 5x and this 3 block attack, those seem to be the only two possible issues to fix


[08-Aug-19 11:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the other reason i prefer RST stay on longer is that for cases like the on/off miners, if they do it just a bit too much, it triggers the RST and we get to recoup the time deficit. i guess maybe the instigators are gone and not punished, but not sure what can be done with 1, 2, 3 blocks and leave sort of miners

RST needs to precisely recover the lost blocks.  The RST could be modified to be more aggressive  in proportion to the blocks it is behind.  It could target to recover them in W  or 5 or 10 or 17 blocks


[08-Aug-19 11:48 AM] zawy#5864
That is the source of the root.

If we're N blocks ahead and want to delay the chain to get them back in M blocks then RST  target is lowered  by   (1-N/M)^(1/M)


[08-Aug-19 11:55 AM] zawy#5864
assuming it's the original RST that was not catching up on blocks


[08-Aug-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
original RST does eventually catch up


[08-Aug-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
and going too fast is not good


[08-Aug-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
counterintuitive, but spreading it out over 20 to 50 blocks allows it to be closer to T and also gives digishield much better initial data


[08-Aug-19 12:02 PM] jl777c#5810
from what i can tell, as soon as i actually implemented what you had in mind, it just started working like magic.

i have tested literally 100+ genesis launches with a lot of possible variations and what worked best is very small changes to what you specified


[08-Aug-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
so i dont think it needs to be fixed, just the digishield transition, which we will see in 20 blocks


[08-Aug-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
and some demonstration . of a 3 block attack


[08-Aug-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
we can probably have earlier triggered weaker exp() type of corrections on the lowering diff side, if there is any big problem with 3x strandings


[08-Aug-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
so all i am worried about is the 3 block attack


[08-Aug-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
we could maybe reduce it to a 2 block attack, but that wont really change much


[08-Aug-19 12:12 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain still just 30 cores? the solve times are all fast and diff is at 400

[08-Aug-19 12:15 PM] zawy#5864
I wanted  a slow recovery  which I thought the 3 would do.  But with the addition of ctB   I thought the 3 might be too slow.  But you added somethng else in the inner loop to get it right?


[08-Aug-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
i force all activated RST to reduce target by at least 10%


[08-Aug-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
oh, maybe this is the 10% error?


[08-Aug-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
i could change it to 1%


[08-Aug-19 12:16 PM] jl777c#5810
just need it to be slightly more difficult so it can be marked as a I block


[08-Aug-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
diff started at 129


[08-Aug-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
so the 7/8 adjustment seems to have worked


[08-Aug-19 12:18 PM] jl777c#5810
better to come in a bit high, than a bit low


[08-Aug-19 12:19 PM] jl777c#5810
and it is a diminishing effect as fewer and fewer RST blocks are in the 17 block horizon


[08-Aug-19 12:19 PM] zawy#5864
You first suggested changing 1/3 to 1/4 which I agreed with, if it was needed.  if changing it to 1/3 \* 0.90 looks right, then it is not changing anything I had in mind.  Althought RST was pure, this one change I knew needed to be decided upon.  Getting the blocks back in 1 block is clearly not what we want but the match can't make that decision. (at least not without making assumptions about what good and bad miners want and how they will react)


[08-Aug-19 12:19 PM] SHossain#0007
digishield kicked in


[08-Aug-19 12:20 PM] zawy#5864
Oh, you're talking about a different 10%

The 1/3 verse 1/4 is dictating how fast the blocks are recovered while 7/8 is about getting digi right


[08-Aug-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
block recovery is fine


[08-Aug-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
it is spread out over 20 to 50 blocks


[08-Aug-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
something like 80 second blocks for the RST duration


[08-Aug-19 12:21 PM] zawy#5864
Ok, 7/8 as I thought we were discussing is about post-RST ctA[]   inputs to digi


[08-Aug-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
yes


[08-Aug-19 12:21 PM] jl777c#5810
that 7/8 is working as expected


[08-Aug-19 12:22 PM] jl777c#5810
in this run, the last blocks of RST had a run of good luck which skewed the starting diff


[08-Aug-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
but digishield is not below the actual diff, so it isnt in danger to trigger RST


[08-Aug-19 12:23 PM] jl777c#5810
105, 39, 85, 58 solvetimes so far

solvetimes are all over the map, but diff is pretty steady


[08-Aug-19 12:48 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems the digishield is stabilizing around 120 diff, solvetimes are still on the slow side from the bad luck period, but it seems this is not a digishield problem. @SHossain change to 3 cores mining until the diff adjusts down to 10 or so. then start with 30 cores again


[08-Aug-19 12:49 PM] jl777c#5810
i think this first digishield transition was not great, but not horrible. the extra time actually is pretty close to the deficit that was left, but no idea how the digshield could have known that


[08-Aug-19 12:49 PM] SHossain#0007
started with 3 now


[08-Aug-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
ideally this next RST -> digishield transition will have a stable diff for the 17 blocks before the transition


[08-Aug-19 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007
will be back after some food.


[08-Aug-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
in 10 minutes or so the diff should be much much lower


[08-Aug-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
food is good idea


[08-Aug-19 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007
oh...in that case, will go for food after 10 mins


[08-Aug-19 12:50 PM] SHossain#0007
i mean if the diff goes down in 10 mins


[08-Aug-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
actually change to 1 core mining, that will make it go even faster


[08-Aug-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
or even better stop mining for 6 minutes


[08-Aug-19 12:51 PM] SHossain#0007
mining with 1 now


[08-Aug-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
even 1 core can get lucky, i think best to stop mining for 6 minutes


[08-Aug-19 12:51 PM] SHossain#0007
now?


[08-Aug-19 12:51 PM] jl777c#5810
yes


[08-Aug-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
that is the fastest way to get the diff down. sort of backwards,but the way the exp() works


[08-Aug-19 12:52 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. stopped


[08-Aug-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
just dont want to mine blocks with 1 core when diff is at 100+


[08-Aug-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it will slow down the transition


[08-Aug-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
i hope this makes sense


[08-Aug-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
so in 6 minutes start with 1 core


[08-Aug-19 12:53 PM] jl777c#5810
diff should come down in several minutes, pretty fast as we have seen, even from 20000 diff


[08-Aug-19 12:53 PM] SHossain#0007
yes, that makes sense to wait a bit

exp() to the rescue


[08-Aug-19 01:00 PM] zawy#5864
If digishield is jumping it's because of the large change in RST targets as they roll in and out of the window.  Average the first two and last two tagerts for digishield.  So you need 1 block before the beginnign of the digisheild window to get the last two.  The way RST jumps up and down in 1 block, this will work even better than what you saw with SMAs


[08-Aug-19 01:00 PM] SHossain#0007
diff down to 6.2

lets see this next run, the last test the miners got lucky 5 of the last 6 blocks


[08-Aug-19 01:02 PM] zawy#5864
that math may not work out any different than just averaging 18.......but I'm not sure


[08-Aug-19 01:02 PM] zawy#5864
I think it will work good.


[08-Aug-19 01:02 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain when the exp() stops then start the 30 cores again


[08-Aug-19 01:03 PM] zawy#5864
but is digi jumpingin 1 block too much?


[08-Aug-19 01:03 PM] SHossain#0007
ok. 30 core started


[08-Aug-19 01:03 PM] jl777c#5810
no digi was just biased high this last test, i think due to the good luck of miners


[08-Aug-19 01:03 PM] zawy#5864
oh, ok, nevermind


[08-Aug-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
it still ended up ok, but will be much better to not have such a mining deviation in the prior 17 blocks


[08-Aug-19 01:04 PM] jl777c#5810
one or two fast solves, ok, but 5 of 6 just biased things to the high end. but the digishield diff was steady throughout the transition


[08-Aug-19 01:05 PM] zawy#5864
The expected error is SQRT(N)....so you need 10 tests of 10 blocks post-RST with constant hashrate to have a 50% chance of knowing if the error is about 10%


[08-Aug-19 01:05 PM] jl777c#5810
this next test will show if that was indeed a mining fluke or if the other 6 times it was too low was a coinsident

next transition is going well


[08-Aug-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
started with 119 diff


[08-Aug-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
even though the prior 17 were all over


[08-Aug-19 01:39 PM] jl777c#5810
only a 23 block RST active


[08-Aug-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
i have a theory that the odds of finding a block at a fixed diff is higher than if it is reducing


[08-Aug-19 01:40 PM] jl777c#5810
basically at the higher diffs there is less chance, so there are not so many chances at the solvable diff


[08-Aug-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
while if it is doing the entire block at the solvable diff, then it is more likely to get it solved sooner


[08-Aug-19 01:41 PM] jl777c#5810
i think that is the effect that i am seeing on the digishield transition


[08-Aug-19 01:42 PM] jl777c#5810
no idea what the math is to estimate the difference in probability


[08-Aug-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
i guess if on average the target is 50% harder during RST, it wouldnt be surprising to find blocks 30% sooner at the fixed diff based on the actually solved


[08-Aug-19 01:43 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe this is your .683


[08-Aug-19 01:44 PM] jl777c#5810
but the digishield did adjust upward from 120 to 140 over 12 blocks and hopefully it will be stable at the 130 to 140 diff


[08-Aug-19 01:47 PM] jl777c#5810
ave 50 second blocks since digishield, and that is with the 7/8 adjustment


[08-Aug-19 01:48 PM] jl777c#5810
@SHossain, just leave it running with 30 cores till morning and then stop the mining. that will give us some data about how many spontaneous RST we have


[08-Aug-19 01:50 PM] jl777c#5810
tomorrow i will see how many low cost blocks can be obtained with the 3 on, then off trick. not sure how to stop it, but once i see it in action maybe i will get some ideas


[08-Aug-19 02:11 PM] SHossain#0007
ok.


[08-Aug-19 03:49 PM] zawy#5864
I am concerned that the RST uses ctB and yet digi uses ctA.  If digi is much better on ctA then ctB, then RST sould be better on ctA.  Intuition and  math guessing says both should be using about 0.693 or 0.88 of ctA.  But the ct's and their solvetimes are supposed to be used the same way by both RST and digi because both RST and digi only want to know the hashrate that those numbers indicate.  When I say "RST" here I mean when it looks at the 3 previous blocks.  That is strictly only wanting to know the previous hashrate.  but my more advanced equation seems to be working awesome, getting the correct average solvetime and digi apparently is getting the correct hashrate too.  It's just something to keep in mind.  I  thought RST and digi needed the same ct[]'


[08-Aug-19 03:49 PM] zawy#5864
So i have to keep an open mind about an error somewhere.


[08-Aug-19 05:57 PM] zawy#5864
RST is just an SMA with a time^2 factor, so the same process can be converted into EMA, Digishield, or LWMA.  The W is a simple function of (improbably fast) x  (recency) factor that can be determined by a pre-function that looks at past solvetimes.   We scale W up to be a precise factor.  The same improbability and recovery speed math can be used on the high side to replace exp().    RST is just an SMA * current solvetime/T/W. I am guessing any DA can be used by replacing recent time in it with time*current time.  Soto cover  the full range it needs 2 equations: one to look at the past solvetime distributions to get W and the second equation which is the DA.   This is what I'll test do and test

RST kicking in for only half a dozen blocks, once in the next 400 blocks, so the 1.5% per 3 blocks seems within range

after no mining at all for 8 hrs or so, started mining with 1 core. of course exp() had to come to the rescue

[09-Aug-19 06:12 AM] jl777c#5810
then somehow the digishield started at too low a diff, probably as most of the 671 to 677 diff of 1 was included in 17 block digishield window

so of course RST kicked in again, as it should have. lasted for 30 blocks, made up for the extra emission and the transition was perfect!

[09-Aug-19 06:14 AM] jl777c#5810
the fist block at 6 diff, probably some edge case, but the rest at the correct diff of 7


[09-Aug-19 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
@zawy i see what you mean about the 3 block attack. i just wait for digishield period, mine 3 blocks at 9x, stop. usually RST triggers, but without my 9x hashrate, it ends up back to approx same digishield diff. RST period lasted 6 blocks the first time.

it seems someone can indeed "steal" a few blocks each time digishield goes active. not sure how to prevent this as it looks identical to miners getting a bit lucky. total coin emission appears to not be increased though, so at least that part is fixed


[09-Aug-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
probably some entirely new method like your DAG approach is needed to fully solve this. also this 3 block attack will work on basically any coin, so its not any unique attack vector against RST


[09-Aug-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
but how much of an attack is this? lets say we can do a full cycle every 30 blocks on average. there would be 30 units of hashing continuously, getting 27 of the blocks. 9x hashing for 20 seconds to get 3 blocks is 3 units of hashing to get 3 blocks... wait, does that mean it is costing everyone the same and there is no economic gain? i guess a slight loss for the always on miners getting 10% less ROI


[09-Aug-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
but this assumes perfect execution on the part of the 3 block miner. seems like a lot of overhead to get a 10% higher ROI


[09-Aug-19 07:00 AM] jl777c#5810
and if there are two just 3 block miners, i think the overall hashrate just goes up


[09-Aug-19 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright ```./komodod -ac_name=ZAWY22 -ac_adaptivepow=1 -ac_supply=1000000 -ac_reward=10000000000 -ac_cc=2 -addnode=5.9.102.210 &```


[09-Aug-19 07:02 AM] jl777c#5810
it is ready for your abuse testing. see if you can get it to do bad things


[09-Aug-19 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
also anybody else who can think of a way to get a mining advantage, please test to see. for ASIC miners, i think you will be quite surprised at how it behaves


[09-Aug-19 07:40 AM] zawy#5864
The plan I gave at the beginning of yesterday is the best available.  To repeat, or maybe say it a little differently, use  RST to regain lost blocks in I'd say in 3 to 5 blocks without regard to W by doing something like changing the 3 to 4.  Digi and exp() are fine.    This means on-off is possible, but blocks will not be emitted too fast on average.  The only way to make the large miner pay more than constant miners in doing this is to change the difficulty during the block with the EMA, or even make RST active on every block.  The difficulty will then jump up and down a lot every block.  But if a fast solve is submitted, teh large miner has to pay more than average.   Even this plan fails if the miner can turn on and off in T/2 while common miners mine all the time.  The complete solution is to enable every miner to turn on and off with equal speed so that no one can cheat relative to anyone else.  So as the EMA is changing D during the block all miners can switch from one chain to another as the target time makes comes close where it is easier.  Miners liking a coin more will start mining early to increase their chances, but at a larger minnig cost.  People wanting to get it at a low D will not get as many but they will help make target time much tighter around T.     It seems like making it jump around each block is more than many will want, so I would say just RST , digi, and exp() and let the big miners get their 3 blocks.  It may take awhile for that to end up bad.  If the big miners get 3 and leave and RST is made to recover in 3, then constant miners have to pay 2x the average difficulty.


[09-Aug-19 07:41 AM] zawy#5864
I will soon have a spreadsheet where you can do testing of the math immediately.  I'll do the C++ code for modellign later.


[09-Aug-19 07:42 AM] zawy#5864
I previously didn't know how to do it in spreadsheet, but that target adjustment equation can work backwards to do what's needed.


[09-Aug-19 07:54 AM] zawy#5864
When I talk about using the EMA I'm talking about using Digi Shield values as its input but Digi Shield values never being seen in the public. And using rst for the other cases to be more aggressive and exp for the fast drops


[09-Aug-19 07:55 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems the gain from this is not worth it. i really like how things are working now and the changing diff for each block has the "attack" by miners who mine just after tipdiff > 30


[09-Aug-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
with just a few minable coins using this method all the time they could hop around to the one with the highest ROI. that doesnt seem like a good equation


[09-Aug-19 07:56 AM] jl777c#5810
as it is now, the RST kicks in only after hashrate boost. inadvertent ones from good miner luck for a few blocks seems to almost always result in a short RST period


[09-Aug-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
and the digishield offers nice diff stability under constant hashrate


[09-Aug-19 07:57 AM] jl777c#5810
so if some miners want to hop in for 3 blocks, let them. as soon as there is more than one such miner, it wont work anymore for them


[09-Aug-19 08:17 AM] zawy#5864
For W=2 you can use numerator = 15, denominator 100  to have the same 0.5% per block occurence


[09-Aug-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
cool! i can add a W=2 and reduce the 3 blocks to 2


[09-Aug-19 08:18 AM] jl777c#5810
that is actually a significant improvement


[09-Aug-19 08:18 AM] zawy#5864
W=1 shouldn't be done because th FTL=4 could be used for substantial manipulation


[09-Aug-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
agreed


[09-Aug-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
what happens if an attacker tries to backdate timestamps


[09-Aug-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
say 5 minutes ago to get past the >mediantime requirement


[09-Aug-19 08:19 AM] jl777c#5810
then can create artificial delays, but i think it will just trigger RST


[09-Aug-19 08:21 AM] zawy#5864
15/100 is 9 seconds, so there could be manipulation (he sends his 2nd block at 1 second and      then    leaves to make others see higher difficulty for two blocks and then comes back or he does it the other way if he's   not too large to prevent the W=2 trigger so that he can get a 3rd


[09-Aug-19 08:27 AM] zawy#5864
So he cuold be 5x and will sometmies see 7 second blocks so he could make next one +1 and then leaves  So ironically, a miner who is not too big can make the triggers happen to force others to have a higher avg difficulty, so more miners do not want to mine the coin so he's competing with a lower hashrate  AND he's getting it at 1/2 the average difficulty at that hasrate.  Miners leaving regular coins is a non-linear function of difficulty, meaning that a 5x or 10x miner could do this, switching between 4 different coin options to not waste equipment time, and let's say he only drives D up 50% higher....well in some coins that would mean 70% of miners would leave


[09-Aug-19 08:28 AM] zawy#5864
I mean avg D would be 50^ higher


[09-Aug-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
as you say, the solution is to implement a good multicoin miner so everyone can do this


[09-Aug-19 08:28 AM] jl777c#5810
with competition, this low diff sniping wont work


[09-Aug-19 08:28 AM] zawy#5864
right, I'm glad you see that.  A lot of people just completely forget it's a viable option....and it would make solvetimes more exact


[09-Aug-19 08:29 AM] zawy#5864
....but....


[09-Aug-19 08:31 AM] zawy#5864
the whole reason for a delay between blocks is to make sure the solvetimes are spread out so there are fewer collisions within network delays that would cause orphans.  You can make blocks half as big to make solvetime 2x faster which improves difficulty speed which makes on-off harder.  And at 2x smaller they theoretically propagate 2x faster


[09-Aug-19 08:31 AM] zawy#5864
so the collisions are not increased


[09-Aug-19 08:34 AM] zawy#5864
So an extreme case of using RST W=2 or EMA to change difficulty during the block can increase collisions, but if it's done mildly, it can decrease collision which are normally bunched at the fast solvetimes due to the poisson.....you could even adjust the DA based on the number of collisions to minimize them.


[09-Aug-19 08:35 AM] zawy#5864
My TSA article shows how the histogram is pulled away from being bunched at fast solvetimes......RST is achieving this


[09-Aug-19 08:35 AM] zawy#5864
at elast when there is an attack


[09-Aug-19 08:35 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems to get the fast solves to trigger the W=2, the collisions would be mostly between the snipers, and there shouldnt be that many of them


[09-Aug-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
if everyone is running the multichain miner and all are hopping to the highest ROI chain, then that chain ends up with a higher hashrate. i think it will all sort itself out


[09-Aug-19 08:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and collisions are not that big of a deal in the context of dPoW as it will resolve itself pretty quickly


[09-Aug-19 08:38 AM] zawy#5864
We are not near collisions being a problem.  I was just pointing out that if  on-off were encouraged to an extreme degree it might look attractive due to solvetim but also has the collisions.


[09-Aug-19 08:39 AM] jl777c#5810
understood. i will design the multicoin miner to minimize this. with each miner putting in their relative value of coins into the multiminer, the collisions would only be between those with identical coin values


[09-Aug-19 08:51 AM] jl777c#5810
funnily, the initial test of W=2, didnt trigger, as there was a slow block and it was > 9 seconds, but the W=3 triggered at the same spot. since they all turn on at ht.65. under a normal situation though it looks like it will indeed reduce the number of cheap blocks by 1


[09-Aug-19 08:53 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a W=1 with numerator 1, denominator 60, would catch it after one block, but then anybody that does a timestamp 1 more than previous would trigger it. though not sure it is so bad to have RST triggerred spuriously as it just gets block production back to where it should be


[09-Aug-19 09:03 AM] zawy#5864
You would have to trigger the rst in the same way you trigger the EMA. You could have the rst running on top of Digi Shield all the time but just a lot less aggressive and how much it changes difficulty based on the solve time. The 0.5% trigger for w equals 1 was less than one second.  A 1 second trigger would need 200 second blocks


[09-Aug-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
too bad. still 2 easy blocks is a lot better than 3, i think what is in place now is a very very good improvement over status quo


[09-Aug-19 09:04 AM] jl777c#5810
now we will test it as much as possible to make sure no unexpected behaviors


[09-Aug-19 09:38 AM] zawy#5864
2 model mining, make the solve time equal to the square root of the negative natural logarithm a random variable divided by the hash rate divided by the Target* 2 raised to the power of 256


[09-Aug-19 09:39 AM] zawy#5864
The natural logarithm is only of the random variable, and the square root covers all of it


[09-Aug-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
going through your reverse nakamoto articles...


[09-Aug-19 09:59 AM] jl777c#5810
do you know of any actual VDF in code that already works?


[09-Aug-19 10:00 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems a VDF-PoS could make PoS quite effective and it seems it can be done in the current context of blockchain, which is my preference as all the other infrastructure in place would still apply


[09-Aug-19 10:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i could never find any simple "this is a VDF code" in C/C++


[09-Aug-19 10:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
anybody who talks about VDFs is usually writing weird academic papers, and if they write code, it's in some weird language or pseudocode


[09-Aug-19 10:01 AM] dukeleto#7326
some kind of VDF in C/C++ might exist somewhere, just haven't found it. It might be called something else, VDF is not a universal term


[09-Aug-19 10:02 AM] dukeleto#7326
When zawy first started talking about them, I tried to research, but the data was extremely scarce


[09-Aug-19 10:10 AM] zawy#5864
Chia is pushnig the VDF tech


[09-Aug-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
i can see how to do half a VDF, where it takes 64x longer to create and can be verified in parallel. but for a single entity to validate it would require the same amount of time


[09-Aug-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe a penalty if any subpart of the data is disproven, or blocks would just take time to verify


[09-Aug-19 10:12 AM] zawy#5864
Bram Cohen (bit torrent creator) brought awareness of them to the blockchain world.  He blocked me on twitter for pestering them about their difficulty problems


[09-Aug-19 10:17 AM] zawy#5864
Through some deep math magic that might take me a long to time to intuitively feel how it works, the VDF outputs a random value that works like a hash.  You can efficiently check they went through the process by comparing the output to the inputs without having to do the work.


[09-Aug-19 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
the effciently checking part seems quite amazing, seems they use some zksnark tech

what about using a CPU orient algo, like curve25519 in a chain. calculate 64 million, posting the partial result for every million.


[09-Aug-19 10:36 AM] jl777c#5810
now anybody can verify in 1/64th time any two adjacent values


[09-Aug-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
given the same amount of time, you can fully validate the entire chain, but that could end up being a lot of work


[09-Aug-19 10:37 AM] jl777c#5810
but it can be done statistically but treating it like mining hashes


[09-Aug-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
so in addition to the 64 values, the one that has the lowest bnTarget equivalent is also posted, along with its position.


[09-Aug-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
then on average in half a million curve25519 you can verify it goes to the next of the 64 entries


[09-Aug-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so kind of like mining, but with a fixed amount to calculate. can start from the hash(prevvdf & pubkey)


[09-Aug-19 10:41 AM] jl777c#5810
you can cmult the 64 values and end up with the last one as these are all basically multiplicative products


[09-Aug-19 10:44 AM] jl777c#5810
the fact that the product of 2 million elements is the same as the product of 2, this is close to being verifiable quickly, but for an ultimately serial calc, i dont see how to allow a fast validation. parallel validation on something that is only serially calculable is not quite a vdf


[09-Aug-19 10:57 AM] zawy#5864
the links on this page are good if you didn't see it.  MIT has a digital currency lab that's interested in it, so that's where some of the videos come from https://vdfresearch.org/


[09-Aug-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
that math seems too deep for me, but i have a possible solution!
let me know if you see any fundamental problems.

1. the idea is to use a curve25519 chain, which is basically multiplying field elements, over and over, in a chain. in order to calculate the ending value of the chain, the entire chain needs to be computed. 

the problem is that to verify the chain, it seems that you need to also verify the entire chain, however, let us have a global reference chain that is very long, but known to all. what this means is that the final product can be known to all. Of course, if the full chain is known, then it seems there cant be much use, but the trick is the "monkeys typing shakespeare" idea. given a long enough chain, eventually there will be all possible data (in the parts of the encoded field element with full dynamic range.

so let us specify an offset into the field element and use two full dynamic range bytes as the ones that have to have the next part of the message.

the message needs to change each block to prevent any lookup tables being created, so there is a per block blinding hash that is not known until the block starts, let us say it is the value of the previous blockchash, with height, pubkey and some other (tbd) things added to the hash. 

now we need to search for this hash 2 bytes at a time in the curve25519 chain. on average it will take about 65536 iterations to find the exact 16bit pattern in the specified two bytes. which is an average of a million iterations per 256 bits hash. 

here comes the rapid validation part!


[09-Aug-19 11:41 AM] jl777c#5810
as each of the 16 elements are found, they are the product of all the elements before it.  multiplying them together gets the same result as a single chain that ends at the last one, so there just needs to be a final field product that goes from the 16 special field elements to the very end of the globally known chain. 17 cmults can validate that the 16 special field elements were in the chain.

one problem is that a parallel search can search in parallel for sequences and since it is multiplication, the order doesnt matter. to avoid this attack, each of the 16 elements needs to be anchored to a specific 1/64th of the global one, and in order. this doubles the required number of elements, but the time for 32 mults is very fast. there can probably be statistical tests to detect parallel searching within a segment, since we have a globally known chain, the resolution can be made every 10,000 elements


[09-Aug-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
my guess is you can define the math to get a very high probability of a non-parallel search


[09-Aug-19 11:47 AM] jl777c#5810
and if the search is known to have been serial, we know that it took a long time to calculate as curve25519 is already CPU optimized and i dont know of any way to parallelize a curve25519 chain. I already have code that searches for one byte values in curve25519, but it was random values, not a chain, still this wouldnt be hard at all and if it implements a VDF, it seems worth doing


[09-Aug-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
an improvement to this to prevent any chance of pre-computing lookup tables is that at each link of the chain, you hash the field element to look for the 16bits. since it is hashed with a height specific data not known until that height started, you cant precompute the hashes derived from that


[09-Aug-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
now all 32 bytes have full dynamic range as it is the output of SHA256


[09-Aug-19 12:00 PM] jl777c#5810
validation now needs 16 extra SHA256, which is also very fast


[09-Aug-19 12:04 PM] jl777c#5810
but i wonder if this breaks the serialization aspect... it does seem like some cheating is possible by scanning a small enough range in parallel, so need to tweak it a bit more.


[09-Aug-19 12:08 PM] jl777c#5810
also if the full curve25519 chain is too small, large computers can load it all in memory. so it needs to be much bigger than can be stored. which gives the idea that the starting point for any given block is changing and then to search, the chain needs to be recreated from the new starting point


[09-Aug-19 03:57 PM] zawy#5864
I can't follow enough to provide any feedback


[09-Aug-19 09:13 PM] dukeleto#7326
@jl777c i think i understood most of what you said


[09-Aug-19 11:05 PM] jl777c#5810
i dont think it works if the curve25519 chain isnt created from scratch each time. another try was to keep squaring to quickly get the total product and then linearly search, but without known anchor points, a parallel search can be done and 1/x used to get everything to multiply out right. i guess we wait for the chia vdf


[10-Aug-19 02:04 AM] jl777c#5810
exploring a modified merkle proof system, where instead of hashing you use curve25519 cmult. the proof size per 16 bits is a bit large, but i think it can be highly compressed by using standard G^(2^n) values. not 100% clear on all the details yet, but i think this allows to find the special 16bits encoded field elements, prove their location and also prove that it is in the linear curve25519 chain. if this is true it means it can use a brand new curve25519 chain for each block, which would mean that parallel processing wont be possible!

[10-Aug-19 02:06 AM] jl777c#5810
also i am not 100% clear on the reversing nakamoto idea for VDT+PoS. do you mean to just start with the stake, add a time delay with VDT, and then submit the block? i guess the VDT needs to be below the bnTarget when hash combined with the txid of the staking utxo? with a divide by stake in the right place


[10-Aug-19 02:41 AM] jl777c#5810
with a utxo system, the stake will be scattered across a lot of different utxo, so i think it needs to do the VDT based on the pubkey and then given the output hash of the VDT, all the utxo can be hashed with the VDT and then divided by the specific value of each utxo and compare to bnTarget


[10-Aug-19 03:08 AM] zawy#5864
I tried to make the "reverse nakamoto consensus" section with the 1 to 7 bullets clear and precise enough to code.  Yes, that's the order. The big advantage of the VDF is that it allows the cnosensus voters to be "permissionless".  They do not need permission to join the vote which is required in non-VDF POS. non VDF POS requires all stakers to register their existance and lock up stake.  The VDF automatically locks stake in each vote.  You only need to prove you were a staker if you won the election.  This is why his 1st paragraph in "why POS fails" does not apply.  His next arguing point  seems to depend on stakers being a very small part of the amount of total coin, less than 1%.  My scheme requires a large portion of coin holders to be running a node which is also a "miner" and they do it for free..  A problem with all POW and POS is that people want no central authority and yet they want to pay others to vote for them in consensus  That's deeply flawed. Freedom is not free.  If you don't want a central authority, then do your share of the voting AND record all the results of all the votes.


[10-Aug-19 03:14 AM] zawy#5864
pubkey sounds like a good idea


[10-Aug-19 03:15 AM] zawy#5864
but finding out what your solvetime will be is fast and easy


[10-Aug-19 03:17 AM] zawy#5864
so you can cycle through them all. .


[10-Aug-19 03:17 AM] jl777c#5810
utxo based staking doesnt seem to need explicit permission, just having a utxo is enough. but you mean with the VDF we dont need to use coinage?


[10-Aug-19 03:18 AM] zawy#5864
Your probability of having a short solvetime is proportional to the coin in the utxo


[10-Aug-19 03:19 AM] zawy#5864
```solvetime = 2*RandValue*TargetSolvetime*Difficulty/(UTXO qty)```


[10-Aug-19 03:19 AM] jl777c#5810
only the amount then, yes that is an improvement, but without the actual VDF value, it seems you cant tell if a specific utxo wins or not, so the VDF must be based on something like the pubkey, height, prevhash


[10-Aug-19 03:20 AM] zawy#5864
The randvalue here is key


[10-Aug-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
the VDF value would be the same for all utxo for the same pubkey


[10-Aug-19 03:20 AM] jl777c#5810
and becomes the randvalue


[10-Aug-19 03:21 AM] jl777c#5810
so all staker need to use a CPU core calculating the VDF value each block


[10-Aug-19 03:21 AM] zawy#5864
the rand value is generated from the pubkey and previous VDF output but not the previous block hash in order to prevent being able to construct blocks that give you a better chance in the next round


[10-Aug-19 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, prevent stakers from grinding


[10-Aug-19 03:22 AM] jl777c#5810
so hash (pubkey + prev VDF) is the rand value


[10-Aug-19 03:23 AM] jl777c#5810
then you just use the smallest value utxo that would solve the block


[10-Aug-19 03:26 AM] zawy#5864
After Chia finally released their paper this summer, it seems they are also doing a "reverse" process.....but they noticed that the timestamp also allows grinding which I didn't.  So they came up with a difficulty algorithms that I know is a disaster in POW.  It very likely is not be a disaster if everyone is consistently voting (not doing on-off mining) which may be the case here because there are no minnig profits.  But I have a long section decribing the problem and a different DA to handle it.  But now that I think about it, their solution may be fine in my scheme (but maybe not theirs because they were considering paying farmers).


[10-Aug-19 03:27 AM] zawy#5864
Another possibility is that I don't allow miners to assign a timestamp.....they simply must add the solvetime they calculate to the previous timestamp


[10-Aug-19 03:28 AM] zawy#5864
So the time cuold get far off from eral time which must be why I did not do that...but that does nto seem to be a problem


[10-Aug-19 03:29 AM] jl777c#5810
why not make elapsed time part of the solving?


[10-Aug-19 03:29 AM] zawy#5864
I think I thought of that and said "heck, let them pick a timestamp" without realizing it opened a grinding attack, so I may make that change and delete that whole paragraph


[10-Aug-19 03:30 AM] jl777c#5810
then all will be incentivized to future date it as much as possible, but with FTL of 4, there is not much room for that


[10-Aug-19 03:30 AM] jl777c#5810
```solvetime = 2*RandValue*TargetSolvetime*Difficulty/((UTXO qty)*f(tipdiff))```


[10-Aug-19 03:30 AM] zawy#5864
a future time here in the timestamps does not help


[10-Aug-19 03:31 AM] jl777c#5810
if it is in the divisor, it seems to help reduce solve time


[10-Aug-19 03:33 AM] zawy#5864
tipdiff always  = solvetime in my mind in that equation so I'm having trouble seeing the implication


[10-Aug-19 03:34 AM] jl777c#5810
it just motivates all stakers to set the timestamp as close to realtime as possible


[10-Aug-19 03:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and to submit the block as soon as their stake+tipdiff solves the block


[10-Aug-19 03:35 AM] jl777c#5810
the VDF will take different amounts of time on different systems


[10-Aug-19 03:35 AM] zawy#5864
but it should motivate +FTL error per block


[10-Aug-19 03:35 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe 3:1 ratio or more


[10-Aug-19 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
yes everyone will try to push as close to FTL border as possible, but with FTL of 4... pushing it even 1 second risks some nodes rejecting it


[10-Aug-19 03:36 AM] jl777c#5810
and 1 or 2 seconds shouldnt matter so much with the right f(tipdiff)


[10-Aug-19 03:37 AM] jl777c#5810
just enough to incentivize using correct timestamp


[10-Aug-19 03:41 AM] zawy#5864
But any ability to change solvetime  allows a grinding attack...he can try all N-possible  timestamps and run them all through a VDF at same time privately, then he does it again for each of those VDF outputs, needing to run N\*N VDFs in parallel in the next block height.....maybe he can do 3 or more generations ...he can then choose which path of timestamp selection that  increased his chances of winning by I think N, amplifying his apparent stake by N


[10-Aug-19 03:45 AM] jl777c#5810
the tipdiff needs to not affect the VDF solvetime, but affect the bnTarget comparison then


[10-Aug-19 03:52 AM] zawy#5864
But bnTarget in the disguise of Diffiulty above would affect   solvetime   , right?


[10-Aug-19 03:53 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is VDF delaytime and a separate solvetime


[10-Aug-19 03:54 AM] zawy#5864
hmmm


[10-Aug-19 03:54 AM] zawy#5864
another field in the header.....I think that would be good


[10-Aug-19 03:54 AM] jl777c#5810
so it needs to have a delaytime at a minimum added to the prior timestamp, in addition to tipdiff based bnTarget calc


[10-Aug-19 03:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i think both are able to be calculated without any additional field needed


[10-Aug-19 03:56 AM] jl777c#5810
this way it seems that even if you can calcualate VDF at 3x realtime speeds, it wont help


[10-Aug-19 03:56 AM] jl777c#5810
as you still need the tipdiff to advance


[10-Aug-19 03:57 AM] jl777c#5810
without this, just relying on VDF solve seems to give the fastest CPU a big edge


[10-Aug-19 03:57 AM] jl777c#5810
the latest i99999 would certainly calculate the VDF faster than a raspberry pi


[10-Aug-19 03:58 AM] zawy#5864
I may be in and out today, but I want  to discuss it to your exhaustion.


[10-Aug-19 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
but for PoS we would want to remove this CPU based advantage


[10-Aug-19 03:58 AM] jl777c#5810
with a small FTL, you can have it solved in half the time, but you would need to wait until it was eligible


[10-Aug-19 04:06 AM] jl777c#5810
without a tipdiff based equation, then the fastest CPU will win, given equal stake, so your staking power is CPU speed * stake


[10-Aug-19 04:19 AM] zawy#5864
The VDF should be implemented by special, possibly expensive, possibly ASIC, VDF or VDF server.  Ideally, everyone would buy their own VDF ASIC that should be small and cheap, except for development.  Chia is spending a lot of bounty on the fastest code.


[10-Aug-19 04:20 AM] zawy#5864
Chia envisions VDF servers.


[10-Aug-19 04:21 AM] zawy#5864
I'm thinking about your idea


[10-Aug-19 06:43 AM] zawy#5864
@jl777c   I am not clear on your idea.  Can you show me the logic+math that determines the next timestamp and VDF value?


[10-Aug-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
the staker would determine the next timestamp, most likely realtime due to slightly easier bnTarget the larger tipdiff is. the VDF is the same logic as yours, just adjusting the bnTarget via tipdiff (slightly)


[10-Aug-19 08:18 AM] zawy#5864
Being able to adjust bnTarget by just 2 options will double the attacker's solutions (effective stake) for the next block.


[10-Aug-19 08:19 AM] zawy#5864
solvetime affects VDF's random output that's used in next block

can we have a fixed solvetime for the VDF that way having N different timestamps doesnt change the first N that solves the block, so it doesnt seem like it increases the attackers solutions


[10-Aug-19 09:02 AM] zawy#5864
You need different solvetimes to prevent collisions.  I made the solvetime distribution flat so there would be fewer collisions than poisson.  If stake-rate is constant, a solution will be found in 0 to 2 x T. (  But if that's with 50% probability, I need to remove the 2.  )   Being able to change the POW's difficulty (not the VDF-POS) by the VDF-POS winners increasing or decreasing it by 0.01% per block is crucial to my coin idea.  So, to keep VDF on track with real time (the problem here) they could also vote to change the  conversion factor between real time and current VDF rate by 0.01%, but the change is delayed 500 blocks.


[10-Aug-19 09:03 AM] zawy#5864
delayed so they do not get the benefit of  this 1-bit grind doubling thier chances in the next block


[10-Aug-19 09:05 AM] jl777c#5810
i was thinking in terms of just replacing an existing utxo staking with VDF-PoS


[10-Aug-19 09:06 AM] jl777c#5810
wouldnt different amounts in utxo get different solvetimes?


[10-Aug-19 09:06 AM] zawy#5864
yes


[10-Aug-19 09:07 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the pubkey needs to be part of the random, to make each staker get different solvetimes


[10-Aug-19 09:10 AM] zawy#5864
The solvetime must be based on the stake.  If he used the pubkey, he would still have to prove he owns all utxo's that sum to the stake QTY in the denominator......so it seems he might as well check every UTXO he has instead.  Also, he could mix and match UTXOs for different quantities to grind, unless the validator knows that he used all UTXO's that exist for that pubkey.


[10-Aug-19 09:11 AM] zawy#5864
I am assuming you mean use pubkey so that he does not have to check every UTXO


[10-Aug-19 09:13 AM] zawy#5864
The security comes from stakers not wanting the coin to be attacked because they would lose value.


[10-Aug-19 09:14 AM] zawy#5864
Similarly, miners do not want BTC to be attacked because of the stake they have in equipment.


[10-Aug-19 09:21 AM] zawy#5864
Replace that POW stake in equip and with  HR as a commodity in the free market (rentals) then BTC has zero security.  POW is a POS scheme that is different  because the stake in POW is locked up in the machine churning out hashes during the vote.  Also different because the POW stake is off-chain, but the miner is trying to get that off-chain stake converted to on-chain stake.  So the time order is reversed.    A government wanting to take over BTC would have to buy $2B of equipment, about the cost of a bomber.  But if BTC had this scheme and everyone ran a node, it would cost the government $100 B plus the massive increase in price that buying coin would cause, if the government had not been secretly buying up coin from the beginning.


[10-Aug-19 09:22 AM] zawy#5864
But if the government owns a lot of the coin....it might not want to harm it


[10-Aug-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the total value of all the utxo is what sets the VDF initial VDF time, but the actual utxo used would extend it? still not sure how the VDF fits into the staking picture precisely


[10-Aug-19 09:24 AM] jl777c#5810
i think of things in terms of the actual list of utxos for a pubkey, some calculation happens for each utxo, which is compared to a bnTarget, with adjustment for utxo size (and tipdiff?) involved in the equation. without seeing the actual bnTarget equation, i am sort of blind about the details


[10-Aug-19 09:25 AM] zawy#5864
difficulty is set by past solvetimes.    It is an estimate of the total amount of stake participating, without having any clue as to actual UTXOs that are out there, just the ones that find a solvetime


[10-Aug-19 09:25 AM] zawy#5864
this is exactly like POW and it's the miracle of Nakamoto consensus


[10-Aug-19 09:31 AM] zawy#5864
traditional consensus made voters register and then gave them a time period to vote.  Then everyone counts the votes to see the result from the  majority of the registered voters.   Nakamoto turned the distributed consensus world upside down by using the voting period  to measure the number of voters.   In addition, the traditional scheme required every voter to digital sign their votes to get 50% instead of 33% protection.   But POW only need to check the hash.   Traditional hasw massive communication: registering, counting every digitally signed vote.   Nakamoto needs only 1 vote from 1 previously anonymous voter to prove he won the election.


[10-Aug-19 09:31 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, i understood that part from your articles


[10-Aug-19 09:32 AM] zawy#5864
Oh i didn't remember i mentionde digitally signing....ok great


[10-Aug-19 09:32 AM] jl777c#5810
with utxo based staking, it seems like other than the entropy that might be grinded, it can be quite similar


[10-Aug-19 09:33 AM] jl777c#5810
absence of a winning submission and solvetime determines the size of the electorate


[10-Aug-19 09:34 AM] zawy#5864
```bnTarget = avg(N prev targets) * avg(N solvetimes) / T```


[10-Aug-19 09:35 AM] zawy#5864
same as always


[10-Aug-19 09:35 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, and how is the "hash" calculated that is compared to the bnTarget


[10-Aug-19 09:38 AM] zawy#5864
```solvetime = 2*RandValue*TargetSolvetime*2^256/target/(UTXO qty)
hash = RandValue / (UTXO qty)```


[10-Aug-19 09:38 AM] zawy#5864
```Randvalue = function(UTXO, pubkey, previous VDFout)```


[10-Aug-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so there is a different VDF out for each utxo?


[10-Aug-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
how can a node calculate that efficiently


[10-Aug-19 09:39 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, previous VDF out. what is the current VDFout and how does it factor into things?


[10-Aug-19 09:40 AM] zawy#5864
You do not need to run a VDF  (or pay a central server) unless you get a fast solvetime


[10-Aug-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so you scan all your utxo, find the smallest one that would win a block, then obtain a VDF to be able to submit the new block


[10-Aug-19 09:41 AM] jl777c#5810
and the VDF delay time needs to match the solvetime from above


[10-Aug-19 09:43 AM] zawy#5864
```VDFout = eval(solvetime,Seed)
seed = functionA(UTXO, pubkey, previous VDFout)
RandValue  = normalize 0 to 1 the hash(seed)```


[10-Aug-19 09:44 AM] zawy#5864
```eval() also returns proof VDF was solved```


[10-Aug-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
and the timestamp needs to be exactly solvetime more than past block?


[10-Aug-19 09:44 AM] jl777c#5810
why cant it be >= solvetime more than past block


[10-Aug-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
if only the hash is made a bit smaller based on tipdiff, it doesnt allow grinding


[10-Aug-19 09:45 AM] jl777c#5810
as solvetime is not affected


[10-Aug-19 09:46 AM] zawy#5864
Hash affects ST which affects VDFout


[10-Aug-19 09:46 AM] zawy#5864
```hash = RandValue / (UTXO qty)```


[10-Aug-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
how?


[10-Aug-19 09:47 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe the next solvetime


[10-Aug-19 09:47 AM] zawy#5864
Yes, that's the grinding attack...increases chances for next block


[10-Aug-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
```hash = RandValue /( (UTXO qty)*f(tipdiff))```


[10-Aug-19 09:48 AM] jl777c#5810
how can changing tipdiff allow grinding, the hash just gets smaller and smaller. it either wins or doesnt


[10-Aug-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
if it wins, getting smaller wont make it win anymore. and you would submit the first timestamp that wins


[10-Aug-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
within FTL


[10-Aug-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
Randvalue = function(UTXO, pubkey, previous VDFout)


[10-Aug-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
entropy source is not affected by the timestamp directly


[10-Aug-19 09:49 AM] jl777c#5810
VDFout is unchanged


[10-Aug-19 09:50 AM] zawy#5864
It seems if he wins by 10 seconds, then he can choose 10 different solvetimes


[10-Aug-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
but the timestamp goes into the block and doesnt change the txid


[10-Aug-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
using the utxo txid allows grinding


[10-Aug-19 09:50 AM] zawy#5864
Changes VDFout


[10-Aug-19 09:50 AM] jl777c#5810
no, i am saying that the calculated solvetime is not changed


[10-Aug-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
just the hash calculation of whether it is lower than bnTarget


[10-Aug-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
nothing else changes


[10-Aug-19 09:51 AM] jl777c#5810
indirectly if the DAA is using timestamps, maybe you can affect things, but make the DAA use the solvetime that is calculated


[10-Aug-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
that avoids the grinding via indirect timestamp changing to change the next solvetime


[10-Aug-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
but there is risk to delaying the timestamp


[10-Aug-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
as you need to wait longer due to small FTL and can easily lose the block


[10-Aug-19 09:52 AM] jl777c#5810
this does also spread out the timing of submissions


[10-Aug-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
it also allows nodes that cant calculate VDF within solvetime to still have a chance


[10-Aug-19 09:53 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe its not a big deal


[10-Aug-19 09:54 AM] zawy#5864
if he gets an improbaby fast solve with tipdiff then he can run 10 different VDFs for 10 different tipdiffs going into future by 1 second each, risking no one else with a solve in next 10 seconds.  He gets 10x more opportunity in next block


[10-Aug-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
but i am saying that there is only a SINGLE valid VDF solvetime


[10-Aug-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
only a single valid VDF that is not based on tipdiff


[10-Aug-19 09:55 AM] zawy#5864
OK, then what is the tipdiff-affected hash being used for if not to reduce the solvetime?


[10-Aug-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
changes an otherwise losing hash to a winning one


[10-Aug-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
this also allows to adapt to large changes in amount staking


[10-Aug-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
at least large drops


[10-Aug-19 09:56 AM] jl777c#5810
the VDF Solvetime is not changed


[10-Aug-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
only whether a hash wins or not is changed by tipdiff


[10-Aug-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess this will affect the next solvetime if you use timestamps to calculate that, but i am saying ignore the timestamp, only use the "VDF Solvetime" for the DAA


[10-Aug-19 09:57 AM] jl777c#5810
make the tipdiff not affect the next Solvetime, nor the current VDF


[10-Aug-19 10:03 AM] zawy#5864
```solvetime = 2*RandValue * T / avg(N prev STs) / avg(N prev Targets)  / QTY   /   f(tipdiff) ```  What is the f() ?


[10-Aug-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
no, dont change the solvetime


[10-Aug-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
just the hash evaluation


[10-Aug-19 10:04 AM] jl777c#5810
f() is a "soft" function, maybe a very weak exp()


[10-Aug-19 10:05 AM] zawy#5864
Make the hash harder than ST requires?  Validator is checking both VDF and tipdiff?


[10-Aug-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
make the hash solve gradually harder and harder bnTarget, so over time the hash used becomes smaller and smaller


[10-Aug-19 10:06 AM] jl777c#5810
yes all nodes would need to verify the VDF has the right solvetime and that the modified hash did indeed solve the bnTarget


[10-Aug-19 10:07 AM] zawy#5864
There would be a DA for the VDF and a DA for the tipdiff hash?


[10-Aug-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
no, just DA for VDF


[10-Aug-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
well maybe that wont work quite right


[10-Aug-19 10:09 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess torn between preventing grinding and precise DA


[10-Aug-19 10:10 AM] zawy#5864
I thought my idea here to let block-winner set a conversion between VDF and realtime is probably ideal...we sort of need to know that value directly and it prevents the grinding.


[10-Aug-19 10:10 AM] zawy#5864
slowly set with 0.01% change per block


[10-Aug-19 10:11 AM] zawy#5864
More generally, I want the stakers to have more control of coin parameters than devs


[10-Aug-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
that gets into powers not available for using VDF-PoS in an existing blockchain


[10-Aug-19 10:11 AM] jl777c#5810
which is the first step that makes sense to do


[10-Aug-19 10:11 AM] zawy#5864
they can react to market and real world conditions


[10-Aug-19 10:12 AM] jl777c#5810
with tipdiff making otherwise losing hashes win, pretty sure we can get pretty immediate very close to realtime timestamps


[10-Aug-19 10:12 AM] zawy#5864
I don't understand this ```not available for using VDF-PoS in an existing blockchain```


[10-Aug-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
existing chains are not setup to change chainparams with every block


[10-Aug-19 10:13 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess i can add that as anything can eventually be done, but it would be more work to do just that, than everything else combined


[10-Aug-19 10:17 AM] zawy#5864
To get the all-important constant value without fiat, stakers need to set difficulty for the POW to mine coins in self-hashing txns.  Being able to surive 51% without BTC like my scheme is supposed to do is good, but the real power is if it can be made stable value without fiat.....a big experiment to see if stakers will act to get constant value as I hope.    Speculation greatly reduced, merchants not needing to worry about price fluctuations.


[10-Aug-19 10:18 AM] jl777c#5810
i solved stable coins using a different method


[10-Aug-19 10:18 AM] zawy#5864
Everyone can join now, or later, and rent mining equipement to get any amount of coin.


[10-Aug-19 10:19 AM] zawy#5864
Ok, tell me your method


[10-Aug-19 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
decentralized so users decide when to issue more coins, or when to take coins out of circulation


[10-Aug-19 10:19 AM] jl777c#5810
it is in #cc-pegs channel, a page up from current is a decent description of it


[10-Aug-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
i dont think the VDF-PoS needs to be conflated with stable coin, that seems an independent thing that can be done regardless of mining algo


[10-Aug-19 10:20 AM] jl777c#5810
of course, even if they are independent, they can always be combined


[10-Aug-19 10:21 AM] jl777c#5810
i also have a way to get DTO (decentralized trustless oracle) so we can force the chain to adjust to actual fiat values

Decentralized trustless oracles (DTO) by piggybacking on timestamp...
Trustless oracles are quite a difficult problem, at least it was until I came up with a simple method that implements them.


[10-Aug-19 10:26 AM] zawy#5864
a  peg.....I'm talking about not having a peg to anything other than constant real-world cost to mine... not in dollars but in whatever buyers and sellers think constant value means, assuming stakers act in the best interest of stable value.    If moore's law were constant or predictable, I would not need the stakers to act as an oracle of current mining costs.


[10-Aug-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
not sure, interesting idea, but it seems small holders would vote to increase, but large ones to decrease to protect their existing stake


[10-Aug-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
VEO is a coin that had the miners vote on blockreward


[10-Aug-19 10:28 AM] jl777c#5810
it rapidly went to the smallest amount and it only has 60,000 supply


[10-Aug-19 10:31 AM] zawy#5864
Does its price on an exchange keep a more stable value?


[10-Aug-19 10:32 AM] jl777c#5810
no, as volatile as any other crypto


[10-Aug-19 10:33 AM] jl777c#5810
but they werent instructed to peg to a fiat, their self interest made them shrink the reward


[10-Aug-19 10:38 AM] zawy#5864
There can be many coins using this  scheme, but only ones with constant value should gain in popularity.   So current miners in VEO must also be large stakers.  I need to take a good look at VEO.  Even if it is not a perdictor of how my scheme would go, it's a valuable data point in understanding feedback


[10-Aug-19 10:38 AM] jl777c#5810
it is a PoW coin, but has the concept of miners voting on rewards


[10-Aug-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
but this is why i think it makes sense to separate out the various parts of your proposed DAG


[10-Aug-19 10:39 AM] zawy#5864
Yes but it's not clear to me that my idea would work out any different.


[10-Aug-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
each can be tested and tuned in isolation


[10-Aug-19 10:39 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why i suggested using DTO to force it to match some sort of fiat value


[10-Aug-19 10:41 AM] zawy#5864
Yeah, for sure, if it's hard (or pointless as in the VEO case) to do staker-directed emission, then I can have a normal emission schedule and two difficulties...1 for VDF-POS and 1 for POW.  Can you do self-hashing transactions?


[10-Aug-19 10:41 AM] zawy#5864
Self-hashing txns and a simple DAG seem like thay would have enormous interest.


[10-Aug-19 10:42 AM] zawy#5864
Automatically no pool


[10-Aug-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
i already have a -ac_txpow mode where each tx needs to have a txid that starts and ends with 0x00


[10-Aug-19 10:42 AM] jl777c#5810
so that needs average of 65536 signatures


[10-Aug-19 10:43 AM] jl777c#5810
takes about 20 seconds to a minute depending on system


[10-Aug-19 10:46 AM] zawy#5864
I think self-hashing txn is the best idea even if it's not as important.  It just seems way cool that anyone could turn on a machine, any machine , and have a  little coin they can trade. in a ittle while......except there needs to be a min limit the due to too many txns..... that would be automatic if there is a  fee per byte in txns that exponentially increases as blocks get near a limit.


[10-Aug-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
what i have is just an additional constraint on spending, you still need to get the coins in the first place


[10-Aug-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
if you are talking about each selfhashed tx getting some new coins issued, that would be new code.


[10-Aug-19 10:49 AM] zawy#5864
The difficulty for POW in the header would be in units of  "coin  per hash" instead of  1/hashes required.


[10-Aug-19 10:51 AM] zawy#5864
The miner needs to know about what block he'll be finished in and he sets a target and then finds the nonce.  The actual hash isn't needed as there's no chain for coin distribution.


[10-Aug-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
crypto signatures are a good CPU algo as i am not aware of any ASIC for it, actually not even sure if GPU can speed it up that much, but not sure


[10-Aug-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
this can be simulated in an existing coin with a special CC that awards coins from the premine to each tx


[10-Aug-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
that would be the only way the premine could be spent


[10-Aug-19 10:52 AM] zawy#5864
The POW for coin creation should be the opposite of POW for consensus:  it must waste electricity as much as possible.  Consensus nedes all the expense in the value of the equipment.


[10-Aug-19 10:53 AM] zawy#5864
Ideally it will be rentable in an open market.....available to everyone at the same rate.....all the better if this also happens to be what a CPU can do

By wasting as much electricity as possible, the coin value is more closely connected with joules instead of speculation


[10-Aug-19 10:56 AM] zawy#5864
To be dreamy about the "ideal" it would *be* joules, transferrable over the internet, exchangeable for electricity anywhere, immediately.

Question, in launching a smart chain using antara, what are the drawbacks from AWS nodes for mining. Does the centralization of the nodes thru Amazon pose a threat to my project


[10-Aug-19 12:55 PM] jl777c#5810
having a few seed nodes being on AWS wont matter much as long as you will also be having people run full nodes


[10-Aug-19 01:06 PM] MCB999#4841
And that  @jl777c comes with building a community, correct? Would it be wise to have more than just seed nodes running on AWS initially until a community of ppl start to develop


[10-Aug-19 01:11 PM] jl777c#5810
unless you are making a corporate chain, it seems without any users it is better to get a few users. just need half a dozen to start. i guess another way to look at it is if you cant get half a dozen people interested enough in your project, then probably a bit more work is needed on getting users side of things


[10-Aug-19 05:28 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
I am very interested in this new type of coin creation, what @zawy  is describing i know there are already interested parties on open market/exchangability end of things for a coin production tied to electricity consumption


[10-Aug-19 06:15 PM] zawy#5864
I was being really dreamy about what the ideal currency would be. I meant literally putting a kilowatt hour into a ball you could magically transfer over the internet. I'm only interested in a stable stable coin (without a peg to fiat) which would be creatde by explicitly wasting POW electricity. It's more efficient over the long term because there is no energy waste for consensus.


[10-Aug-19 06:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The idea of a ‚Äústable‚Äù stablecoin  without pegging  and proportional to electricity expenditure is what I was referring to in regards to interested parties .   Very much along the lines of what you are describing

not sure how to store the electricity on the blockchain, so redeeming it could be a problem. maybe with a physical coin, there can be something that is charged up and so possession of the coin allowed to actually use the stored energy. and somehow its usage can be detected and updated on the blockchain. seems a few years before we have all the tech for such

You pay for things with energy, you buy food with energy, you buy things that increase your energy storage/regeneration


[11-Aug-19 02:28 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Your net worth is backed by the amount of energy that you have, that you can create, that you control. Holy hell, think about that. We use/d gold as the backing for currency, then created something that represented it (dollars). Why not create something that represents what is the driving factor of the modern world, energy.


[11-Aug-19 04:30 AM] dukeleto#7326
Private keys are a way to store energy. You just can't get it back out.

Consistent value in various contexts is the source of money's prop...
An ideal money has the same value in all relevant contexts or "dimensions".¬† The numerous properties ascribed to money are just referring th...


[11-Aug-19 07:31 AM] zawy#5864
The ideal currency  is constant value in all context As part if this it is proportional to the net work (energy) output for a given  time period (velocity) of the commodity infrastructure that it controls. It's the control of net work.    However, 3 people actually showing an interest (or misunderstanding that I was being both serious and ridiculous)  in "ball of energy" got me thinking about it.  The ball of energy is not supposed to be exactly energy, but should store,  transfer, and release of  net work energy.  Joules of heat are completely useless, or at least wasteful if driging a steam engine.   But look at this: we work for money and that work we do puts some amount of net energy into society.  Then we spend that money to extract net work energy back out.  So although it is more immediately precise to say money is control of net work energy, the amount of currency in our hand is a control of a ball of energy floating around in society.  If law and economics are acting correctly we put that energy out there in exchange for the bills and the bills can extract it back out.

Szabo's comments on currency are very interesing and true. He reveals some interesting things such as pointing out a history of use and cost of creation are often the foundation of money.  This is extremely important to how we view BTC.  My article is trying to give a better and deeper picture  of the forest.


[11-Aug-19 09:19 AM] polycryptoblog#1173

@jl777c These are the 0.5% per blk numerator constants for W=2 to 16 if denominator is 100.   I could not find a simple equation to generate this.  Let me know if you want to go to a higher or lower trigger threshold than 0.5%  My belief is that they will not provide much help over 2, 3, 6, 12, but if  your code is well-suited to scanning and doing these, here they are.  I just started trying to mimic what you're doing today. This was a preliminary step.


[11-Aug-19 10:27 AM] jl777c#5810
i ended up going with 1, 2, 3, 6, 12 and it is working very well. it does get occasional false positives, but in such cases it almost always catches up and stops after half a dozen or less blocks and really it seems that false positives only balances out the normal luck based fluctuations


[11-Aug-19 10:35 AM] zawy#5864
What is your W = 1 num/denom?


[11-Aug-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
1/60 if blocktime is 60


[11-Aug-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
if over 100, then 1/100


[11-Aug-19 11:10 AM] jl777c#5810
if less than 60, it is disabled


[11-Aug-19 01:26 PM] zawy#5864
You changed the < to <=  ?  If it is too sensitive you can try another trigger on a W = 2 that includes tipdiff as the 2nd block with num/den = 8/100 ....but it will require different RST equations


[11-Aug-19 01:26 PM] zawy#5864
I mean sum 1 < 1/60 should never trigger.


[11-Aug-19 01:27 PM] zawy#5864
But <= will


[11-Aug-19 01:27 PM] zawy#5864
And it will not hardly affect RST


[11-Aug-19 01:28 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, i adjusted for the 1 case


[12-Aug-19 01:34 AM] zawy#5864

mostly just the initial 9x attack, then after a while down to a single core mining. mostly testing the false positive activations. overall blocktimes are close to 60 seconds


[12-Aug-19 01:42 AM] jl777c#5810
pretty confident that any large hashrate is just stopped in its tracks and the ave blocktime for the duration is back to normal


[12-Aug-19 01:42 AM] jl777c#5810
there was going to be some testing of timewarp attacks, but so far it is not working


[12-Aug-19 01:44 AM] zawy#5864
MTP=1 and FTL=4?


[12-Aug-19 01:44 AM] zawy#5864
@jl777c 4-second timestamp attacks?


[12-Aug-19 01:46 AM] jl777c#5810
probably the reason it was hard to get working, i think a 51% attack is combined to rewrite past 7 blocks and then make then 1 second from each other to get exp() diff many times


[12-Aug-19 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
@Alright can explain clearer what he was trying, but so far it only ends up on an orphaned chain


[12-Aug-19 01:47 AM] zawy#5864
what was hard to get working?


[12-Aug-19 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
the attack that most likely is not possible


[12-Aug-19 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
truly impossible things tend to be hard to get working


[12-Aug-19 01:48 AM] zawy#5864
you mean the best attack you can think of is not working?


[12-Aug-19 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
i think anything done to gain time, ends up triggering RST


[12-Aug-19 01:48 AM] zawy#5864
so everything is good?


[12-Aug-19 01:48 AM] jl777c#5810
so far, no known attacks


[12-Aug-19 01:48 AM] zawy#5864
I can tell you the best way to attack....let me think


[12-Aug-19 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
RST changes the 51%, as to catch up 7 blocks, you need to do a lot more than 51% when RST kicks in. doesnt seem to matter how much, though at 10000x maybe you can brute force past 7 blocks (by then maybe 10 blocks and notarized)


[12-Aug-19 01:49 AM] jl777c#5810
so a very small window to do a very difficult thing to get a very minimal reward


[12-Aug-19 01:51 AM] zawy#5864
it will require on-off mining every block, and exploit the RST.  There should be a way to make it jump higher than yuor hashrate


[12-Aug-19 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
the 2 quick blocks and stop seems the only exposure


[12-Aug-19 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, just wait for 30 seconds on each block before mining


[12-Aug-19 01:51 AM] zawy#5864
OK, so the attack would be to get 2 blocks and set them both to 1 second


[12-Aug-19 01:51 AM] jl777c#5810
or 40, or 50, wherever you want to set your threshold, you get easier than the steady miner


[12-Aug-19 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
but if there are more than one doing this, RST kicks in


[12-Aug-19 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
what we might have here is a way to allow CPU to mine in conjunction with ASIC


[12-Aug-19 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
certainly the ASIC will get blocks, but so can the CPU. whether it is fair to get more blocks per unit time with 10000x the hashrate, well it doesnt seem so wrong. and if ASIC are mining steadily, then the CPU cant mine


[12-Aug-19 01:53 AM] zawy#5864
lol, yeah, if CPU can mine on-off and ASIC can't, then all CPU miners cheat by design?


[12-Aug-19 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, need half a dozen such chains and CPU miners will have a really good ROI


[12-Aug-19 01:54 AM] zawy#5864
I supposed there's no way to make CPU advantageous over GPU


[12-Aug-19 01:54 AM] jl777c#5810
and two blocks of 1 seconds each is only a 118 second deficit, which is made up in half a dozen blocks


[12-Aug-19 01:55 AM] zawy#5864
try to cause oscillations.....during active triggers, have big miner set 1 second


[12-Aug-19 01:55 AM] jl777c#5810
there are ways, like verushash2.0 that equalizes CPU and fpga to a large degree. GPU mining is just 10x worse than cpu


[12-Aug-19 01:55 AM] zawy#5864
when difficulty is easy


[12-Aug-19 01:56 AM] jl777c#5810
such things happen already. miners get lucky and mine at 100x the actual hashrate


[12-Aug-19 01:56 AM] jl777c#5810
then RST kicks in, but exp() needs to rescue it


[12-Aug-19 01:56 AM] jl777c#5810
now diff is back to 1


[12-Aug-19 01:56 AM] jl777c#5810
and easy blocks happen and RST kicks in again


[12-Aug-19 01:57 AM] zawy#5864
OK, I'll look at your data.  I shoudl be doing spreadsheet testing today...don't know when I'll have your code inside modellign


[12-Aug-19 01:58 AM] zawy#5864
I'll send it to you when it looks like the spreadhseet is close to your code.


[12-Aug-19 02:30 AM] zawy#5864
@jl777c  If RST is active whenever targetB column is zero, it looks like something is wrong because the last block in a series should always be >60


[12-Aug-19 02:32 AM] zawy#5864
unless a longer window is triggered, but that's not what's happening


[12-Aug-19 02:33 AM] zawy#5864
block 268 is a good example


[12-Aug-19 02:34 AM] jl777c#5810
RST is dormant if targetB is 0


[12-Aug-19 02:35 AM] jl777c#5810
i see what you mean, but there was a 481 right before it. maybe there is an off by 1


[12-Aug-19 02:37 AM] zawy#5864
block 1224 is just the opposite....it should not have shut off at that point


[12-Aug-19 02:44 AM] jl777c#5810
28 seconds for prior 3 blocks


[12-Aug-19 02:44 AM] jl777c#5810
aha! what happened was the exp() kicked in on 1225


[12-Aug-19 02:46 AM] zawy#5864
It looks like W=12 should have kicked in at 262 which is 2 blocks ahead of when it did


[12-Aug-19 02:46 AM] zawy#5864
i mean 263


[12-Aug-19 02:46 AM] zawy#5864
oh, W+1


[12-Aug-19 02:48 AM] zawy#5864
OK, so how did 336 and 337 be the last two in triggered state when both are < T?


[12-Aug-19 02:50 AM] jl777c#5810
27 and 25 are less that the 7, 2, 3 second blocks that triggered this


[12-Aug-19 02:50 AM] jl777c#5810
but it is strange indeed as the deficit isnt made up unless solvetime > T


[12-Aug-19 02:51 AM] zawy#5864
I can't see why that sequence began


[12-Aug-19 02:52 AM] jl777c#5810
268 is the first one that did this, so it is only in the false positive sequences


[12-Aug-19 02:52 AM] jl777c#5810
i think W=12 triggered it as many fast solves within 12 blocks


[12-Aug-19 02:53 AM] zawy#5864
The sum at that point was 9 instead of < 7


[12-Aug-19 02:54 AM] jl777c#5810
11 of 12 fast blocks


[12-Aug-19 02:55 AM] jl777c#5810
255 seconds for 12 blocks


[12-Aug-19 02:58 AM] zawy#5864
What?   255 for which 12?  Are you removing the longest solvetime or something?


[12-Aug-19 02:59 AM] jl777c#5810
i just added up the prior 12 solvetimes


[12-Aug-19 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
252 to 263


[12-Aug-19 03:00 AM] zawy#5864
Oh, sorry, I'm looking at block 330


[12-Aug-19 03:00 AM] jl777c#5810
13, 35, 78, 6, 17, 75, 33, 17, 4, 35, 7, 6


[12-Aug-19 03:01 AM] zawy#5864
Also, the trigger is W+1 < T\*num/den


[12-Aug-19 03:02 AM] jl777c#5810
i thought that seemed too slow to catch the on/off miners


[12-Aug-19 03:02 AM] jl777c#5810
W of 3 needs 4 solvtimes?


[12-Aug-19 03:03 AM] zawy#5864
Yes, that's what I thought we did


[12-Aug-19 03:03 AM] jl777c#5810
to be in 30 seconds?


[12-Aug-19 03:03 AM] jl777c#5810
so it is 8x to trigger


[12-Aug-19 03:03 AM] zawy#5864
yes


[12-Aug-19 03:03 AM] zawy#5864
no


[12-Aug-19 03:04 AM] zawy#5864
it's a tricky possion effect......


[12-Aug-19 03:05 AM] zawy#5864
The hashrate of a blockchain is 2^256/avg(target) * T / (sum N solvetimes)  * (N-1)


[12-Aug-19 03:06 AM] zawy#5864
The average(1/avgSolvetime) is not the same as avgSolvetime because poisson distribution is not symmetrical


[12-Aug-19 03:06 AM] jl777c#5810
i understand i made it a bit more trigger happy, but the ave blocktime is still on track and this makes it harder to do on/off mining


[12-Aug-19 03:10 AM] zawy#5864
Yeah, it did seem a little more trigger happy.  What you have might be OK, but the thing to do is to raise the 0.5%.    330 looks like a good time to trigger, but my math is saying it's pretty sensitive


[12-Aug-19 03:12 AM] zawy#5864
So maybe the reason the last blocks are < 60 is because a W=12 window is rolling out the back of your  past setting


[12-Aug-19 03:12 AM] zawy#5864
so a short solve time gets discounted


[12-Aug-19 03:17 AM] zawy#5864
In the above eq for hashrate, our W is N-1...in other words
hashrate =  2^256/avg(target) * T / (sum W+1  solvetimes)  * W
We're checking if the Hashrate was unexpectedly high


[12-Aug-19 03:19 AM] zawy#5864
6x in W=3


[12-Aug-19 03:20 AM] zawy#5864
But the goal is not to detect 6x with 50% chance per 3 blocks, but to not trigger at > 0..5%


[12-Aug-19 03:20 AM] zawy#5864
on accident


[12-Aug-19 03:21 AM] zawy#5864
I still can't figure out how 336 and 337 were the last two in the series


[12-Aug-19 03:21 AM] jl777c#5810
but based on how it behaves, a false positive trigger is really not any disaster


[12-Aug-19 03:59 AM] zawy#5864
Triggering on accident too often is not what concerns me, but that it's triggering under logic at the end that does not seem to be based on a weaker trigger. I wonder if it is actually using Digi Shield at that point


[12-Aug-19 04:03 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, all 0 means it is digishield (or exp() without RST)


[12-Aug-19 04:05 AM] zawy#5864
that means RST is active on 336 and 337 and I can't see why.  It could be a security risk, but in any event it seems  there is room for improvement

I agree that an FPGA is far more energy efficient. It looks like an equilibrium has been reached where FPGAs drop off Verus network in pursuit of more profitable coins. The only real victim of the new algo is the GPU (for now, nobody knows what the future will bring)

@jl777c it depends on how the cumulative proof of work is calculated, ie how many easy diff blocks I have to mine to surpass pow of real chain to reorg it. 

Invalidate 7 minutes(or more) worth of blocks, you can now mine at minimum diff because local time - prev blocktime  is >7 minutes. Now mine blocks at prev blocktime+1 and you can mine a lot of consecutive blocks at min diff


[12-Aug-19 10:46 AM] Alright#0419
maybe not possible if you're competing with other miners, but if a chain was legitimately stalled for 7 minutes, you can shit out a ton of blocks I believe


[12-Aug-19 10:46 AM] jl777c#5810
have you tried just trying to mine a lot of blocks using ASIC when diff is 3?


[12-Aug-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
after a few blocks, diff skyrockets


[12-Aug-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
best you try just normal mining to see how it works first


[12-Aug-19 10:47 AM] Alright#0419
haven't been able to get it working, thinking something in this branch changed invalidateblock's behavior somehow


[12-Aug-19 10:47 AM] jl777c#5810
prevblocktime +1 will rapidly boost the diff to 300k


[12-Aug-19 10:47 AM] Alright#0419
why would diff skyrocket if local time - prev blocktime is still >7?


[12-Aug-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
just try it first without 51% thrown in


[12-Aug-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
sure you can get a few easy blocks


[12-Aug-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
but then it become much harder


[12-Aug-19 10:48 AM] jl777c#5810
in the meantime the mainchain keeps going as normal


[12-Aug-19 10:49 AM] Alright#0419
maybe I'm missing something here


[12-Aug-19 10:49 AM] Alright#0419
diff *will* skyrocket if there are say 10 consecutive blocks 1 second apart(blocktime) even if local time - prev blocktime = >7 minutes?


[12-Aug-19 10:50 AM] jl777c#5810
the 7 minutes is from blocktime, not localtime


[12-Aug-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
you can get one easy block, ok, but now the blocks are 1 second solve time. another, now two fast solves and the RST kicks in


[12-Aug-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
just try it


[12-Aug-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
it sounds like you havent even tried to mine normally

something is wrong with my setup, was fighting it for hours yesterday


[12-Aug-19 10:51 AM] jl777c#5810
usually if you ASIC a digishield chain that is at CPU diff, you get a few hundred easy blocks, before diff adjusts


[12-Aug-19 10:52 AM] jl777c#5810
with adaptivepow, you will get half a dozen, at most

just try mining normally before trying to devise an attack


[12-Aug-19 10:55 AM] Alright#0419
would need to mine blocks prevtime +7 minutes


[12-Aug-19 10:55 AM] Alright#0419
and would have to invalidate many many blocks or would hit the future time rule very quickly


[12-Aug-19 10:56 AM] jl777c#5810
again, just try to mine normally to get a feel for how it responds before trying to devise an attack


[12-Aug-19 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
always mining at maximum timestamp prevtime+4(?) will give a slight advantage, no?


[12-Aug-19 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
oh sorry, local time + 4


[12-Aug-19 11:42 AM] Alright#0419
so setting system clock 3-4 seconds in the future will give a slight mining advantage


[12-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Alright#0419
also stratums will definitely need some tweaks so that they mine at the correct diff


[12-Aug-19 11:51 AM] Alright#0419
how often will diff lower if chain is stuck? just constantly?


[12-Aug-19 11:52 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, during the same block


[12-Aug-19 11:52 AM] Alright#0419
I mean there isn't like a specific timeframe?


[12-Aug-19 11:52 AM] Alright#0419
like 1 second, diff lowers, another second, diff lowers


[12-Aug-19 11:53 AM] Alright#0419
diff is just lowering constantly?


[12-Aug-19 11:53 AM] Alright#0419

in blocktemplate at least


[12-Aug-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
if in RST or exp() mode, diff is adjusting every second

8 million diff


[12-Aug-19 12:31 PM] jl777c#5810
seems 2 fast blocks and now very hard diff so exp() needs to kick in


[12-Aug-19 12:34 PM] jl777c#5810
will take another 10 minutes for the 8 million diff to come into CPU range


[12-Aug-19 12:35 PM] jl777c#5810
@Alright was this real hashrate, or timestamp fiddling?


[12-Aug-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
8 million is the highest diff we have seen during testing, 1.2 million was the previous high


[12-Aug-19 12:36 PM] jl777c#5810
interestingly it got there in 2 blocks


[12-Aug-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
solvetime of 1302 seconds


[12-Aug-19 12:48 PM] Alright#0419
was accidental timestamp fiddling üòÖ


[12-Aug-19 12:48 PM] Alright#0419
stratum got block template as soon as prev block came in


[12-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
then used curtime from that as blocktime


[12-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
and 1 block made the diff sky rocket


[12-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
was about to design an attack around that, should I?


[12-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Alright#0419
think I can make blocks take very long time on a CPU mined chain


[12-Aug-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
what is the attack? slowing down coin emission is not really an attack. speeding up coin emission would be


[12-Aug-19 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
yea, just slowing down blocks


[12-Aug-19 12:50 PM] Alright#0419
best I can think of so far


[12-Aug-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
if you can boost mining ROI somehow in a significant way, maybe it is a viable attack, but it seems that is not really the case


[12-Aug-19 12:50 PM] jl777c#5810
somehow the 8 million diff block was solved


[12-Aug-19 12:51 PM] Alright#0419
yes I saw that, dumb luck from my ASICs


[12-Aug-19 12:52 PM] Alright#0419
I think I can keep diff very high with minimal hashrate though


[12-Aug-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810
implied hashrate to solve 50 million diff


[12-Aug-19 12:52 PM] Alright#0419
sorry what?


[12-Aug-19 12:52 PM] jl777c#5810

so getting a couple fast blocks, not increasing coin emission


[12-Aug-19 12:57 PM] jl777c#5810
quite an improvement over status quo


[12-Aug-19 12:57 PM] Alright#0419
no, what just happened there is default behavior of knomp on one of these chains

solving a 8 million diff in 1 second?


[12-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Alright#0419
so if people start setting up stratums for these chains and don't realize they can't use p2p notify, we'll have problems


[12-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Alright#0419
it wasn't in a second


[12-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Alright#0419
it's because blocktemplate for knomp is only updated when a block comes in


[12-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Alright#0419
then it uses the "curtime" value for nTime


[12-Aug-19 12:58 PM] Alright#0419
which will always be the second after the block came in


[12-Aug-19 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
well it updates every 55 seconds


[12-Aug-19 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
so if it finds a block within those 55 seconds, it will always be +1 second


[12-Aug-19 12:59 PM] Alright#0419
and make diff go up


[12-Aug-19 12:59 PM] jl777c#5810
not optimal behavior for mining apow chains


[12-Aug-19 12:59 PM] Deleted User#0000
just make it use the nTime from the block template?


[12-Aug-19 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
only updates block template when block comes then every 55 seconds after that


[12-Aug-19 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
with p2p notify thing


[12-Aug-19 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
it's not a problem if stratum just uses rpc polling


[12-Aug-19 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
and does it very quickly


[12-Aug-19 01:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
so it need something to trigger it from daemon? or just poll more often?


[12-Aug-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
then it is mining at harder than required diff for 54 seconds


[12-Aug-19 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
yep


[12-Aug-19 01:00 PM] Alright#0419
look, doesn't matter


[12-Aug-19 01:01 PM] Alright#0419
just have to say "DON'T USE p2p NOTIFY"


[12-Aug-19 01:20 PM] Alright#0419
ok I think this can *kind of* be used to make money... well at least prevent others from making money while you switch off to something else

Let's say you have a switching setup, you're mining ZAWY24 and decide you want to switch to something else for a bit, you raise the diff to ridiculous levels, leave, mine something else then come back once diff normalizes?


[12-Aug-19 01:21 PM] Alright#0419
is basically the same as normal switching, but instead of gaining more blocks, you just make everyone else get less


[12-Aug-19 01:22 PM] Alright#0419
idk, still formulating ideas, I just find it strange that a miner can raise the diff(drastically) at will by changing nTime


[12-Aug-19 01:22 PM] jl777c#5810
a lot of DAA allow that, just to a lesser degree


[12-Aug-19 01:23 PM] jl777c#5810
but if you are using ASIC vs CPU, it is not clear you are gaining, i guess you can use CPU and fiddle timestamps, but not clear how much you can gain


[12-Aug-19 01:27 PM] Alright#0419
curious how the cumulative pow thing is affected by this(thing that determines when or when not to reorg to another chain)

like can I just keep mining at these massive diffs and the network not reorg to the honest chain(longer but less pow) because of it?


[12-Aug-19 01:30 PM] Alright#0419
ok let's say chain is at very high diff because of time stamp thing I just mentioned, it's stuck at block 100

honest miners wait until diff comes down and produce block 101 with low diff, then block 102, 103, 104, 105

I ignore their 101-105 and produce my own 101 at block 100+1 second and very high diff

if my 101 chain has >pow than their 105 chain, will the network jump back to my 101?


[12-Aug-19 01:30 PM] Alright#0419
then have to wait for diff to come down again

Since Litecoin blocks are 4 times faster than Bitcoin‚Äôs, the network can handle a sudden decrease in hashrate much better.

If 75% of hashrate disappears overnight, Litecoin just acts like Bitcoin for 2 wks (10 mins blks) and then diff retargets and everything is back to...

it sounds like everything is working like it should


[12-Aug-19 02:00 PM] jl777c#5810
yes. so far only nuisance attacks that dont make money


[12-Aug-19 02:01 PM] jl777c#5810
so for a low hashrate CPU mined chain, it seems just fine. and if the hashrate is high, much less room for attackers to play games


[12-Aug-19 02:03 PM] zawy#5864
The way to attack is to pester the public chain into higher average difficulties that reduces average rewards for mining.  Perhaps someone with 25% HR could assign a +1 stamp whenever he found a block..I'm not sure this can actually raise avg difficulty for others.....but if it can, and if it's like other chains where 70% of miners leave if difficulty rises 30%, then he can simulatneously do 5 to 10 block private mines and submit those.....at much lower difficulty cost due to the public chain not having gained much work due to 70% leaving.  After he submits, the difficulty is a lot lower, so normally a lot of miners jump back on.  So he could only do it periodically


[12-Aug-19 02:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but exp() sort of defeats this


[12-Aug-19 02:06 PM] zawy#5864
He would do it to try to be just below the level of exp() kicking in.  He only needs to make avg difficulty higher by say 30% to see a lot more than 30% of miners lose interest


[12-Aug-19 02:06 PM] jl777c#5810
but even RST activating will start adjusting the diff to the actual hashrate


[12-Aug-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure you can boost the diff 30% consistently without triggering RST


[12-Aug-19 02:07 PM] jl777c#5810
but in any case the coin emission is not increased, which is the bigger picture issue


[12-Aug-19 02:08 PM] zawy#5864
Yes, if my math and general idea is correct and the chain work uses the targetB, this is not supposed to be possible


[12-Aug-19 02:08 PM] jl777c#5810
all these thing slow down coin emission, which seems relatively benign


[12-Aug-19 02:09 PM] zawy#5864
private miners trying to boost the public chain difficulty when they start their private mine is something that happens.....it's just something to be aware of and to try to prove to yourself they can't benefit

All meaning digi, rst, and exp()


[13-Aug-19 05:28 AM] jl777c#5810
digishield is back to using only targetA, unless RST is over. in that case it uses 7/8 of the targetA for the blocks that had RST active

[21-Aug-19 12:44 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
1.0 ,  no known asic but it is FPGA dominated


[21-Aug-19 02:04 PM] miraculu#8334
Please is there a way to make a smart chain asic/FPGA resistant?


[21-Aug-19 02:17 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Kind of impossible ,  any chain that is profitable enough eventually will have a bitstream made for it .


[21-Aug-19 02:19 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
chains with good utility don't need "asic/FPGA resistance"


[21-Aug-19 02:35 PM] miraculu#8334
I have a targeted audience that don't have access to asic/FGPA and I'll like the community to be part of the block producers.


[21-Aug-19 02:37 PM] miraculu#8334
Staking would have been the solution, but the docs says it's shouldn't be used in production.

@Chipmoon  is staking production ready?


[21-Aug-19 04:06 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
VerusPoS you could say is,  even pos64 is being used on live chains


[21-Aug-19 04:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
But still new technology so just proceed with caution


[21-Aug-19 04:15 PM] Chipmoon#7477
zexo and ourc are both ecosystem projects that enabled staking as well as veruscoin of course


[21-Aug-19 08:18 PM] Alright#0419
@miraculu @polycryptoblog there is a version dubbed "verushash1.1" that smart chains can use right now


[21-Aug-19 08:19 PM] Alright#0419
it's basically verushash1.0 but with a few tricks to slow down FPGA development for it


[21-Aug-19 08:20 PM] Alright#0419
Joker made it, he'd be able to explain. It's not a good long term solution for a chain though. Is basically security through obscurity

[22-Aug-19 12:53 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes, the verushash1.1 is verushash 1 with a random seed, so there are no FPGA or even GPU miners for it, as it never got used on any real chain. The code was all there in the Verus merge for sapling, but the algo was not activated so I added the code nneded to use it as a3rd algo option.

It also works with verusPoS and PoS64, but PoS64 is a little weird on verushash, it works, but blocktimes can be a bit crazy

@Alright  and @Deleted User  thank you very much. I'll check it out.


[23-Aug-19 04:16 PM] dukeleto#7326
I am sure blackjoker+Alright have done good work on that hash variant. It's just that most people using it aren't going to realize that if it were profitable, an FPGA could mine it very effectively, it's just that no financial target has ever appeared to bitstream devs. Why is somebody using the function, and do they realize they may be that first target of this new variant? People just need to understand what it's limitations are


[23-Aug-19 04:17 PM] dukeleto#7326
most people making new smart chains don't know enough to decide between Equihash (N,K) variants and this, so we guide them to what we think is best for most situations. I am trying to think of a situation where I would recommend verushash1.1 to a consulting client, and I can't think of one

if your system is heavily loaded, it's more likely as well

if the problem is persistent, starting a new wallet.dat and importing any necessary keys might make it less likely. It's a real bug, but nobody has been able to fix it. Also happens in Zcash and all Zcash coins, but is only triggered very rarely. Usually I see it on an overloaded system, and trying again works

As a general rule you should be able to use either some existing bch testnet pool to mine, or if it's cpu minable then run the daemon with testnet settings.

`and if you are willing to order from shady sites in languages you don't speak and wait for shipping from china, you might get some deals`
Someone turned me on to a supplier that they use and I never did order because there were 3 different prices on the listing and one of them was a range of prices


[06-Sep-19 08:56 AM] dukeleto#7326
Buying new requires a lot of timing and luck and money. Used game is more forgiving of those, in my experience


[06-Sep-19 08:56 AM] dukeleto#7326

@Cryptoon voltage depends on when you go from breaker to outlet, you can use whatever, but default is 110/120v and our washer/dryer machines use 220v/240v

because the incoming is controlled by the transformer

it's more expensive, but runs in both directions (AC or heater) and is much more efficient

`household heatpumps take warmer air from outside to warm floor heating or whatever at a more than 100% efficiency rate`
they do exactly not that, unless they are "geothermal"/"ground-source"
a household "heat pump" is nothing more than an AC unit with a "reversing valve" that constricts the gas flow and forces it in the opposite direction

Interesting read. I havent finished it yet, but will comment that it takes a very narrow look on how only bitcoin could be used. If you were to look into how Komodo could be used in this situation, it would make more sense. Each planet/colony/ space station could run their own currency(chain) which solves the massive limitation of light lag factors that would be present only using bitcoin. The individual currencies would then be notarized to Komodo (light lag isnt as big of a problem because you dont have to wait for confirmations on your main chain).
Each currency would then have liquidity on the Komodo DEX, which would have light lag limitations, or people could trade direct with each other directly using their native currency using atomic swap tech (p2p atomic swap transactions).


[13-Sep-19 07:49 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
It's the perfect use case for the ecosystem Komodo is trying to build


[13-Sep-19 07:50 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Have atomicDEX satellites in orbit around each planet that runs their own currency, that manages communications between all of the connected planets/colonies/stations.


[13-Sep-19 07:55 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
The people trying to trade would then only have to connect to the satellite closest to them.

@zawy3 We would use a $KMD asset chain mineable via custom CPU/GPU miners which crunch data and jam it into OP_RETURN. One "de-anon coin" per privacy coin, such as DEANONZEC, DEANONXMR. Then miners use AtomicDEX to atomic swap those coins for $HUSH. Allows CPU/GPU miners t...

without a way to turn in these coins for something more liquid, why would anybody mine it?

You can get rewards in Gridcoin, bet they're worth peanuts


[20-Sep-19 06:31 AM] dukeleto#7326
that is why, these coins will be pegged to HUSH or some other coin

AtomicDEX makes it all work, on the phone


[20-Sep-19 06:32 AM] dukeleto#7326

@kevinkatovic 
The larger irony than you blocking the owner of a pool you're looking to find answers about is that not only did no one "steal 50%" from you, the pool also owns the fees address and the fees are eventually paid back to the miners

@dukeleto   BOINC is just a way of onboarding users,  rationale being they would rather earn something than nothing which they are currently doing.   I was thinking a system like Gridcoin where they submit ‚Äúbeacons‚Äù , with their contributed work and are doled our coins based on that.

not sure what exactly you mean about making 12x more on one pool vs the other (not even sure which pool he said was paying more)


[20-Sep-19 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
if you mean that he's getting paid more at my pool, then the fact that my pool found 43 blocks in the last 3 hrs and your pool hasn't gotten that many in any entire day at any point in the last 13 days likely has a lot to do with it


[21-Sep-19 02:31 AM] phm87#7395
CG: my labs pool is staking labs and paying miners with pos rewards (if they are mining). We can see blocks here : https://unimining.net/site/block?id=3018
On my discord he said that your pool is paying 12 times more. But as I saw some confusion from the miner, I won t dig more.
When hashrate is on my pool, earnings are more or less the same compared to other pools.
Thank you to jl777 for the calculations for miner earnings

@ComputerGenie From what i have read its possible to snipe blocks that u want to mine, i suppose u simply scan the mempool for bigger blocks and target those blocks with ur hashpower, not sure never mined just assuming


[21-Sep-19 03:30 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's possible to increase your chance, but there's no guarantees
what you described is the answer to what you asked
You want CoinB block with lots of rewards....
You mine CoinA with lots of hash....
When CoinB has a lot of tx fee value you move that hash to  CoinB....
When you do/don't get those fees you go back to your preferred CoinA

[20-Oct-19 01:26 AM] Oszy#5734
you may not be aware of that, if more miners are mining the SAME coin the less YOU will get. This is how it works, and when you feel you are not making enough to make profit or break even, you move on to another coin, this is called profit switching.

To get any sort of useful profit mining KMD, you'll need an ASIC miner because of the high difficulty
You can *try* GPU mining. I'd suggest using <https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1707546.0> (Version 0.3.4b) and <https://luckpool.net/komodo/connect.html>

Maybe stupid question but why equihash coins need stratum pool setup when mining solo with GPU and ASICs? If i understand that bitcoin combatible coins can mine directly to Qt-client port but why this is not possible with equihash?


[06-Nov-19 09:47 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the political answer: because CPU mining and "external" mining are not the same thing
the apolitical answer: because Bitcoin Core and slush (the creator of "stratum") have a close relationship and getwork was removed from Core (and thus all forks of it) to benefit the existence of pools and the revenue of the original pool ops (like slush)


[06-Nov-19 09:49 AM] Mark81#4505
So it is not possible mine anymore with any modern fork of bitcoin? Thanks CG!


[06-Nov-19 09:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
correct, you could recode your daemon and miner to use getwork again, but it requires deep knowledge of both the daemon code and cgminer code

If you have this please share, I know a few yiimp pools have this working already just no one on the internet willing to share for some reason very hush hush.

Komodo 5% Active User Reward - All You Need to Know
What is the 5% Active User Reward?     Any Komodo address holding an unspent transaction output (UTXO) of value greater than 10 KMD will begin earning a¬†reward once the lock time is set about 1 hour after a transaction that creates the UTXO is mi...


[21-Dec-19 08:04 AM] Deleted User#0000
How about that 5% annual staking reward, how does that work then?


[21-Dec-19 08:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
Who pays that KMD? Miners or dev fund?


[21-Dec-19 08:08 AM] phm87#7395
I think that it is printed out of thin air


[21-Dec-19 08:09 AM] jorian#4555
math üòÑ


[21-Dec-19 08:13 AM] phm87#7395
I see the KMD active user reward as a negative transaction fee. If you perform a tx with KMD, if you wanted few hours/days before moving/sending the coin, you won't pay tx fees (and you gain some tiny amounts because the active user reward is above tx fee). In some cases, the KMD user won't claim his active user reward (ledger users that don't use the special tool to claim rewards) then the value will go in the tx fees for miners (miners will gain this amount not claimed)


[21-Dec-19 08:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
I still don't understand it. Where does the KMD i claim come from? There is a fixed supply of 200M of which 110M is mined and in circulation. I hold amount x, who pays for my extra 5% * X?


[21-Dec-19 08:22 AM] phm87#7395
it is added to the circulation and it comes from nowhere (thin air) or math. If someone wants to have some KMD, he can mine it on a pool or he can claim his reward regularly. Both are new coins added to circulation


[21-Dec-19 08:22 AM] phm87#7395
there is no KMD fund or miner fund that pays the active user reward


[21-Dec-19 08:23 AM] phm87#7395
the current supply is changing, it can be calculated


[21-Dec-19 08:23 AM] phm87#7395
but due to this active user reward, it should be calculated based on blockchain


[21-Dec-19 08:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
So its written in the protocol that every moment somebody claims rewards a portion of the tokens that a not mined yet come into circulation without mining?


[21-Dec-19 08:24 AM] phm87#7395
yes sth like this


[21-Dec-19 08:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
Does it affect mining rewards or are they 2 seperate processes?


[21-Dec-19 08:28 AM] phm87#7395
that's what I tried to explain here above, these 2 processes are not separated, your guess is right


[21-Dec-19 08:29 AM] phm87#7395
if the user funds are eligible to claim their reward, user moves funds but without claiming (it can happen using ledger or similar devices if you don't use the proper tool), then the unclaimed reward is added to Komodo reward for the miner (or the notary node)


[21-Dec-19 08:30 AM] phm87#7395
Notary nodes are mining KMD blocks, around 75% of blocks. About 25% of blocks are mined by equihash mining pools


[21-Dec-19 08:30 AM] phm87#7395
if you search through the KMD explorer, you'll see some blocks with higher block rewards


[21-Dec-19 09:02 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`How about that 5% annual staking reward, how does that work then?`
@Deleted User Part of the problem with you understanding how it works is not understanding the terminology behind it and the terminology you are using.
There is no staking in KMD.
KMD does have a "usage reward" where you get a bonus reward for *using* it.
Merely sending a transaction that meets certain rules allows you to earn this reward.
Staking requires you to actively produce a block.
These are completely different things.
The user rewards don't "come from" x or y, they are created with the transaction at the time of the transaction.
The amount that users get as a reward does not exist before the user gets the reward.
The rewards are created by the protocol as a form of emission.

[21-Dec-19 11:39 PM] dukeleto#7326
@Deleted User `There is a fixed supply of 200M ` this is incorrect. KMD does not have a fixed supply.


[21-Dec-19 11:40 PM] dukeleto#7326
it has a tail emission, similar to XMR

Hi, 
We've added Verus (VRSC) to http://zpool.ca/ verus. See below for connection details.

Fee only: 0.95% or less
BTC payouts are processed once a day for balances above 0.0025
Payouts for all other currencies are made automatically every 4 hours for balances above 0.05 and balances more than 0.0125 are included in one of the payouts each day.

- Sample configurations -
To mine and get paid in VRSC:
```-a verus -o stratum+tcp://verus.mine.zpool.ca:6143 -u VRSC_ADDRESS -p c=VRSC,zap=VRSC``` 
Exchange to BTC:
```-a verus -o stratum+tcp://verus.mine.zpool.ca:6143 -u BTC_ADDRESS -p c=BTC```
Exchange to BTC but mine only VRSC:
```-a verus -o stratum+tcp://verus.mine.zpool.ca:6143 -u BTC_ADDRESS -p c=BTC,zap=VRSC```

All of our ports are NiceHash friendly, no need to specify any extra details

We also provide stratum servers in:
Europe: `verus.eu.mine.zpool.ca:6143`
South East Asia: `verus.sea.mine.zpool.ca:6143`
Japan: `verus.jp.mine.zpool.ca:6143`

DPoW helps make timewarp attacks harder and more expensive, but does not completely prevent them

I warned them of issues a long time ago but they didn't think it was an issue. I haven't followed what they have done recently


[12-Jan-20 06:47 PM] dukeleto#7326
They had a mechanism where the block reward is much larger, sometimes, in a supposedly-hard-to-predict manner. It draws large hashrate swings


[12-Jan-20 06:48 PM] dukeleto#7326
And their way to randomize when it would happen was extremely predictable, which caused a lot of issues in the past


[12-Jan-20 06:50 PM] dukeleto#7326
DPoW helps a bit, but if your difficulty algo has timewarp attacks, that is really bad. DPoW basically just makes it more expensive for the attacker, but does not stop it.

Dear @Pool-Operators, 

Komodo core was updated to 0.5.2 - please update your AC & Komodo mining-nodes and restart the mining daemon with -minrelaytxfee=0.000035 & -opretmintxfee=0.004 - the latter was added in https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/commit/c4d60f8defbe8036846a9baa410411f26528355a and allows miners to set the desired minimum transaction fee for processing big opret transactions (>256 bytes). We recommend min 0.004 per 1 Kb. It will make spam attacks cost significantly more.

More details about update can be found here:
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/dPoW/blob/master/doc/update011.md

While we're throwing consensus out the window, might as well throw censorship resistance out with it


[23-Jan-20 07:57 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
It's implied that you agree to forgo your own choices with that of the pool operator's consensus vote(s) by joining a pool


[23-Jan-20 08:01 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
and also that the funds mined belong to the pool and may be doled out however they deem


[23-Jan-20 09:09 AM] dukeleto#7326
No consensus rules are being changed, they are "playing by the rules", which most people don't seem to understand


[23-Jan-20 09:12 AM] jl777c#5810
this is why some people are against having too few mining pools that can collude to get 51% of hashrate, as such groups can do quite a lot of unexpected things, ie. softforks (segwit, BCH tax)


[23-Jan-20 09:18 AM] dukeleto#7326
that seems like a reasonable concern


[23-Jan-20 09:19 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, as if a chain is not viable, people will be forced onto the chain that is being mined, effectively giving control of the coin to the colluding miners

in select circumstances, the efficiency difference works for a few people
but as a general rule, the current markets make a mini more profitable for short positive ROI than something like an A9++ (and especially an A9+, which stayed overpriced when the ++s came out)

Apologies for the newb mining question, but every resource I find on calculating mining rewards is an ad to ‚Äúuse free online calculator‚Äù but I‚Äôd like to build a custom one to do some more specialized things. I tried a few equations like (hashrate x time x blockreward)/difficulty but get only close to the calculator results. Does anyone have any resources that might explain how to accurately calculate it?


[04-Feb-20 01:53 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
the closest you'll get is likely that *0.25 because NNs get about 75% of all blocks


[04-Feb-20 05:08 PM] tolken#2655
Ah good point. I figure they‚Äôre making that adjustment as well (otherwise, it must be very inaccurate) Does everyone here rely on the online calculators, or calculate themselves?

to get a "real-world" value, one has to check it when they are actually mining

prior to that? when that original fans weren't functioning.
Usually the fans go to 100% when there is an error, unless it is an OS or mainboard issue.

[19-Feb-20 08:41 AM] PeoplesReserve#2704
@penguin whats the best thing to do about a burnout? New dashboards worth it?


[19-Feb-20 08:53 AM] Oszy#5734
you need to test all PCB's with a multimeter at least the fault might not be on the main board, a short circuit can be caused by the hashing board or the control board too


[19-Feb-20 08:53 AM] Oszy#5734
also check the psu


[19-Feb-20 10:22 AM] Alright#0419
if magic smoke came from the main board of the ASIC, it's fucked


[19-Feb-20 10:22 AM] Alright#0419
the hashing boards might be salvable, but unlikely


[19-Feb-20 10:26 AM] Alright#0419
break the whole thing down and find out which board it came from, it should be very obvious

Hey everyone.  I got an s-nomp mining pool up and running for our smartchain.  It runs beautifully for short periods of time, and then the node stops syncing.. 35% pow/65% pos.. any ideas?


[24-Mar-20 08:39 AM] Oszy#5734
@mediast stops syncing or goes on a fork?


[24-Mar-20 08:40 AM] Oszy#5734
@ComputerGenie might be able to shine some light on hybrid pow/pos mining pools


[24-Mar-20 08:51 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
`stops syncing or goes on a fork?`
is pretty much what I got out of that and basically the solve for that is add mode nodes
generally that only happens when nodes follow another peer making blocks
if that's not the meaning then more explanation would be needed before I could offer anything


[24-Mar-20 08:57 AM] mediast#1110
@Oszy Stops altogether.


[24-Mar-20 08:57 AM] mediast#1110
The other nodes continue to function as expected.


[24-Mar-20 09:03 AM] mediast#1110
I am able to mine via the pool for a short period, blocks are created, block rewards are paid to an external wallet. Then I start receiving errors about invalid blocks (something along the lines of "the network disagrees", and when I check, the local instance is no longer syncing.  It just occurred to me that perhaps the masternodes are blacklisting the pool node..


[24-Mar-20 09:06 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
We don't have masternodes


[24-Mar-20 09:08 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
sounds to me like the settings of the pool or the pool code are not right (which is likely with s-nomp as I don't think they've ever added code for assetchains)


[24-Mar-20 09:09 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
last I heard, rather than collaborating to create a better overall code, they wanted komodo folks to submit PRs to them in order to make s-nomp work properly


[24-Mar-20 09:10 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
<https://github.com/webworker01/knomp> is likely your better bet for a public pool code to work from


[24-Mar-20 09:28 AM] mediast#1110
@ComputerGenie Sorry, that's a term that I'm using for our primary nodes, for our smartchain.


[24-Mar-20 09:30 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
either way, the pool issue still holds
chances are that s-nomp isn't reading the template properly


[24-Mar-20 09:32 AM] mediast#1110
I used this, adapted to work with our smartchain.  Like I said, it works perfectly, then starts rejecting new blocks:

you didn't use verus komodod for the pool and komodo komodod for other nodes, did you?

I'd have to take a look at that pool fork before I'd offer any opinion about it, but I'm most comfortable recommending knomp because I know how much work @webworker01 put into it


[24-Mar-20 09:38 AM] mediast#1110

[10-May-20 04:56 AM] jeezy#3408
cant shake the feeling that with this whole mining rig industry is a big ripoff, they develop the machines, keep them running for themselves when they are still most profitable, then sell them off at a premium, the measly customer has to invest 3-4 months to at least get his ROI and then some to make minimal profit, am I wrong?


[10-May-20 05:06 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I have a slew of profits and rigs that would say "yes, you're wrong"


[10-May-20 05:08 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
Do companies make profit? yes
Do miners make profit? yes
Is it somehow a "ripoff" that miners who buy a $1900 rig don't make as much profit as the companies that invested, literally, millions in creating those rigs? **no**


[10-May-20 05:13 AM] dukeleto#7326
@Oszy the trick is they promise delivery and it never comes


[10-May-20 05:14 AM] dukeleto#7326

@ComputerGenie  what are your thoughts about these mining pools


[10-May-20 05:51 AM] jeezy#3408
I can rent S19Pro   200TH for 360 days for  $4600 it looks like


[10-May-20 05:52 AM] jeezy#3408
currently 200TH makes around 1.15 BTC a year,  half of that next week  so its a  wash right?


[10-May-20 05:52 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I think pools are great for people with little or no technical skills
I think pools are a waste of money for anyone that can run their own mining setup


[10-May-20 05:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
as far as rentals go, my advice is to either rent enough to find a block before the end of the rental or don't rent


[10-May-20 05:54 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
rental + pool = everyone else makes more money on your money than you do


[10-May-20 05:54 AM] jeezy#3408
oh yea rentals I ment


[10-May-20 05:55 AM] jeezy#3408
@ComputerGenie  yea I guessed that much,  so basically rent enough to play lottery


[10-May-20 05:55 AM] jeezy#3408
just asking  myself why these are selling out so quickly


[10-May-20 05:56 AM] jeezy#3408
are people not calculating or do they know things we dont?


[10-May-20 05:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
personally, I'd never advise anyone to do a BTC mining rental unless they can learn to set up their own private pool 1st (and my pool sw suggestion would be ckpool)

if I go into configuration of this I can only chose  btc.com as pool not change it looks like


[10-May-20 05:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
generally, rentals for companies like Genesis sell to gamblers and people that do not read the fine-print or are just happy "to be in the game"


[10-May-20 05:59 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
anyone that tells you they bought a Genesis (or the like) contract and made a mentionable profit got lucky on a bull market run


[10-May-20 06:00 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
but, that's the BTC dream (million dollar booms and lambos)


[10-May-20 06:00 AM] jansako#3330
Especially with Genesis, Buy the BTC for your USD & Hold, you will be better off.


[10-May-20 06:01 AM] jansako#3330
Worth more to put the BTC some place that pays interest on it (obviously there is a risk too)

Hi guys. I'm mining Komodo at the moment. In july I'll be upgrading my gear and will have 5 pieces of Antminer Z11 for sale. In EU only! The machines are still in warranty ( 1 more year ) and the service centre is in the Netherlands. Let me know if you need more info. Thanks!


[14-May-20 12:07 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
Bitmain warranty only applies to original buyer


[14-May-20 12:07 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
but, how much are you asking for them @thedigger


[14-May-20 12:09 PM] thedigger#1967
@ComputerGenie Antminer Distribution has 2 year warranty that applies to the new owner too. I did that with my L3++ machines by the way. The price with psu and warranty is 1100 euro. Only EU sale


[14-May-20 12:16 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
73-80% of retail seems pretty steep, but I'll keep in mind for friends in that region that are looking for some


[15-May-20 04:01 AM] Fuego#8379
@ComputerGenie could be worth if that includes VAT because you can get it 0 rated if you are an EU company


[15-May-20 04:01 AM] Fuego#8379
because to import into Europe you pay 20-30% import taxes


[15-May-20 04:03 AM] Fuego#8379
But EU electric rates make mining pretty mehhh for the most part

In addition to this characteristic, block zero has a message in the coinbase parameter, which represents a possible reminder of why the cryptocurrency was created. The genesis block‚Äôs message reads:

The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks

@ComputerGenie yes they were

not sure too many of them will be on KMD outside of the multipools


[04-Jun-20 02:56 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
too easy to mine other coins and buy KMD


[04-Jun-20 02:56 AM] Oszy#5734
possibly, still it will affect nethash imo

@ComputerGenie not all miners realizing this

hopefully not too much until I can get a dozen


[04-Jun-20 02:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> not all miners realizing this
across the space, the number of miners that would profit more from shutting down and spending costs buying instead is quite staggering

I'll put my hand up to start a KMD pool once it's Live. I have some RUNE as well to kick things off. It could be a really valuable dimension for KMD. I encourage people to read up on the non-custodial liquidity provision (staking) aspect of this new model AMM protocol.

it would take some time before the big farms commission new generators being built under those patents, but after a year or two, I would expect things to accelerate a bit yea


[27-Oct-20 10:06 AM] alkimi#1111
I don't know how many miners there are out there using DIY renewable energy, they're not subject to the patent laws so would have been innovating generators all this time anyways

Hi guys, when is the halving?


[16-Nov-20 05:27 AM] gcharang#6833
there is no halving for KMD. there is block reward reduction by 1. schedule here: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/komodo/coin-emission.html @Neos

@gcharang good to read that, thank you... so mining rewards change in ~2031/32?  and after ~2046 emission of ~525000 kmd/year perpetually for  the rest of its life?

it means KMD needs more miners

just thinking out loud to see if making it more interesting for external miners might increase demand/renew interest in the coin


[14-Jan-21 09:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362
sure, but I believe jl said once that the % of NN rewards might be altered if KMD/USD does well


[14-Jan-21 09:58 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the answer is to make miners want to want KMD

the amount of external hash on KMD depends on the revenue compared to the other Equihash coins... ZEC price rose 75% in the last 7 days, KMD 3%, so the gap became much bigger... hash goes to ZEC... https://whattomine.com is your friend

their math on that bottom graph is never right
and 1000 blocks back doesn't mean anything even if it were right

zerg hasn't hit a block in 5 hrs


[18-Jan-21 03:26 AM] cipi#4502
1000 blocks is about 17h... and every time i looked at the chart in the last weeks, we are at 65%... instead of 75%


[18-Jan-21 04:18 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
```
$ ./NNrewards4.sh 2196572 2226812
scanning ~21 days....
Scan took.... 24 minute(s)
Over the scanned 30240 blocks...(2196572 - 2226812)
Miners got: 10266 blocks and NNs got 19975 blocks
Miners got: 31226.68374192 KMD and NNs got 89761.21907552 KMD

NNs got 74.19024297 percent of ALL rewards (expected and bonus)
NNs got 66.05270989 percent of all blocks

NNs got: 29836.21907552 KMD in bonus rewards
Miners got: 428.68374192 KMD in bonus rewards

*note: "expected" is 3 per block, since fees cannot be known in advance.
```
and that has nothing to do with 12-14 NNs forcing their nodes to "overmine" (some by as many as 700+ blocks for this half of the season) holding the diff high and not enough open miners to compensate for the weight that luxor drops when the other NNs "catch up", right?

[18-Jan-21 04:30 AM] cipi#4502
your own stat shows `NNs got 66.05270989 percent of all blocks`... but should be 75%
and yes, profit switching pools like luxor are a problem, they drive the diff very high when they start mining because they throw a lot of hash to KMD when they switch
but if NNs would mine 75% of blocks (like they should) the 30 min gaps would be gone or at least not so often, the diff would not drop that sharp (it does that after this gaps) and the profit switching pools would not switch a lot of MSols to KMD after that


[18-Jan-21 04:32 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> but should be 75%
and with that many NNs "force mining" it never will be without solid external hashrate
the current hashrate (which is smaller than my hobby farm and smaller than it was before ASICs were even invented) is not enough to compensate for that many NNs intentionally throwing the algo off


[18-Jan-21 04:35 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> but if NNs would mine 75% of blocks (like they should) the 30 min gaps would be gone or at least not so often
That wouldn't happen even if the "forced mining" stopped and all NNs mined as "expected" because the diff drop will happen (because that's what diffs do) and the cycle will continue
The only difference between then and now is the actual diff target (which 1-2Msol/s still isn't going to hit without lag)


[18-Jan-21 04:36 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
instead of a diff target for 80-90Msol/s, it'd be like 50-70Msol/s


[18-Jan-21 04:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
no matter what anyone *thinks* the "cause" is, the only solution is __more external miners__


[18-Jan-21 04:37 AM] cipi#4502
how about we try it out... make every NN mine like they should (not overmining and not hunting) and we will see how it turns out... i am pretty sure it will solve the problems with the huge gaps

I wish you luck in convincing hunters in the cabal to give up their 10x income


[18-Jan-21 04:40 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
or non-hunters trying their best to add to their income as they watch that 10x happen


[18-Jan-21 04:42 AM] cipi#4502
hunting was forbidden till this season.. allowing it was a huge mistake


[18-Jan-21 04:43 AM] CHMEX#0686

[18-Jan-21 04:43 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
hunting was never "forbidden" and it was @jl777c that 1st decreed it needed to be a thing


[18-Jan-21 04:44 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the only difference between S3 and S4 was the privatization of the rewards from all NNs to the cabal


[18-Jan-21 04:45 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
part of the S3 dec hf was literally only about hunting


[18-Jan-21 04:46 AM] cipi#4502
but that makes a huge difference, because before only 1 or max. 2 NNs were used for hunting, now we have 5 or so, which is exactly the missing 10% (65% instead of 75%, 5 out of 64)


[18-Jan-21 04:47 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
we had 5 then, just not all as successful as the thing now privately owned


[18-Jan-21 04:52 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
(the irony that this topic is at least 75% of the reason I no longer hold a NN is not lost on me a bit)

that's because there was again a 30 min gap in block creation... after that diff dropped a lot and the pools switched
but the 30 min gap was because not enough NNs were mining

That would be a valid point if any of it were true

Also, the ridiculous notion of the lag having to do with hunters doesn't account for any explanation of why there were __more hunters for the 1st 5 months of S4 than there are now__ and the issue didn't begin until the 3rd week of Nov


[18-Jan-21 08:15 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
also also, hunters are required to produce a "similar result" in terms of block production whether hunting or not (in other words, about the same 15-16 blocks throughout every day)


[18-Jan-21 08:19 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
```
In the event a NN opts to hunt, as above, that NN must find some way to contribute block production to the network similar to the result of "traditional NN mining". This contribution shall be no less than 75% of the blocks produced by the region's leading block producing NN and in any event not below 15 blocks per day on average over the course of a calendar month. The contribution may be through means of only hunting part time, employing "external" hashrate full-time, or some combination of the two. This contribution shall not include mining several blocks in a short time with "external" hashrate and then abandoning the chain for a time, such an action does not produce a "similar result".```


[18-Jan-21 10:38 AM] daemonfox#6136
The issue wasn't being MASSIVELY exploited until Nov. Big difference.


[18-Jan-21 11:21 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
please provide any data supported by the chain to this claim


[18-Jan-21 11:22 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
specifically how *not* mining raised the target diff

hint: you're wrong


[18-Jan-21 11:27 AM] daemonfox#6136
I already tried to hash this out with you but you refuse to admit regular mining to replace missed NN mining has an impact


[18-Jan-21 11:28 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
because "the calculation" isn't what you decided it is


[18-Jan-21 11:28 AM] daemonfox#6136
Misstyped that sorry


[18-Jan-21 11:32 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
simple fact:
drop 200Msol/s on a chain and the diff rises
drop 50some NNs hitting both time and diff targets on top of that and diff stays high
that 200M goes away
the actual 1-3Msol/s cannot mine without lag

add 64 NNs and the diff goes **higher** or stays the same
**and** the code adds lag time to the NNs
that you refuse to accept that is on you and the "impact" is the exact opposite of what you've decided (despite the actual code as evidence to the contrary of your insane beliefs)


[18-Jan-21 11:33 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I've been begging you for months to learn how diff works and yet you refuse üò¶


[18-Jan-21 12:02 PM] daemonfox#6136
Never refused, I only insistd you stop leaving out the rest of the factors.


[18-Jan-21 12:03 PM] daemonfox#6136
Like, why would the 200Msols drop on to start with if diff wasn't already low enough to be profitable? They wouldn't. So why was the chain in that state to begin with?


[18-Jan-21 12:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
Why 50 some? Our whole point has been missing NNs are adding to the lag.


[18-Jan-21 12:04 PM] daemonfox#6136
the 200 Msols goes away standing the diff... but the NN side of the diff ahsnt hit a target in months because the hunters are also mining on the other side of the equation.


[18-Jan-21 12:05 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
> Like, why would the 200Msols drop on to start with if diff wasn't already low enough to be profitable?
ffs, is your argument **really** " KMD price sucks horribly bad and no one will ever want to mine it"?


[18-Jan-21 12:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
Not my words


[18-Jan-21 12:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
You seem to read too much into straight forward statements.


[18-Jan-21 12:05 PM] daemonfox#6136
and then make statements about diff and mining from an absolutist pov


[18-Jan-21 12:05 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
"profitability" = a function of diff **and** price


[18-Jan-21 12:07 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
because they are?


[19-Jan-21 03:33 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
because it's 5am and I'm waiting on coffee to make....
no part of this is you understanding how diff works
I will oversimplify this because I know you really don't care and not even the deity you pray to can convince you of how mining actually works:
that 200M hit, for example, 20 blocks in 2 minutes
when the 200M goes away and even 1 NN hits a block on a 1 minute interval, that NN hits the diff as if it were 200M
now, the time of block arrivals is fast by 18 blocks
this means that a single "stall" of 18 minutes would put blocks "on time"
except...
4 NNs hit a block in that time
now 200M has hit 24 blocks in 2 minutes
some minutes go by and NNs start producing blocks again
if less that 33 of the last 65 (iirc) blocks are not NN blocks, a time interval is added to the earliest time a NN can send out the next block
the diff algo does not look at the same interval, nor does it care "who" made the blocks
diff algo looks back at x blocks and calculates the time all of those blocks average
if the average is above the target time, the diff increases
if the average is below the target time, the diff decreases
the increase has no cap
the decrease has a limiter so as to not drop the diff too fast in too short of a time and "yoyo" the current block target to wild extremes in a super short time
whatever the diff drops to when NNs start mining again is the "network rate"
if it only gets to, let's say, that of 80M then the network is assumed to be 80M strong
no part of this system is designed for NNs to keep hitting blocks at space intervals of 66
66 is the __minimum elegibility__, **not a target**
it was designed to interweave NN blocks and "external" blocks
the "forced mining" of some NNs throws that balance off (because many are raising the diff target)

I dont quite understand the mining steps on github, don't I need to set my wallet or user or something?


[05-Feb-21 10:17 PM] webworker01#3884
still need help? yes you need a wallet ofc


[06-Feb-21 09:00 AM] LuzPlayGames#1725
I have a wallet. I mean when I run commandline komodod, don't I need to set my wallet in the command somehow?


[06-Feb-21 09:00 AM] LuzPlayGames#1725
so the mining goes to me and not someone else?


[06-Feb-21 09:10 AM] lightspeed393#5403
where/how are you mining? on a pool?


[06-Feb-21 09:11 AM] webworker01#3884
`komodo-cli getnewaddress`
`komodo-cli dumpprivkey <address>`


[06-Feb-21 10:15 AM] LuzPlayGames#1725
yes I wanted to mine some WSB coins for the lulz just incase


[06-Feb-21 10:15 AM] LuzPlayGames#1725
I think it's via their pool if I read the github readme correct


[06-Feb-21 10:20 AM] lightspeed393#5403
for WSB you'll need to run that chain, then do what webworker01 said and get an address. But it will be `komodo-cli -ac_name=WSB getnewaddress`


[06-Feb-21 10:21 AM] lightspeed393#5403
then choose a pool and setup your miner to mine with the pool address and your wallet address.

[07-Feb-21 01:44 PM] bishop#9773
No, you are better off mining something like ETH and selling it for BTC to buy KMD with (don't recall any liquid KMD/ETH pairs)


[08-Feb-21 12:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362

If you don't know what the hashrate is for your GPU, you can try Google to see if anybody with the same or similar GPU has shared their stats


[11-Feb-21 04:21 PM] Nachorov027#5682
but how i know my hashrate without a miner?

[11-Feb-21 04:21 PM] jvr#6773
lol was thinking the same thing


[11-Feb-21 04:22 PM] jvr#6773
and you'll need to know the algorithm is Equihash


[11-Feb-21 04:27 PM] Nachorov027#5682
the problem is that the data is too old because betterhash said i do around 40MH/h on ethereum but this GPU cant mine eth because this gpu is strange (it have 2 gpu inside of it so 3vram for each gpu inside)so the dag is bigger, and a driend toldme try komodo but i cant find any miner to test it and is no information about the gpu ofter 2016

i dont really expcet people to actually mine it much as we are more gpu miners but some are interested in it

I understood the same of lightspeed393


[07-Mar-21 02:03 PM] lightspeed393#5403
well KMD has equihash 200,9 sometimes called just zcash equihash. It has asic's now, so most of the software mining software options have been updated to other equihash variants that other coins use and don't support 200,9 anymore.


[07-Mar-21 02:04 PM] lightspeed393#5403
so if users try to mine with an miner that's incompatible with the algo, it gives that incorrect solution size error.

perhaps that is what is happening actually, i asked him what commands he was using to launch and miner

[07-Mar-21 03:19 PM] webworker01#3884
i just switched my local test pool over to using the included docker-compose and dockerfile

i have some working 200,9 miners here https://piratepool.io/getting_started#gpuMining


[07-Mar-21 03:26 PM] EduCatOR#5372
@lightspeed393 yes i originally only had bitcoinz setup


[07-Mar-21 03:26 PM] phm87#7395
I am using the old ccminer when I need to mine equihash with my gpu. I don't remember if the old version of miniZ works for it


[07-Mar-21 03:27 PM] EduCatOR#5372
we are also running litecoinz now as well which also takes that algo, i would need to add proper command


[07-Mar-21 03:29 PM] phm87#7395
You can also have a look at decker's integration of equihash into yiimp <https://github.com/DeckerSU/yiimp-stratum-equihash/>


[07-Mar-21 05:00 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
s-nomp halfassed worked for KMD when s-nomp 1st came out
KMD has changed a bit since then and the level of if/else bullshit already in s-nomp makes it so no one wants to fix it for KMD
if you want a nomp variant for KMD and assetchain coins then use either <https://github.com/webworker01/knomp> or <https://github.com/spaceworksco/knomp>

this is the command he was using which doesn tlook right


[07-Mar-21 07:00 PM] EduCatOR#5372

[07-Mar-21 09:19 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`--algo 192_7 --pers ZERO_PoW`
both of those parts are wrong


[07-Mar-21 09:19 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's 200,9


[07-Mar-21 09:20 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
and there's no "pers"


[07-Mar-21 09:24 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
if a brand of miner doesn't support 200,9 then it cannot be used for mining KMD

can you recomend me a pool ?


[27-Mar-21 12:46 PM] Komodefi#5638
not sure about pools, but the rewards are built in. you can get "staking" rewards just by sending your balance back to yourself once a month in any of the official wallets


[27-Mar-21 01:38 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
What if I told you that it's not actually "staking".........


[27-Mar-21 01:50 PM] Komodefi#5638
the team should just rename it "first layer liquidity mining" and watch as kmd goes back to the top 100.


[27-Mar-21 02:04 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
the team named it "interest" and/or "user rewards"


[27-Mar-21 02:04 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
user rewards

hey guys i ran the command to run the wsb miner how do i know if its working? and is it cpu only or can i use my gpu also to mine


[07-Apr-21 11:49 PM] webworker01#3884
`komodo-cli -ac_name=WSB getmininginfo` should say `generate": true,` but with current diff of 32K i think you probably need to use at least a gpu. 

you can setup a pool for gpu really easily with docker: https://github.com/webworker01/knomp#docker-install

@phm87 a LTC pool shouldn't be too difficult if we make it desirable.


[13-Apr-21 11:30 AM] daemonfox#6136
I was able to mine a single LTC block several weeks ago with 5Gh/s in 24 hours.

I don't know about recent scrypt asics. Technically, it is easy to run ltc pool, yiimp stock with preconfigured coins works. I mined LTC and BTC on testnet with my gpus.


[14-Apr-21 02:43 AM] cipi#4502
go to https://www.asicminervalue.com and input "scrypt" in the search field to get an idea about the available scrypt ASICs


[14-Apr-21 02:46 AM] cipi#4502
look at the first 2 ones... with the > 2 GH/s hashrate... one is from 2019 the other one from 2021, but they have the same efficiency (hash/W)... idk, but it looks like there is not much potential in increasing the efficiency


[14-Apr-21 06:13 AM] daemonfox#6136
I tried to find info on what chip those two were made from but havent seen a nm size yet...


[14-Apr-21 06:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
But im willing to wager they didnt get past 12 nm as Nvidia only last year broke 12 nm and got to 8nm with Samsung.


[14-Apr-21 06:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
No one has 7nm capacity for ASICs and Apple has all the 5nm bought for now.


[14-Apr-21 06:14 AM] daemonfox#6136
So im leaning towards those still being 14nm chips

not really much to document
`setgenerate true some_number`
activates CPU mining for PoW with that number of threads
`setgenerate true 0`
activates staking for PoS
`setgenerate false`
stops both

yeah, I tought same thing but how can I remove this ban? My chain started mining before syncing chain and probably it forked itself and I have banned by the nodes.

you could try deleting your peers.dat as well, not sure that will help with them blocking you though.

[09-May-21 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
what ban?


[09-May-21 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
your node is getting IPs from other nodes, trying to connect and failing


[09-May-21 05:56 PM] Alright#0419
doesn't necessarily mean they banned you


[09-May-21 07:09 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
I suggested it was because of a peer ban because of 95.213.238.98 being a seed node and refusing connection (61 as opposed to the "typical" 111 for inactive )


[09-May-21 07:11 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
other likely cause would be an outdated client


[10-May-21 12:41 AM] structi#6733
Actually passed more then 24 hours and it is still the same for MORTY, ROCKY and VSRC TEST


[10-May-21 12:42 AM] structi#6733
ok, let's assume there is no such kind thing as banning, what can be it otherwise?


[10-May-21 12:44 AM] structi#6733
if you know IP address of an active node for MORTY for example please send me and I can add it to the peers.dat file then we can test it

ahh sorry, peers.dat file is not readable. if you have can you please share your peers.dat file with me?


[10-May-21 03:37 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it's a database, you're not supposed to try to read it manually


[10-May-21 03:38 AM] structi#6733
yeah I realized lately, that's why asking for the your peers file üôÇ


[10-May-21 03:38 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
delete yours, run the chain, run what I posed above


[10-May-21 03:39 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
my node has been running for 2 years and is crammed full of dead nodes that there's no need to pass on


[10-May-21 03:43 AM] structi#6733
I see. Unfortunately I don't have komodo-cli. I am using Verus Desktop to mine on MacOs. I searched for komodo-cli but I couldn't find it for the MacOs under the Verus folders


[10-May-21 03:43 AM] structi#6733
you may ask me to ask this question to them. I already asked it to them and they redirected me here üôÇ


[10-May-21 03:46 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
for any given coin, the data dir on mac is 
`~/Library/Application\ Support/Komodo/THECOIN`


[10-May-21 03:47 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
as far as mining, I'd suggest ditching verus app and using #wallet-ocean-qt with the chain params for whatever chain, if you want a GUI


[10-May-21 03:50 AM] structi#6733
yeah I know the coins' directory and I adlready sent the debugs by taking there. Thank you so much. I didn't know komodo ocean wallet has Mac support


[10-May-21 03:55 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> I searched for komodo-cli but I couldn't find it for the MacOs under the Verus folders
as an aside:
I don't know what the Mac equivalent is, but the dir on linux for the appimage is
`/tmp/.mount_Verus-blablabla/resources/app/assets/bin/linux64/komodod/`
'blablabla' being a rand string with each run

[10-May-21 04:01 AM] structi#6733
folder for it is "/Applications/Verus-Desktop.app/Contents/Resources/app/assets/bin/osx/komodod"


[10-May-21 04:01 AM] structi#6733
but cli is not there


[10-May-21 04:01 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
odd


[10-May-21 04:03 AM] structi#6733
sorry I am asking here because we started discussion here. I successfully started Komodo ocean wallet and it started syncing. But I didn't do any configuration for MORTY. I need to do it after syncing is done, right?


[10-May-21 04:04 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
it needs to be run from terminal or a shortcut like
`komodo-qt -ac_name=MORTY -ac_supply=90000000000 -ac_reward=100000000 -ac_cc=3 -ac_staked=10 -addnode=95.217.44.58 -addnode=138.201.136.145 &`


[10-May-21 04:06 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
without those params, it will run for KMD by default


[10-May-21 04:33 AM] structi#6733

General info (I know CG doesn't like Verus-Desktop, but I'll provide the info anyway):
In Verus Desktop you can go to `settings` --> `coin settings` and select the (active) chain you want to run commands for in the GUI CLI interface.
replace `verus`, `komodo-cli` or `zcash-cli` with `run` and leave out the chain parameters.
Example:
`komodo-cli -ac_name=MORTY 158.69.255.49:16347 onetry` becomes (after selecting the proper chain in the GUI) `run 158.69.255.49:16347 onetry`


[10-May-21 04:46 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
> I know CG doesn't like Verus-Desktop
I don't dislike it, I just have not much use for it (especially for mining) üòõ


[10-May-21 04:46 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I do actually use it for USDT üòâ


[10-May-21 04:49 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
For mining you would need a pretty hefty processor for it to make sense... We'll need to have some kind of stratum being built into it to be useful for mining.


[10-May-21 04:50 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Or a standalone stratum connecting to it.


[10-May-21 04:50 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
I've toyed with adding stratum to komodod, but haven had the time to finalize it


[10-May-21 04:53 AM] structi#6733
also Verus Desktop cannot find the komodo-cli at the coin settings


[10-May-21 05:18 AM] ComputerGenie#7004

[5/10/2021, 1:40:13 PM] [info] [komodo] [Pool [:3]] : Block notify error getting block template for komodo
i have same problem with Pirate so it must be a linux node problem
here is the rejected block info:

this pool software has been working fine for 3 months, but is underdevelopment. I cant figure out if i did something to screw up the wallet or software....

this isnt random, its all blocks


[10-May-21 12:12 PM] dswelch51964#1917
i run 5 z15's on my own pool that has worked fine for 3 months.


[10-May-21 12:18 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`getblocktemplate call failed` generally happens when out of sync with the network


[10-May-21 12:20 PM] dswelch51964#1917
right, but it is synced and load on machine is 0.15 so its not overloaded.


[10-May-21 12:21 PM] dswelch51964#1917
or its a bad block for me, but its all blocks founds


[10-May-21 12:21 PM] dswelch51964#1917
atleast it says synced with 'getinfo'


[10-May-21 12:21 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
what stratum are you using and when's the last time it and the daemon were updated locally?


[10-May-21 12:22 PM] dswelch51964#1917
```git+https://github.com/webworker01/node-stratum-pool.git```

his has worked best for 3 months

is there a working full pool on git hub i can try real quick to make sure its not the pool software.

i've reverted to 3 different versions i had backed up that did work. but dont now.

3 days ago it worked

seems your trasnaction js is making an unacceptable coinbase tx


[10-May-21 12:33 PM] dswelch51964#1917
ok so i sould look at the transaction.js for anything i might have modified?


[10-May-21 12:33 PM] dswelch51964#1917
but thats in the node-modules?


[10-May-21 12:33 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
are you adding pool fee in the config?


[10-May-21 12:34 PM] dswelch51964#1917
like this? ```"rewardRecipients": {"RGPnLvubvCZK2zpiXNV582oMC3vs5mBZQU": 6.75},```


[10-May-21 12:34 PM] dswelch51964#1917
zero fee in pirate


[10-May-21 12:34 PM] dswelch51964#1917
this was for tesing, ill remove if it might be problem.


[10-May-21 12:34 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
rewardRecipients = pool fee


[10-May-21 12:35 PM] dswelch51964#1917
ok, lol


[10-May-21 12:36 PM] dswelch51964#1917
just disabled and restarted pool


[10-May-21 12:36 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
somewhere it's producing an amount of 0.2025 in the coinbase that isn't allowed
could be in the config, could be an extra amount, could be in the transaction js of the stratum module
not sure


[10-May-21 12:36 PM] dswelch51964#1917
oh ok. bet that 6.25%


[10-May-21 12:36 PM] dswelch51964#1917
approx


[10-May-21 12:37 PM] dswelch51964#1917
6.75%


[10-May-21 12:37 PM] dswelch51964#1917
ok i see that output in the error


[10-May-21 12:38 PM] dswelch51964#1917
i didnt understand what it was refereing to before


[10-May-21 12:39 PM] dswelch51964#1917
which node-stratum do u use?


[10-May-21 12:39 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
any time you get that issue, either use the disablecb function or take fees out of payments rather than in the coinbase


[10-May-21 12:40 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
similar to what webby has posted, but with personal tweaks


[10-May-21 12:40 PM] dswelch51964#1917
i havent tried the disablecb function yet..


[10-May-21 12:40 PM] dswelch51964#1917
ok ill check his post


[10-May-21 12:41 PM] dswelch51964#1917
just rest miners and ill know in next 15 minutes or so


[10-May-21 12:41 PM] dswelch51964#1917

[10-May-21 12:47 PM] ComputerGenie#7004

no get block errors so far


[10-May-21 12:48 PM] dswelch51964#1917

ive got my miners over on solopool now in last 10 minutes got 2 blocks. this sucks.


[10-May-21 01:30 PM] lightspeed393#5403
no I don't have a fix. I haven't ran into it in a bit, knock on wood. But I did find at the time that making sure the daemon has a good amount of connections helped.


[10-May-21 01:33 PM] dswelch51964#1917
right, and keeping the linux system load low. high load caused it for me a while back.


[10-May-21 02:57 PM] dswelch51964#1917
It was komodo from source. Just downloaded new binary and got 2 blocks in 10 minutes there is a bug in whatever version I had. I downloaded source about 2 days ago.

been testing for 4 hours now and the binary from github works fine. I'll download that version of source and recompile to test. ive got 10 kmd blocks since 4pm cst

If you have GPU, maybe you can mine the most profitable mining algo for your GPU and ask to get paid in KMD on zpool.ca as example, that's what I did with my GPUs

and i know that this isn‚Äôt mining related but another question is going to be what can i mine on? old phones an old laptop or can i build a mining rig under 200$


[19-Jul-21 12:54 AM] Slyris#2880
There is some miners that use their atomicdex address at automatic deposit eg doge,etc,eth etc


[19-Jul-21 12:55 AM] Slyris#2880
So I guess you just need to set the output address of your mining hardware to the atomicdex address

[19-Jul-21 06:29 AM] gcharang#6833
it will technically work. but, after the number of txns become too large, as it usually does when receiving mining payouts, the electrum servers may struggle to send the past txn set and the balance on atomicdex may not reflect the real value. there were some issues like this in the past. my suggestion is to use a nativemode wallet to collect the payouts and periodically send coins to atomicdex in bulk

@Pool-Operator 

Please update your Komodo core daemon to version 0.7.1 - currently in the master branch of https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo. This update contains various enhancements including updated DNS seeds for better initial sync. For a full changelog please check our release page https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases/tag/0.7.1 . You can also find pre-built binaries in the release page, though we advise you to build your Komodo daemon from source.

Here is the corresponding announcement on the Komodo Platform website: https://komodoplatform.com/en/blog/komodo-hydra-update/

Please ensure you update prior to September 28th which will be the expected hardfork date - the hardfork is triggered on KMD blockheight 2588672 which is at or around this date.

@gcharang

consensus code was refactored for efficiency and may cause network splits. so this is a precautionary hardforking update


[27-Sep-21 02:18 AM] Cryptofarmer [mining-dutch]#0995
Alright, so no consensus rules are changed in general?


[27-Sep-21 02:19 AM] gcharang#6833
none were changed

edit- correction:

```
we did refactor consensus affecting code but kept the consensus logic - in general it is recommended to update Komodo daemon where used, however the hardfork change itself does affect KMD consensus but not ACs
```

zergpools conversions are convenient, but costly. Most people here are fully capable of exchanging mined coins into their favorite coin by themselves.... Through AtomicDEX...

Do they just load up the bitstream and it‚Äôs almost plug and play? Unsure on profitability vs what they have in stock (Antminer s19 only) which seems to have break even at 570 days :abusedsmily:

profitable FPGA minable coins are hard to find and generally suffer from low liquidity. The upside is you can switch BS and mine a different (more profitable) algo, but the profits are "not great". For the best margin you trade them yourself (no auto-exchange pool) and HODL and sell strategically, but it's a lot of effort for little profit.


[28-Sep-21 12:28 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
(SHA3solidity is currently most profitable, the minable solidity contracts, but the gas impact is significant)

[22-Nov-21 12:12 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
using js is mostly a non-starter given that there's a miner in the daemon that can be called with specific number of threads


[22-Nov-21 12:19 PM] cryptosammy#3587
@ComputerGenie the reason is that there won't be a full node and I want to avoid that full node to be there (nSPV). I am looking for a npm solution, as the application might do the mining on demand for a short lived chain and I can easily access it this way.


[22-Nov-21 02:24 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
mining doesn't and shouldn't work that way

Nspv is not meant for mining. Also mining is only best to be done on full node.

"there won't be a full node" and "short-lived chain" makes my neck-hairs stand up.

The reason why I am asking this here is on advice from James. I completely understand the reactions, and what I am working on is outside of the comfort zone.


[23-Nov-21 01:28 AM] cryptosammy#3587
So, to clarify, nSPV is indeed not for mining! Its super lightweight.


[23-Nov-21 01:28 AM] cryptosammy#3587
And I am not even considering tampering that area - at all.


[23-Nov-21 01:37 AM] cryptosammy#3587
However, the short-lived chains are small blockchain to reach a consensus - and the mining part is a possible game mechanic. My question is if there is:
a) a mini standalone miner compatible with Komodo smartchains.
b) that miner being available as a npm module - because my development stack is Node
c) that miner being configurable not to go mayhem on the CPU/GPU and can be managed
I appreciate the warnings. I know I don't have any credibility as a coder or 0.0001% knowledge what you guys have. I understand that, and thats why I before I asked here, did some research. I am trying to learn from you all and your experience. If I was as smart as you all or was able to figure it out myself easily, I would not ask it. My goal is to learn. I might not be as fast as you all, but I really dedicate my time to read as much as possible. My brain however needs something that I can play with, hack with (saying hack as bluntly cutting through all the nice rose hedges with a chainsaw and screaming Drakaiiinnnaaaa).

not shooting down your ideas, but just clearing things what are recommended on mining. Don't take it as harsh if that's what you meant. üôÇ
I tried looking for something related to mining with node.js and only found this relevant repo: https://github.com/digitalbazaar/equihash

_I'm unsure if this repo can help mine any block with KMD smart chain._


[23-Nov-21 02:19 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
what is the use case of mining in your application? What does that solves?


[23-Nov-21 03:00 AM] cryptosammy#3587
I think this is what I am looking for. Now the next step of the puzzle is how to apply that to a Komodo chain?


[23-Nov-21 03:00 AM] cryptosammy#3587
Really trying to sketch here, because its not really a "great" idea.


[23-Nov-21 03:12 AM] cryptosammy#3587
Special purpose chains that could have a cc_lib enabled, configured for that purpose alone.
Think of special dice rolls, etc. A game server generates the chain, but its params are disclosed conditionally; connecting to that chain would be difficult unless you know where to connect to. Once you find it, you can get all the blocks in it. Yes, a total overkill.

This can be possibly achieved by setting up a pool miner server and having the nspv node run a lite miner.


[23-Nov-21 03:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
your use case is still unclear and doesn't make sense to me.
The purpose of creating a blockchain is to create a decentralised p2p network of cryptocurrency.
the purpose of creating a cc_lib is to create a custom consensus on this smart chain to do some decentralised operations.

Creating a short lived blockchain, used only by single party or 2, as I understand from your quick description doesn't make sense to me. Not even a party of 10 or 20 using that short lived blockchain makes total sense to me to be honest. It's like may be a private blockchain network?
May be reasses your use case from the point of view of utilising just a p2p messaging? would that solve your issue?
There are two ways you can create p2p network **without** blockchain:
- use a library for creating a p2p network, such as `libp2p` or similar others
- use DEXP2P feature of smart chain. You can create a new smart chain **without** needing to have any blockchain role, or with a blockchain role. with DEXP2P you can send custom p2p messages to network nodes. It can solve many things where p2p communication is needed without doing too much complex p2p network building by newbie developers.
See if these alternative solutions solves your use case.

@cryptosammy reading what you've since written, it seems to me like what you're after is one of the original tromp miners
In the situation, as I read it, using spv or full would be moot since the miner itself would be getting the info from the stratum as in any other mining instance and the design of the wallet would be inconsequential since they are different processes.

Also, if you're looking for an in-code C++ example then zcash daemon repo would be more appropriate than komodo because of all the "extra" NN, verushash, asset, and labs code in komodo

Lore of the Tokels lives on the Tokel Platform. Which is awesome - because it supports oracles.


[23-Nov-21 08:22 AM] cryptosammy#3587
Now, recently I learned that komodo smartchains share to a certain level what I call "keypair-compatibility"


[23-Nov-21 08:24 AM] cryptosammy#3587
Meaning: "my KMD address/privkey can hold Komodo and I can use it with a client connected to that network; that same address/privkey can hold TKL and I can use it with a client connected to that network. The same applies for CX (Currency X) that was created with Komodo platform.


[23-Nov-21 08:26 AM] cryptosammy#3587
Now the KMD blockchain has no tokens/assets CC enabled (if I got this correctly), Tokel has certain CC enabled (-ac_cc=555 -ac_ccenable=236,245,246,247).

I'd read that a zcash miner could be used last year, but didn't know if that was still true. I'll be mining on a rpi, if possible.

[18-Jan-22 07:51 AM] gcharang#6833
there were 2 slightly different questions then I think.

> cpu vs asic algo. 
coin creators might want to pick a mining algo that doesn't have ASICs yet to make sure that everyone will be able to participate in the initial stages and get some coins. but, if the coin becomes valuable enough, first FPGAs and then ASICs will definitely come

> komodo default mining algo vs verushash available through -ac_algo param

my recommendation is to not use the -ac_algo param as, 1) it has verushashV1 and not the latest verushash 2)-ac_algo wasn't tested extensively with all the other available params afaik. if we assume the implementation works as expected, the difference between the 2 would be the difference in types of mining hardware available. also, as komodo's algo is equihash, all the existing miners of zcash,kmd and other zcash forks with same algo will be able to mine the smartchain from birth. this can be good or bad based on the situation


[18-Jan-22 07:52 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
With the uneven balance between hardware, there's hardly any advantage using Verushash 1.0. While the chain can be used using CPU, those become worthless once GPUs appear on the network, which in turn turn useless when FPGAs hit the network.
The difference is mining algorithm used to solve a block.
The algo KMD uses is Equihash 192,7 (iirc) and is dominated by ASICs, but can still be mined with CPU and GPU. Once ASICS appear, those CPUs and GPUs will be worthless on the network.

[18-Jan-22 07:54 AM] gcharang#6833
or, why verushash was updated


[18-Jan-22 08:02 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612 (pinned)
VerusHash 2.x does use the same intrinsic CPU functions as VerusHash 1. The main difference is that a number of loops have been built into the algo, which makes it hard to serialize (which takes up space on FPGAs).
Those loops run the intrinsic cryptographic CPU functions multiple times, which slows down GPUs and FPGAs (They need to emulate those functions, taking up precious clock ticks).
In Verus Discord those loops are often referred to as Monkins-Loops, referring to the genius coming up with that.
The evolution from VerusHash 2.0 to 2.2 is fundamentally closing possible loopholes, that would give FPGAs and GPUs in certain specific configurations vastly more hash than they are intended to have.
The goal of all this is to create a mining algorithm that results in roughly the same hash to watt ratio across devices. Unfortunately GPUs can be considered as extremely low performing FPGAs (from a programmers point of view) and their performance really suffers on the 2.x versions.
