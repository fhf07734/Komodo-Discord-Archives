@jl777c question about this new call, -ac_cclib=<name>. while designing the user experience for chainlizard, one of our thoughts was that someone can create multiple clusters and name them before they even create a chain, since creating a cluster (i.e. 'purpose') first is more intuitive than creating a chain then choosing an un-named cluster by integer.

is this essentially what this allows? that is my assumption from @Mylo's tech tuesdays, but i wanted to confirm.


[23-Jan-19 03:36 PM] Mylo#8306
**Edit for wrongness**:
- Clustering comes from -ac_cc=XXX   which is just an id shared by the cluster.
- ~~The -ac_cclib=<name> is used for a filename to load. ~~

~~Maybe <filename> would have been a better description?~~

That name has your "dynamic loadable library".  What I call "mycustomlib" is different to ca's "mycustomlib" because we both load them at chain start up on totally different chains, presuming we are working indepdently on separate stuff.

To further illustrate:

- I've created a single chain and enabled crypto conditions and started it with -ac_cclib=MyloGameLibrary set of crypto conditions.
- I've then created another single chain, enabled crypto conditions and started it with -ac_cclib=BetterGameLibrary set of crypto conditions.
- I've made MyloGameLibrary come with a set of 5 specific game library conditions.
- The BetterGameLibrary includes the 5 from MyloGameLibrary plus an additional 10 that enables extra in-game functionality.

The cluster id is just an identifier (but has to be a number), it could be randomly made up - as long as all the chains in the cluster share the same random number.

ac_cclib is not the file name, rather how the cc is defined in cclib.so

[24-Jan-19 06:53 AM] butthole.finance#0577
@Mylo i'm still a little confused on ac_cclib. i understand ac_cc integer and setting that, but for a user, setting an integer doesn't really make much sense. it would make more sense for them to set a purpose for a cluster which they then assign an integer, or the app sets it for them after they choose whether it should be fungible (>100) or interoperable (<100)


[24-Jan-19 06:55 AM] butthole.finance#0577
from what @Alright is saying, it sounds like the ac_cclib should do that?


[24-Jan-19 06:58 AM] butthole.finance#0577
or maybe i'm completely off base here.


[24-Jan-19 07:03 AM] jl777c#5810
cclib allows to create a custom CC has nothing to do with clusterid


[24-Jan-19 04:39 PM] Mylo#8306
@butthole.finance will DM you for voice chat details.
depends on app workflow and if there's state (db) saved before and after launch of the chain project.
if you are creating a table, and ppl can plan stuff, then hit <the button> to start the chain(s), then at runtime it could just decide on a clusterid if required.


[24-Jan-19 09:46 PM] butthole.finance#0577
@jl777c  ah sorry, i was confused since -ac_cc refers to clusters, i just assumed anything ac_cc were related


[24-Jan-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810
-ac_cc < 100 is not a cluster


[24-Jan-19 11:39 PM] jl777c#5810

[04-Mar-19 04:41 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
Specifically, I'm working on the first command:

```
## cclib

**cclib method [evalcode] [json_params]**

The `cclib` method allows the user to interact with the dynamic CryptoConditions module associated with `evalcode`.

Each `evalcode` module can have unique `json_params` inputs, as well as unique responses.

### Arguments:

| Name        | Type             | Description                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| method      | (string)         | the name of the method                                  |
| evalcode    | (decimal number) | the `EVALCODE` of the module of interest        |
| json_params | (array)          | the parameters to be supplied to the method, provided as an array |

### Response:

| Name        | Type             | Description                                         |
| ----------- | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| (each `EVALCODE` is unique ||| 
```


[04-Mar-19 04:46 PM] Bryan_Beus#6442
This raw documentation was prepared by someone else, and I have questions about it.

In this line here:

```
**cclib method [evalcode] [json_params]**
```

The prepared of the raw docs suggests that evalcode is given as an array, or, perhaps the preparer thought that EVALCODE was optional, and put `[evalcode]` in brackets thinking that it was supposed to be `(evalcode)` in parens. 

I'm not sure. 

From the description of the `cclib` method or rpc, it would seem that each execution of `cclib` will have an EVALCODE -- and only one EVALCODE.

Also, the term `method` is not descriptive. Is this referring to an idea that for each EVALCODE there can be unique methods plugged in here?

I would think that this line would be written like this:

```
**cclib insert_method insert_evalcode [json_params]**
```

Also, one more thing: I need an explicit example for the `cclib` rpc, specifically to alleviate any of this kind of confusion. 

Any help is appreciated. Thank you!

To the whole daemon or just to your cclib?


[09-Apr-19 11:43 PM] jl777c#5810
what blockchain variables can it access? how do you pass in arguments? is nesting supported?


[10-Apr-19 04:37 AM] jl777c#5810
if there is a way to expose all the functions in the cc dir, that would be really nice.


[10-Apr-19 04:38 AM] jl777c#5810
with JS wrappers to all the useful C functions, then the JS scripts can become very useful


[10-Apr-19 04:38 AM] jl777c#5810
the other idea i had was using the opreturn as a way to pass in parameters, so that is up to 8kb of parameters


[10-Apr-19 04:39 AM] jl777c#5810
and the output would be some standard type, which in turn could be used as inputs to another JS function


[10-Apr-19 04:39 AM] jl777c#5810
so a library of JS code can be made and 8kb of JS code reduced to a txid of where it is


[10-Apr-19 04:39 AM] jl777c#5810
kind of like defining a specific txid to be a specific JS function


[10-Apr-19 04:40 AM] jl777c#5810
oh, maybe there can be an include functionality, that includes a bunch of "files" which are actually txids


[10-Apr-19 04:40 AM] jl777c#5810
the idea is to have a set of highly optimized opreturn JS code into a txid based library of functions

so i guess with such a mechanism, people can write CC contracts using JS and all during runtime

the text.js file cant be a local file for consensus, so just need to push it through opreturns

freaking awesome.  nice work @Deleted User


[11-Apr-19 07:47 PM] Mylo#8306
yep, already browsing options and documentation to accelerate understanding to implement


[11-Apr-19 07:48 PM] Mylo#8306
i won't be deliverying any.  no time to to take on such a project with small market of cc devs atm.


[11-Apr-19 07:48 PM] Mylo#8306
need to concentrate on the training artefacts (docs/diagrams) first.

to mine too, as there are no limits to what can be in it

@mrlynch how do you include a go program in a c++ program?


[20-May-19 06:12 PM] Mylo#8306
or c.


[20-May-19 06:12 PM] Mylo#8306
something like:
```
#include <mysql/mysql.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

then add to your gcc command

-I/usr/local/include/mysql -L/usr/local/lib/mysql -lmysqlclient
```
?


[20-May-19 06:14 PM] Mylo#8306
maybe i'm asking the wrong (exact!) question, but i'd like to be able to include golang inside  c/c++ and access the internals of komodo.


[20-May-19 06:14 PM] Mylo#8306
from go


[20-May-19 06:17 PM] mrlynch#5735
oh.. you mean a wrapper in go?


[20-May-19 06:18 PM] mrlynch#5735
@grewalsatinder is working on it ..checkout kmdgo in his repo

[20-May-19 06:19 PM] Mylo#8306
@mrlynch no not a go wrapper.


[20-May-19 06:19 PM] Mylo#8306
embed golang inside the kmd daemon.


[20-May-19 06:20 PM] Mylo#8306
cclib is a dynamc library.


[20-May-19 06:20 PM] Mylo#8306
we can pile anything into cclib.


[20-May-19 06:20 PM] Mylo#8306
emmanuel is working on js runtime into cclib.   this way, a consensus rules can be written in js.


[20-May-19 06:21 PM] Mylo#8306
so by embedding golang into cclib, consensus rules can be written in go


[20-May-19 06:22 PM] Mylo#8306
hope that makes sense...e.g. cc-dice could be written in go, and other games like that.


[20-May-19 06:23 PM] mrlynch#5735
oh.. i don't know.. haven't reached that lvl yet

you over estimate my abilities üòÇ

still a guppy


[20-May-19 06:23 PM] Mylo#8306
haha ok - well...on your travels thru docs/interwebs, can you be mindful of it.   if can be done, i'll learn go üòÑ


[20-May-19 06:24 PM] Mylo#8306
cheers


[20-May-19 06:26 PM] mrlynch#5735
i deffinitely will.. there are so many things i need/want to learn, it's easy to lose track of


[20-May-19 06:42 PM] Mylo#8306
something to test when more time.


[20-May-19 06:43 PM] Mylo#8306
does it both ways go->C and C->go


[20-May-19 06:43 PM] Mylo#8306
hard to tell if the data structures will be visible.


[20-May-19 06:49 PM] Mylo#8306
removed old link.  ^^ those comments relate to old link.
this one is more recent and uses structs of C

may be useful in the future.


[20-May-19 06:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Yes, I only looked at using C C++ in golang code
Cclib is a lib file, I guess we can call C funcs in Go code and make a cclib of our own
I don't know about calling go code from C cclib, but pretty sure its similar way.


[20-May-19 06:53 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I will check on it
Thanks for giving me some short target to focus on

could the code be put into a file to work around all the things that want to parse things using different escape rules?


[13-Jun-19 02:25 PM] dimxy#2587
I tried to parse both strings calling the parser directly from komodod
```
std::string str1 = "{\"method\": \"cclib\", \"params\": [\"func0\", \"17\", \"{\"key\": \"striiiiiing\"}\"]}";
std::string str2 = "{\"method\": \"cclib\", \"params\": [\"func0\", \"17\", {\"key\": \"striiiiiing\"}]}";
```
so the str1 could not be parsed and str2 was parsed okay. Seems the parser works correctly. It is somewhere else that requires quotes for objects


[14-Jun-19 02:16 AM] dimxy#2587
well, I found how to add the support for parsing VOBJ (with no quotes requirement) in the cclib rpc - made it in my repo.
I can do a PR. 
Are PRs accepted this time?


[14-Jun-19 02:29 AM] Deleted User#0000
no


[14-Jun-19 02:34 AM] jl777c#5810
PR can be submitted, but until the update is done to master, code freeze is in effect


[14-Jun-19 02:37 AM] dimxy#2587
okay, not a critical issue...


[16-Aug-19 07:04 AM] Mylo#8306
If I wanted to add compression using a c library to data being stored in an oracle, how would I do it using cclib?


[16-Aug-19 07:08 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems you would not need cclib for that, just compress the data before storing it in the oracle


[16-Aug-19 03:54 PM] Mylo#8306
Ok yes probably easier to put it in the client side application.
