` RPG Maker, but Komodo CC powered.` 
My freind wants to make one of these, this will be great.. 
He keeps asking what kind of engine to use to be able to use KMD CC and crypto in his game... but I think we need access to soource code of the game to do that.


[10-Apr-19 01:17 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Actually, that will be separate package, the audience is different and it will take a lot of work. But give us time, give us time.


[10-Apr-19 01:18 AM] Deleted User#0000
I have no issue writing code for his game to link it with a CC directly... I was always going to make this... but if you guys are doing it already it saves me a shit load of time üòÉ


[10-Apr-19 01:19 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
The problem at the moment is Unity sofware and Unreal Engine branding guidelines. That takes time. Just throwing source in the wild open, will add todo's to my massive list like PR's, remember, we are only rocking this show for some weeks. Haven't seen many that are doing the same at our velocity.


[10-Apr-19 01:19 AM] Deleted User#0000
I wouldnt mid some advice on what engine to use though? Are there any open source engines we can easily link with jkomodod? or are you doing everything via RPC calls?


[10-Apr-19 01:20 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
No, because more engines means more work. If you are willing to guarantee the salary of a full timer working on this for a year, heck, I'll start throwing things out super duper fast.


[10-Apr-19 01:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
lol no, my mate is making his own game, already and I said we should blockchain it just because we can.


[10-Apr-19 01:20 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Our budgets are now based to have the core team running and working, and there is a lot more that comes with making a game.


[10-Apr-19 01:21 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Well, any game can be ported, remastered or powered.


[10-Apr-19 01:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
But if your suing closed cource engines then I guess its not really possible üò¶


[10-Apr-19 01:21 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
How is Unreal closed source?


[10-Apr-19 01:21 AM] Deleted User#0000
I dont know isnt it?


[10-Apr-19 01:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Listen, if I get a Unity Enterprise license, I get the source too. Also, using ILSpy, you know what you need to know. Both engines however support bridges and plugins


[10-Apr-19 01:23 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Anyway, adding engines to the list will get developers but not audience. So our key focus is on players. We need to work with engines that are well maintained, well supported and are bleeding edge.


[10-Apr-19 01:24 AM] Deleted User#0000
IMO choose an engine, make it work anbd release one game... if it all oppen source ppl will just make all kinds of games based on it :shexy:


[10-Apr-19 01:25 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Open source is good to build technology. We want to make games and make crypto accessible. We try to be a hybrid.


[10-Apr-19 01:25 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
The Komodo Gaming SDK's though will be 100% open source.

We are going to need about 100 testers for UltraFighter K64. As a requirement, it is mandatory you have some experience with blockchain, you are computer savvy enough to know your system specs (these will be required to make a "supported" list). You can find our Discord invite link in #komodore64, do ping me there.

Komodore64 is about three things. One: we develop a virtual console that plays games, and Two: at this point our games. The open source part is the Gaming SDK, which isn't an "all-in-wonder", but a bridge between a game engine and Komodo. And I didn't ask for development help at this point, I asked for playtesters. Now help me with what I asked help for.

[16-Apr-19 01:42 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Yeah I looked at your twitter, didn't know which games you were talking about though aha. 
You said previously you can purchase the games through your "steam like" client, with a blockchain coin. Other than that, how are the games integrated with Komodo/blockchain?


[16-Apr-19 01:49 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
The virtual console is as like a launcher; it allows you to connect with your "friends", it keeps your system configuration stored and holds the binaries for your platform, and it allows you to purchase/play a game. Games require often a cache and my idea to is to have a standard set of assets available to accelerate development. This makes it incredibly easy to deploy games for developers (pop in the SDK in your engine of choice) and don't worry about the end user in regards to distribution. It should feel like starting up an emulator. Some games can use the same blockchain, but the power of Komodo is that every game can use its own blockchain, its own coins, its own custom consensus implementations. The thing that it solves is mostly for game developers; you don't need to be a Komodo expert to create games with Komodo. It is really that simple.


[16-Apr-19 01:51 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
Internally, we have "project names" for games. Games are media, and it comes with research - copyright, design, art, data (like a description, genre, age, etc). Our plan is to "present" our final titles at the Expo in June.


[16-Apr-19 02:03 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
Makes sense. Apologies for all the questions, I am just trying to wrap my head around what is going on. So you have created and are providing a distribution method for game devs(is this what you're putting on github)? Similar to Steam, but will only accept crypto payment method. Whilst also creating 10 or more of your own games that will be launched on said virtual console. 
How will people be "creating games with Komodo"?


[16-Apr-19 02:04 AM] NutellaLicka#4241

3. Not similar to Steam, even though that was the initial idea. It evolved into a virtual console. And yes, it will accept crypto payment. We are in negotiation with a partner to support fiat to crypto, but that's all in the works and long term.
4. Yes, we are going to do a lot of games. They are intended to show off the possibilities of blockchain gaming.
5. Developers can use the SDK, and my intention is to group a bunch of extra tools to make it easier. Sadly, big game engines require a lot of legal stuff to be in place. In case of Unity, its basically installing a UnityPackage and fire up a script and you can develop a game in Unity. For Unreal Engine and Godot, I've made similar plugins, but these are fairly bare bones.

As joker basically said, game validation isn't easy. Claiming you will make it easy is a very bold claim, so I can see why someone might be skeptical


[16-Apr-19 08:20 AM] TwilightPunkster K64#7533
@Alright I had a bad morning, skipped over the conversation and basically interpreted it as questions what we are doing. I don't mind the questions, in fact, I asked some local people from blockbar to go through the codebase with me two weeks ago and reserve some time for it. My claim though is misinterpreted - with easy I mean the gameplay for the end user through our platform. I  did had conversations with @Deleted User about my strategy some weeks back, when he was still busy with other things, so I kept moving forward to develop solo. I've learned a lot about CC the past couple of weeks, went through the Komodo whitepaper, read every doc available and went through the Rogue source line by line and actually took a lot of notes from other ecosystem projects. There are some people who mind find me to talk bold and easy about it, but the people who are here locally see me take risks and the amount of time I put into Komodore64. 

We are working on a whitepaper, which isn't quickly made in a day; which explains the technical side of things. I understand the skeptical perspective and in retrospect; I was in "dick mode", a combination of a lot of things that came out wrong. However, I am releasing the Gaming SDK to show some work that was intended to be public anyway, I rather had done this at a better time though, but what's life without a challenge. And most importantly I apologized for it and owned up to it. That might not seem much, but I personally find no bigger honor than in being accountable. I'll try to refrain myself being bold üòâ

@Alright @Deleted User Just be warned, the amount of shit code will not be impressive or elegant. I hacked most stuff together. I know it could be done a lot better, but four weeks ago, it would have been a web store with some NFT stuff, now we are going for a virtual console with lots of features and working with @Meyse is hard because he hates every UI I make and if he doesn't he still wants to change stuff.

Someone might want to let Gregory Barber, who writes for Wired, know about the cool things happening here with komodore64. It is sad that in his world gaming and blockchain equate to CryptoKitties driving race cars.   Show him the light please...     https://twitter.com/GregoryJBarber/status/1126891010032689152

Virtual goods are a massive industry, with in-game purchases raking in more money ($50B+) than the global box office. Now some think blockchain could make it even larger by turning digital swords and potions into assets you can actually own and trade. https://t.co/BEoyVFDy...

Are you ready for the #whitepaper release on July 20?  üöÄ

**We from Komodo have unfortunately not been able to validate K64's claims about a 78M EUR investment from Goldman Sachs. We have approached Goldman Sachs but were unable to verify these claims. Publicly available data also suggests Komodore64 does not meet the requirements in order to qualify for such an investment. We publicly distance from K64 and want to point out that at no time has the Komodo team been involved in these activities. Please be cautious and do your own due diligence before investing in any project.**

Pretty ironic:
This channel was put in the "dead projects" list all of a sudden (while the project is still alive).
Some time after that (today) moderators forbid any K64 talk at #üí¨‚îÉgeneral.
And we used to laugh about Veriblock team forbidding certain topics on their discord server.

Other projects have been moved to the ecosystem archive just like K64, so it is not being singled out

K64 brings up drama that Komodo does not need and is a distraction and it has been discussed about on a daily basis for months. Let's get on with building things rather than argue over something we cannot prove.
