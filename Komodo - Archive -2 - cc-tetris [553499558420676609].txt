@SHossain tweaked the timing a bit, most of the flashing is gone for me

On which chain/daemon is possible to play tetris?

./maketetris from cc dir and then ./tetris


[08-Mar-19 01:24 AM] jl777c#5810
not fancy some screen flashes, but it seems to work and the codebase for it is very small


[08-Mar-19 01:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it mostly should fit into the rogue rpc, but i guess there is no playerdata other than points scored


[08-Mar-19 01:31 AM] TonyL#3577
Works smooth on my side


[08-Mar-19 01:32 AM] TonyL#3577

Game over!
You finished with 500 points on level 1.

playing experience is much better now


[08-Mar-19 05:09 AM] SHossain#0007
jsut noticed one thing that, some of the variants of tetris clears screen upon completion of each level. this one keeps playing continuously.


[08-Mar-19 05:15 AM] CHMEX#0686
this is adictive! You finished with 820 points on level 1.


[08-Mar-19 05:37 AM] Cryptofist#7504
@SHossain  The traditional versions of the game do not clear on level advancement.


[08-Mar-19 05:38 AM] Cryptofist#7504
the other side to that is, there are a few hundred variations on the game


[08-Mar-19 05:38 AM] SHossain#0007
i see. didn't know. there are so many variants, i thought there were thousands. this one looks good


[08-Mar-19 05:38 AM] Cryptofist#7504
I only like the orginal nintendo, gameboy and ps3 (ultimate) editions myself, so bit of a biased purist.


[08-Mar-19 05:39 AM] Cryptofist#7504
There might be thousands!

`gdb -args ./tetris` ?

Yep, I think you can check also if it reproducable in "offile mode" by `gdb -args ./tetris 777 gui`

Hmm interesting - no function which doing blocks swaps in this backtrace
Is it hangs on 3rd time when you swap?


[29-Mar-19 07:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm I've started game on my side by `./tetris 777 gui ` and swapped blocks like a 100 times a row without problem


[29-Mar-19 07:57 AM] SHossain#0007
not on 3rd swap...but few more. didn't actually count


[29-Mar-19 07:58 AM] SHossain#0007
try to swap on the left corner


[29-Mar-19 07:58 AM] SHossain#0007
like the image above


[29-Mar-19 07:58 AM] SHossain#0007
when you have the block exactly at the left side and you swap (after multiple done), it will hang


[29-Mar-19 08:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh on left side it hangs yes, in midle not - very edge case hmm üòÉ


[29-Mar-19 08:00 AM] SHossain#0007
yes

so, only on the edges


[29-Mar-19 08:04 AM] SHossain#0007

It's the cases when brick to which you want to swap not fit game field if to put it to position on brick which swapping

So game engine don't have space to draw it and hangs


[29-Mar-19 08:08 AM] SHossain#0007
yeah, i was thinking the same. not enough space to change on the edges

@SHossain Could you please add in `cc/games/tetris.c` :
```         obj->stored.ori = ori;
         while (!tg_fits(obj, obj->falling)) {
             obj->falling.loc.row--;
             obj->falling.loc.col--;

     tg_put(obj, obj->falling);
```


[29-Mar-19 08:56 AM] TonyL#3577
`obj->falling.loc.col--;` this line should be added, then `./maketetris` and play

There was an edge case with tetris game hang (when trying to swap block close to the game field edge and block not fits game field horizontally)

[29-Mar-19 09:19 AM] SHossain#0007
but, sometimes, it feels like it hanged on the edge when i try to switch. that happens for few seconds and next move can be displaced due to this lag


[29-Mar-19 09:20 AM] TonyL#3577
Oh, I see


[29-Mar-19 09:21 AM] TonyL#3577
I tested on right edge


[29-Mar-19 09:21 AM] TonyL#3577
On right edge it super smooth


[29-Mar-19 09:21 AM] TonyL#3577
But from left edge it's moving block to the right side - need fix for fix üòÉ


[29-Mar-19 09:23 AM] SHossain#0007
yep. you described it better üòÉ


[29-Mar-19 09:24 AM] TonyL#3577
Ah, I see what happening - it's moving blocks horizontaly until it fits only left direction at the moment


[29-Mar-19 09:25 AM] TonyL#3577
So from left edge it moving to left to right edge üòÉ Have to detect on which edge case happening and if it on left side have to move right instead of left


[29-Mar-19 09:26 AM] TonyL#3577

Hmm, do you have ../keystrokes.log file (if check from src/tui) ?  I had the same problem when started daemon from one folder and used TUI from another daemon folder


[30-Mar-19 10:53 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, i have keystrokes.log file inside `tui` dir


[30-Mar-19 10:57 AM] TonyL#3577
Hmm it should be in src


[30-Mar-19 10:57 AM] TonyL#3577
It looking in `../keystrokes.log`

`keystrokes.log` creating in same folder with komodod

there is also one in src dir as i played manual too
