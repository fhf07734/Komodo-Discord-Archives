**Welcome to Komodo Ecosystem!**

Thank you for filling out the form and registering for the Komodo Community Portal.

We want to provide value to our ecosystem projects, so don't hesitate to let us know if we could improve the portal experience or if you have feature ideas you would like to see in the future. Let us know if you find the portal valuable and why or why not.

Through this Discord channel, we intend to stay in tighter contact with the various projects who are building on Komodo. We want to hear from you and about your challenges and achievements.

The Komodo marketing team is always ready to talk about exciting news and announcements. However, we often miss or overlook things as we are busy in our day-to-day activities. With this new process, we wish to bridge the cap and be there when something newsworthy is happening.

If you are about to unravel something more substantial that might get the eye of the broader media, please contact us *before* you share the news. We are working with a world-class PR agency who might be able to help in such situations, but the news should not have leaked before they learn about it and get a chance to try to sell the story to the journalists.

**Disclaimers**

1) We don't promise, nor are we committing to sharing your news or doing constant retweets. Our team judges the situation and decides on its own. Please be mindful of the requests you send.

2) We maintain the right to remove a project from our community portal at any time without prior notice when we detect suspicious activity, or we receive scam accusations or any other complaints from our community. Team members of a project must always have appropriate behavior and respect towards others. Breaking Komodo community guidelines may result in the removal of a project from the portal board.

**Sharing your project news or update on the Komodo Community Portal**

1. Use the topic 'News & Updates' on your post. Please only use the topic in your message when the content is newsworthy. Frequent low-quality posts would bury the announcements of other projects.
2. Remember to add other relevant topics to your post, such as your project topic.

**Ask Komodo for marketing help**

1. If you have noteworthy news, you can reach out to the Komodo Marketing team and see if we can share your story through some of our channels.
2. Contact us through this Discord channel. If the nature of your news requires privacy then you can DM @moneystacks or @Audo 
3. We will either approve or decline the request.
4. It would be best if you committed to also publishing the news or announcement on our Komodo Community Portal.
