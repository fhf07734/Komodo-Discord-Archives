@ca333 
1) After I press `logout`in settings I get to my phone screen instead of login screen. 
2) Also AtomicDEX asking me to create PIN every time I login to wallet with saved (created by AtomicDEX) seed
when i put the application to background / open it - it asking me to `Input` pin, but when I logout and login to my saved wallet from login page it asking me to `Create` pin

@TonyL - 
1) on logout event we shut down mm2 and the app. fyi - We added this with the last release. 
2) shossain reported it already - this will be changed with next release. We will store the PIN encrypted with pw too.
3) thanks - we will add exception handler for "history too large" response

waiting for a swap to finish, to test this again.

**WRONG** was the graphic of the "Awesome Post" slow to load.  **Can ignore**

1.  News "Check back later" in bottom half of screen
2. Gpt to News Saved.   Nothing saved.  Tap "Browse" to go back to news feed
3. News feed in bottom half of screen.
4.  Go to other tab (DEX for example)
5.  Go back to news tab, full screen.

1. Unbookmarking a saved article, would be nice to have a confirmation modal, otherwise fat fingers might lose articles (or some kind of undo)

@modereck Hi! @SHossain will recheck it 

Thanks for logs - I can notice such `Error creating RaiiRm("/data/local/tmp/lt-dht-4861232908906222768.tmp"): Permission denied (os error 13)` in my logs too - so maybe it's a cause/symphtom


[04-Jun-19 05:59 AM] smkhound#7640
on `view seed` page - 
it says `COPY THEN TO YOUR CLIPBOARD`
maybe remove `THEN / YOUR` so its just `COPY TO CLIPBOARD`

also it's not immediately obvious what that red button does while entering pin. Could see some frustration there if you accidentally press it while you don't have your seed on hand


[04-Jun-19 10:38 AM] Alright#0419
found a way to reliably create stuck swaps. 
start a swap
turn the phone off
wait a minute, so swap is at 2/3
turn phone back on 
hit red button that clears seed
restore the wallet 
swap will be stuck at 2/3 with seemingly no way to recover the funds sent

Would be great to have a confirmation button to leave the app. Because if we press back button, we can leave the app during a swap. Sometimes it's involuntary.


[05-Jun-19 02:24 AM] Kiruel#2091
@t0sma if you leave the app during a swap and not closing the app the swap will be ok.


[05-Jun-19 03:22 AM] Kiruel#2091
@Alright if you logout your swap will be not successful. I need to inform the user when he try to logout or delete wallet. (If swap is ongoing). Anyway your fund will be restore after few hours if swap did not finish.


[05-Jun-19 05:30 AM] smkhound#7640
Can we add option to stop phone from going into standby during swap? (like GPS, screen stays on)

using pin change feature in settings, all works fine, but after change returns user to "unlock wallet" page. After unlocking wallet, I'm back at enter pin, then enter/confirm new pin. so I change pin 2x because I didnt realise unlock screen was going back there. 
Not a bug, just could be confusing. request returning to a different screen (not unlock wallet, maybe main settings screen instead) after pin change.

I'm ready to start testing. Can I try to swap like KMD to RFOX? Or RFOX to K64


[15-Jul-19 03:02 PM] Alecandro#1179
anyone with ios that is having that problem?


[15-Jul-19 03:02 PM] Mcrypt#4468
is there even one person here who was able to install it?


[15-Jul-19 03:03 PM] yorklab#7270
I haven't. My google email address is deferent from my invitation email address so hopefully that doesn't create an issue.


[15-Jul-19 03:03 PM] hastrup#8742
I also can't install the app


[15-Jul-19 03:04 PM] SHossain#0007
if you didn't register with google play store email, you can't test


[15-Jul-19 03:04 PM] yorklab#7270
I did.


[15-Jul-19 03:05 PM] yorklab#7270
I get the "unregister" sign now.


[15-Jul-19 03:07 PM] allbits#5898
I have the same issue, getting the unregister sign now


[15-Jul-19 03:11 PM] yorklab#7270
@SHossain I remember now, I sent you my google email in a DM because I had read that was how to sign up at the time. Then later signed up officially, but maybe used a different address, so maybe I don't have the google email address registered after all. Don't know now.üôÑ


[15-Jul-19 03:13 PM] Mcrypt#4468
go to sleep now... hope this is getting fixed soon

I saw earlier that someone suggested that when AtomicDEX is doing a swap that the phone is kept from timing out. I think that would be a good idea; TabTrader does this. I would think a liquidity provider would want this feature also.

Also on my Note 8 I noticed when creating a password and didn't have a special character that I needed, there was a warning in red below that telling me what I needed for that password, but it didn't state the entire paragraph. I think it ended with something like" ....a lower ca..." it ended with those three dots.

when trying to sell DOGE for BTC, when entering Amount to Sell, it only allows me 4 digits. When I hit the 5th digit, the whole string erases. I can't actually enter enough DOGE to satisfy the BTC minimum amount (0.0077 BTC, or roughly 27200 DOGE)

`or maybe someone wanted to sell 5 KMD for 1 BTC` no I dont think so - I think I got it, when there is no orders - it printing my input to sell and receive fields app printing it as a best availiable rate

And when you "Click to create an order" it's order creation actually (you'll act as a maker)

So can set any price

and it'll be the best rate (because no other orders on market)

I made a swap order for KMDBTC at 0.000205 . Could not make real price because of the 0.00777 minimum. Why is that by the way? Thats too much!


[15-Jul-19 07:18 PM] TonyL#3577
It's mm2 protocol limitation (same for all coins)


[15-Jul-19 07:18 PM] SHossain#0007
what's the KMD > BTC price now in atomicDEX?


[15-Jul-19 07:18 PM] nymkappa#9440
But thats quite a big amount...


[15-Jul-19 07:19 PM] nymkappa#9440
Imagine I want to buy something with a game oriented asset. I want to swap my BTC for 10 USD (which is a correct amou t for gaming purpose). I cant :/


[15-Jul-19 07:20 PM] TonyL#3577
Fees in BTC are huge so there is no practical reasons to trade little amount, also taker have to pay fee which may not pass because of the dust limit


[15-Jul-19 07:20 PM] nymkappa#9440
Its like steam asking to deposit minimum 50 USD in your wallet.


[15-Jul-19 07:20 PM] TonyL#3577
There are reasons behind it


[15-Jul-19 07:20 PM] nymkappa#9440

`what's the KMD > BTC price now in atomicDEX?` there are no orders for it atm

Would be nice if we can choose the fees to pay as well for the swap.

@nymkappa it's just GUI interface for mm2 protocol - and it's a temporary limitation. CLI nodes are able to create orders with any rate at the moment so on this stage CLI nodes acting as a main market makers

@TonyL it didnt solved the issue. Im reading some guides about adb logcat at the moment.


[15-Jul-19 07:40 PM] TonyL#3577
oh, @aume27Rrpmp.nft I think now I know what issue is  - 0.1.2 (with hotfix for logs sending) seems broken and not starting. I wonder playstore update was propagate on your side faster than on mine so thats why you got this error


[15-Jul-19 07:41 PM] TonyL#3577

[15-Jul-19 07:42 PM] yorklab#7270
I crated an order (that I know won't go through) then logged out and logged back in and the order is still there. But will the swap happen if I'm not logged in?


[15-Jul-19 07:44 PM] TonyL#3577
When you acting as a maker your mm2 should be up to perform the swap. On application minimaze mm2 not exiting - it should exit only when you totally kill application


[15-Jul-19 07:44 PM] TonyL#3577
So with just minimized app swap should be performed


[15-Jul-19 07:45 PM] yorklab#7270
But logout = exit or minimize?


[15-Jul-19 07:45 PM] aume27Rrpmp.nft#2727

Have completed multiple swaps with real coins. Revolutionary.  So much better than a centralized exchange - no waiting for deposits and withdraws, no risk of exchange shutdown. Easy and fun to use.

[15-Jul-19 09:32 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@nymkappa Hi, this is how things are expected to work, app is sending real transactions on blockchains of selected coins so your balance is updated when these transactions are created and broadcasted. It also takes some time to negotiate the swap details between the nodes so you might notice some delay too.

[15-Jul-19 09:34 PM] nymkappa#9440
I think the wallet balances should reflect this


[15-Jul-19 09:34 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, but balance is locked "virtually" by ongoing swaps to prevent starting the swaps that are about to use more coins than you really have.


[15-Jul-19 09:35 PM] Mark81#4505
Finally installed but it's crashing from start due to update version 0.1.2?

[15-Jul-19 09:37 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
`I think the wallet balances should reflect this` - right, we need to discuss it, the balance meaning is actually "real coin balance on blockchain" so maybe it will be separate "locked balance" indication.

üëå 

[15-Jul-19 09:40 PM] nymkappa#9440
Just to make sure. Any swap related to eth (ether or token) requires some initial balance right?


[15-Jul-19 09:40 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, you need ETH to buy ETH/ERC20 - it's required to run the smart contract functions unlocking the swap payment.

plenty of co-ordintation happening, and the devs are busy atm.

the first goal is to make sure the first 100 users have no problems in the first few hours - there have been a cpl of beta hiccups which are being fixed.
the next beta testers will receive the follow up instructions (so they don't have to go through the same errors of the first 100).  hope you understand it's to allow ppl to process the success/problems without affecting everyone at the same time.

we may have aimed for one subset of beta testers first, maybe by timezone or phone model or some other "metric" or randomly.  i'm not aware of the choice, but it's so any minor errors don't affect everyone at once.

the channel has been made public, so everything is done transparently.

I have a failed swap but I lose token too. Is it normal


[15-Jul-19 10:37 PM] Mylo#8306
no you either have coins you had or coins you wanted.
depends what stage of the swap failed, there is a lock time on deposits.
someone with better tech/support understanding of the app/protocol will be able to respond more accurately


[15-Jul-19 10:38 PM] Mylo#8306
the lock time is protocol/blockchain enforced


[15-Jul-19 10:40 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
@vichiet Please try to start the app in 3 hours from now, it should attempt to refund your payment, if it doesn't happen please let me know.

The only problem I notice so far with orbotVPN enabled AtomicDEX starting of app takes long activating all coins on startup


[15-Jul-19 11:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
It was mostly waiing on MORTY or RICK or ETH or USDC
BTC KMD VRSC loaded fine in my 4-5 restart app attempts


[15-Jul-19 11:05 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Maybe spv servers were either busy or not reachable or timed out on such slow connections over tor?


[15-Jul-19 11:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I do not see option to remove coin from activating by default

`If I for example make an order of 2000, and the bids says maxvolume 500 or 600 as showing in that JSON will that make the matching utxos and fill my order from seller side?` in general it should create `taker` request first, then if it match existing `maker` request it should partially fill it and part which left convert to `maker` request


[15-Jul-19 11:42 PM] TonyL#3577
```Buy and sell methods always create the taker order first. Therefore, you must pay an additional 1/777 fee of the trade amount during the swap when taking liquidity from the market. If your order is not matched in 30 seconds, the order is automatically converted to a maker request and stays on the orderbook until the request is matched or cancelled. To always act as a maker, please use the setprice method.```

Need more market makers maybe.  If 100 ppl decide to do 20+ swaps at same time....we‚Äôre not testing that yet


[16-Jul-19 12:22 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Should I make different amount trade?


[16-Jul-19 12:23 AM] cipi#4502
```"taker_amount" : "0.007770000000464000000000000",
"taker_coin" : "BTC",```
```         "event" : {

i guess 0.00777 might be too low... look in your swap files


[16-Jul-19 12:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
I specifically input 0.00777 üòÖ


[16-Jul-19 12:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Maybe need more than that


[16-Jul-19 12:24 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Gonna try bigger then


[16-Jul-19 12:25 AM] cipi#4502
the swap status would indicate exactly how much is needed


[16-Jul-19 12:26 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe your bundle is outdated  a little bit @grewalsatinder - soon new build will be published to play market it's better to try with it

[16-Jul-19 12:51 AM] TonyL#3577
ok, in next release logs sending feature should work - will help a lot

Hello, i notice that my playstore Email Adress is not registered. What can i Do now? Last week i get an Email that i have to correct my Email Adress to this Adress which is connected to the playstore. I changed it but now im not preregistred when i Look at the playstore


[16-Jul-19 12:53 AM] cipi#4502
@grewalsatinder atomicdex spends... don't know why it hasn't done so... did you close the app before the swap completed?


[16-Jul-19 12:54 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
After it showed failed and posting screenshot here


[16-Jul-19 12:54 AM] cipi#4502
hmmm... then it is a bug... swap completed on maker side...


[16-Jul-19 12:55 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
The window was active all time it was going. Switched to another app went back to atomicdex app, unlocked it with fingerprint swap failed. Took screenshot,  posted here, did a lil chat, closed app, opened app


[16-Jul-19 12:56 AM] cipi#4502
i guess taker will spend the KMD later... just leave it running... and look in the swap json... swap id is `49547950-ff80-41ca-ae24-1654b3e78345`


[16-Jul-19 12:56 AM] TonyL#3577

Hi all, lots of exciting stuff here since last night. So if I can only see the 'pre-register' button in Playstore, that means I am not a part of the lucky 100? :troll_hurt:

Just checking opening app again in cas it can auto claim the KMD funds to spend and make it available in my atomicdex kmd address. Now the history shows timeout, instead of failed. Same version as before. M not updating till next instructions.

If you have failed swaps - please do not delete application and do not clean app cache/data because it'll delete information about swap and will be much more harder to continue swap

I hope it didn't wipe the old dex data


[16-Jul-19 03:13 AM] wl#4107
Can I send kmd to the dex?


[16-Jul-19 03:13 AM] wl#4107
Or just Rick and Morty for now?


[16-Jul-19 03:14 AM] Kiruel#2091
@grewalsatinder Its really weird.


[16-Jul-19 03:14 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
yep. I only left the app running.

Tell when you have installed if you still see the redfox please.

don't want to open the app... concerning if it wipes old swap data, I will lose those KMD


[16-Jul-19 03:18 AM] TonyL#3577
maybe playmarket update propagated not worldwide yet


[16-Jul-19 03:19 AM] Kiruel#2091
I don't think you will lose your fund, your fund should be re-fund in the next 24h @artem.pikulin right ? If a swap fail.


[16-Jul-19 03:20 AM] Tony Stark#4609
@Mark81 @TonyL Yeah, I'm running v0.1.2... I'll wait for a fix, thanks!


[16-Jul-19 03:21 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
It depends on what error happened, `satinder` swap is in state when refund is not possible as his payment is spent. The app data should be kept, but we will be able to get the funds back even if app data is lost, however it might be a bit harder.


[16-Jul-19 03:21 AM] TonyL#3577
@Tony Stark fix should be in Play Market already,  please uninstall AtomicDEX app which you have atm on your phone and install actual one from Play Market


[16-Jul-19 03:22 AM] Kiruel#2091
`however it might be a bit harder` We need to do something manualy ?


[16-Jul-19 03:27 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
In some cases yes, I've already found that MM2 aborts swap on 1st errored RPC request attempt when waiting for payment to be spent, but even with the fix we will still have low percentage of swaps that will need manual help with to unlock the funds.


[16-Jul-19 03:28 AM] Kiruel#2091
Ok so he just need to wait how many time you think ? (to a refund)


[16-Jul-19 03:29 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
We need to get `swap_status` and logs first and then we will see what to do next.


[16-Jul-19 03:30 AM] vichiet#4058
@Kiruel a New one ? I have 0.1.2


[16-Jul-19 03:32 AM] Kiruel#2091
For this we need more logs then. And he will need to delete the app for this and lose the swaps infos.

It's `MovieMaker` dir, @Kiruel where MM2 DB dir should be located?


[16-Jul-19 03:38 AM] Kiruel#2091
It's the `workingDirectory` when call mm2 right ? Lets me print the path

Should be here `/data/user/0/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex/app_flutter/`

[16-Jul-19 08:33 AM] ferjr90#9314
In a RICK/MORTY swap, my screen turned off due to waiting and the swap failed. During swap, AtomicDEX must keep the screen on or the swap stops.


[16-Jul-19 08:36 AM] Oszy#5734
no I did not leave it on in fact i locked the phone and it worked


[16-Jul-19 08:37 AM] Oszy#5734
it must be a phone power saving feature that disconnects it when screen is off?


[16-Jul-19 08:38 AM] CryptoNinjaa#5350
Could be that data turns off when phone locks


[16-Jul-19 08:39 AM] Alecandro#1179
That is definitely something that needs to change. you have to be able to close the app and your order still gets filled. noone is going to want to sit there and wait for an order to fill with their phone open haha

I change the energy saving profile of atomicDEX to none. This time I turned off the screen during a MORTY/RICK swap and it worked fine.


[16-Jul-19 09:00 AM] allbits#5898
Not able to send bch. Says not valid address. However when I copy and paste the exact same address into another mobile wallet it works fine.


[16-Jul-19 09:03 AM] ferjr90#9314
Are you trying to send BCH to AtomicDEX? AtomicDEX uses legacy addresses, not the newer cash format. Which wallet are you using?


[16-Jul-19 09:06 AM] allbits#5898
No. I'm trying to send out of atomicdex to another wallet, using new format


[16-Jul-19 09:07 AM] ferjr90#9314
So I guess you need to use legacy addresses in atomicDEX until cash addresses are implemented. Electron cash have a built-in address converter.

@cipi thank you for the feedback, I don't know how large the tx in the BCH chain is but 1000 sats isn't very expensive.


[16-Jul-19 09:18 AM] ferjr90#9314
@Mcrypt Go to the energy saving profile of your phone and disable energy saving for atomicDEX. This way seems to work fine in the background.


[16-Jul-19 09:19 AM] Mcrypt#4468
ah ok thx


[16-Jul-19 09:20 AM] cipi#4502
this is a BCH swap: https://github.com/cipig/coins/blob/master/swaps/BCH-KMD.md
fee was `0.00001000 BCH     0.00 USD`

Yes, swaping in background works once AtomicDEX is set off from energysaving districtions on Android.


[16-Jul-19 09:28 AM] Mark81#4505
Ie. you can watch YouTube while waiting swap to complete.


[16-Jul-19 09:35 AM] ca333#0333
@Mark81 i believe the app should be executing swaps in background anyway - which android version are you using? I will test it to ensure this claim is true.

Ok so, I have tested it with Sony Xperia xz3 and Nokia 8 and later on worked without tweeking settings.

And Xperia also works in background after changing settings back to default. Weird since I felt that it didn't.

Sent out of atomicdex a test amount with bch (using legacy address). Everything went fine. Followed up with a larger amount and this transaction did not show up in target wallet. However it does show on explorer but has stayed with zero confirmations for over an hour


[16-Jul-19 11:07 AM] allbits#5898
Not sure if this is a wallet issue or a blockchain issue


[16-Jul-19 11:10 AM] ferjr90#9314
Seems like a blockchain issue. Most wallets show unconfirmed transactions. Did the transaction showed up after the 1st confirmation?


[16-Jul-19 11:11 AM] allbits#5898
There has been no first confirmation. It stays unconfirmed according to the explorer. And the target wallet does not see the transaction.


[16-Jul-19 11:12 AM] ferjr90#9314
Please, can you post the transaction ID?


[16-Jul-19 11:12 AM] allbits#5898

@jorian ios started testing cpl days ago between a few of us.  not top priority.  priority is swap protocol testing publicly.   all other things will be tested (including gui bugs/changes) in coming weeks.  but first, atomic swap on mobile across different networks - wifi/3g/4g/vpn etc.

Not sure if this is the info you are looking for or not, but I've tried KMD to VRSC three times, twice it just hangs on step 0/3, one time it hung on step 1/3.  It seems like its a matched order, but not processing.


[16-Jul-19 12:10 PM] Mylo#8306
yes all failures are valuable.   it might be a simple hosting error on the marketmaker where the admin has taken it offline/moved.   hard to know immediately, but plz - if you have errors.
there's a button in settings -> send feedback which i think sends logs of failures.    phone model, network connection is handy, android version etc. if you know any of those.

@Mylo how long does an atomic swap needs to take?


[16-Jul-19 12:52 PM] Mylo#8306
depends on block times.  if it's a blockchain where the block time is 1 minute per block. maybe 4-9 mins usually


[16-Jul-19 12:52 PM] Mylo#8306
sometimes 3 mins

@Mylo comparing the transfer of let's say eth from coinbase to kucoin that requires 
 167 confirmations but nothing on kucoin yet or am i comparing apples to peers?


[16-Jul-19 01:04 PM] Mylo#8306
depends what you want to compare, and i'm being facetious here (warning):
1.  you can deposit your coins on a place that has all sorts of data on you, or you can keep it in your own wallet.
2. you can wait for deposits and kyc, or you can keep it in your wallet
3. you can trade eth to btc to buy any other alt coin, or you can find a direct pair in your pocket.
4.  you can leave your coins on a centralized target, and trust in the security and the employees of somewhere (usually in a foreign country) - or you can keep it in your pocket.
5. you can set an order at a centralized exchange and wait for it to hit/move/dance/whatever, or you can reach into your pocket and set an order in one market, and use the same funds to set an order in another market.  first order to bite, and you're trading.

it's unfair to compare it to centralized tech.   p2p atomic swaps are the best form of trading in many respects.
liquidity is better at a cex, but that is the current day.

an instant exchange like shapeshift or coinswitch, they do maybe 50BTC per day volume.
that sort of volume out of your pocket, and a whole new way of exchange can happen - and not only for crypto-traders.  merchants too...


[16-Jul-19 01:07 PM] Mylo#8306
centralized exchanges and atomic swap dex can also integrate & share order books at an api level.   this part is coming in the future.  some testers of marketmaker have scripts to refill their wallets when needed,.

the aim of the game is liquidity.   then crypto becomes useful.
and with the work being one in #dev-nspv , we're trying to scale lite wallets to millions of users, by optimizing the amount of data required by a client to validate their wallet data.

Also, minor issue - on the BCH wallet page, two transactions are showing as unconfirmed even though they are confirmed.  If I click through to the transactions, proper confirmations are displayed.  I tried turning the app on and off but the issue persists. If anyone wants a screen shot let me know.

@PTYX Hi, the process of setting up a LP node (maker) is as follows::
1. Arrange a server/vps.
2. Build/download MM2 (atomicDEX-API) and configure following walkthrough guideline: https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/atomicdex-walkthrough.html#initiate-marketmaker-2-0
3. Activate the coins you'd like to sell and receive, fill the balance with desired amount.
4. Call `setprice` for selected pairs: https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#setprice
5. If you have any questions please feel free to ask at #dev-marketmaker

- Option to remove an added coin from the list
- when hovering between - trade - order - history - it goes smooth, but when actually clicking on them it shows a translucid square...

ok, phone open now


[17-Jul-19 04:26 AM] ca333#0333
on iOS there is a limitatin - unlike android it does NOT swap in the background

we have to deposit kmd and usdc ourselves in this test?


[17-Jul-19 04:31 AM] Audo#5667
yes, it was completed


[17-Jul-19 04:31 AM] Audo#5667

[17-Jul-19 04:32 AM] Audo#5667
now I'll cash out to USDC


[17-Jul-19 04:32 AM] Audo#5667
and then it's party time


[17-Jul-19 04:32 AM] ca333#0333
yes its an operating system limitation. Unlike android its pretty tough to get an app approved with "unusual" background operation times. VOIP apps for example are allowed to operate in the background and theres even a special flag for this. I guess Apple thinks users may associate this with "iphone is crap" since it could drain the battery VERY fast if an app runs longterm in the background. Right now you could extend the background runtime to a max of ~3 minutes according to various documentations. We will work on optimizing this and eventually find a good solution (even if we had to integrate a real VOIP chat functinoality at some point of time to bypass apples rules)

@Audo for 0.1 KMD swap you will burn more ETH so you will actually pay for Vitalik party üôÇ

@Audo ensure you have ETH on your account before executing ERC swaps (like USDC)


[17-Jul-19 04:33 AM] Audo#5667
haha, ok, I didn't thought of that


[17-Jul-19 04:33 AM] Malti#3948
once you are in 2/3, you can lock the phone in iOS @ca333 ?


[17-Jul-19 04:34 AM] ca333#0333
@Malti no you have to keep it running in foreground until the swap is completed.


[17-Jul-19 04:34 AM] Malti#3948
ok


[17-Jul-19 04:34 AM] SHossain#0007

But even if you went into background for a moment (screen-lock), etc. do not worry - atomicDEX backend handles this properly and will continue/resume your swap automagically.


[17-Jul-19 04:34 AM] Malti#3948
i locked it at 2/3 with a Rick and Morty test and it seemed to work

yes, but there is no marketplace view on AtomicDEX right?


[17-Jul-19 04:36 AM] Malti#3948
that you can 'browse' orders

[17-Jul-19 04:36 AM] Audo#5667
What happens if I proceed with KMD - USDC swap without having any ETH balance? It should warn me about it, right? I don't want to press 'trade' and burn my precious KMD


[17-Jul-19 04:37 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Audo App should not allow you to do this returning the error mentioning that you don't have the ETH.

suggestion on the biometric/PIN, maybe a good idea to confirm an actual trade as well with this security and not only the login ?

[17-Jul-19 06:39 AM] Tony Stark#4609
@ca333 upon first run, when I enabled all coins, ETH sync was very slow and eventually died, I had to add all coins one by one ( at first, I marked everything and tried to add all in go)
Actually, I guess ETH sync got somehow stuck, but can't prove this...


[17-Jul-19 06:40 AM] SHossain#0007
@goldenman currently, you need to delete wallet from settings and re-login/setup

@ca333 complementing @Malti earlier comment about autodeleting a wrong PIN it would be a MUST HAVE feature to self destroy the wallet in case the PIN is entered incorrectly X times (say, 10 times).
Also, add a growing time gap each time the PIN is entered incorrectly
(Just like Android and iOS lock screen behavior)

[17-Jul-19 06:44 AM] Tony Stark#4609

[17-Jul-19 06:44 AM] ca333#0333
@Tav on android no. On iOS it wont immeditely fail but it wont execute (finish) the swap if the app isn't kept open. So if you keep it closed too long the swap will eventually timeout (fail).

low bandwidth

maybe it is better to only start with a few coins active and manually add them, but then people will complain they have to manually add

Cleared cache and restarted Android phone but Morty transactions still do not come up, I get the spinning circle. While the circle is spinning I can still send and receive but no transactions will show. After trying to access Morty transactions, then the other coin's transactions will not come up. At work now so can't continue playing with it, we'll try again later.

[17-Jul-19 07:57 AM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
@FtrSaroth I was having the same issue yesterday and today, I tried to create several orders with BAT but nothing ever showed up in the order tab.  I've been wondering if we are not able to actually create a trade/order, we can only accept the trade/orders that are shown


[17-Jul-19 08:02 AM] Tav#8476
Adding to what @cryptoclueless | $ARRR is saying, it isn‚Äôt immediately obvious that creating an order is possible, at first I was under the same impression


[17-Jul-19 08:03 AM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
I thought I read something about market makers and liquidity, so maybe those of us that aren't set up for market makers/liquidity aren't allowed to actually create trade.

These are small amounts but if you look, the exchange rates favors the market maker by 5-10 percent.  I thought I might be able to set up something like that with BAT but it didn't work.  I even tried to set up a even trade and it didn't work.

@ca333 Since @Tav  mentioned trying the QR code  for a withdrawal, I figured I'd try to send some BAT out using the QR code on my android phone.  It did not close atomicdex so thats good, and it looked like the withdrawal was successful, but not tx was actually created.  I've tried twice with no transaction.  Not sure how long I should wait, but my BAT balance has not changed.

@Alecandro it is a joke, but the universal KYC requirement, withdraw limits, etc. that are mandated on the CEX by the govt sure is creating a large demand for a noncustodial KYC-free atomicDEX

@jl777c 10 waiting swaps to be matched or 10 on going swaps?

i think itd be important to test if dICOs are to be a thing again (which they could be with this tech)


[17-Jul-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
a stress test is a good idea. maybe we can have everyone do swaps to the same LP at the same time


[17-Jul-19 09:13 AM] ca333#0333
@dan. the tech is fully ready to carry out dICOs - anyone could create a chain right now - get it listed on atomicDEX mobile and set the ICO orders up.


[17-Jul-19 09:13 AM] jl777c#5810
@Markus i think half a dozen swaps were pending at once, but you need to ask shossain to know for sure

@dan. do you mean dIEO ?


[17-Jul-19 09:14 AM] Alecandro#1179
So I can't remember if anyone asked this or if it got answered yet. Will there be the ability to start a swap and then close the app while it still completes in the future?


[17-Jul-19 09:14 AM] ca333#0333
we have a stresstest coming on an automated infrastructure - we already ran thousands of swaps through that system and will do this in a more coordinated fashion as soon as all beta testers are onboarded - which thb is already some sort of stress-test.


[17-Jul-19 09:15 AM] vichiet#4058
@ca333 how many tester do we have now ?


[17-Jul-19 09:15 AM] dan.#2473
It'd be good to know a max number of concurrent connections so the math can be figured out for number of LP's needed for a dICO. Or maybe an LP can be invisible if currently at the max, to avoid failed swaps due to networking issues


[17-Jul-19 09:15 AM] ca333#0333

i had atomicDEX nodes i run during the tests matching more than 10 swaps almost simultanously - even the swap process itself takes place concurrently as this is a real multhreading DEX engine.


[17-Jul-19 09:17 AM] Tav#8476
Found another pretty important bug: after logging out and back into atomicDEX (entered password, not just PIN) I had to re-add all of the assets that I possess to the portfolio section. At first I thought I‚Äôd lost them but once I added them back, it displayed the balances. This would be a major pain if you had quite a lot of assets in your DEX wallets

Maybe later it could be nice to have a option to tab out of current swap to lets say create another order or browse the orderbook and just get a popup when ur swap is completed?

@benzo where do you copy your seed from?


[17-Jul-19 09:58 AM] SHossain#0007
you shouldn't copy your seed and keep in any device which is connected to internet


[17-Jul-19 09:59 AM] SHossain#0007
write down in a piece of paper or notebook


[17-Jul-19 09:59 AM] SHossain#0007
or in an 100% offline computer


[17-Jul-19 09:59 AM] allbits#5898
What about in gpg protected file?


[17-Jul-19 10:00 AM] SHossain#0007
might be secure enough. but, hey, you never know what gets hacked next.


[17-Jul-19 10:01 AM] allbits#5898
Piece of paper seems stone age, and carries its own risks

[17-Jul-19 10:01 AM] SHossain#0007
keep multiple backups


[17-Jul-19 10:03 AM] SHossain#0007
like combination of paper, crypto steel, offline computer, offline USB drives

@SHossain yeah, I know but I'm willing just for testing....so yeah, that's probably right. I was too excited to get home to write down lol


[17-Jul-19 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
i've an A4 size paper which is filled with seed that used for testing


[17-Jul-19 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
no funds there, but just helps for testing as well


[17-Jul-19 10:10 AM] Malti#3948

[17-Jul-19 10:10 AM] SHossain#0007

End of the day check the notifications to see which went through


[17-Jul-19 10:14 AM] SHossain#0007
we dreamt about this, @Cryptoon,  and the result is this beta test and mobile first approach

yes, it might be possible


[17-Jul-19 10:22 AM] SHossain#0007
if you don't have a github account, post me with details of what you want, i'll create a feature request

[17-Jul-19 10:24 AM] Malti#3948
I put some more funds on my test wallet and will test the 'claim rewards' function tomorrow


[17-Jul-19 10:26 AM] allbits#5898
What is KMD address for DEX? So we can see fees happening in real time


[17-Jul-19 10:26 AM] Malti#3948
it's nice that the app populates your max amount when you put more then you have (e.g. 100000 eth will translate into 0.008 ETH now for me) , however the 'fee' is not included so when I want to confirm the trade it gives me the insufficient funds box


[17-Jul-19 10:28 AM] Malti#3948
i think it's my balance that is the problem and not the logic


[17-Jul-19 10:28 AM] SHossain#0007
@allbits KMD and DEX coin has same address that starts with `R`


[17-Jul-19 10:28 AM] allbits#5898
I'm asking what KMD address the fees go to


[17-Jul-19 10:29 AM] Malti#3948
@SHossain clicking on a coin and seeing the 'trade' option next to 'send' and 'receive would be nice as well


[17-Jul-19 10:30 AM] SHossain#0007
@allbits this is the DEX fee address https://kmdexplorer.ru/address/RThtXup6Zo7LZAi8kRWgjAyi1s4u6U9Cpf


[17-Jul-19 10:31 AM] SHossain#0007
@Malti it is already there. i requested it a month ago


[17-Jul-19 10:31 AM] Malti#3948
and fee calculation is the failing factor for max amount trades

[17-Jul-19 10:32 AM] Malti#3948
hmm, can't see it on iOS, possible?


[17-Jul-19 10:32 AM] SHossain#0007
you need to long press on coin name


[17-Jul-19 10:32 AM] SHossain#0007
wait, let me check iOS


[17-Jul-19 10:32 AM] Malti#3948
aha, i more meant when you short click the coin


[17-Jul-19 10:32 AM] Malti#3948
i'm on it


[17-Jul-19 10:33 AM] Malti#3948
ah yes


[17-Jul-19 10:33 AM] Malti#3948
long press then it appears


[17-Jul-19 10:33 AM] SHossain#0007
there you go


[17-Jul-19 10:33 AM] Malti#3948
but when you 'click' it, then there is only the send receive claim


[17-Jul-19 10:33 AM] SHossain#0007
i wanted 3D touch implementation in there


[17-Jul-19 10:33 AM] Malti#3948
trade would also be a good one (or swap to keep terminilogy)


[17-Jul-19 10:33 AM] SHossain#0007
let me create an in issue then


[17-Jul-19 10:33 AM] Malti#3948

[17-Jul-19 10:34 AM] SHossain#0007

ihahah, but can I just create them in Gitbhub? I don't wanna spam your project


[17-Jul-19 10:34 AM] SHossain#0007
yes, of course you can

anyone with a github account is free to create feature request and report bugs


[17-Jul-19 10:35 AM] Malti#3948
awesome


[17-Jul-19 10:35 AM] Malti#3948
you can also swipe to reveal the send receive swap part


[17-Jul-19 10:35 AM] Malti#3948
nice

the link is in this channel's topic or in pinned posts


[17-Jul-19 10:35 AM] Malti#3948
a little 'boink' of your top coins when you open your app up would reveal that that is an optio

blocks are not 100% consistent and rely on mining


[17-Jul-19 11:19 AM] SHossain#0007
we will get more complains if the estimated time is not right


[17-Jul-19 11:20 AM] jansako#3330
ETA can change as swap progress hapens


[17-Jul-19 11:21 AM] Mark81#4505
Yes variates but we are talking about only giving like time based on last blocks. It helps to know if we are seeing blocktimes longer than normal.


[17-Jul-19 11:21 AM] SHossain#0007
i understand. you guys will not complain. but, there are plenty other users who will just dislike or complain if the estimated time is not correct and changing


[17-Jul-19 11:22 AM] SHossain#0007
steps are there to give you better understanding of what is happening


[17-Jul-19 11:23 AM] SHossain#0007
that's definately a good suggestion.


[17-Jul-19 11:24 AM] Mark81#4505
Ok, how about deep dive from default view to advanced  info what is really happening on blockchain level?


[17-Jul-19 11:26 AM] Markus#5464
There is a bug in swapping kmd to vrsc, if i select kmd and write 0.1 i can choose any coin i want to recieve and 0.1 will stay but if i choose vrsc it changes 0.1 to something else


[17-Jul-19 11:26 AM] t0sma#0368
I have an issue. There is no historic data. Does it work for you? Same for all coin. Picture above

Talking about rates, it could be nice to fetch the rate from oracles instead of having to compute your own, when we will be able to always set our own rates. Could also have some laddering like "Sell 5% premium / discount"

no no


[17-Jul-19 11:49 AM] SHossain#0007
this happens when you have a swap running


[17-Jul-19 11:49 AM] Oszy#5734
exact steps are > open atomicdex > click on any coin üòÑ


[17-Jul-19 11:49 AM] ca333#0333
while swapping the balance of coins will change - yes.


[17-Jul-19 11:49 AM] allbits#5898
We don't have swaps running


[17-Jul-19 11:49 AM] Oszy#5734
also, many times i have to fully quit app and restart to refresh balance or get rid of connection lost message

@SHossain can you please send me the reproduction steps of this issue.

start a swap, while swaps are running, go back to Portfolio page and click on differet coins, it will show loading animation circle

"Base coin balance is 0 is to low to cover gas fee, required 0.0002" I am trying to convert 0.9 KMD to USDC, I have 1 KMD in my account. So I will be left with 0,1  enough to pay the fee. Is there any  amount for minimum atomic swap ?


[17-Jul-19 12:40 PM] cipi#4502
no min amount, but you need ETH to pay for the USDC txfee... that is how ERC20 works, you always pay txfees in ETH no matter which token you tranfer


[17-Jul-19 12:41 PM] aume27Rrpmp.nft#2727
@Chipmoon I would write 
10% discount if paying fees using komodo 
(that what I understand from the post)
It is 10% by holding kmd or by paying fees in kmd

10% discount fee trading with KMD is already accomplished or applied


[17-Jul-19 12:43 PM] Chipmoon#7477
the one that hasn't , is the automatic deduction fee in KMD while trading


[17-Jul-19 12:44 PM] Chipmoon#7477
so that is what I am trying to do a survey on @aume27Rrpmp.nft


[17-Jul-19 12:44 PM] Chipmoon#7477
the concept is by depositing KMD to a lockaddress, and fee will be deducted from that address everytime a trade is completed


[17-Jul-19 12:45 PM] MegaManEXE316#1166
Question. I received the invite for the AtomicDex Beta a couple of days ago. I want to know am I suppose to get another email to download the app?


[17-Jul-19 12:45 PM] aume27Rrpmp.nft#2727
Yes that what I meant. So a better phrasing could be:
How many of you would like 10% discount dexfee if paying fees in KMD on any pair.
Depositing KMD in a lockaddress for the purpose of fee deduction while doing trade in atomicdex? #dexit #dex-it

i got the mail that i'm in the first batch of beta testers 2 days ago but couldn't download the app on googleplay.. it looked exactly like yours. then i cleared cache today and the download button showed up. may clear chache an restart phone?


[17-Jul-19 01:06 PM] MegaManEXE316#1166
@RNI I'll try to do it again and see what happens. Give me a moment

@RNI and it did the same thing. Very odd.

@SHossain it is indeed so that even when in 2/3 you can‚Äôt close the app in iOS. You can however browse around in atomicDEX so not needed to stay on the swap screen. 

When the news page will be activated, that will be the perfect time killer üíö

@aume27Rrpmp.nft I had the same issue and had to entirely reset the app


[17-Jul-19 04:02 PM] aume27Rrpmp.nft#2727
@allbits you mean unistall and everything


[17-Jul-19 04:04 PM] allbits#5898
No. On your Android phone go to settings > apps > atomicdex > storage and hit the "clear data" button


[17-Jul-19 04:04 PM] allbits#5898
Make sure you have you seed backed up before you do that


[17-Jul-19 04:04 PM] aume27Rrpmp.nft#2727
Ok I'll try this


[17-Jul-19 04:09 PM] allbits#5898
I sent them a log, and they say they've identified the issue and are working on it. The reset is just a workaround for now.

Anyone having issues with Verus Coin atomic swap? I tried two and both failed already

I think you need eth in your wallet for gas fees

[17-Jul-19 05:32 PM] cipi#4502
both parties need ETH... you, the taker needs to call the swap contract on the ETH chain to get the ETH, and that costs gas

[17-Jul-19 06:03 PM] tolken#2655
Maybe Kmd will get extra fancy and have a pool of eth do draw from for dex users... but yea, eth has grown long in the tooth


[17-Jul-19 06:57 PM] cipi#4502
the problem with ETH gas is even bigger... look at this tx:  https://etherscan.io/tx/0x91ad987b51e9cf2838764150ab0c1d1b95ddef9e45f3d61bdd4548d5924332bb
value of transferred coin: $1.33
txfee: $0.37
so in order to not loose money, the margin should have been 50% or more on this swap
atm i help me by removing all ERC20 orders from orderbook when gasprice > 20 gwei
the above tx was with 21 Gwei, so i should remove the orders when gasprice > 5 gwei, but ok, i want to let people test all this üòÉ


[17-Jul-19 07:00 PM] cipi#4502
the other solution is to add a feature of `minvolume` for orders, so that the taker must buy at least x amount of the tokens for the swap to start... but that is not implemented yet

Not sure if this issue has been addressed: after claiming KMD rewards in the atomicDEX app, you can no longer see your KMD transaction history. (When tapping on a coin in portfolio section, it normally displays transaction history, but after claiming, it seems to get erased, or fails to display)

[17-Jul-19 10:33 PM] Jisu_jung#8912
I have a mild suggestion for the dex. How about having like a trading competition for people who use the dex with the highest volume after the beta comes out? You know like the binance style trading event. Peeps with highest trading volume gets some kmd and so on. That will really do the stress test rolling.


[17-Jul-19 10:36 PM] DigitalPunk#0381
What a easy a quick experience using the DEX, well worth the wait. Well done Komodo Team! I understand staking KMD is possible in the dex , is the minimum balance still 10KMD?


[17-Jul-19 10:37 PM] TonyL#3577
@Jisu_jung I think it's good idea but at first AtomicDEX should be polished (before massive trading with real funds)


[17-Jul-19 10:39 PM] TonyL#3577
@DigitalPunk Thank you for feedback!
 Rewards generating (it's not staking technically because you dont need to keep wallet online to generate rewards) is the same for KMD blockchain in general  (it's determining by blockchain protocol, not GUI) - UTXOs > 10 KMD starting to generate rewards in 1 hour after "maturing"


[17-Jul-19 10:40 PM] TonyL#3577
You have to claim it once per 30 days to keep generation

Technically RICK and MORTY same coins as other KMD assetchains, just don't have any real USD value


[18-Jul-19 12:05 AM] Alecandro#1179
So would it work for BTC then?


[18-Jul-19 12:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Technically you can swap RICK/MORTY with any coin which presists in AtomicDEX


[18-Jul-19 12:07 AM] TonyL#3577
Our basic QA test is swap of everything with RICK in closed trading network üòÉ

@nymkappa could you please try to restart app on your side? (probably app will resolve this swap if you not cleaned cache/deleted app after this swap)
It seems that taker payment does not returned to you yet in 6.1159 VRSC -> 25.0000 RFOX swap

we need to speedup the init time, do things in the background, do things in parallel, defer waiting for 100% complete


[18-Jul-19 02:34 AM] jl777c#5810
with many coins, if we require all coins to get to 100% initialized, then as we have more coins, the odds of a stuck init gets larger and larger


[18-Jul-19 02:34 AM] jl777c#5810
and maybe the user didnt even care about that coin for that instance

@Kiruel It's not normal for user experience. IIRC I was told that GUI should parallelize the enable requests to speed up them. Is it happening in latest version? I'm going to perform a benchmark with same coins activated in parallel and check what time it will take. I will post results here.

@jl777c i will check the init routine again but its launching coins in parallel already - what we could do is removing the "loading screen" and having the coins pop up in the dashboard as they init/connect one by one vs. waiting for all to finish the init/conn. This is likely a UX issue.

BTW, this has been resolved already but in case others ran into this issue, and as somebody has already mentioned, if you can't see your transactions of the coins then go into the AtomicDEX apps section in settings then "Clear Data" and "Clear Cache". Make sure you save you're seed first. That worked for me.


[18-Jul-19 03:42 AM] TonyL#3577
Please do not clear data/cache if you have failed swaps with funds stuck


[18-Jul-19 03:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Is there some reliable way to reproduce issue with coins tx history and is it actual for specific coins? Unfortunately on my side txhistory loading after different manipulations


[18-Jul-19 03:44 AM] yorklab#7270
My original issue was that I could see the transaction history of all the coins except for Morty. And once I tried to access the transaction history of Morty then I could no longer see the transaction history of any coins. After clearing data and clearing cache everything works fine now.


[18-Jul-19 03:56 AM] Oszy#5734
I cleared cache as I have same issue as @yorklab now i can't even create an order and original issue still remains


[18-Jul-19 03:57 AM] smkhound#7640
which issue? tx history?


[18-Jul-19 03:57 AM] yorklab#7270
Clearing cache alone didn't work for me, I also had to clear data. But you'll need your seed to get back in.

Hi, about the fee structure. I think i dont understand it fully.
I made 4 KMD >LTC trades then resold back all at once LTC > KMD.
My initial balance was 7.77KMD and now its 5.9673KMD and 10~ cents of LTC.
This make 22.7799% fee.
Isnt it a bit high?
(Maybe some balances dont update properly)

Also as a feed back, wouldnt it be possible to give the 10%discount on fees when purchasing KMD with Xcoin. In other word 10%disc. for anytrade implying KMD, base or rel.
Thanks in advance.

ref. the fee - these are hardcoded. But the price you buy/sell may be very different which in the end isnt the fee - but market/trade loss.


[18-Jul-19 07:20 AM] cipi#4502
Look at the prices your are buying/selling at... my node asks for 5% higher price when you buy LTC and bids 5% lower when you sell. Also beware the time difference between buy and sell, prices change.

https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX/blob/master/l10n.dart#L144


On that line, the "name" attribute is spelled incorrectly, i guess the IDE auto checks things, but just in case you wanted to catch this before it's a hair pulling moment down the track :)

`swapSucceful` should be `swapSuccessful` but any changes need correction where it's called.   If it ain't broke.....

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #25: tx history not displaying
Same issue, but for KMD and RICK tx history. Other coins are fine with me.
It does not load history. Once clicked one of these coins, every other coin does not load anymore.

Also orderbook does not load anymore after clicking one of these coins portfolio.
Looks like it's hanging in checking tx history.

App restart does fix it, until checking tx history of KMD or RICK again.

@ca333 I don't know Dart, so can you please update the existing language file with multiple objects which gives me the structure to add this extra language to the file? for now I just made the copy of the existing file and started the hindi translation.

[18-Jul-19 10:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
Once there is an extra object to add more languages, I can probably make a readme file with instructions to help others to start contributing.


[18-Jul-19 10:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
or may be if you can just start importing the other files in this language file, then that will also work. I think this will be better option than adding the extra objects to existing file.


[18-Jul-19 10:37 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you can fix code or this file being imported in existing used language file it'd be easier to start contributing.


[18-Jul-19 11:04 PM] Mylo#8306
nice start.  i made a spreadsheet to help with translation but clearly these extended character sets need to be done directly to src code instead of c+p


[18-Jul-19 11:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I just use the google input tools to type in English and that types that in Hindi for me. I just check the spellings are correct and the phrase I wrote makes sense to the context it is being used in the translated  file.


[18-Jul-19 11:07 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
just using the translate service will do the poor job. has to be typed at many times or at least fixed the errors in translated text.


[18-Jul-19 11:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
the ideal way to let other users to add the translations would be just sharing the translated files like I did. If people knows github they can add those files there or they can maybe just share with the existing staff, and they can push those to GitHub.


[18-Jul-19 11:08 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
but the exiting single file even for me is bit confusing. so I just tried to start with a copy of that file.


[18-Jul-19 11:09 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
which needs to be fixed to be importable to the project.

Is it possible to send eth to the atomicDEX or do I need to have some kmd?


[19-Jul-19 12:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
You can send ETH, fees paid in the trading currency, you are not forced to pay in KMD


[19-Jul-19 12:14 AM] luca_skywalker#0887
Do i have a discount if i use kmd to pay fees?


[19-Jul-19 12:14 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Yes


[19-Jul-19 12:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
But if you want ETH/BTC you cant pay in KMD to get it cheaper


[19-Jul-19 12:15 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Would need ETH/KMD


[19-Jul-19 12:16 AM] luca_skywalker#0887

Do we have any release date?


[19-Jul-19 12:18 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I think there might be something later that could do something like BNB but for now ???/KMD will give you the discount


[19-Jul-19 12:19 AM] hyperDEX#6586
I am not too sure when the official release would be. It is "live" now. Just be careful about it because i dont think you can set market orders yet. You just take what is available


[19-Jul-19 12:20 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So if someone lists something for 5% lower than market rate you would get 5% lower than a CEX

I have a user experience on the latest version of atomicDex that bothers me. I start creating an order, I start filling the order, I go back to my home screen on my phone, and then go back to the application. And here the order I had begun to fill is completely erased. it would be nice if the data of an order being created is persistent

All simply when we put the application in background, we lose the data we were entering.

May be this is already reported

@hastrup AtomicDEX doesn't substract fees automatically. So you need to trade a lower amount to pay the fees with the remainings.

[19-Jul-19 01:51 AM] Oszy#5734
No it's true, on losing focus it does not keep already entered information, power saving has nothing to do with that


[19-Jul-19 01:52 AM] Slyris#2880
It may be a fast fix, but it's not user friendly. I think the customer expects behavior persist by default


[19-Jul-19 01:53 AM] Slyris#2880
Also asking for the fingerprint every time we come back from the background, I think it's a little intrusive. But it's only my opinion.

I think it's a fundamental feature, very important. To be able to explain to our different tax entity the transactions that we could do with our cryptocurrencies and traceability. I think that would allow faster adoption.

We can inspire ourselves for this in the same way as coinbase with their statement downloadable at any time by their customers. The banks systematically ask us for traces of our actions.

- At the startscreen to set a password, you can‚Äôt see which letters a password needs to consist of

- The startup logo is just a small square, would be nicer if it fits the whole screen

-app immediately crashes when opening down to up screen on iphone (for instance to change from 4G to internet, or even to get more brightness on the screen)

-a possibility to sell all amount of a coin (now you need to check the exact amount you have)

-news feed keeps loading for ages (I guess this doesn‚Äôt work as of yet?)

Some remarks (iphone SE user)


[19-Jul-19 02:24 AM] jl777c#5810
seems these can be real issues and need to be posted in github


[19-Jul-19 02:27 AM] ca333#0333 (pinned)
already reported and fixed - please leave issue reporting up to @TonyL @SHossain @smkhound or we will have redundant reports. If you re a community member or tester no need to open issue tickets UNLESS you validate its not reported already and confirmed to be a bug (confirmed by @TonyL or @smkhound ). Otherwise just report your issues in this channel and our team will transform them into a "readable" issue report for us.


[19-Jul-19 02:27 AM] ca333#0333
@Mr. Rager thank you - next build has this iOS specific issue fixed.

@Slyris Yes, it's a dirty fix until devs find a final solution.


[19-Jul-19 02:29 AM] Slyris#2880
@ca333 There is the possibility inside the app to see the version of the app that we are running ?

Yes, I'm tracking this channel all the time when with PC üëç

For example the build number or the version


[19-Jul-19 02:30 AM] TonyL#3577
@Slyris it's possible to see in settings menu on the bottom


[19-Jul-19 02:30 AM] TonyL#3577
In new release will be also possible to see which mm2 version bundled

For now you can check app version in your phone applications management menu - in next release it will be visible on the bottom of settings menu

delete your app (clean)


[19-Jul-19 02:35 AM] ca333#0333
and reinstall the latest versoin


[19-Jul-19 02:35 AM] ca333#0333

[19-Jul-19 02:40 AM] Slyris#2880
When you uninstall the application. The history of your transactions disappears logically. That's why I think that the export of data is super important or even the possibility of link a google drive for example to record in pdf format our transactions.


[19-Jul-19 02:41 AM] Slyris#2880
The user could configure his application so that every month the history of his transactions is automatically exported to his drive in a secure way.


[19-Jul-19 02:42 AM] TonyL#3577
@Mr. Rager is only password hint place you noticed so far where text doens't fit on IphoneSE?


[19-Jul-19 02:43 AM] ca333#0333
TX export coming soon @Slyris - we have this already noted in the 'future features' - even for specific timeframes, etc.


[19-Jul-19 02:43 AM] ca333#0333
For swaps we will think about a method to persist trades (unless a user wants to delete them) too.

it means that if you trade 1 ETH by this rate (1 KMD = 0.005 ETH) you'll get 43000 USD of value for 1 ETH


[19-Jul-19 02:46 AM] smkhound#7640
rates are set by LP, a 5% diff should be assumed


[19-Jul-19 02:47 AM] TonyL#3577
but unlikely someone will want to trade such volume with such rate


[19-Jul-19 02:47 AM] smkhound#7640
someone being opportunistic?


[19-Jul-19 02:47 AM] ca333#0333
@Mr. Rager thats the specific "trade rate" like Tony pointed out.

I would like to sell 1 ETH for that amount of KMD though if you re interested @Mr. Rager

But the Ethereum orderbook seems empty? I tried 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 ETH to KMD, but there are no matches


[19-Jul-19 02:48 AM] ca333#0333
ok seems no orders up - i will put one up for you for demonstration purposes


[19-Jul-19 02:48 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
I have put some orders up, for all these


[19-Jul-19 02:48 AM] ca333#0333
please note that you need ETH balance in order to trade with ETH (sell AND buy side)


[19-Jul-19 02:48 AM] Slyris#2880
It is not yet possible to see all the order books and their contents as a stock market view (binance like) no?


[19-Jul-19 02:49 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
I have 0.5 ETH


[19-Jul-19 02:49 AM] ca333#0333
not yet @Slyris - but similar feature coming


[19-Jul-19 02:49 AM] ca333#0333
a) to see all orders and b) to create manual orders regardsless of already existing orders


[19-Jul-19 02:49 AM] Slyris#2880
It is true that without this feature, it is difficult enough to trade and easier to make mistakes @ca333


[19-Jul-19 02:50 AM] Slyris#2880
But hey if it can allow you to have 43000 dollars ... ahah üòÑ

"it means that if you trade 1 ETH by this rate (1 KMD = 0.005 ETH) you'll get 43000 USD of value for 1 ETH" real value should be 200 dollars though

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #32 exchange rate in USD displaying not correct when creating maker order
On screenshot: input for trade 0.05 ETH for 10 KMD

What means 1 KMD = 0.005 ETH rate, or 1 ETH = 200 KMD

In USD equivalent should be ~242$ (with KMD by 1.21$). So it seems this USD amount calculating not correct.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #30: \[Feature request\]: Ability to export its history in pdf for the taxation and the justifications of our transactions
For now the history of swaps is only local. So if you change a device etc.. you will not have the swap history. So for now it's not possible to do this.


[19-Jul-19 06:50 AM] jl777c#5810
seems that exporting only local history is sufficient @Kiruel 
most people will just use one phone and if they need to get all their history, they would just need to export from each phone used. we dont want to get into aggregating histories from multiple devices


[19-Jul-19 06:51 AM] Kiruel#2091
Do you think it's possible to get all history swaps from a public key ? (in the future i mean)


[19-Jul-19 06:52 AM] Kiruel#2091
Exporting in local it's simple, but i think something more accurate.


[19-Jul-19 06:52 AM] jl777c#5810
that would be accurate enough as long as people dont delete things


[19-Jul-19 06:52 AM] Slyris#2880
You can propose and export in a JSON format that is linked to a drive and when you restore you use the JSON information


[19-Jul-19 06:53 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe if there is some centralized stats website, it could figure out all the swaps, but that will be very tricky


[19-Jul-19 06:53 AM] Kiruel#2091
No centralized information it's the purpose of the app. @Slyris

Yeah I agree @jl777c .


[19-Jul-19 06:54 AM] Kiruel#2091
But we can track in the chain the swaps no ?


[19-Jul-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
i think exporting per device is fine, if users need a 100% complete record, they just need to export from each phone. seems like not a big issue


[19-Jul-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
when volumes are low, we can, but how to detect swaps that dont complete?


[19-Jul-19 06:54 AM] jl777c#5810
also for zaddr based swaps, the source and destination for half the swap is "invisible"


[19-Jul-19 06:55 AM] Kiruel#2091
Hum.


[19-Jul-19 06:55 AM] jl777c#5810
which means it will be more accurate to get the sum of local history than via blockchain


[19-Jul-19 06:55 AM] Kiruel#2091
I just think of people when they log with there seed to another platform like iOS to Android or in the future Desktop.


[19-Jul-19 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
sum of all devices -> accurate history


[19-Jul-19 06:56 AM] jl777c#5810
without a centralized reporting i see no other way, especially when zaddr swaps come online


[19-Jul-19 06:57 AM] Kiruel#2091
Because they use centralized application everytime. That can be strange for users.


[19-Jul-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
unless you specifically export the zaddr swap info, there is no way anybody will be able to correlate


[19-Jul-19 06:57 AM] Kiruel#2091
Ok.


[19-Jul-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
welcome to the decentralized world


[19-Jul-19 06:57 AM] Kiruel#2091
haha


[19-Jul-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
some things must be different


[19-Jul-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
else it will be the same centralized world


[19-Jul-19 06:57 AM] Kiruel#2091
Yeah true but we need to teach ppl.


[19-Jul-19 06:57 AM] jl777c#5810
if people really need their history, they will find out how to export their history


[19-Jul-19 06:58 AM] Kiruel#2091
Or at-least find sollution to be close to centralized.


[19-Jul-19 06:58 AM] Kiruel#2091
(but still DEX)


[19-Jul-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
decentralized trading with centralized big brother tracking all swaps?


[19-Jul-19 06:58 AM] jl777c#5810
i feel allergic to this


[19-Jul-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
if people want to report, let them, but we cant force them. so that means we would need to record all trades from everybody to be able to record it centrally as we wont know if they will want a history in the future


[19-Jul-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
you see where this leads to?


[19-Jul-19 06:59 AM] ca333#0333
atomicDEX wouldnt be as efficient as it is if we did persist all swaps - what we can do in the future is turning it a local app feature with a local persisting DB for swaps. Not much more that can be done for now and until the swaps persist in the network which i see resulting in potential efficiency issues


[19-Jul-19 06:59 AM] Kiruel#2091
Yeah I see exalty.


[19-Jul-19 06:59 AM] jl777c#5810
and with zaddr swaps, it isnt possible to do it from blockchain, not to mention the difficulty in correlating who the other side of the swap was


[19-Jul-19 07:00 AM] jl777c#5810
i think a simple log of all swaps as they are complete would be sufficient and also handy for some of the requested features and bugs


[19-Jul-19 07:00 AM] Kiruel#2091
So it's just local first, and it's better like this. We just need to tell the users.


[19-Jul-19 07:00 AM] Kiruel#2091
Inside the app.


[19-Jul-19 07:00 AM] ca333#0333
yes exactly


[19-Jul-19 07:00 AM] jl777c#5810
yes exactly


[19-Jul-19 07:11 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Doesn't it conflict with statistics capturing that we have to implement? The swap statuses are sent and stored on seednodes now (which also helps to troubleshoot the swaps). How should we deal with this?


[19-Jul-19 07:12 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Anyone can be a seednode actually, but the data is still stored and can be tracked by `big brother` maintaining his own seednode.


[19-Jul-19 07:13 AM] jl777c#5810
when the bugs are all fixed, then we can just get aggregate data from the blockchain


[19-Jul-19 07:14 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Do you mean by scanning the coins blockchains trying to find swap payments?


[19-Jul-19 07:15 AM] jl777c#5810
if we just need to get aggregate swap data, we can just track the amounts in the dexfee address and get a very good estimate


[19-Jul-19 07:23 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
It might require some effort to collect such data and then try to detect what other coin participated in swap. What is the reason to do it if we can simply allow swap status broadcast to network?


[19-Jul-19 07:24 AM] jl777c#5810
for aggregate stats we dont need to correlate the other side


[19-Jul-19 07:24 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Of course we can add an option allowing user to disable this.

Hi - just got the testflight invitation today and got started - pretty awesome, have done some rick > morty swaps and then some VRSC > KMD which have gone through in minutes over wireless.

Core swap functionality is amazing compared to where things were at with BarterDex MM1 - amazing effort, this is so cool!

I am on iOS iPhone 7 and found the usability tricky from the point of view of keeping the app in focus on the screen and not in the background. Using the app is fine, but waiting for swaps i ran into problems a few times

First few swaps timed out because the screen would lock, and when i bought the app back and accessed via touch ID it didn‚Äôt seem to like it much. (so set screen timeout to longer, which meant i got successful swaps but it set at 5 mins which obviously not ideal)

Assume swaps won‚Äôt complete whilst the app is in background mode?

Also seems that the touch ID biometric authentication can get it is in a bit of a mess when returning to the app double clicking to bring up the open apps in the background because the touch id message just keeps coming back even though it accepts my thumb and then app goes back into the background.

Other small thing i noticed when i first set up the wallet and hadn‚Äôt closed the app yet was when double clicking to get app into focus the screen that was being shown was the first screen with my seed in it! Now i have closed the app and started again and now the screen shown is the PIN screen as i would expect.

Using the actual app and swap function is so easy and simple, so cool, just need to test it on mobile now when walking to the pub for next use case :)

Thanks you everyone in the KMD that built this - its just phenomenal!!!


[19-Jul-19 07:25 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Current dexstats site contains both coins and their volumes.


[19-Jul-19 07:25 AM] ca333#0333
that gives user some sense of privacy and big brother can just parse the blockchains if he wants to track all swaps.


[19-Jul-19 07:25 AM] jl777c#5810
it seems it is just more work to add this and after debugging, and dexstats will just need to track activity at the dexfee address. it will need to do this to track DEX revshare anyway, so not any extra work


[19-Jul-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810
if we are gathering this data, i just forsee it leading to bad things


[19-Jul-19 07:26 AM] jl777c#5810

I experienced this aswell.

"Assume swaps won‚Äôt complete whilst the app is in background mode?"
Would like to know this aswell, I have a few orders (not swaps, orders) up. Am wondering if they are able to complete if my app is not running in front


[19-Jul-19 07:33 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
@FtrSaroth confirmed me this swap failed at his side at 15:51. My app still has this ongoing 2/3 at 16:31

I already tried restaring the app


[19-Jul-19 07:41 AM] miles#6381
@Mr. Rager - i managed to get to get one swap through after the the low battery warning popped up in the middle of a swap and sent to the app to the background - i got it back into focus - authenticated and then went to the orders screen as quick as i could and it carried on from step 2 - but had a couple of other timeout / fail when the app was in background for longer.


[19-Jul-19 07:41 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
Maybe this has something to do with it? It is syncing since yesterday (started at 8 millions tx or so)

Can somebody confirm wether these TX needs to be synced fully, before being able to swap? That would help

4G Swap test just completed - Pub Enabled Swaps....


[19-Jul-19 08:06 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
I think 13.3751 went missing from my account, see attached pictures

1 = history of vrsc which shows unconfirmed tx of 13.3751 vrsc
2 = apperently confirmed tx of 13.3751 vrsc
3 = swap history showing the 13.3751 tx had timed out
4 = detail of time out

It is possible though that my account will be credited the 0.0107 eth when all ETH TX are synced? But then again, the swap shows timed out, so this is strange at the least.

[19-Jul-19 08:17 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
Thanks, @FtrSaroth . I'll wait this one out, let's see what happens üòÉ


[19-Jul-19 08:17 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
Is the 0.0107 eth missing from your account?


[19-Jul-19 08:19 AM] FtrSaroth#2069
Apparently no, only the fees every time i try a swap üòÖ


[19-Jul-19 08:21 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
ETH gas price is high now according to ethgasstation (https://ethgasstation.info/), the atomicDEX-API doesn't check gas price on order creation so it then results into failed swap as you attempt to trade amount close to your entire balance.


[19-Jul-19 08:22 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
So the swap_status contains error from ETH RPC node: `\"Insufficient funds. The account you tried to send transaction from does not have enough funds. Required 13700000000000000 and got: 10745000000000000.\"`


[19-Jul-19 08:22 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
I'd recommend to not trade ETH as of now at least until gas price gets lower.


[19-Jul-19 08:23 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
The stuck VRSC payment should be refunded in few hours, please restart the app periodically.


[19-Jul-19 08:23 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
My original order of 25 seems back up, while balance stays at 15.21.

[19-Jul-19 08:29 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Mr. Rager You're welcome! So you initially created 25 VRSC <-> 0.02 ETH order, it matched partially, but amount is still displayed as 25 while your balance is lower than this, correct?


[19-Jul-19 08:31 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
@artem.pikulin  correct, except the transactions shows as timed out


[19-Jul-19 08:32 AM] FtrSaroth#2069
Thanks  @artem.pikulin, with ltc tried two times 1 success and 1 failed, with eth tried 5 times and the 5 failed


[19-Jul-19 08:33 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
You may try to trade lower amount but I wouldn't recommend this as fee will be quite high.


[19-Jul-19 08:33 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
You are about to pay 1$ worth in ETH gas fee per trade.


[19-Jul-19 08:35 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
At least 0,5$ each side.


[19-Jul-19 08:35 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
I didn‚Äôt know about those gasfees. LOLthereum, thats why I‚Äôm trying to swap them for KMD üòè


[19-Jul-19 08:36 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
20 is not highest gas price ever been, it was 100 or even more sometimes during spam attacks.


[19-Jul-19 08:37 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
So ETH swap might cost even more and there's not much we can do about it.

The speed of Atomic swap depends of the speed of both blochain. I'm correct?  So if yes, could be nice to have an estimation time of the swap according to the time to have a new block.


[19-Jul-19 09:42 PM] t0sma#0368
Could be also something visual like red, orange, green indicator.


[19-Jul-19 09:43 PM] t0sma#0368
If I swap 2 Komodo smartchain, swap will be fast compare to a swap with BTC.


[19-Jul-19 09:44 PM] t0sma#0368
This is to help people to understand that is it normal that an atomic swap takes time.


[19-Jul-19 09:47 PM] t0sma#0368
There is an issue in TX historic. It's mentioned unconfirmed instead of confirmed.

When I want to sell all amont of a coin. I can't because I can't pay fees.  Could be nice if fees are automatically calculated and deducted from the amount I want to sell.

`There is an issue in TX historic. It's mentioned unconfirmed instead of confirmed.` what version of the application are you using? Current one 0.1.3 (you can update via PlayMarket) - this issue with tx history was fixed

So there is still 13.3715 vrsc missing since yesterday. However I have an order up (original order) of 25 vrsc.

Now lets try and see what happens if I cancel the original order

You need to correctly uninstall the application before @yorklab


[20-Jul-19 02:29 AM] Slyris#2880
If you update without uninstall


[20-Jul-19 02:30 AM] Slyris#2880
You will not see the number anymore


[20-Jul-19 02:30 AM] Slyris#2880
This is a known bug.

[20-Jul-19 02:32 AM] TonyL#3577
@Mr. Rager it's not good that you have some funds missed/stuck
Do you have log file with this problem swap or it's uuid?


[20-Jul-19 02:34 AM] TonyL#3577
Also have you tried to restart app after full stop? Probably app will continue swap or at least will try to and we'll see something helpful in log (in case you didn't delete/reinstall app after problem swap)


[20-Jul-19 02:35 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
I restarted several times since yesterday, I have not reinstalled the app


[20-Jul-19 02:36 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
This is what I have regarding the swap

I guess it's still possible that the Ethereum will be credited to my balance, when the Ethereum wallet is ready syncing


[20-Jul-19 02:38 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
Cancelling the order of 25 vrsc did not do anything as of yet


[20-Jul-19 02:39 AM] TonyL#3577
Can you check your Ethereum address in explorer?  (https://etherscan.io/)

There is no such feature at the moment. you can execute "logout" from settings and then on login will have only default coins activated

I don't seem to be able to swap anymore since updating the app. All attempts stay at 0/3

@Mr. Rager If it will not help to send logs via app - could you please dm me when you have a PC, USB cable to connect the phone and a little bit time for `adb` logs collecting?


[20-Jul-19 05:23 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
The app just crashed for some reason at the start screen ( I had all my wallets up: btc, kmd, vrsc, doge and dgb). Just I have my phone connected to my macbook right now


[20-Jul-19 05:25 AM] Mr. Rager#6247
I will try send feedback once more now


[20-Jul-19 05:25 AM] TonyL#3577
ok, on OSX to install adb:
1) Install Homebrew (in case if it's not installed yet): `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`
2) Install android cli tools: `brew cask install android-platform-tools`
3) After it you should be able to use adb `adb devices`


[20-Jul-19 05:26 AM] TonyL#3577
Also you need to enable USB debugging on your phone (it vary of Android version)

We would love to add some dex trading on our wallet, however we don‚Äôt see a lot of demand and adoption for that. If there were, we would move into it immediately

Question: When I go to trade and select coin to Sell (Rick), then select coin to buy (Morty), I am unable to change the rate so that it will create a new order at a different rate. Is that by design? New orders at different rates cannot be created?


[20-Jul-19 09:02 AM] aume27Rrpmp.nft#2727
Shossain i clicked on the google play link shared yb ca333
Then "download from google play" button.
Then clicked on "installed" and it started downloading even ifs it was showing installed after i unistalled.

I'm assuming that it's taking time because theres no one on the exchange . Is that correct?

So i have some questions about the LP thing. I heard the current LP fee is like 5%? If more people use it, then does it mean that the swap will happen without an LP and the trade will happen on the market value without any slippage on both parties except the dex fee?


[20-Jul-19 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
LP doesn't pay fee


[20-Jul-19 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
maker never pay fee


[20-Jul-19 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
taker pays 1/777 fee


[20-Jul-19 10:04 AM] SHossain#0007
which is about 0.15%


[20-Jul-19 10:04 AM] Jisu_jung#8912
I mean the LP charges a fee for their risk

The orders placed by the team on rick kmd are for us(testers) to buy kmd with testcoins not the other way. Sorry having some doubts xD

I have a feature to propose  for github:
From trade history>in a trade detail, add repeat/retry trade. 
It would bring you to make a swap with the 2 asset selected and amounts entered.

Just starting and have a small issue... Grabbed 7.777 Rick from the faucet then tried to kick off a swap 1 Rick for 0.5 Morty. It eventually timed out and is showing 0 confirmation for both the 7.777tx and the initial tx for the swap. If I look for the txs on the explorer it they are not there but if i go back to the faucet it says I've had enough.

How long does the trade is active ? Its been over 1hr since i placed an order, what will happen if the   order is not matched lets say i placed a trade for some xyz coin at 0.00100 sats but never got processed as the price of the coin went up to 0.00101 and that never goes back to 0.00100 sat price

How can one get his coins back ? That he placed for trade ?

Here's a few thoughts about the atomicdex. I've tried to think about this from the point of view of newbies and how they can get onboard easier. 
First off, really great job! This is going to be awesome when it's done. VERY easy to navigate and to use. I can't wait to see what you guys come up with in terms of improvements. Here's my set of suggestions.

1) sending coins from coinbase/binance  (PC) to the dex involves actually having to type the address out. This can be a nuisance /liability . So a good addition would be to let the app scan the text or a qr code
2) this might be phone specific, but if you can have the address displayed in one line as opposed to the last few characters on the next line, it might be more convenient for users.
3) if I need to leave the app for some reason while I'm about to enter the amt for the swap, when I get back in, the selections and the numbers are gone. So if you can retain those number while the app gets locked, that would be awesome. 
4)It would be nice if you could explicitly explain what the kmd reward is somewhere in the app
5) same as above for the gas needed for transactions
6) I'm not sure if this was by design, but my Rick and morty addresses were the same. I got my rick coins. And when I tried to put the address in morty faucet provided in the email. It mentioned that it was sent to the address. But it never showed up.

Tests in the email 
1) the Rick and morty swap executed perfectly.
2) I tried to swap some the kmd for eth. I got a msg saying "base coin balance is too low to cover gas fee. Need 0.0002" what does this mean? I need to have some eth to be able to swap kmd with eth? I got that same msg when I tried to swap kmd with usdc as per the email.

Hope this helps! Great job guys! It was awesome to be a part of this

Yes you need eth in order to acquire eth or usdt. It's because you need to pay for your smart contract that is executing your swap. It's an eth thing.

Of course it does. Damn shitcoin :/
Thanks.

i still recommend we should set up an eth donation address to help get people into kmd and off of the eth plantation. how its distribution could be implemented is beyond me however.

`- logout, create a second wallet2, erased coin list of wallet1 when logging back in. ` - it supposed to be normal behavior at the moment

Please use "Settings -> Send feedback" feature to send logs from app


[20-Jul-19 11:05 PM] TonyL#3577
`Please, stop testing chainswap, we have reports of issues.` - no need to stop, just please `Use "OPTIONS -> SEND FEEDBACK` feature to send LOG after FAILED SWAP`

For now it seems that there is some specific connectivity problem to electrums and more logs after failed swap will help to isolate it.
  
@ubhillutd thak you for a feedback!  advices are great, nice idea to show information message/popup that ETH is needed when in ERC20/ETH part of the swap

Hey guys not sure if this has been mentioned, but I ended up going in circles when using 4 digit pin instead of 6. Wasn't prompted to use 6 and it stuck on 'encrypting wallet' for ages. When I restarted the app the wallet was there but I couldn't unlock it. Fixed now, but thought I mention it.

Hello. So I have those swaps which failed (timeout) more than 24h ago and my funds did not returned properly. I made some test running the app in power saver mode and I think the app is put to sleep when I switch to another one (not by killing it). Thereofe I guess this makes the swap fails.
The thing is it also happened while running in performance mode.
There is definitely something wrong if  the app is not focused and active.

It's almost nithing, but for the sake of learning, is there anything I can attempt to do in order to recover the failed sawp funds?

Ex: e4e51deb-497f-4b65-b6d0-f689d5763095
Requested 1.7803 KMD for 61.6907 RFOX.
My balance shows 0 KMD.

Dear testers, please `do not swap RVN until the next AtomicDEX update`.
RVN electrum servers which using in at the moment in the app very unstable, what causing almost all RVN swaps fails. 
We already prepared own RVN electrums infrastructure and it's under testing at the moment so in next release we'll have stable ones ü§û

Hi - how do i get ver 0.13? I am on iOS and got v0.12 from testflight via the email that came through. Testflight still showing old version. Also - i have a timeout swap from a few days ago that hasn't returned my coin depsite various restarts etc. where is best to send the logs? In general though 95% swap all done without problem so long as i keep the app active and not in the background - pretty awesome!! cant wait to play with next version üòÉ


[22-Jul-19 12:29 AM] ca333#0333
@miles iOS takes always few days more for the version upgrade as apple requires a application approval process. The 0.1.3-a for iOS likely available in the next 2-3 days.

Coins loading process was improved in latest mm2 release which was bundled in 0.1.3a, but at the moment mm2 binary not updating when you using "Update" button in playmarket (it'll be fixed in next releases).
So would be great if you try to uninstall current app first and then install 0.1.3-a again. (at first please ensure that you control seed from your wallet to restore it)

Hello.  I have some feed back on the mobile DEX.  Very good so far.  I have done 11 swaps.  6 Timeout failures.  For some reason, the tactile feedback on entering my pin could be more sensitive.  For the 6 number password, it often only registers 5 numbers. Not sure why, but it happens more often than not.  Also, when a atomic swap fails, it would be better to have the error message stay up until you confirm OK.  Many times I am trying to read the error message but it dissapears before I finish reading it.  Overall, the mobile DEX is impressive and I am excited for Komodo's future.  Keep up the great work. üëå (I just realized I posted this is the wrong section, earlier...my apologizes)


[22-Jul-19 02:49 PM] Mr. Orange#4717

Is there some way to see the list of orders without first typing in both a coin and an amount on the trade screen?

Would be awesome to have some sort of notifications or at least a refresh button of sorts.


[22-Jul-19 06:54 PM] aume27Rrpmp.nft#2727
Yes same here xD, ive proposed the refresh button to.
No at the moment unless you run a full node(lp node) theres no way to just query the orderbook.


[22-Jul-19 06:57 PM] aume27Rrpmp.nft#2727
Also at the moment. The way the order book is displayed and loads isnt super intuitive. Im never sure if it loaded properly or if im having an issue, it leave a lot of uncertainty in the accuracy of what is displayed.

Perhaps a stupid question, isn't 12 words for a private key seed to low if you want to reach the kind of adoption you're aiming at?


[22-Jul-19 11:03 PM] Mewnzter#0237
Or is it always 12 words + password to recover on a new device?


[22-Jul-19 11:37 PM] Oszy#5734
You are free to use your own seed just import that instead of creating a new one.


[22-Jul-19 11:37 PM] Oszy#5734
Later it could be an option to choose from 12-24 that is a good idea.


[23-Jul-19 12:24 AM] Mewnzter#0237
Ok, will do that when it's out of beta :)


[23-Jul-19 12:31 AM] Oszy#5734
Found a `bug?` so far only happened with DOGE, I have 12.94 DOGE in my wallet, when I am creating an order and pressing the `MAX` button, it fills the input field with only 2.92 DOGE and then i get an error saying you need at least 5 DOGE to swap.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #41: Withdraw transaction history shows source address as destination if less than whole balance sent\.
The withdraw transactions are OK, you sent from RUwodWWAabv3h2jSatVDSMT89cLkTMSutA to RKD8NjuLNrnqaFY9KRpU6MAWHeve9byjAA and the rest was returned to RUwodWWAabv3h2jSatVDSMT89cLkTMSutA, that is why the tx has 2 outputs.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #41: Withdraw transaction history shows source address as destination if less than whole balance sent\.
I understand, but atomicdex display doesn't show the address where bulk of funds (the address input as destination) went to.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/35845239/61710492-5b444580-ad84-11e9-981f-2c93bcf3c6f2.png)

This creates the misconception that all funds were sent to self. User reported this when attempting to send to Binance (I linked them to tx on explorer to confirm it actually went there).

[23-Jul-19 08:02 PM] Tav#8476
Found a bug with the new update that could potentially cause problems, it‚Äôs a bit difficult to explain but I‚Äôll give it a shot. First I hit max on the coin I‚Äôm trying to sell, then I select the coin I want to buy. There isn‚Äôt enough of the coin to buy, so it reduces the amount I‚Äôm selling. I noticed the amount I was selling was very small for the amount of the coin I‚Äôd be getting. I thought there must be some mistake, why am I getting such a good rate? I almost didn‚Äôt think twice and almost hit the swap button thinking I‚Äôd hit the lotto, but then I checked again on the selling amount. It displayed 62.347838, but after tapping the amount field, it scrolled over to reveal that the amount was actually 162.347838. This could definitely cause some issues


[23-Jul-19 08:11 PM] Tav#8476
Also, in this screenshot of a transaction, the button in the top right (circled in red), I believe it‚Äôs a button to view the transaction in a separate block explorer, but it doesn‚Äôt work, it exits the app. It happens on any transaction from any coin

I'm testing with .0053 BTC, prior to requesting what coin I want to swap for I press MAX. It brings my max down to .00441232 BTC. So my question is why does it lower my balance to .00441232 BTC?

Also, when attempting to create an order (since there were no existing orders in the book), it refuses my order telling me the minimum trade for BTC is .00777 BTC. If this is a rule (and not a  bug) it would be nice to list it in a FAQ section.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #2: 5 digits input issue base sell
Its because you don‚Äôt have enough RICK. So if you try to put more than your balance the field is clean.

1 DGB price is around 0.01$, 10000 DGB selling is just 100$ order. So it would be great if it'll be possible to input >4 digits into this field.

@TonyL Okay. So there is no maker fee, but there is a taker fee of 0.015%, what is the txfee?

@pbcpaintballer Hi! Could you please try this link? https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex


[24-Jul-19 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptonian txfee for BTC isn't hardcoded calculating dynamically from AtomicDEX protocol side, let me find out how it's calculating üòÉ


[24-Jul-19 07:57 AM] TonyL#3577
In general you'll see it before broadcasting confirmation, last time I've tried to send BTC fee was around 0.0005


[24-Jul-19 07:59 AM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2/mm2src/coins/utxo.rs#L1681 for BTC it's calculating as "Dynamic" in case of electrum mode usage (which AtomicDEX is using), and this dynamic is taking from electrumx protocol if I understand correct. I think @artem.pikulin or @artemciy_dice can explain precise how this fee calculating

if funds are spent, does it cancel all orders automatically related to that coin?


[24-Jul-19 08:29 AM] Oszy#5734
or does it stay and will get executed when i have that coin again?


[24-Jul-19 08:30 AM] TonyL#3577
Like a case when you have KMD/RVN KMD/DOGE lets say and somebody sell you some DOGE and you don't have enough KMD to pay for KMD/RVN order?


[24-Jul-19 08:30 AM] Oszy#5734
yes


[24-Jul-19 08:31 AM] Oszy#5734
if  KMD balance goes to 0


[24-Jul-19 08:31 AM] TonyL#3577
I don't think that order will be cancelled automatically in such case - most probably second swap will just fail on maker txfee (in case of balance == 0) or maker payment tx broadcasting stage (in case if balance < maker payment)


[24-Jul-19 08:33 AM] Oszy#5734
should it be removed tho?  is it going to make a difference in bigger scales for the mm2 if it's filled with many active orders that can't be filled because of this?


[24-Jul-19 08:34 AM] Oszy#5734
also to avoid failed swaps

I have clarification question, if I set up a trade that is stored in the order book, do I have to have my phone on, and AtomicDex open for someone to accept the trade, and for it to be processed?


[24-Jul-19 02:35 PM] cipi#4502
yes, both nodes (maker and taker) need to be online to perform the swap


[24-Jul-19 02:36 PM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
so the hope is that more users = more liquidity, which eliminates the issue of the phone and app needing to remain on?


[24-Jul-19 02:37 PM] cipi#4502
yes... i also think that, as time passes, more people with atomicdex on PCs or servers will be there to offer liquidity


[24-Jul-19 02:37 PM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
So does an order then disappear from the orderbook when the app is closed? or does it remain, it just can't be successful?


[24-Jul-19 02:38 PM] cipi#4502
not sure about that, i haven't tried, but i guess the order will disappear from orderbook when you close the app... someone has to confirn this though

it would be nice if there was a way to allow the app to run in the background, maybe giving the user this permission option, as I'd expect it would eat at the battery

Hey guys I have been testing barterDEX in the early days and am patiently waiting for my atomicDEX invite to snap some pictures - might it be possible to get the invite sooner ? I‚Äòm on iOS üòÉ


[24-Jul-19 03:20 PM] ca333#0333
on android the app does process swaps and and other operations in the background. On iOS this is not possible though @cryptoclueless | $ARRR

[24-Jul-19 03:21 PM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
ok, so the app can close as long as I don't log out, and swaps can still process?


[24-Jul-19 03:23 PM] ca333#0333
"close" is moving the app to the background and focus on some other app or locking screen for example - but if you "kill" the application then it wont do anything in the background.


[24-Jul-19 03:26 PM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
I believe I understand.  there is an option to "Log Out on Exit", so if I don't turn this switch on, and the phone locks after 2 minutes to save power, the app should still be running in the background.

I updated to 0.1.4 and it's exhibiting poor behavior so far. Not loading orderbooks. Fiat balances are showing zero across the board (although the coin balances are all showing properly)


[24-Jul-19 07:20 PM] Regnar#6164
just a small design change I'd like to recommend on AtomicDEX, when you have an active trade ongoing, and you click on it from the "orders" menu, the whole "swap ongoing" screen should be moved up so that you don't have to scroll at all, currently the swap ID is cut off and there really isn't a need for this


[24-Jul-19 07:47 PM] allbits#5898
My orderbooks are fine now. But the fiat balance still shows at zero across the board.


[24-Jul-19 08:47 PM] TonyL#3577
@aume27Rrpmp.nft please try to clean Play Store cache - helped me in similar cases (even phone reboot not helped but cache cleaning does)

@allbits please try to reboot phone, if it'll not help - please DM me your application logs (Settings -> Send report)

@Regnar thank you for feedback! Do you mean this ^^ screen?


[24-Jul-19 08:51 PM] TonyL#3577
I wonder it depends of phone screen size, maybe progress circle size should scale depends of the screen size to fit Swap ID ü§î But in general Swap ID is debug/support information mostly in GUI


[24-Jul-19 09:35 PM] allbits#5898
Ok. Logs sent and screenshot of issue. Phone was rebooted


[24-Jul-19 09:42 PM] allbits#5898
Issue resolved by logging out and logging back in.  Settings > log out. Thanks Tony!


[24-Jul-19 09:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Was glad to help! üëç Most probably it was caused by some cache + playmarket update

[24-Jul-19 11:05 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, 0.1.3 is not visible in my Testflight too at the moment so it's normal state. It's related to propagation/approval of fresh 0.1.4 release with important fixes (to sync testing state with android platform)

Not sure if this is the right place for this, but I'm starting to play around with the atomicdex CLI on linux. I've completed the walkthroughs for RICK/MORTY, as well as KMD/LTC in the 'how to be a LP".  I've managed to figure out how to launch an electrum coin, by copying the LTCconnect.sh and replacing the neccesary info to launch, say, RICK, but where can I find the info for launching DOGE, or RFOX for example? I can get RPCports from the coins file, but what about URLs?

That little word "you" in the news article kept this from being exactly the first 12 BIP words. @Oszy had wise Spidey sense not to include that one.

Now I'm super curious about the seed words used in atomicDEX. Is it strictly BIP39? Or is it using a modified list of words that excludes words like "you"?

Or perhaps there was another hint tucked away that indicated one should ignore that BIP word...?

@Oszy LetsEncrypt / certbot is great, and fortunately supports multiple (sub) domains for free. So `https://www.domain` and `https://domain` can both have SSL certificates. To make it work, nginx or similar should be configured for this. /sidenote

Please reopen app and try again with "fast encryption" mode enabled


[25-Jul-19 01:39 PM] nitrospawn#6261
Went back clicked on fast encryption and still the same will close app and reopen now


[25-Jul-19 01:40 PM] Jcharming#2693
Thanks @TonyL   I just opened up the app and I saw the create or restore option.  Does atomicDEX have it's own wallet  setup process, and if so is it safe/is it different from the agama problem that happened a while ago?   I'm just looking for info before I create a wallet,


[25-Jul-19 01:41 PM] nitrospawn#6261
@TonyL  how long does a decryption take


[25-Jul-19 01:42 PM] TonyL#3577
@nitrospawn usually it taking around 5-10 seconds on my Android phone (Xiaomi Redmi Note 5)


[25-Jul-19 01:42 PM] TonyL#3577
@Jcharming It's totally different from Agama, have separate codebase written in another language and with very low amount of external dependencies. So it can be considered as safe. But please note that it's in beta stage now - so some bugs might presists still.


[25-Jul-19 01:44 PM] Jcharming#2693
Thank you, I don't intend to use it to store amounts, I was just curious about the wallet and its dependencies as compared to agama.  Do you know if Agama is working and safe to start using again?


[25-Jul-19 01:45 PM] TonyL#3577
Verus Agama is safe to use (it dont have vulnerability connected with hack), at the moment Verus developing Agama wallet project


[25-Jul-19 01:45 PM] nitrospawn#6261
Still decrypting as we speak

[25-Jul-19 01:47 PM] TonyL#3577
@nitrospawn please try to create new wallet - since last encryption attempt hanged on your side maybe this one is unfinished/corrupted on preparation stage state


[25-Jul-19 01:47 PM] TonyL#3577
@gnarbill please DM me your email associated with playmarket account


[25-Jul-19 01:47 PM] nitrospawn#6261
@TonyL ok


[25-Jul-19 01:48 PM] gnarbill#7799
@TonyL will do


[25-Jul-19 01:49 PM] nitrospawn#6261
@TonyL the password creation style might be dificult to remember 12 words !


[25-Jul-19 01:49 PM] TonyL#3577
It's not a password but seed. It's the most important "key" for your wallet


[25-Jul-19 01:49 PM] TonyL#3577
Write down it in some safe place


[25-Jul-19 01:50 PM] TonyL#3577
It's a thing which not changing often so creation/saving process should be reliable so user definetly will not lost access to it


[25-Jul-19 01:52 PM] nitrospawn#6261
Created a new wallet and it took 5 seconds

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #44 PIN is initialized when device reboots during account creation
I rebooted my phone (Android) while the app was encrypting my initial wallet and didn't seem to finish (both fast and non-fast encryption). After the reboot, the app thought I had a wallet with a PIN and asked me for the PIN, but of course I didn't know the PIN since I never got there. 

I fixed it using recover wallet (I had the seed anyway), and that worked great.

When opening the failed wallet with the passphrase (so I can try to delete it), I get stuck on "decrypting wallet".

Suggestion:

When restoring a seed phrase (not custom), instead of a single blank, it would be better to provide 12 boxes and validate the input into each box to make sure they are valid bip39 words and provide feedback after each word.

To do this, my suggestion will be to provide 12 boxes and a button that says 
 "Next box". When the button is hit, the word in the current box should be validated and if it is valid, move the cursor to the next box. If not turn the box red and say invali...

Will try, might be on my side but happened twice. When typing the password a final space was added into the password. 
So basically the password for encryption had a space in the end, usually they do not accept that on passwords but I might be wrong.

can I run same wallet (seed) at the same time on multiple mm2 instances ?


[26-Jul-19 08:22 AM] gcharang#6833
@Oszy I don't think it is recommended
Any use case i can think of that needs same seed on different instances can be done on one instance

You can maybe enable different pairs on different instances with same seed without trouble


[26-Jul-19 08:23 AM] Oszy#5734
oh yes that's what i am doing, there are pairs on ChainSwap that are not on Atomicdex and was wondering if it interferes or not

Hey guys, I am part of the initial 1000 to get invited to download the app.  I made sure my email address matched my iphone appstore account but when I search for AtomicDex it doesn't show up.  Anyone else experience this issue?

@Oszy running two instances of MM from the same seed on the same IP was a problem with MM1. The swaps would just fail most of the time. As it was explained to me, it was something with the data not knowing which instance of MM it belongs to. if it was resolved in MM2, great but I would check...

Question : I spent 0.0001 kmd but the fee was 0.0001 without any warning. Is it planned to add a warning when fees represent a big part of the trade (> 10% as example)

This was during a swap. But I don't think it should have been negative in the first place...

Not sure if this is a known issue, but my orders or in-progress swaps don't show up under Orders anymore. Yet they're still there, as I'm still getting them executed. They're never showing under orders, not even after just placing them. This didn't use to be the case (hence "anymore"). I'm on Android.

The app itself looks really like super early beta, there is still a lot can be done: design, ux/ui, if you are making a swap you still see the whole amount in your wallet, if you have smth locked you don‚Äôt understand it is locked until you try to move or trade funds, etc. If the team wants to create one universal place for crypto they will have to drastically upgrade the app, atm from design and ux/ui, content point of view it looks amateur and homemade. I am sure backend part is great but frontend has to be great as well in my opinion..

You can check out delta, blockfolio, cryptonews, o3 ios apps, maybe others to see what they did and have inside (at least from content, ux/ui point of view), it is always great to widen the vision by checking out what is already available on the market..

@fat3lvis though you may have more BTC available, the trading pair you are wanting to swap may not have the volume you are after (you can only buy as much as there is for sale).

Any chance the beta will include ARRR btw? I think I read that it at least worked on paper. I'd really like to see the proof of concept of swapping to a true privacy coin. If that's brought to life, the dex has got something nobody else has. (since for active trading, the dex's fees and weird order book will hamper adoption, I'm afraid).

@az You can try clearing app Data and Cache in Settings ->  Apps -> AtomicDEX.

Please do not clear data/cache if you have failed swaps with funds stuck


[27-Jul-19 11:34 AM] actionslacks#4072
@Solicitor Rick implementing z transactions will probably take some time. the fees are competetive with everything else out there afaik. my favorite feature, which you cannot get anywhere else, is the liquidity multiplier, or being able to place multiple orders and only needing enough crypto to fill one.


[27-Jul-19 11:35 AM] az#1921

[27-Jul-19 01:02 PM] Solicitor Rick#8992
@actionslacks good point. The reason I'd like for z transactions to be included isn't the fees though (I see how my previous post would have led you in that direction, my bad), it's the anonimity. Everywhere else, you'd need an account to make your funds go "poof" for anyone who's watching you; on any kmdex, you'll just swap via arrr and off to wherever it was you where going and you're off the grid. So that would be the adoption booster in the arrr case, not so much the fees. And of course, then there the multiple use of funds you mention. üòÉ

Speed is limited by confirmation times on the blockchain. These are decentralized atomic swaps, not changes in bookkeeping entries by a centralized exchange.

By the way, how does the speed compare to changelly or shapeshift. It's way faster, right?

@mazyar_lp | alphasharks for sure, it's much longer compare to a CEX but it's more cheaper and secure.. From my side, I consider that after step 1 "order matched", the trade is done. Step 2 is just the execution of the swap.

@Deleted User could you please user "Settings -> Send report" option and DM me the log?

@t0sma Actually all steps are important to perform succesful swap. On steps 2 and 3 transactions broadcasting so there is much more failure possibility than on step 1

@ca333  SO are we supposed to enter eth address in a case sensitive manner or will there be an update where the address can be non case sensitive?  Just want to know what is the best practise here?


[28-Jul-19 02:16 AM] ca333#0333
@kartha87 we actually updated it the other way around. So first we did allow just raw hex (which represents a ETH address) without further validation but noticed that this could cause issues (users sending to a wrong address) - that is why we implemented https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55 - to prevent this risk.

Hello there! Thank you for AtomicDEX and all the work you have done so far in Komodo!
I have done swapping some Ricks and Mortys and wanted to try the real deal - sent LTC from Coinbase to AtomicDEX, which went instantly. Here are some observations:
* after the screen locks while being in DEX tab, all the information (coin, amount) resets to blank - I believe it should keep that information after unlocking screen
* the same happens, if I put information in DEX and then switch to Orders or History sub-tab - after coming back to Trade sub-tab, all the fields are blank again
* I like that fiat equivalent is shown, but I would also like to swap coins based on exchange rate (at least informational calculated values shown), not based only on amount
* is it true - if someone has made a market order, I have only two options - either accept the exchange rate or deny it? Is there no option to make market order myself if someone has already done that? 
* What happens with partial orders - for example I want to swap 0.1 BTC to 800 KMD but in the market there is only 400 KMD available for swap?

What about partial order matching? Will it execute partially and the remaining half will stay in the market as my market order for the rest to fill and offer liquidity?


[28-Jul-19 04:11 AM] hyperDEX#6586
Will leave that to atomicDEX support, dont know enough about it to answer with any certainty.

I believe @hyperDEX  and the desktop app will also offer this functionality via GUI in due time.

hello, I have a suggestion for MobileDex, if it is possible.  And if it is possible to install a button to abort the swap as long as it is not completed, as in a normal exchange the trade cancel.


[28-Jul-19 05:24 AM] smkhound#7640
@mo7881 failed timeout transactions should return after a time, but there is a chance they get stuck. Make sure to NOT clear cache, so we have the data to perform a manual return if required. To do so, DM your logs to a team member (green name - Angelina, Gcharang, TonyL) for review.
@eduard cancelling a trade is possible, but no button exists yet. Depending on what stage of the trade it has progressed to, this may forfeit the dexfee, and require waiting for the trade to timeout. Personally, I'd avoid cancelling a swap once it has begun.


[28-Jul-19 05:33 AM] mo7881#6408
@smkhound I have a few that failed unreturned. Its all small amounts so im not bothered about getting it back but it could help your development.

There is example of seed in this field (it with spaces), also you can press on eye to type and see the  seed.

I understand there is an example shown. But checking visually if there is 1 space or two between two words is difficult in a mobile phone.

That is why I proposed a solution where spacebar is not needed.

Also, I haven't suggested manipulating the seed

There is exist seed validity checking already - if you not select "Allow custom seed" checkmark you'll not able to proceed with not valid bip39 seed

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #46: Better Seed input when restoring a seed phrase
Yes, the checking is there for the whole seed. User doesn't get an indication of which mistake they made
- Did they add extra spaces? How many?
- Did they make a spelling error in one word?
- more than one word?

How long does it usually take to add new assets to trade? For insatance Neo or Tezos etc. Is there a priority list for coins to be added as well?


[29-Jul-19 05:38 AM] gcharang#6833
@ohweoh AtomicDEX is a GUI
its backend: Marketmaker(mm2) needs to work with any new coin to be added
all the coins tested to work with mm2 have the key-value `mm2: 1` in the file https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins

 currently BTC forks and ERC20 can be easily added
Tezos and Neo could be added in the future but no ETA

@ecbuddy in iOS AtomicDEX backend shutdown when app is not active (even if phone screen turn off because of inactivity), Can you try keeping the screen active while doing the swap?


[29-Jul-19 12:29 PM] TonyL#3577
At the moment backend trying to kickstart some of yours unfinished swaps, that‚Äôs why part of the coins locked. Please try to disable screen auto turn off and don‚Äôt switch to another applications for some time

@ecbuddy as Angelina said, on iOS mm2 backend shutting down when operating system losing focus on app (screen turn-off or switch to another application). Right now on your side few swaps with "Timeout" status deadlocked backend because of the issue in swap kickstart logic. Developers already working on resolution and it will be resolved in next release.


[29-Jul-19 12:51 PM] TonyL#3577
Some swaps completed on your side after shutting down application because there is swap continuation feature, so seems it worked fine on your side in some cases 
But edge cases were found also - thats beta testing üòÉ


[29-Jul-19 12:54 PM] TonyL#3577
what you can do for now: 
a) if you don't have any swaps with your funds stucked in it - you can uninstall and install app. It'll delete information about your swaps but it'll not try to kickoff it anymore so funds will be unlocked
b) wait for the next release to update - problem you encountered will be resolved on the backend side

[29-Jul-19 01:55 PM] TonyL#3577
most probably swaps were so fast so some finished before you close the app or during app re-opening kickoff


[29-Jul-19 01:56 PM] TonyL#3577
actually you can check it in app logs, on each startup backend printing version like a:
```29 18:50:55, mm2:144] AtomicDEX MarketMaker 64bfd683c
29 18:50:55, lp_native_dex:1311] version: 64bfd683c```


[29-Jul-19 01:57 PM] TonyL#3577
and there is a this event time print, so if it work in background time will be time in the past


[29-Jul-19 01:59 PM] ecbuddy#8524

@TonyL after a few trades, I am running into issues where I can‚Äôt place trades anymore.
My balance goes to max, but doesn‚Äôt reflect my max balance, and it flickers fast and hard.
Seems like it‚Äôs glitching out or something.

We migrated the RICK & MORTY test-chains to new and more economic smart chains with a hybrid PoW and PoS structure. Faucets have been reset and you have to request new funds for testing. AtomicDEX mobile will automagically use the new chains and thus not contain your old RICK/MORTY balances. We will inform the community once all the infrastructure(block explorers/faucets) is updated to work with the new chains.

Here's the faucet links for RICK/MORTY -

https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/faucet/morty
if not working at first, give it a few minutes and try again, there may be a flood of thirsty traders early on.

I received this email about testing atomic DEX  but it said that app not available  and this is a notice I received on my email
AtomicDEX Mobile Beta
Congratulations! 

You have been invited to the AtomicDEX beta. To join the beta and download the app go to the following link:

https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex

If the link does not work it means you had subscribed with an email that was not attached to your google play account. In this case contact us through Discord.

About The Test

During the next 24 hours, we will be conducting extensive tests with our AtomicDEX wallet application.

Please note that our tests are primarily focused on testing atomic swaps and network connectivity issues. As a secondary focus, we are also collecting feedback about the overall wallet functionality and user experience.

Let‚Äôs get started!


[30-Jul-19 08:55 AM] tomsmith26#8707

@Werxadler most likely the swap that timed out for you is because of the chain migration we just did


[30-Jul-19 09:41 AM] FtrSaroth#2069
@gcharang Faucet dont want to give me Rick and Morty, when i put my address of AtomicDEX said "you have enough, go to home" but my balances show 0 ü§î


[30-Jul-19 09:43 AM] gcharang#6833
@FtrSaroth will investigate the problem
if you don't have any other coins in the wallet you are currently using, create a new seed phrase and use it to get coins from the faucet


[30-Jul-19 09:48 AM] FtrSaroth#2069
Thanks @gcharang, i have other coins in the wallet, its possible to have another wallet with different addresses on the app? To create one to receive Rick Morty and then send it to the first one


[30-Jul-19 09:51 AM] gcharang#6833
@FtrSaroth that can be done
logout -> create new wallet -> give it another name

but I just used the faucet to get coins to an address I already received coins with the old chain
may be open the website in a private window
don't use firefox

[30-Jul-19 11:57 PM] gcharang#6833 (pinned)
To update AtomicDEX on Android:
```
Playstore -> Hamburger menu (in left - top corner ) -> My apps and games -> Installed -> find AtomicDEX and click update
```
or, it will be updated normally along with the other apps when that happens

If the PlayStore doesn't have the updated version, clear the PlayStore cache

[31-Jul-19 04:40 AM] gcharang#6833
@diamondsareforever even if you restore a wallet, you must give it a name so that from the next time you can login with a password


[31-Jul-19 04:44 AM] diamondsareforever#4055
Ok, but if I'm restoring a wallet, shouldn't it inherit the previous name/pass once restored? Or will it always require a new name/pass after a restore?

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #63 \[feature request\] \[x\] button deletes a whole number instead of 1 digit
I had 8.39088... RICK and I tried to swap 7.39088... RICK, so exactly 1 RICK is left on my account. 

First I clicked on "MAX", then I tried to delete the first digit '8' and type '7' in its place. Turns out clicking on [X] button on Android deletes the whole number. Pretty annoying.

[31-Jul-19 07:23 AM] Audo#5667
not sure what happened. Now I no longer got those orders up. Two swaps show on the history column
 - 2 RICK for 0.0167 KMD
 - 7 RICK for 0.0583 KMD

I tried to swap 12 RICK in total. @ca333 I think my phone should automatically remake an order if a swap did't fill up it entirely.

Not sure what happened to my MORTY order, it just dissapeared.


[31-Jul-19 07:24 AM] ca333#0333
if the remaining trade volume would be below 0.00777 its considered dust and the order gets removed - could this be the case?


[31-Jul-19 07:25 AM] ca333#0333
what was your order? 12 RICK for how much KMD ?


[31-Jul-19 07:27 AM] Audo#5667
hmm. I had 12 RICK for graps in total. Two swaps started (2 and 7 RICK = 9 in total). 3 RICK was left, which was in KMD a total of 0.025 KMD with the exchange rate I used.

(0,008333333 RICK/KMD, 12 RICK for 0.1 KMD)


[31-Jul-19 07:29 AM] Audo#5667
I also had an order for Morty (15 MORTY for 0.1 KMD). That order dissapeared without any record of a swap.


[31-Jul-19 07:31 AM] Audo#5667
Now I am unable to create new orders, they don't appear at all.

It is a hashing process and it takes some time. You can chose the fast encryption method (insecure) if your phone model takes too long.

Can confirm there is a little problems with auto order matching in some cases (there is some rounding missmatch between frontend and backend and consistency should be achieved in next mm2 update). What you can do is manually create DOGE - KMD order with price better than price in orderbook and in that case it should match you with seller

what determines the ETH fee (0.0015) when withdrawing ETH? It seems waaay on the high side. An option to set a gas price would be nice?

Do you plan to allow the user to fill multiple swap using a single front-end order?
For example, in the order book there are the following swap request like this:
```
price  - max vol   -  receive
0.5 MORTY - 100 MORTY - 0.5 MORTY
0.5 MORTY - 200 MORTY - 0.5 MORTY
```


[31-Jul-19 04:52 PM] nymkappa#9440
That would be really nice for the UX if I could fill both orders at the same time using a single actions from atomixDEX.
That would pretty much correspond to a `Market buy` filling as much order as needed until my maximum prices is reached.

So, the "Market swap order" would be:
```150 RICK for 300 MORTY```
And it would fill both pending swap request at once.

Hey all!  I am new here and have done a ton of reading on Komodo AtomicDEX and have a few questions (I'll write a blog post about it later), first both parties need to create wallets on the Komodo AtomicDEX Wallet (??).  Any API/Smart contract non-GUI commands?

Then I can send BTC to a 'pre configured BTC address that is watched by AtomicDEX.

AtomicDEX will create an order, then swap my BTC for ETH directly in my wallet all via smart contract
Is there anywhere I can read about this, I have spent like 4 hours reading about this and love it! I just haven't found examples of what your talking about.  Only high-level chatter

@jward01 Im not part of the team but have been following for a while. Atomicdex is essentially a wallet with a DEX interface. You can either import an existing komodo address wallet or create a new address wallet in atomicdex. If you import an existing wallet, your coins (compatible coins ~ 99% of existing coins) should be accessible to send, receive, or trade. If you create a new wallet you will have to send your coins to the new wallet address(es) (BTC will have a unique non kmd type address and so will some other type of coins that are not komodo asset chains). Once they are in your new wallet you can send, receive and trade as you wish. When you trade, BTC to ETH for example, you use the DEX functionality and create your order that you want to trade. When you go to place it, you can select from existing liquidity or create a new order at your desired rate. Once it is matched, the rest is taken care of automatically. It leaves your wallet and the traded assets are sent directly to your wallet. Pure awesome'ness from jl777 and Komodo Team.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #66: \[Discussion\] \- Orders should be display as cumulated in the order book
Clue is that on CEX by one "buy" action you can fill orders of N sellers, but in DEX your trade performing with one seller only at a time. As I see some additional logic on GUI side is needed to implement trading mechanism similar to what you explaining. If there are two 900 and 900 volume orders, to buy lets say 1100 at once you'll need two swaps actually with first seller and second one what will require double taker fees, tx fees + part of the swap might fail and interface should handle it...

I definitely agree with `So a lot of additional logic is needed`. But I believe this is pure front-end logic.
Maybe the protocol itself could offer such functionality in the future as well.

*I actually believe the benefits would be great for low liquidity markets.*
For high liquidity market it would not really matter.

exactly - with the difference that we should not limit the required modifications on the GUI side since all trade-related operations are handled on the atomicDEX-API layer (backend). Although it could be implemented on the frontend, a backend implementation would make more sense and resolve this more efficiently since all GUIs and even CLI traders could profit from this. However, it does sound much like a future feature request for mm2 OR a trading-bot implementation for atomicDEX mobile wher...

A small bug (sorry if it was already noticed):
I had orders to sell rick and morty before the new rick and morty chains. When new chans replaced old ones, my portfolio balances of rick and morty went to 0 (ok) but my existing orders selling rick and morty are still there ... I have no clues what will happen if these orders are matched (old or new coins ?).

hello, I got the invitation link to try atomic swaps from my cell phone but I couldn't download the app because I don't have the same email linked to my google play account, how can you help me


[01-Aug-19 08:25 PM] TonyL#3577
@ecbuddy depends on Apple at the moment, quite soon I think :)

@Portman at the moment there is controlled beta stage with limited amount of participants, AtomicDEX will be availiable for everyone right after release

@devopsecret @Bernardo94 Please DM your email connected to google play (or apple app store maybe in medianjohnson case) to @Angelina

basically, I deposited about 0.0011btc  btc hitting 'max' restricted me to 0.00039, and then there were two orders for btc -> kmd, but as I could only set max of 0.00039 it only let me swap 3.9 kmd, but order looked to have huge liquidity, so i thought I should be able to swop all of my 0.001, not only 0.00039. and then 2 minutes later I got "invalid arguments" when i clicked to select which kmd order i'd like to fill

@goldenman because you need to pay gas to execute the swap contract

@ninjanoel minimum swap amount is 0.00777... this limitation will be removed in future versions

oh... so it was misbehaving cause i didn't hit the minimum?

yes, looks like the GUI doesn't deal very well with this limitation... the problem will disappear when the limitation is removed from the underlying mm2

@saskboy there are RICK/MORTY faucets in pinned messages.
 1% per hour it's quite good actually, AtomicDEX backend working in background on Android so on you can perform swap even with minimized app. I'm afraid that such "FIX NOW" button will close it.


[02-Aug-19 04:58 PM] saskboy#5198
Because it's Decentralized, I suppose if the app is closed, there's no other server running to maintain communication.

[02-Aug-19 11:46 PM] ca333#0333
@Mark81 - no, thats normal. The addresses starting with `b` are the "DEX addresses" (script_address which many refer to as "multisig address")


[02-Aug-19 11:49 PM] Mark81#4505
Well I was thinking that when I chooses my own rates I would be trading with myself. On blockexplorer from multisigaddress my kmd ended into different address.

are your orders showing now?


[03-Aug-19 02:59 AM] Werxadler#6422
@gcharang i mean i set 11 orders with my max amount of morty and rick vs different coins, on other exchanges you can only set 1 order, i am pretty sure i red somewhere at atomicdex you can set 5 different orders... Still all my orders dissapeared


[03-Aug-19 03:02 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, this is a feature called "liquidity multiplier"
same coins can be offered for different trades and all the offers are valid till atleast one offer is accepted by someone else
then the rest of the offers for the same coins should disappear

do you think something like the above caould have happened to your orders?
i.e., 2 trades matched. one for rick and other for morty; which made all the other offers invalid

[03-Aug-19 05:15 AM] Solicitor Rick#8992
Not sure whether anyone commented on this yet, but I have mixed feelings about the UI regarding the order book. Let's say I select that I want to sell my 10 KMD. I used to see how much of each coin I could get for my amount, and now it shows how many bids are out there for each coin instead. I have to click on the order book to see what the best bid actually is. That's okay if I know which coin I want to buy (the "serious" use case), but annoying if I just want to play around and maybe see if there's any "dumb" orders out there (the "casual" use case). Any chance we can have both types of information in the interface? E.g. BTC - 3 - best: 0.001 BTC (where 3 is the number of orders out there; maybe put that in a header or something).


[03-Aug-19 05:24 AM] Werxadler#6422
@gcharang meanwhile another swap completed, and one reported timeout, i guess the one with reported timeout cleared all other orders for morty, and the other swap for rick took just too long, even though there was no ongooing swap reported

- I've created an order RFOX_KMD
- It got partialy filled, but the created order didnt updated I still see it untouched in order list
- Then I made a taker order with rest of my RFOX balance, the order never appeared in order list but completed and appeared 5min later in trade history.
- At the end now I have no more RFOX and the initial created order is still showing in orderlist untouched

I have a little feedback
For created order(maker) I would be good to have some sort of indicator that the order is still broadcasted/active.

At the moment only having it listed in order list leave place to uncertainty and confusion. 
Maybe a little circle loading style
A status code
3little dots loading style 
Something like that.

@ca333 I have same screen as on screenshot on my side, I wonder this issue clue is not precise message: after `"Click to create an order"` option usage it's better to print something like a "Input amount of BTC you want to get" below the "Receive" section so for user will be clear that "Trade" button will became active after BTC amount input

[04-Aug-19 04:13 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Only 0.013, no 0.017.


[04-Aug-19 04:17 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@TonyL   When an order is selected (the current order can be locked, the maximum is selected, the current order should be filled), sometimes the maximum is selected, and it will automatically change to other orders.


[04-Aug-19 04:23 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
I choose the top order 51.12RFOX, and then click the maximum, it will automatically jump to the bottom of the order 0.013.
The current order cannot be locked and the current order is not automatically calculated.


[04-Aug-19 04:25 AM] TonyL#3577
top order with price 51.12 RFOX have maximum volume 4.4 RFOX (~0.086 KMD). There is an issue that base coin amount (KMD in your case) not updating atomatically on trade view


[04-Aug-19 04:26 AM] TonyL#3577
I wonder what happened is that only one order which fit 1 KMD volume was this bad price one, but it's bad that swap started without confirmation about price change


[04-Aug-19 04:27 AM] TonyL#3577
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± has you input 1 KMD or used max button?


[04-Aug-19 04:29 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
I entered 1KMD.
But please don't deny that the order will automatically change the problem.


[04-Aug-19 04:32 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Unable to lock, orders that have been selected will change, you can click the maximum, try.


[04-Aug-19 04:34 AM] TonyL#3577
just tried same case on my side - yes, it's not adjusting KMD max volume for best order (4 RFOX at 51 RFOX/KMD price) which can not fit all base coin volume (1 KMD in our case). But on cofirmation screen it printed `1 KMD to 4 RFOX` (best order which can fit 1 KMD volume)


[04-Aug-19 04:34 AM] TonyL#3577
And after I pressed `Confirm` button swap 1 KMD to 4 RFOX started


[04-Aug-19 04:34 AM] TonyL#3577
So I can't reproduce swap with price different to price on swap confirmation screen


[04-Aug-19 04:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Max volume adjusting will be implemented (developers aware of it)


[04-Aug-19 04:35 AM] TonyL#3577
Sold 2 KMD for 8 RFOX - somebody should be happy üòÉ


[04-Aug-19 04:40 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
I lost 1 KMD. it's OK. But in the future, more newcomers will use it, if you can't lock the order you have already selected. There will be more users complaining in the future. Any change at a time is a loss.


[04-Aug-19 04:41 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
I am very afraid that there will be an attack API method, and the exchange price will be changed one second before the confirmation.


[04-Aug-19 04:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Can you remember what price you saw on confrimation screen?


[04-Aug-19 04:47 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@TonyL   Two exchanges before and after, only one minute apart, I can't remember.


[04-Aug-19 04:49 AM] TonyL#3577
Please doublecheck price on confrimation screen before swap start, if price in swap is different from value on this screen it's very bad bug, but I'm not able to reproduce

@Cryptosaurus | $ARRR can confirm there is a some not correct behaviour on maker orders creation, thank you for report

@general_grievous such refund time determined by protocol, in these 4.5 hours there is a still a chance to complete swap with this maker. It's very helpful if one of the deal participants have a bad connection lets say

How we can change languages? AtomicDex is in French. I prefer in English.


[04-Aug-19 01:12 PM] aume27Rrpmp.nft#2727
I had an idea for ethereum based trade and the tx fees.

It would be interesting if a % of eth based trade fees could be directed to a capped pool(c-pool). By c-pool i mean that after for example 10 or 100eth accumulated the fees would stop going in the c-pool.
 The c-pool would pay for taker side of trades or maybe both sides (i personally think mainly taker shouldnt have to pay to buy eth or erc20 because if you are trying to get your first eth or simply go from asset to stablecoin its doesnt make sence to send asset to CEX > get eth > withdraw to atomicDex > get what you need)

Thats pretty much it. Thank you


[04-Aug-19 01:14 PM] allbits#5898
Why should we want to bother fixing a shortcoming that is inherent in eth? Let it suffer from its poor design and be exposed for what it is

It would be wise to address the eth shortcoming because solutions and simplicity attract users. Complexity for the sake of some ‚Äúnot my mess‚Äù attitude is self defeating at best


[04-Aug-19 01:42 PM] allbits#5898
That's not simplicity. You're further taxing eth transactions, and sending the devs.down a side road. Adding complexity.

Attracting users is not going to be a problem


[04-Aug-19 02:27 PM] Chipmoon#7477
just adding a note informing user about ETH needs gas before trading for first time traders should be sufficient

@D3b0 The success of the swap is unrecoverable. If it fails, KMD is still in your wallet.


[04-Aug-19 03:04 PM] D3b0#9761
I have 2 timeout and i cant see my kmd for this 2 swap


[04-Aug-19 03:46 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #70 Clicking the \`max\` button in the trade screen when the balance has many decimal places sends the most significant digits off screen
Example:

![IMG_1568](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21151592/62466263-8f6d2c80-b7ae-11e9-85f5-efa6474be473.jpeg)

The positioning of the cursor and the part of the number visible on screen currently make it easy to edit the number but there is no way to see the whole number.

Request: Display the whole number being edited in the field in a smaller font just below it. Update the additional display dynamically as the contents of the field are changed

I had two swaps time out and now it says that the btc is locked in swaps and not available for trading. The swaps were days ago


[05-Aug-19 10:32 AM] CS_#7849
@TonyL can i also tell you that i tried to test 'withdrawal' to Coinexchange and the address was not valid so i send some ETH back to my Wallet and from there i sended it to my Coinexchange ETH address. 

A bug you think?

@fat3lvis what version of app on what platrorm are you using? please try to "Log out" from settings and login again


[05-Aug-19 11:41 AM] TonyL#3577
@CS_ ETH checksum verification used by AtomicDEX, so it is case sensitive (https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55)
e.g. for https://etherscan.io/address/0x2a5994b501e6a560e727b6c2de5d856396aadd38 it'll be `0x2a5994b501E6A560e727b6C2DE5D856396aaDd38`

iPhone SE. Software 12.3.1  ‚Äì Wouldn't let me set it up beyond the stage of pasting my Seed Phrase.


[05-Aug-19 01:32 PM] justpip#5610
Some additional feedback:

1. Found the red text on dark grey background (seed phrase) hard to read. This has to be super clear. Not all of us have the eyesight of a 20-year-old üòâ 

2. Was surprised it was such a short seed (expecting 24 words  not 12) so hit the refresh button assuming the second half of the seed phrase was hiding. Realised it wasn't. 

Anyways, that's as far as I got before it froze at that stage.

@Angelina  I checked the atomic interchange record and saw that the wallet was split into 2 times, 1 time is a normal swap +1 charge, which is too outrageous. If you use BTC swap, you need to pay 2 miners. Fees, increase costs.


[06-Aug-19 02:43 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Swaps and fees should be placed in the same transfer.


[06-Aug-19 02:50 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
The 1 BTC miner fee is 0.0005*2, which is no advantage.


[06-Aug-19 03:29 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
The DOGE miner fee is 2, and the miner fee is 5 in exchange. Who controls this? I think we should let everyone know the standard of miners' fees in various currencies.


[06-Aug-19 04:36 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
An atomic exchange, today found that it is necessary to pay 2 coins + 2 miners.


[06-Aug-19 04:44 PM] TonyL#3577
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± There is 0.13% taker fee which paying as separate transaction


[06-Aug-19 04:46 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@TonyL  Then people who exchange with BTC will lose more.


[06-Aug-19 04:46 PM] TonyL#3577
And DOGE has 5 coins as txfee as I remember. Taker sending 2 transactions 1 with fees and second with maker payment so -10 DOGE in fees in total


[06-Aug-19 04:47 PM] TonyL#3577
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± Yes, at the moment it have sense to make trades for big BTC amounts only


[06-Aug-19 04:47 PM] TonyL#3577
because of huge txfees


[06-Aug-19 04:47 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Then DOGE's miner fee is 2, why is it 5?


[06-Aug-19 04:49 PM] TonyL#3577
As I remember this txfee amount was set because of problems with transactions propagation into DOGE mempool (miners not accepted txs with less fees)
@cipi can correct me if I'm wrong


[06-Aug-19 04:50 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
I think these basic details, miners should be announced on the official website.


[06-Aug-19 04:53 PM] TonyL#3577
On which website DOGE coin miners have announcements?
5 DOGE vs 3 DOGE It's a 0.015$ vs  0.001$ txfee (0.005$ difference)


[06-Aug-19 04:54 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
If the unit price of the coin rises, such a setting is difficult to popularize.


[06-Aug-19 04:54 PM] TonyL#3577
But this way txtransactions faster and reach mempool more guaranteed so it was increased in interests of AtomicDEX users


[06-Aug-19 04:55 PM] TonyL#3577
`If the unit price of the coin rises, such a setting is difficult to popularize.` txfee can be adjusted any moment


[06-Aug-19 04:56 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
All miners in AtomicDEX should have a publicity fee. Not a DOGE.


[06-Aug-19 04:56 PM] TonyL#3577
if DOGE blockchain will  constantly and reliable accept transactions with 3 DOGE txfee without issues 5 can be changed to 3 for sure


[06-Aug-19 04:57 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, I agree that it's good idea to display txfees before swap start


[06-Aug-19 05:00 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
0.13% is a reward paid to market makers?
Did the market maker have already earned the difference?
Everyone can place a single order, and the difference is the income.


[06-Aug-19 05:06 PM] TonyL#3577
0.13% taker trading fees (1/777) collecting on special address and distributing between DEX coins holders. Also there is a 10% discount for swaps with KMD. For maker fee is 0%


[06-Aug-19 05:16 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Why is DEX coins charging? Is this a development reward? Still DEX maintenance costs?


[06-Aug-19 05:19 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
DEX is the platform share of the atomic exchange dividends?


[06-Aug-19 05:21 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Maybe I should hold BNB instead of KMD+DEX?


[06-Aug-19 05:35 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Making a DEX is deliberately hindering the development of KMD? No wonder the price has dropped even lower.


[06-Aug-19 05:40 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Do not understand whether the atomic exchange technology belongs to KMD or to DEX? If it belongs to KMD, the proceeds should be given to KMD holders. Of course, if it belongs to DEX and KMD does not matter. I have nothing to say.


[06-Aug-19 05:43 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
AtomicDEX is not for KMD, it is actually for DEX. Is it only for 5% rewards for holding KMD?

More to say no benefit, let the market to verify it.


[06-Aug-19 06:02 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Why do you want to create DEX??? with KMD?


[06-Aug-19 06:03 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
What is the purpose of DEX?


[06-Aug-19 06:04 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Develop a technology and create a coin?


[06-Aug-19 06:04 PM] allbits#5898
This DEX is s massive leap forward for crypto currency. Hard to think that you're encouraging people to stop developing it?? Bizarre!


[06-Aug-19 06:05 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Why can't I apply KMD directly. Need to create another new DEX coin?


[06-Aug-19 06:06 PM] allbits#5898
You are severely under informed


[06-Aug-19 06:06 PM] allbits#5898
DEX predates KMD. It is not a new coin


[06-Aug-19 06:07 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Then you are happy.


[06-Aug-19 06:08 PM] allbits#5898
Seems that the set up that has been in place for years isn't satisfactory in helping you meet your little personal financial needs. And for that reason you make bizarre complaints and accusations. Got it.


[06-Aug-19 06:09 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Forget it, don't want to say anything for something. Let's toss with you. I still hold BTC is the best.


[06-Aug-19 06:10 PM] allbits#5898
Meanwhile a great technological leap is taking place right under your nose. Sit back and enjoy it. Help them test and improve. This is such important infrastructure for the entire crypto world.


[06-Aug-19 06:10 PM] allbits#5898
I agree with you the BTC is great. So is Atomicdex.


[06-Aug-19 06:14 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
I am using Google Translate, there may be errors, I mean DEX is unreasonable, I will reduce the number of uses, I will hold BTC, not KMD.


[06-Aug-19 06:17 PM] allbits#5898
You're right. There are errors in your understanding and your communication.  You can't possibly mean what you say.


[06-Aug-19 06:19 PM] allbits#5898
Coming in here and telling people their project is unreasonable! While it's obviously the product of years of hard work by many many people, and is one of the most important achievements in crypto currency since the beginning of bitcoin.

@allbits  If you feel good, you will use it more. If you feel bad, you can use it less. It is a matter of choice.


[06-Aug-19 06:38 PM] allbits#5898
People will use it because it's useful. Very useful.  If you don't see that, no-one can help you.  

I remember using bitcoin for the first time in 2012.  It was useful. Very useful.


[06-Aug-19 06:39 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224

You can go on letting your precious feelings get in the way of seeing the obvious fact that Atomicdex is a huge breakthrough.


[06-Aug-19 06:47 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
@Ëä±ÊûúÂ±± If i remember correctly what i read, when all the fees accumulated reach 1 million on value, all these fees gonna be converted to kmd and shared betwen who hold the assets dex, supernet, jumblr, etc, so yes, the directly befited gonna be who hold that assets, but indirectly all kmd holder because those fees gonna be used to buy kmd


[06-Aug-19 06:47 PM] FtrSaroth#2069
or im wrong?


[06-Aug-19 06:48 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
People's dissatisfaction with BTC and ETH is that the miners are too expensive and the transfer is slow. If ETH and sharding technology solve the congestion and miners' costs, what are your advantages?


[06-Aug-19 06:49 PM] allbits#5898

Hi guys, quick questions on the way out the door...
atomicdex has the disclaimer bout using real funds.  Is that only for the DEX function or does it include using the wallet for real funds as well?
I've seached for info on using BCH.  Seems it needs the old format wallet.  Is this still the case, or has that been changed?  Where can I find further info on using BCH on atomicDEX?


[06-Aug-19 09:44 PM] CrisF#3405
Thanks a lot.


[07-Aug-19 12:22 AM] gcharang#6833
@CrisF the disclaimer is for all aspects of the atomicDEX as it is still in beta
but it is mainly for the DEX part
BCH still uses the old address in atomicDEX: starts with "1"
have you been invited?

Try to uninstall/reinstall application, it's possible that updating process is not crystal clear still

there are already some ERC20 tokens added
more coins will be added at a later date


[07-Aug-19 06:30 AM] TonyL#3577
@Oszy agreed, in 1.6.0 we'll ensure that updating process is smooth
Regards swaps issue - it seems that these orders were placed by non-updated maker, there is feature request on this matter https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/513 so as soon as it implemented updated takers will trade with updated makers only

Fyi, all, I just took a simple arbitrage on KMD/VRSC, all on Atomicdex mobile.  Because takers don't match with takers, it is possible for coins to be purchased for less than they can be sold in the very same instant. Happy hunting!

Stupid question but my app should be open during the swap (3 steps), or can I let it run in background?


[07-Aug-19 07:12 AM] Angelina#6231
@Lance if you are on iOS, then yes, it should be open throughout the swap


[07-Aug-19 07:13 AM] Lance#9742
I'm on android, but the 3 swaps I did by running it in background are in timeout

@Lance do they timeout if you keep app open?

Is the btc fee really .0015 for a trade? Ouch


[07-Aug-19 07:53 PM] jspook16#3059
I guess I mean the btc mining fee


[07-Aug-19 08:01 PM] allbits#5898
My guess is that dex markets will tend to bch or ltc pairs ... or kmd pairs ;).  Might be bullish for bch which has a lot of fiat onramps and offramps. I'm assuming that dex will take over because the convenience and safety level is much better.  Also might be room for a decentralized, or highly distributed, btc proxy token

[09-Aug-19 12:38 AM] CrisF#3405
I can send a PIRATE, VRSC or THC tip to cover it.


[09-Aug-19 12:38 AM] CrisF#3405
Maybe KMD, but my balance is very low.


[09-Aug-19 12:41 AM] Oszy#5734
What's your address? I have some dust lets see if it's enough

[09-Aug-19 01:53 AM] Oszy#5734
does it fail after matching? at 0/3? or at 1/3 when it's matched?


[09-Aug-19 01:53 AM] Oszy#5734
I had this with VRSC before, try half the amount

1/3 on old version, 2/3 on new.


[09-Aug-19 01:54 AM] Oszy#5734
so fails at ongoing swap? has fee been taken?

If you're using MM2 CLI you may get full swap status with all transactions details by calling `my_swap_status`: https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#my-swap-status

[09-Aug-19 09:17 AM] ferjr90#9314
Is it because I have no Ether? I need to deposit ETH to recieve ETH?


[09-Aug-19 09:18 AM] smkhound#7640
yeah, any trade involving eth or erc20 as seller or buyer requires gas.


[09-Aug-19 09:20 AM] smkhound#7640
transaction has to go via a "smart" contract, so gas.

yes, this channel belongs to the GUI (mobile DEX): https://atomicdex.io
and it is in beta testing

the backend can be used seperately and all the coins I mentioned above are tradeable if two sides of a trade are available

yes @dudezmobi - for now uninstall/reinstall resolve it. The update process is not fully clean yet. Some "old" app-data persists which is likely leading to this situation. We will improve this for next release.

@gcharang from your screenshots it looks like that only transactions to "self" address not displaying. Could you please confirm that? 
Also can you please send DASH transaction to self from AtomicDEX and from Agama and compare results in AtomicDEX tx history?

Just tried to send few DASH txs to self address in AtomicDEX and it displaying fine. (tx to self displaying as fee consumption) Maybe txs from Agama has some specific.

@Oszy thanks, i supposed it that way, just wanted confirmation... Not so sure if other nontechies are aware of that though


[12-Aug-19 02:41 AM] Werxadler#6422
Might be also the reason for several failed swaps i guess ü§î


[12-Aug-19 02:51 AM] Oszy#5734
failed swap is other reasons


[12-Aug-19 02:51 AM] Oszy#5734
it would be timeout if you close the app once a swap has already started


[12-Aug-19 02:52 AM] Oszy#5734
but there is a "big" timespan in which if you log back in it kickstarts the trade again and continue

[12-Aug-19 05:20 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@jansako Hi! `Didn't receive any data since...` messages are related to Electrum server connections. It means that no data was received from particular Electrum server for 60 seconds so connection is forcefully aborted and reconnected then. It might mean that you have some connectivity issues on your server or maybe there's a problem with Electrum server itself. These messages can appear when no swaps are running as connections are kept active at background continously if coin is activated.


[12-Aug-19 05:22 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
If you see these messages often and have failed swaps please make sure that network connectivity on your node is in good state. If it's good but you still see this please submit an issue with logs to AtomicDEX-API repo: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues

Not sure if it was mentioned but if a swap fails it would be good to show the unrecoverable fees charged and possibly the amount of recoverable funds 'locked' in the swap


[12-Aug-19 12:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
New version looks much better but could fit more on the portfolio page before needing to scroll


[12-Aug-19 12:20 PM] Deleted User#0000
would also be great to have a 'Markets' tab where you can see all markets for currently activated coins with current prices and maybe jump to trade by selecting one


[12-Aug-19 01:47 PM] TonyL#3577
Thank you for a feedback! UI/UX enchancement and new features definetly coming in next versions.
If you have time you can elaborate your suggestions and ideas and open issue here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicdex/issues 
Lets say mockup of how this 'Markets' tab should looks like can help a lot to deeply understand your idea (paint is fine üòÉ )

If you have an erc20 selected when making creating order and you dont have eth activated it doesnt let click the trade button,(not greyed out its still green) which is fine but no indication why. Now not every might know you need the eth for the order a message would be nice about it when you try to do the swap.mentioned above.

can i use the address in atomicdex for mining kmd?


[13-Aug-19 01:45 AM] antropov083#9529
after the release, the balance will not disappear?


[13-Aug-19 02:10 AM] TonyL#3577
I recommend to consolidate balance (send whole balance to self) time to time if you mine on AtomicDEX address


[13-Aug-19 02:11 AM] TonyL#3577
Otherwise you might have problems in swaps because of too complex transaction construction (too many UTXOs)


[13-Aug-19 02:15 AM] jl777c#5810
best to not atomicDEX the address you mine to. at some point it will exceed electrum size limits for utxos


[13-Aug-19 02:15 AM] jl777c#5810
make a different address for atomicDEX


[13-Aug-19 02:16 AM] jl777c#5810
do not mine to atomicDEX address. this should be a warning, there is no way an electrum based swap will work reliably to a mined address

We're aware of some users encountering this issue (myself included), and have identified a root cause, though additional logs are welcomed in case there is more than one. Strangely, the phone I was having issues with has also had periods of not suffering the problem. I'm curious and investigating why.


[14-Aug-19 07:23 AM] Oszy#5734
accoding to atomicdex I paid 0.1235816 KMD fee on a 19.8764184 KMD tx sending out KMD from atomicdex to another wallet (not swap) 
I actually sent out 20 and received 20 so the indication is wrong


[14-Aug-19 07:31 AM] smkhound#7640
fee seems high for a send. can you plsDM the txid?


[14-Aug-19 07:33 AM] Oszy#5734

More bug than feature I think because confusing

block explorer is same. tx without rewards, fee is 0.0001. When there are rewards, fee is a negative number


[14-Aug-19 07:47 AM] smkhound#7640
I've been confused by it before, now I just look for the negative fee. I wish banks had negative fees.


[14-Aug-19 07:47 AM] TonyL#3577

[14-Aug-19 07:48 AM] smkhound#7640
yeah, that screen does look very strange üòÑ


[14-Aug-19 07:48 AM] TonyL#3577
but on screenshot above it displaying like I sent 0.58 KMD (1 KMD - 0.41 rewards) what is quite confusing


[14-Aug-19 07:48 AM] smkhound#7640
so that is when reward is > funds being sent?


[14-Aug-19 07:48 AM] TonyL#3577
no, I sent 1 KMD and rewards 0.41 KMD


[14-Aug-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
fee is (sum of inputs) - (sum of outputs)


[14-Aug-19 07:49 AM] smkhound#7640
yeah, explorer makes more sense than screen


[14-Aug-19 07:49 AM] jl777c#5810
rewards are part of the sum of inputs


[14-Aug-19 07:51 AM] TonyL#3577
yeah, in case of rewards just need to display amount of sending to destination vout as this number on top in AtomicDEX


[14-Aug-19 07:51 AM] TonyL#3577
so it'll be clear like in explorer


[14-Aug-19 07:54 AM] TonyL#3577
This thin edge between feature and bug üòÉ


[14-Aug-19 08:25 AM] jansako#3330
Could be addressed by the 'Fee' field being labelled as 'Fee - Rewards' or "Fee - negative if rewards claimed"


[14-Aug-19 08:26 AM] jansako#3330
The field would have to be KMD-specific, of course, unless other coins get rewards like that.


[14-Aug-19 08:27 AM] jansako#3330
may be simpler than messing with the math and still ending off because of the reward making the balance a different size than expected.

@fat3lvis are you on version 0.1.6 ? Can't reproduce control center crash on this one.

`Swaps are not shown in order book, but if the app is open they are working.` could you please elaborate - is orderbook not loading or you can't see ongoing swaps ?
`Rick & Morty chains getting updated, but no history` RICK and MORTY chains were restarted from scratch on some point, you can use faucet from pinned messages to get some

@NMD3 Thats strange, RICK and MORTY chains were changed right between 29-30 July so now you can see some old chain transactions, from cache probably. 
Can you try to `Settings -> Logout` and login then? If it'll not help try to uninstall and install app back (ensure that you controll your seed)


[15-Aug-19 09:01 AM] NMD3#0024
Ok, Logout was already tried 
I will uninstall now...


[15-Aug-19 09:24 AM] NMD3#0024
@TonyL  Thanks a lot, uninstall and install again did the trick
Would be nice if there is a warning when uninstalling (seed and history)
Already did a swap and everything is fine

[15-Aug-19 12:49 PM] Oszy#5734
if `cargo build --features native -vv` does't run just do `cargo build` 
make sure you have `nightly-2019-08-05` set as default rust,  and don't forget to run `rustup component add rustfmt-preview`
it should build like this

There is definitely something wrong with the latest version. I've reinstalled it. Restored one wallet. Seems to work fine.
Then I logged out and restored another wallet, then the app is rendering one frame every ten seconds for a while. Seems like it's good right now but there is something wrong at initialisation.

After closing the app and re-opening again. Same issue. The app freeze really badly at the connecting step it seems.

if you just want to try out atomic swaps, chainswap from #chainmakers  and #dex-hyperdex has a nice gui and they are working now.
both in beta, only experiment with small amounts.

Hi! Thats how swaps protocol works at the moment - if swap failing on stage when you already sent the taker fee it's not sending back


[20-Aug-19 10:28 AM] phideas#8309
After a little bit of struggle to create a wallet (slow encryption, freezing ui) I am happy to swap back and forth on mobile. Dozen of swaps, no failure so far. Native Android UX very slick. It's gonna need o lot of tweak and polish to make it production ready, but overall I am impressed.

just got this fired up on my iphone ETH deposit was fast testing first trade now for ETH to KMD and this app looks slick nice work


[22-Aug-19 12:11 AM] zephuros#2936
looks like it let me open 2 orders with the same ETH not sure how that will work


[22-Aug-19 12:12 AM] gcharang#6833
@zephuros for two different pairs?
if so the first order that matches will cancel the other order


[22-Aug-19 12:13 AM] zephuros#2936
the first time it did cancel my eth to kmd and then let me do eth to rvn, now i got both going we will see which one goes thru first


[22-Aug-19 12:14 AM] zephuros#2936
how long does a swap take on avgerage?


[22-Aug-19 12:15 AM] gcharang#6833
depends on the block times of the involved coins
faster blocktimes --> faster swaps


[22-Aug-19 12:15 AM] zephuros#2936
got ya


[22-Aug-19 12:16 AM] zephuros#2936
rvn takes forever so kmd trade should go thru first


[22-Aug-19 12:17 AM] zephuros#2936
anything you need me to try on my iphone?


[22-Aug-19 12:18 AM] gcharang#6833
@zephuros did both orders match and swaps started? eth/kmd and eth/rvn ?


[22-Aug-19 12:18 AM] zephuros#2936
both are on 2/3 right now


[22-Aug-19 12:18 AM] gcharang#6833
and both are using the maximum available eth?


[22-Aug-19 12:19 AM] zephuros#2936
looks like the eth is locked now to


[22-Aug-19 12:19 AM] zephuros#2936
yes


[22-Aug-19 12:19 AM] zephuros#2936
ok rvn went thru and now the eth to kmd is still open


[22-Aug-19 12:19 AM] zephuros#2936
i am guessing this one will fail


[22-Aug-19 12:22 AM] gcharang#6833
@zephuros what happened with the eth/kmd swap?


[22-Aug-19 12:22 AM] zephuros#2936
2/3 right now still


[22-Aug-19 12:23 AM] zephuros#2936
still surprised it let me get that far tho


[22-Aug-19 12:23 AM] gcharang#6833
it shouldn't actually
can you verify the amount of eth being swapped in both the trades?


[22-Aug-19 12:23 AM] zephuros#2936
sure


[22-Aug-19 12:24 AM] zephuros#2936
.0879 eth for 482.4852 rvn which went thru and  pending one is .0879 eth for 20.5045 kmd


[22-Aug-19 12:25 AM] zephuros#2936
only put little eth in to test


[22-Aug-19 12:26 AM] gcharang#6833
once the eth/kmd swap fails or times out or god forbid goes throuh, can you send the log thrugh DM?


[22-Aug-19 12:26 AM] zephuros#2936
sure


[22-Aug-19 12:26 AM] zephuros#2936
i hope it fails but ether way got to fix that

@gcharang there should be a bug about not finding conflicting transactions sooner. it seems if there is a swap that cannot possibly work (due to the same funds being spent), then we can detect it sooner. then again, it could be tricky as it is balance based


[22-Aug-19 01:20 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, that was my thought as ETH doesn't have utxos

@Small Fish the locked amount should be back to you in some time
there are no plans to integrate IOTA currently as it is an entirely different system and it is not a blockchain
it might be possible in the future but further research is needed

Ok will do


[22-Aug-19 03:07 AM] Small Fish#5687
The coin are not really important it‚Äôs just to avoid further complication with bigger amount


[22-Aug-19 03:08 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, there were problems with unlocking stuck swaps in the previous versions
now it should be better
once you send us the details, we can advise you on how to unlock the coins


[22-Aug-19 03:35 AM] Small Fish#5687
I have some trouble to do with my phone


[22-Aug-19 03:35 AM] Small Fish#5687
Will do later when I got my computer


[22-Aug-19 03:37 AM] gcharang#6833
sure!


[22-Aug-19 03:45 AM] TonyL#3577
`Settings -> Logout` and Login then might help in this case @Small Fish


[22-Aug-19 03:45 AM] TonyL#3577
if it not - please uninstall/install application (please ensure that you control the seed first)


[22-Aug-19 07:51 AM] dudezmobi#1945
yup yup. success

Some swaps failed today on Qtum pairs. No loss or locked funds. Swap was successfull in the end with slightly less amount.

[23-Aug-19 02:12 AM] gcharang#6833
may be the app isn't able to connect to spv servers when used through an emulator
you could use a screen recording app on a android device?

How is the pricing worked out between coins? E.g. I am exchanging BCH for KMD


[23-Aug-19 03:53 AM] gcharang#6833
normally it depends on whatever the maker wants to offer

right now, most of the maker orders are from the team with the approximate market price


[23-Aug-19 03:55 AM] Crypto Rich#6241
ok ty

adex is a little more expensive than changenow


[23-Aug-19 04:07 AM] Crypto Rich#6241
how come? and will this change in the future with greater liquidity


[23-Aug-19 04:13 AM] gcharang#6833
@Crypto Rich any one create a new order with whatever price they'd like
right now the only orders available are by the team
that is the reason the price might be a little different from the market price

Error [DF-AA-33] when downloading my Application
I just uploaded my App to the Google Play Store and when I try to download it I get the following error: Error retrieving information from the server [DF-AA-33]

```2

These are steps:

    Go to Settings -> Apps -> Play Store and then tap Clear Data and Cache
    Go to Settings -> Accounts -> Google and then Remove Account
    Restart your phone
    Log in with your Google Account and open Play Store.

Done
``` maybe such way can help


[23-Aug-19 06:33 AM] TonyL#3577
this error looks like some Play Store issue because since you have `Install` button availiable you have an access to the app


[23-Aug-19 06:38 AM] Oszy#5734
Not sure about Bluestacks but it didn't work for me in Memu, none of them are even close to "stock" android experience. Also please don't use real wallet seed in these bloatware emulators.


[23-Aug-19 06:48 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
now i don't find atomic dex on google magazine!

@LuckyShadow 
have you tried
```
Go to Settings -> Apps -> Play Store and then tap Clear Data and Cache
    Go to Settings -> Accounts -> Google and then Remove Account
    Restart your phone
    Log in with your Google Account and open Play Store.
```

I don't see it neither on the playstore, it's been like that for 2 or 3 days already (at least on my phone)

I do not , it said on waiting list or something previous now nothing ??


[28-Aug-19 04:44 PM] yorklab#7270
I see it on both the computer and my phone. Perhaps you need an invite? You'll have to wait for a team member to find out why you can't see it.


[29-Aug-19 12:37 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
There should be a setting to trade through KMD to any coin from any coin.
. Make KMD default LP - most grandmas wont use the order books. - call it "Grandma Mode" or say trade available with a X% DEX fee.... then do the 3 way swap ...


[29-Aug-19 12:43 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Alice swaps DGB for KMD then KMD to Etherium Bob swaps Etherium for KMD then KMD to DGB...
Something like that......private swaps will not be popular with shit coins


[29-Aug-19 12:45 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Or instead of swapping the first step it could just be a purchace transaction from the LP

Yeah well I already signed up twice, one on the first day (with a different adress than my Google Play adress - at that time my talks with ca333 and Angelina didn't really helped)  and one 3/4 weeks ago with my google play adress but this time I didn't received a confirmation email like I got the first time. I can PM you the details but if it's too much trouble I can wait, no trouble.

Thank you @ca333,  after some troubles with the cache and datas of my play store application I finally downloaded the app and my first KMD-VRSC swap worked perfectly
Thank you all for your help :)

Posted in the Blocknet discord a few hours ago, I dont really understand what's his problem with the "atomic". Maybe there is some documentation I Can point them to, or something more technical ?
Anyway here's the message :

What's up with nix using atomicdex?   I thought nix was working with blocknet?   Do they know that just because they called it "atomic"dex doesn't really necessarily mean that?


[30-Aug-19 01:24 AM] GuilouGuilouOTE#1930
Oh maybe this particular NIX_KMD swap was not atomic because of their Ghost protocol thing ?


[30-Aug-19 01:32 AM] ca333#0333
@GuilouGuilouOTE  https://www.binance.vision/blockchain/atomic-swaps-explained - there is a sentence in this article stating that (we) jl777 did the worlds first automated cross chain atomic swap - even Binance gave us credit for the worlds first REAL DEX technology which i think says more than thousand words. Furthermore does https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-and-the-early-pioneers-of-atomic-swaps/ explain our DEX history and technology very well. However, rest assured that atomicDEX is the only 3rd generation, platform independent, cross-chain atomic swap technology.

Please consider adding the `recover/unstuck` button for failed swaps.

Testing latest 0.1.62 on Samsung S10 (exynos). First start still rough a little bit. It connects and slowly loads the assets, very sluggish and freezes. Minimizing and opening the app again helps immediately, opens up quickly and working smooth. Only cold start is problematic.

As I can see from logs on the seed node this swap was actually failed with ` "type": "MakerPaymentSpendFailed"` error. (https://paste.ubuntu.com/p/Bjvf7jbZJ4/)

Have you actually received the komodo on some point? that's some kind of AtomicDEX-API bug if yes.

Anyway this issue not AtomicDEX GUI related. If you'll face such problem again please reopen this issue and I'll move it to AtomicDEX-API repo.

@ca333 google is rough with banning apps. ive been through the whole rigamole of copyright infringing on google play, as many others. I would take out the pictures of rick and morty on the listing. if you search for rick and morty in the store they are definitely DMCAing apps using their IPs due to the lack of older rick and morty apps. at the very least i would make sure to not mention in the description where to get rick and morty coins for example.

Thanks @dan. - will remove these just to make sure to not run into issues. jfyi - We were told that since we do not sell anything with Rick and Morty (not assigning value to these tokens) nor profit from it in any way (app is free) it wouldn't be a problem due to the fact that fan-projects are allowed. (Apple for instance has also reviewed this application).


[06-Sep-19 07:39 AM] ca333#0333
We do not collect any KYC data - if courts contact us we would have to inform them about the technical architecture of a DEX system. The above paragraph is just a legal requirement in the application itself @Acura - dont worry, DEX doesn't have KYC.

swap speed depends a lot on how fast block times are. KMD to smartchains with 1 min blocktimes will be much quicker than swaping for something with a 10 min blocktime. If blocks are slower than normal, it takes longer still.

I just figured it out.


[06-Sep-19 10:29 AM] Novo#3073
This happens when you have PIN disabled.  If you have it disabled and you come back to the app it hangs.


[06-Sep-19 10:34 AM] Novo#3073
Additionally, 'Biometric protection' on it's own does not work.  The user needs to have the PIN toggle activated as well in order for the biometric protection to work.   Yet it is possible to toggle 'biometric' on it's own.  That should also be fixed.


[06-Sep-19 10:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Thank you for report! Yes, this clue with biometric protection is know one and will be improved in the next patch

Will try to reproduce issue with disabled pin + hang on my side


[06-Sep-19 10:37 AM] Novo#3073
Additionally.  When the user selects 'Change Pin', the label should state 'Enter your old PIN code'  and the next screen should state'Enter your new PIN Code'.  Make sure the 'old' and 'new' adjectives are bolded for emphasis.

Correct me if I am wrong, but currently there is no way of seeing the order book for a coin that the user already does to have a balance in their wallet.
In a way it is logical, but I would want to know the price before I send any to my DEX wallet... 

In other words, this is a feature request: Show order books for coins with 0 balance.

this is a dumb question but all the swaps on this public beta are real swaps right? not a testnet


[06-Sep-19 12:43 PM] gcharang#6833
rick - morty pair are the test coins
the rest of the pairs are real trades between real coins involving their blockchains


[06-Sep-19 12:47 PM] ca333#0333
even Rick and Morty trades are **real** swaps - this is a production/live DEX network. No testnet. However, still considered beta-stage.

@Gig - Komodo's DEX technology has been in development for half a decade like stated above -  AtomicDEX is our 3rd generation DEX technology which was eventually ported from the legacy codebase and tech-stack to the new protocol and state of the art tech-stack. The closed beta was going on for around 2 months before reaching public beta stage.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #87: \[feature request\] orderbook page
Orderbook on CLI is visible regardless of the balance of the coin, the coin just has to be enabled.

@marrych it needs some addional research and work to implent (special swap smart contract for ETC needs to be created). In general I think it's possible but not in the shortlist at the moment

With enabled PIN protection it should start fine. And in general I'm strongly recommend to always use this option üôÇ  But anyway it'll be fixed for sure

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #82: Total asset display
1. Swap needs to finish until step 3. (ex. ETH to KMD)
2. Go back to PORTFOLIO total assets displayed in USD
3. The total USD value displays the PREVIOUS USD value PLUS the swapped asset which was not yet confirmed.

suggestion: after any swap (step 3) wait for ALL transactions to be confirmed before computing for total USD value

The server is is on has been having memory issues lately tho, so it might crash intermittently (auto revive is in effect). Hoping to upgrade or move some things to another server next week.

Or can i swap a rick for anything?

No, technically you can swap RICK/MORTY with any asset but it has not much sense for buyer because RICK and MORTY valuation is 0$

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #89 Support Coinomi seedphrases
A colleague attempted to use a Coinomi seedphrase and while it was seen as valid, no BTC balance was seen.

I wonder if this is actually a bug in "gap addresses" and not checking enough addresses for a balance, or genuinely looking at a wrong wallet prefix.

In any case, it would be amazing for AtomicDEX if all existing Coinomi users could sweep their funds away from a closed source wallet üéâ

@The1earl As I understand at the moment it caused on your side because of non standart font size. Screen resolution is quite huge on this phone model so shouldn‚Äôt cause such problem. There is just no space on screen to fit everything because of big label on top and numbers. If you can make font size a little bit smaller it should be fine

@jspook16 coins will be added slowly


[08-Sep-19 09:16 AM] PTYX#6840
Some might be added at the same time in batches but it all depends when the listing fee and agreement between the coin being listed and the komodo team is finalized.


[08-Sep-19 09:17 AM] PTYX#6840
We need to leverage not only the community of the coin we're adding, we need to monetize the listing and also levarage the community's marketing reach.

having a listing fees means coins that could bring in volume maybe excluded if they decide not to pay,

Anyone is able to work on their own implementation of the DEX on their own app for free. Some coins will be added for free in exchange for marketing and other partnerships. However, $6500 is very accessible.

The api is free to use as far as I know.


[08-Sep-19 12:16 PM] applecider#7505
ok so other GUIs can decide not to apply listing fee , ok got it thanks

Correct,  there is pros and cons to going straight with Atomicdex or making your own.

Many wouldn‚Äôt dedicate their limited programming resources when their is a relative cheap pay option available

@ team @Admin  i made about ten swaps from Rick and Morty and a handful real swaps, i exchanged to get VRSC and i got KMD, with other tokens, and it worked! Very good job!

Add a price change information from 24h, to see my portfolio value go up or down, and it will be perfect for me. Claim reward from my Komodo balance is beautiful.

[08-Sep-19 09:24 PM] hastrup#8742
Is there a time line for when the essential kmd asset will be add, Like jumblr revs bots dex to AtomicDex? I'm not asking for a hard date. Just is it whit in the next three months or so?


[08-Sep-19 09:25 PM] dudezmobi#1945
@gone for some time  it will finish just wait it out. Or you could chose not.to encrypt


[08-Sep-19 09:31 PM] dm312#9176
Is there going to be a desktop atomic dex?


[08-Sep-19 09:51 PM] TonyL#3577
@gone for some time Try to kill app in this state and start again. Just reproduced issue with similar symphtoms on one of the devices (quite old with Android 6) - app actually crashed on encryption stage and because of this reason dashboard crashed too with endless Connecting. App restart helped in my case.

What Android version/device model are you using? (upd found in backlog thats it's Huawei P20. Try to create wallet with "Fast encryption" enabled. It should help)


[08-Sep-19 09:52 PM] TonyL#3577
@dm312 As far as I know desktop AtomicDEX is in future plans, yep


[08-Sep-19 09:53 PM] TonyL#3577
in general you already can use it on desktop with Android emulator or screen sharing üòÖ


[08-Sep-19 09:56 PM] TonyL#3577
@hastrup It'll be added eventually after app evolution to release version from current beta state

Two different systems.


[08-Sep-19 10:09 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
You can have your own GUI and choose what coins you want to add, or pay for integration into the reference client.

@AkiraX in my understanding it's not easy task to atomicswap arrr because of this chain private nature. In general more coins will be added eventually after app evolution to release version from current beta state.


[09-Sep-19 09:05 PM] TonyL#3577
`Next AtomicDex Beta for iOS will be downloaded via App Store, not Testflight, correct ?` - during the beta - Testflight, after release - App Store. At the moment app is in open beta stage so testflight link availiable to anyone interested in testing.

via iPhone you can only set 0,0xx instead of 0.0xx, so you get an error message because this format is not supported

that s why i dont care about kmodo üòõ i was kinda angry


[10-Sep-19 03:49 AM] Oszy#5734
what do you mean? nothing is abandoned, there was a migration  to sapling, and even if you missed that you had time till June 2019 to claim your Pirate from an old address


[10-Sep-19 03:50 AM] Oszy#5734
also it's 2 different chains and coins


[10-Sep-19 03:50 AM] Deleted User#0000
i cash out all my kmd in winter

so how is call  the kmodo private chain ?  coin


[10-Sep-19 03:51 AM] Oszy#5734
There is no such thing, Pirate is not Komodo, it's built on komodo.


[10-Sep-19 03:51 AM] Oszy#5734
but let's keep this channel for AtomicDEX


[10-Sep-19 03:52 AM] Deleted User#0000

[10-Sep-19 03:53 AM] Oszy#5734
you need to tell us more about how what is happening / not happeing, what do you see when you try it, in order to replicate and fix your issue

just by saying it's not working we can't figure out what is wrong

@vogelfreund88  I think you misunderstood me big time, I talked to you politely and you didn't answer my question 3 times, and then you started to take it out on me for no reason.
But it's okay, we don't need to talk, anyone would have ask you the same question that's a 100%.

normally it takes a minute, but VRSC needs several hours, because of VRSC

Steps to reproduce:
1. Start app, ensure you have swaps in history.

if you selected "custom seed" then there is a possibility that you have input a wrong seed


[11-Sep-19 11:17 PM] lollipop#1682
I did


[11-Sep-19 11:18 PM] lollipop#1682
So i uninstall and try again right?


[11-Sep-19 11:18 PM] gcharang#6833
no need to uninstall
just select "restore" in the welcome screen and give it a different name


[11-Sep-19 11:18 PM] lollipop#1682
Okay


[11-Sep-19 11:18 PM] lollipop#1682
Thx


[11-Sep-19 11:18 PM] gcharang#6833
you can also delete the wrong wallet from "settings"


[11-Sep-19 11:19 PM] gcharang#6833
if you don't select "custom seed", the wallet will only allow you to proceed if you enter a seed that was created by atomicDEX


[11-Sep-19 11:20 PM] lollipop#1682
Aaah


[11-Sep-19 11:20 PM] lollipop#1682
Its not a wallet created by atomicdex tho


[11-Sep-19 11:22 PM] gcharang#6833
where was the seed created?
agama?


[11-Sep-19 11:22 PM] lollipop#1682
Yew


[11-Sep-19 11:22 PM] lollipop#1682
Yes


[11-Sep-19 11:23 PM] gcharang#6833
then you should select "custom seed" and enter the words properly. click the eye icon to see the words you are entering
and don't add extra spaces


[11-Sep-19 11:24 PM] lollipop#1682
I did. But must have missed something. Ill just try again. Np.

@wanda if you forgot the password, you could use the "restore" option and use the seed words that you have backedup when creating the wallet

@lollipop is the seed phrase producing the correct address in agama itself?

It works in chainswap


[12-Sep-19 01:01 AM] Fib-O-Trader#6042
is eth in atomicdex a smart contract or direct transfer?


[12-Sep-19 01:02 AM] gcharang#6833
@Fib-O-Trader it uses a smart contract
what do you mean by direct transfer?


[12-Sep-19 01:03 AM] Fib-O-Trader#6042
@gcharang ah okay, coz the exchange i use it says it does not support smart contract just direct transfer


[12-Sep-19 01:06 AM] gcharang#6833
@Fib-O-Trader the receiving address for ETH in atomicDEX is a normal address
so it is a direct transfer
what I said previously is that, for atomic swap involving ETH, we use smart contracts
so you should be able to withdraw to your atomicDEX ETH address

Really, minimum BTC buy is .00777? Is this a bug?


[12-Sep-19 02:42 AM] dudezmobi#1945
Looks like it


[12-Sep-19 03:02 AM] TonyL#3577
@benzo Hi! It's not a bug - minimal swap amount is 0.00777 determined by protocol and the same for all coins. I'm agree that it's quite high amount in USD equialent. But from another side it's better to trade huge amounts of BTC because of tx fees.


[12-Sep-19 03:22 AM] Zekeiel#2861
$80 btc minimum for buys


[12-Sep-19 03:24 AM] phideas#8309
no one should complain, btc is digital gold after all. heavy and expensive. by design.


[12-Sep-19 03:26 AM] Zekeiel#2861
well since you said no one should complain, then u must be right, naturally.


[12-Sep-19 03:28 AM] phideas#8309
üôÇ i don't have to be right, btc is as it is on layer one. not realy suitable for small tx.


[12-Sep-19 03:33 AM] Zekeiel#2861
Which set of layers we referring to?


[12-Sep-19 03:33 AM] Zekeiel#2861
How about the LN?


[12-Sep-19 03:36 AM] phideas#8309
Yes, LN is designed to do micro tx with BTC. But it is different tech, L2 solution. Not suited for komodo atomic swaps afaik,


[12-Sep-19 03:42 AM] benzo#8202
In my opinion a DEX shouldn't have restrictions like this

{Reactions}
üçÄ 

[12-Sep-19 03:56 AM] phideas#8309
i agree $80 is a bit overkill for a min. amount per swap. btc is currently capable to do it cheaper, but otoh btc fees can change rapidly as "number go up" üôÇ

I had some rewards to claim, but after sending some kmd to another wallet I have no more rewards to claim, is that how it's supposed to behave or is a bug? If I'm correct, on the agama wallet this was possible (send some and still have my previously accumulated kmd to claim)...

[12-Sep-19 08:39 AM] ca333#0333
@wl that is a feature - when sending a TX the reward is automagically claimed. You can actually check your transaction on the blockexplorer and will see the reward.

you can turn off the pin in settings, but password turnoff is super insecure

-Can‚Äôt paste rick address in send
-Would be nice to scan screenshots no?
-Logging off also toggles me out of the app.
-After sending 5 mortys to another dress it has shown -10 mortys for about a minute
-On my first wallte after relog-in: rick and morty wallets are not shown, but on the second wallet they are shown.
-would be cool if for testing password could be disabled.

Privkey to seed is not possible 
but the other way is definitely possible and in the wish list

@Fib-O-Trader atomicDEX uses mixed case addresses for ETH. they have error detection builtin
it seems like your exchange doesn't support mixed case addresses yet
you can simply convert all the alphabet to lower case and submit
convert to lower: <http://www.convertstring.com/StringFunction/ToLowerCase>
mixed case vs all lower: <https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289992-Why-Some-Addresses-Are-Mixed-Case>
```
For example, address 0x6eaff3479c17b8e7a0069823dc87bab09fbf4549 is valid, but 0x6eAff3479c17b8e7A0069823DC87bAB09fBf4549 is easier to copy down safely.

there's a user complaining on telegram about ```Still experiencing the endless connection screen on the new atomic dex. I 'm using a HUAWEI MediaPad M3 Lite 10, but same problem with a Samsung s8. I was in touch few weeks ago with tony from Discord but he wasn't able to find the problem with my app logs. Great. For the record, during the beta phase I was able tl use the dex. Performed several swap. But since an update, I m stuck on the connection screen```

`3` or `bc1` thats segwit. Legacy addresses starting from `1` - you need to specify such address as a receiving address

iPhone 6s, iOS 12.4 and DEX 0.1.7. Nothing specific happened. I wanted to make a swap between KMD and VRSC, then I‚Äôm first of three steps the swap was confirmed. Afterwards nothing worked anymore. The same with a second and third swap and I cannot create any more orders since then. They‚Äôre not saved anymore.

You  can  swap  any  privacy  coin  to KMD  ,  and  swap back  again.  Just  use AtomicDEX @liqdmetal


[16-Sep-19 10:37 AM] PTYX#6840
@liqdmetal if kmd had kept it's privacy features we'd be delisted from major exchanges just like other privacy coins have. the decision to remove those features was made by james and it was a smart decision.


[16-Sep-19 10:38 AM] PTYX#6840
it makes more sense to keep KMD as a transparent chain and use privacy features through other methods. possibly even a side chain

any network with enough sniffers on it is compromised, be it TOR or grin

de-anonymized


[16-Sep-19 11:45 AM] liqdmetal#8650
the network itself is critical to true anonymity


[16-Sep-19 11:54 AM] jl777c#5810
you miss my point. GRIN transactions are effectively encrypted in the blockchain form, but all the miners get plaintext transaction details. granted, still some work is needed to correlate things, but without any encryption layer, it is all in plaintext.


[16-Sep-19 11:55 AM] jl777c#5810
compare that to the zcash transactions (that are not taddr), the entire transaction is encrypted, before it gets to the miner. so add all the sniffers you want, without the privkey, you wont be able to decrypt the zcash z-transaction


[16-Sep-19 11:56 AM] jl777c#5810
in this case, the network is not so critical and that is the big advantage of z transactions. also with PIRATE, the user cant make a transparent transaction, which is how most of the privacy is lost. by preventing the users from doing transparent tx, the highest level of privacy is maintained

i dont believe i did. the miners of grin only receive the aggregated transaction details with no addresses. therefore enough nodes needs to be sniffer nodes to de-anonymize anything

am i crazy to ask about rvn coin protocol layer assets on the dex? :)


[16-Sep-19 04:13 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
I'm very excited about AtomicDEX and have done a successful trade with an open offer, buying KMD with BCH


[16-Sep-19 04:14 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
Today I sent some BTC into my AtomicDEX and attempted to create an offer to sell some for USDC, however I'm unable to do this and am wondering what I'm doing wrong.

[16-Sep-19 04:15 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
as you can see, the trade button lit up as though I'd be able to press it


[16-Sep-19 04:15 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
but I cannot.,


[16-Sep-19 04:20 PM] allbits#5898
You need ETH in your account to trade USDC because it is an ERC20 and there are gas fees


[16-Sep-19 04:21 PM] allbits#5898
Also when trading BTC Atomicdex imposes a minimum because btc transaction fees are relatively high


[16-Sep-19 05:25 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
ahh, an error message with that info would be handy in a future update


[16-Sep-19 05:26 PM] FTL_Ian#8600
Also another annoying bug:  when logging into the wallet and inputting the password (not the pin) I cannot use the Android's normal paste feature, so I have to type in the long, complex password I'd set


[17-Sep-19 12:15 AM] ca333#0333
@everyone we released atomicDEX mobile 0.1.8 (beta) - this version brings many improvements and resolves pretty much all of the reported issues. It is already on playstore (Android) and will be available for iOS (testflight) in the coming 24-48h (pending approval). Happy testing!

and seems sides are flipped


[17-Sep-19 01:04 AM] ca333#0333
amount is okay - it shows the order he was expecting to get for his order matched with a better offer thus spending less coins to get the expected amount...


[17-Sep-19 01:05 AM] Markus#5464
so maybe its not his own order in the end being matched?

i just checked @buralux - i thought the screenshot is from the current version - yes in 0.1.8 you should not have this problem anymore


[17-Sep-19 01:10 AM] ca333#0333
this was indeed an issue in the old version with the order visualisation - Thanks for reporting!


[17-Sep-19 01:10 AM] Oszy#5734
is it not showing the exchange rate anymore below the trade button?

[17-Sep-19 01:10 AM] ca333#0333
it actually does @Oszy - which trading pair?

RFOX/KMD


[17-Sep-19 01:11 AM] Oszy#5734
it's ok now


[17-Sep-19 01:11 AM] Oszy#5734
wasn't coming up first


[17-Sep-19 01:12 AM] ca333#0333
ok i see - might be the fetching of the FIAT value - had similar delays (since using external APIs) but shouldn't affect the app like causing an error or so


[17-Sep-19 01:12 AM] Oszy#5734
not coming up for HUSH now


[17-Sep-19 01:13 AM] ca333#0333
We could add a syncing icon for the time it fetches the FIAT values and generates the exchange rate line


[17-Sep-19 01:13 AM] Oszy#5734
looks like the first time it's missing, then second time it's there


[17-Sep-19 01:13 AM] ca333#0333
thanks for the hint - will test this


[17-Sep-19 01:19 AM] Markus#5464
@ca333 from where do atomicdex fetch prices?

coinbase and coingecko @Markus


[17-Sep-19 01:57 AM] benzo#8202
can we put in a request for smaller bitcoin orders, we're supposed to be testing with small amounts yet cannot sell $10 worth of kmd for BTC.. @ca333


[17-Sep-19 02:15 AM] ca333#0333
will check this and revaluate the situation @benzo - the main reason for this limit is that with lower amounts the DEX fee could result in a dust-transaction which wouldn't be accepted by (most) network participants. However - we will check this and keep you updated.


[17-Sep-19 02:40 AM] benzo#8202

@vichiet   @wl        Don't deactivate Pin-protection.  I installed everything worked, after I turned off the pin , black  screen and the application was unavailable.  Re-installed - everything is fine.  After each exit from the application you need to reactivate the coins you need. Android.

Just a simple UX suggestion: Ethereum network is currently clogged due to high activity. Since AtomicDex tx rely on underlying blockchains, it would be cool to inform users in wallet if there is any slow down on supported blockchains. this could prevent potentional failed swaps and also save time and resources to avoid human interaction.
edit: i just waited >5min to confirm a tx on eth with normal tx fee.

Btc and Kmd available for exchange in the DEX ...any list of coins coming in the future?

@Elevibes you can activate more coins if press `+` in the dashboard. There is quite huge list of UTXO coins, Komodo assetchains and ETH/ERC20. More assets will be added eventually

feature suggestion for AtomicDEX: On the screen when you click on a coin in the portfolio view (screen where it brings up the coin balance, fiat value of the balance, receive and send buttons and transaction history) you should be able to tap the balance at the top and cycle the displayed fiat from `balance` to `per coin` values.


[17-Sep-19 08:28 PM] Regnar#6164
Considering many people track the per coin price, it would make sense to offer the ability to see the per coin price here as well instead of just the total balance.

Good day

I have a question, in my portfolio it only says connecting, why so?


[17-Sep-19 11:17 PM] ITM#7678
I have a quick question.
I see the atomicdex swap happen directly from the wallet.
Let say I Sell LTC for KMD.
The swap is completed but both LTC and KMD transaction broadcasted is unconfirmed.
If a miner decides to create kmd transaction(to his own address), include it in the solved block(nicehash to quickly solve difficulty) but not submit it until the LTC transaction is broadcasted. As soon as that is done he broadcast the solved block. This will allow a double spend to take place?
Am I missing something? I thought is was linked to a cryptocondition or something?


[17-Sep-19 11:20 PM] ITM#7678
fine it was not a quick question


[17-Sep-19 11:36 PM] jl777c#5810
komodo ecosystem coins use dpowconfs, so they wait for notarizations. other coins can indeed be double spent if enough resources are used, but the economic cost to double spend a single swap makes it a non-economic attack. just dont swap 100 BTC without setting it to wait for enough BTC confirmations


[17-Sep-19 11:37 PM] jl777c#5810
this is why we say dont swap large amounts during the beta


[17-Sep-19 11:42 PM] ITM#7678
Let say 100KMD, The cost to double spend is less then ~1 KMD.(Since I am solving a block solo with the double spend transaction since the other transaction is not confirmed ). So the dpowconfs don't kick in until 1 confirmation. Now the volumes are low, but when the orderbook is huge, its can slice attack the orderbook in seconds.


[17-Sep-19 11:45 PM] jl777c#5810
the swaps should not be treating the transaction as valid until the dpowconfs shows 2 confirmations


[17-Sep-19 11:45 PM] jl777c#5810
which means it is notarized


[17-Sep-19 11:47 PM] jl777c#5810
also there is no way you can mine an LTC block for 1 KMD, let alone double spend attack LTC


[17-Sep-19 11:49 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Also worth to add that only `spending` transactions are left unconfirmed, in more details:
1. Maker sends payment, taker waits for this payment to be confirmed so double spending is prevented here.
2. Taker then sends his payment, maker waits until this payment is confirmed before attempt to spend it.
3. Only then maker is spending taker's payment revealing the secret and taker spends maker's payment.
@ITM Only the `spending` stages are left unconfirmed in this case, the inputs being spent on this stage are hash-timelocked so other side won't be able to spend the transaction until timelock conditions are met (few hours).


[17-Sep-19 11:49 PM] jl777c#5810
the one issue would be if one of the coins is a low hashrate coin without double spending protection


[17-Sep-19 11:50 PM] jl777c#5810
it seems for such coins, we need a way for the user to specify the required confirmations for that coin


[17-Sep-19 11:51 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, the problem can occur if even after some number of confirmations the attacker can still double spend the output that was used for swap payment itself rolling back significant amount of blocks.


[17-Sep-19 11:52 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe we need to allow the user to specify the required confirmations for each transaction. using default value so it doesnt have to be changed if it is acceptable. that would allow the user to specify larger confirmations for larger amounts. or we can automatically scale the required confirmations based on the amounts being swapped


[17-Sep-19 11:53 PM] jl777c#5810
probably there can be some algorithm that balances a coins hashrate and economic value of the swap to generate the required confirmations


[17-Sep-19 11:53 PM] ITM#7678
@artem.pikulin What if I submit a solved block with double spend transaction before the hash-timelocked transaction is confirm or even properly broadcasted?


[17-Sep-19 11:55 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
The MM2 will then abort the swap since the transaction won't ever be confirmed.


[17-Sep-19 11:56 PM] ITM#7678
@artem.pikulin When I completed a swap, both KMD and Hush transaction stage on the explorer was unconfirmed. The swap was marked as completed


[17-Sep-19 11:56 PM] artem.pikulin#0794
These transactions were spends of swap payments that were confirmed before.


[18-Sep-19 12:01 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
The protocol is as follows:
1. Maker sends payment that protected with hash of secret. We must wait for it to be confirmed.
2. Taker then sends his payment using same hash of secret. We must wait for this to be confirmed.
3. Maker reveals secret to spent the Taker's payment - we don't have to wait for this to be confirmed. The taker won't be able to refund it for long time.
4. Taker uses the secret to spend the payment. Same here, to make a refund attempt Maker needs to wait for long time, but since it passes the transaction will be confirmed.


[18-Sep-19 12:04 AM] jl777c#5810
if a chain is under a constant 51% attack for the entire duration of the timelocks and doing a censorship attack, then it is possible to mess things up. so we need to rely on the expense of such an attack being magnitudes more expensive than would be gained by the swaps


[18-Sep-19 12:04 AM] ITM#7678
@artem.pikulin Thanks :). Explained perfectly


[18-Sep-19 12:06 AM] jl777c#5810
for BTC the cost of such an attack would be millions of dollars, but for some smaller chain, maybe it isnt such an expensive cost. it is of course safest to be swapping dPoW protected coins, which dont suffer from such attack vectors


[18-Sep-19 12:08 AM] ITM#7678
@jl777c So you say we bulletproof in terms of attacker not making a profit?


[18-Sep-19 12:09 AM] jl777c#5810
practically speaking, yes.


[18-Sep-19 12:09 AM] jl777c#5810
theoretically, if a user swaps 10BTC worth of some low hashrate coin, then maybe it is possible for an economic attack.


[18-Sep-19 12:09 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
```

```
@jl777c MM2 already has the API to set the required confirmations per coin during runtime (not persistent) - https://github.com/artemii235/developer-docs/blob/mm/docs/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.md#set_required_confirmations. But adding the USD-volume heuristics is also possible, maybe something simple at the start like `if volume > 1000 USD confirmations = confirmations + 1`.

[18-Sep-19 12:11 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, so the GUI can do a market price vs hashrate based calc for setting confirmations


[18-Sep-19 12:16 AM] jl777c#5810
i guess a more practical way is to have 2 confirmation values per coin that we know of and we can manually calculate the > $1000 numconfs, so for small amounts not at risk, it will still be fast, but for anything with significant economic value it uses the slower more secure numconfs. this logic should probably be done by the caller

[18-Sep-19 02:57 AM] ca333#0333
not yet @Surfer007 - since its a pure DEX (100% decentralized and p2p) the swap data is only being stored locally (filestream layer) on the affected nodes/device and where you actually issued the swap. However - you will find the swap transactions in the transaction history of the affected coins detail view (which is blockchain data thus globally available).

@CrisF Hi! Can see orders for BCH. Most probably there are no maker orders for ETH atm because of current crazy tx fees


[18-Sep-19 04:30 AM] TonyL#3577
@wl it's possible to check orderbook to compare with another current orders. If there is no orders at all - yeah, atm you'll need to check CMC and make some calculations to place an order with a good price. Agree that it's good feature to display current "market" ratio before maker order creation to help place a good order easily

I really like AtomicDEX and its potential.  Are there plans to allow offers to specify a minimum as well as a floating price based on a rate from an exchange?  For instance, I'd like to sell some BTC at 10% over spot and don't want to come back and update the price every hour.  Also, a minimum purchase amount would be nice as the little stuff just isn't worth dealing with.

Thank you for the cool app!

[19-Sep-19 04:25 AM] Regnar#6164
@wl rewards are based on UTXO, so if you sent 10 KMD to the wallet it would gain rewards, if you then sent another 5 to the wallet, it would still only gain rewards on the 10, because the 5 is a separate Utxo and is less than the 10 KMD minimum. If you then claim the rewards, it will send the entire balance to yourself, so you'll have a single UTXO of 15, which will all gain rewards

In the same way, if you send two transactions of 10 KMD each, they will both gain rewards

[19-Sep-19 08:43 AM] TonyL#3577
Are you using mixed case ETH address as recepient?

```Q: Why am I getting "invalid address error" message on ETH transaction broadcast attempt?

A: AtomicDEX uses ETH checksum verification: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55. Thus, address input is case-sensitive.``` (https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000030788-atomicdex-faq)

I‚Äôve got VRSC locked in swaps after a timeout trying to do VRSC->KMD


[19-Sep-19 08:07 PM] ia#8418
@PTYX Are there any live examples of web interfaces to AtomicDEX, and a list of URLs where people can do real trades on AtomicDEX. To do that, what exactly do people install in order to starting trading on AtomicDEX? MM2? I was just about to install it, but I also was wondering  if this is doing any real volume of trading, as the first thing I read (in the README.md) was:
```# AtomicDEX Marketmaker V2

This repository contains the `work in progress` code of brand new Marketmaker version built mainly on Rust.  
The current state can be considered as very early alpha.  
**Use with test coins only. You risk to lose your money in case of trying to trade assets with real market cost.**```


[19-Sep-19 08:08 PM] PTYX#6840
The atomicdex is available in mobile app


[19-Sep-19 08:08 PM] PTYX#6840
There is also a desktop application called hyperdex running on the same network


[19-Sep-19 08:09 PM] PTYX#6840
There's not a web interface yet but it's being worked on


[19-Sep-19 08:09 PM] ia#8418
So HyperDEX is a front end while AtomicDEX is the backend?


[19-Sep-19 08:09 PM] PTYX#6840
No, both are frontends for the barterdex network


[19-Sep-19 08:09 PM] PTYX#6840
Hyper dex is a desktop gui and atomicdex is a mobile gui


[19-Sep-19 08:10 PM] ia#8418
How about the Market Maker 2?


[19-Sep-19 08:10 PM] PTYX#6840
The marketmaker2.0 is the engine that let's you broadcast and settle orders into the network


[19-Sep-19 08:11 PM] PTYX#6840
There's another layer called the Liquidity Provider network. They act as a dedicated decentralized network of buy/sell orders for any specific coin pair


[19-Sep-19 08:11 PM] PTYX#6840
You can also broadcast orders from both frontend apps but they wouldn't be considered LP nodes.


[19-Sep-19 08:12 PM] ia#8418
And the atomicDEX-API is simply a reference for anyone building a front end.


[19-Sep-19 08:12 PM] PTYX#6840
Correct


[19-Sep-19 08:14 PM] ia#8418
So HyperDEX is still a current product?


[19-Sep-19 08:16 PM] ia#8418
The atomicDEX-API is the general API for the BarterDEX backend? So it's not particularly exclusive to a mobile wallet?


[19-Sep-19 08:20 PM] ia#8418
Also, I thought I read the terms when I installed AtomicDEX on my Android phone that basically gave commercial, proprietary terms when I got it from the Play Store, but I read in Github normal GNU GPL 2.0.


[19-Sep-19 08:25 PM] ia#8418
Yeah. I just opened it again in my phone. I haven't actually done anything with it yet, but I checked the EULA and it reads like the software is owned by Komodo... don't copy, only one user, all that kind of thing, like a Microsoft licence.


[19-Sep-19 08:30 PM] PTYX#6840
The atomicdex frontend isn't open source. It indeed belongs to Komodo as it should.


[19-Sep-19 08:31 PM] PTYX#6840
Hyperdex is being developed by @hyperDEX. Feel free to ask questions directly to him


[19-Sep-19 08:33 PM] PTYX#6840
The atomicdex mobile app uses the barterdex api and the marketmaker2.0 as far as I understand.


[19-Sep-19 08:45 PM] ia#8418
Just one more thing. So, the (GNU GPL) licence at https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX
what does that refer to?

Repos:

<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/> --> repo with the backend called Marketmaker 2.0, you can build it and get a CLI to the dex network
<https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX> --> this is the placeholder repo of the AtomicDEX mobile app, a mobile GUI that uses Marketmaker 2.0
<https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex> --> the repo for the HyperDEX GUI, a Desktop app that uses Marketmaker 2.0
<https://github.com/chainmakers/chainmakers-ui-mono-repository/tree/master/packages/atomicdex-app> --> the repo for the Chainswap GUI, a Desktop app that uses Marketmaker 2.0

As all the UI's use the same backend, "Marketmaker 2.0", they share the same liquidity pool. i.e., an order created in one of them will be seen in all the others
<https://github.com/jl777/coins> --> all the coins in this repo with `"mm2": 1,` in the file named "coins" have been tested to work with Marketmaker 2.0 and any one of the GUI's is able to list them

instead of waiting for others to create orders on your favorite pairs, you could create them with the prices you like

[20-Sep-19 08:28 AM] cipi#4502
the swap has not failed, it is still underway... this is MakerPayment: https://kmdexplorer.io/tx/6e01e35cbb8ff986140bf006b17d89171b95392e257b22064cf0a45587ac5e20
next step would be TakerPayment, so your node should make the BAT tx


[20-Sep-19 08:32 AM] CrisF#3405
Oh, I received a swap fail message on both of them.


[20-Sep-19 08:32 AM] cipi#4502

will atomic dex integrate with coinmarketcaps. Bartedex information would not transfer to them so coins did not get credit for being on an exchange.


[20-Sep-19 09:44 AM] gcharang#6833
@LoveOfMoney we will try to get it on CMC once it is out of beta


[20-Sep-19 09:54 AM] jl777c#5810
barterDEX did eventually get onto CMC, i think we can try to rename it to atomicDEX when there is sufficient volumes

Made this question in telegram group and Acura adviced to ask it here.. So "If we talk about steps that need to be taken regarding Atomic Dex, how does it look? I mean:
‚Ä¢Beta testing phase now
‚Ä¢Liquidity solutions
‚Ä¢Stress tests
‚Ä¢Roll-out @ end of year, i guess?
‚Ä¢What is the strategy for getting as many coins listed as possible?
‚Ä¢And finally will there be marketing or some kinda campaigning towards the release?

Also, how much users are actually wanted / needed now as Atomic Dex is still in beta..? I mean it would be easy to multiply the user amounts right away by spreading some information, interviews and so on. Generally speaking I am interested in the strategy part of Atomic Dex roll-out"

> What is the strategy for getting as many coins listed as possible?

the main issue is getting a commitment from a coin community to provide liquidity, there are plans to collab with various coin teams for Promotion and liquidity

I only see available orders between btc and kmd, no other coins, is that correct, or do I need to clear cache or uninstall/reinstall to see current order book


[20-Sep-19 10:15 AM] gcharang#6833
@cryptoclueless | $ARRR did you enable other coins? only orders involving enabled coins are shown


[20-Sep-19 10:15 AM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
yeah, I've enabled a bunch of them


[20-Sep-19 10:16 AM] gcharang#6833
can you tell me the pair you are looking for? I will check in my app


[20-Sep-19 10:17 AM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
I've just tried to see whats available to swap for btc, and I'd have to create an oder for every coin except KMD.  I've enabled bch, axe, qtum, dash, vrsc, ltc, rvn bat, hush, zilla, rfox


[20-Sep-19 10:20 AM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
I also have a little bat, zilla, qtum, rfox, and eth, and again the only available swaps are to kmd


[20-Sep-19 10:24 AM] gcharang#6833
@cryptoclueless | $ARRR there are only KMD orders with BTC as base pair
there are orders for most coins with KMD as base

you could create an order by yourself for a BTC base pair if one isn't there already


[20-Sep-19 10:31 AM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
Yeah, I know, just surprised no swaps for btc


[20-Sep-19 11:11 AM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
maybe its because the minimum btc swap amount is 0.00777 which is around 75 dollars, will that minimum amount be lowered at some point?


[20-Sep-19 11:14 AM] gcharang#6833
not anytime soon
there can be times when btc txn fee is $1 
then swapping for less than $70 is more than 1% fee

there might be an option to disable the limit for advanced users in the future


[20-Sep-19 11:14 AM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
ok, good to know, thanks


[20-Sep-19 11:22 AM] Markus#5464
or make a check, if fee is greater than 1% then make a popup window appear to warn the user


[20-Sep-19 11:54 AM] FTL_Ian#8600

@CrisF Interesting, both these swaps were failed on TakerTx broadcasting stage with:
`"error": "taker_swap:691] eth:864] eth:864] RPC error: Error { code: ServerError(-32010), message: \"Transaction with the same hash was already imported.\", data: None }"` error. Were there another successful or failed swap attempts with same BAT amount?


[20-Sep-19 11:26 PM] CrisF#3405
Not on this version (0.1.9), @TonyL .  I don't have the data from the previous version.  I did a few rushed trades on that just to see if it was working.  I don't remember if one was the same amount but it is possible.


[20-Sep-19 11:27 PM] CrisF#3405
Would the address be the same between versions?  I can check the explorer.


[20-Sep-19 11:53 PM] Seko#7408
I got a timeout for the swap. Exactly this KMD amount has been locked since then. I can't use exactly this amount of KMD.

hi guys, why are coins with the KMD logo like hush, redfox etc.?


[21-Sep-19 09:13 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi! It‚Äôs indicator for chains using Komodo smart-chain technology (aka assetchains)


[21-Sep-19 09:28 AM] Trusty#8181
are like erc20 of ETH?


[21-Sep-19 09:32 AM] PTYX#6840
yes


[21-Sep-19 10:03 AM] TonyL#3577
Actually its not - assetchains are totally independent blockchains while erc20 usability/txfees depends of ethereum blockchain


[21-Sep-19 10:04 AM] TonyL#3577
Assetchain can exist without kmd, erc20 will not work without eth


[21-Sep-19 10:05 AM] TonyL#3577
And with assetsCC Antara module activated you can issue infinity amount of tokens on assetchains which will be something like a erc20 on eth blockchain


[21-Sep-19 10:05 AM] TonyL#3577

[21-Sep-19 04:03 PM] 2456145768#5267
Has it ever been available on PC before? I swear I thought I had read something regarding that


[21-Sep-19 04:28 PM] CrisF#3405
Previously BarterDEX, using mm1 (marketmaker1), did over 100,000 atomic swaps.  That was on PC with both BarterDEX GUI and CLI.  
AtomicDEX is the moblie app and based on mm2.  The underlying mm2 software can run on PC (CLI).


[21-Sep-19 05:06 PM] 2456145768#5267
That's what I remembered! BarterDEX. Thank you.
Sorry for the noob questions, but why is there now a marketmaker2? And do we have an ETA for mm2 GUI release on PC ?


[21-Sep-19 05:14 PM] CrisF#3405
mm2 is an updated and improve version based on rust rather than nanomsg(?) among other thing, as I understand it.
A mm2 gui will be released when someone makes one I suppose.


[21-Sep-19 05:15 PM] CrisF#3405
At the moment AtomicDEX is the focus. Not sure if anyone is working on a mm2 gui right now.


[21-Sep-19 05:22 PM] GuinnessStache#3821
So what will be the process to get new ERC-20 assets in the Dex? If for example I wanted TRAC to be listed, would I make a request to the devs or would a community member have to submit it to github and add it themselves ?


[21-Sep-19 05:24 PM] GuinnessStache#3821
Or do you just send it to your eth address in the Dex app and it becomes available to list for sale?

you can set it to never sleep in settings.

and you can only stake verus in  desktop wallet as far as I know

buy verus via atomicdex, use the same seed used by atomicdex to import that address to Verus Agama Desktop, and stake on the desktop.

How long does a swap need to be on step 2 of 3 to be considered 'stuck' in Atomicdex?

Has AtomicDex reached out to projects, CMC 5 to 2000?


[22-Sep-19 08:50 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe with a standard DM or email.


[22-Sep-19 09:04 PM] PTYX#6840
@Deleted User yes, chainzilla is contacting projects and we've designed brochures as well as a first contact email to onboard projects. We're currently working on interviewing people to expand our sales team to accommodate the atomicdex. I expect the have a new sales agent by the end of the month.


[22-Sep-19 09:05 PM] PTYX#6840
We've already onboarded one project, have 2 in the process of approval for compatability and we've reached out to around 40 projects. The goal isn't to simply list coins. There's a listing fee and we are negotiating that the atomicdex is listed and marketed through the project's website.


[22-Sep-19 09:06 PM] PTYX#6840
Additionally, we have to walk the project through the LP setup. This part is still being polished. It's a crucial part for liquidity.

The listing fee is very reasonable


[22-Sep-19 09:10 PM] PTYX#6840

There's a few other projects but we haven't gotten clear responses. Most of them don't want to pay so we have to negotiate other things.

[23-Sep-19 03:17 AM] gcharang#6833
for now, you can use: https://www.oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/
or the mm2 directly through terminal : <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API>

2 electrum servers had this in the log
`[Sep23 12:55] TCP: request_sock_TCP: Possible SYN flooding on port 10064. Sending cookies.  Check SNMP counters.`
10064 is the port of the HUSH electrum
times are in UTC
does it match with the above error?

does not really fit
i tuned a parameter, so the synflood should not happen any more
if it is related, the red screen should not return, if it does, it is something else

@hastrup most LBRY users are non-crypto users, so I don't think we'll be pursuing that anytime soon.  Depending on what the process looks like, maybe a community member can give it a shot. I know there was some Dex that did support LBRY, don't recall if it was Komodo or something else.

@hastrup LBC already works just fine on AtomicDEX: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins#L2774
but it is not in the electrumx-code, so no mobile usage possible... in order to add LBC, it must be added to electrumx first: https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx

We run our own spv servers already as a fork of electrumx ....so we may just be able to use those. It may require some modification on their end though

look here: https://github.com/jl777/coins/tree/master/electrums
there we "collect" the infos about the electrums for the different coins... if LBC electrums are working, we can add them there

@gcharang after a put in the address, amount and custom fee, and click withdraw, nothing happens. No error or anything, it just sits there. If I don‚Äôt choose custom fee it works fine


[25-Sep-19 05:56 AM] gcharang#6833
what value did you use for custom fee @lohash


[25-Sep-19 05:59 AM] lohash#7759
Several different ones, from 0.00000250 to 0.0005, none worked

@lohash does your BTC address start with `1` or something else?

Any plans of adding Beam? They seem to 'support' atomic swaps with their cli-wallet. "Atomic swap is available at Beam CLI wallet version 2.2.5635 or higher."


[25-Sep-19 07:39 AM] gcharang#6833
@lohash are you using the max amount? make sure the 

"amount being withdrawn + custom fee" = "amount available"
we will make the adjustment automatic or add an error message


[25-Sep-19 07:58 AM] lohash#7759
Ahh that must be it, I was figuring it would auto-adjust. I‚Äôll try that


[25-Sep-19 08:07 AM] gcharang#6833
@scubapanda it looks like it is possible
but not straightforward
- their addresses are not on blockchain
- SBBS has to be integrated with MM2
- addresses are valid for 24 hours
- not sure if their demo protocol works on a mobile device (won't have a local node)

our devs are working on perfecting the existing implementation
it is definitely possible to add Beam in the future

[28-Sep-19 01:42 AM] ca333#0333
@rnr nice to see you!! Yes exactly - anyone could provide a browser based atomicDEX soon and the best thing is it would be able to utilize a unified liquidity pool across all DEX apps (web, desktop, mobile, ...) so they would basically be all interconnected.

dexfees, and the discount for KMD pairs

Many benefits like more tech adoption, more dexfees as mentioned by SMK, bigger unified liquidity-pool, much bigger userbase, chance for atomicDEX becoming the DEX standard protocol, and so on. It is also in the sense of the general open-source idea and our interoperability and unity vision.

each time some functions run, it gets prices from Binance or Coingecko API. I've heard CoinPaprika is also good, but havent integrated it

does the bot market buy or put a limit order?


[28-Sep-19 03:22 AM] smkhound#7640
I've not yet streamlined binance side of things much. Basically not worried about fiat, just use it to maintain a baseline balance of each coin. If I have too much of one and not enough of another, I'll adjust manually. Will automate this more later, but have been careful/paranoid with delegating too much power to API keys early on.

@zephuros from what wallet did you scan the QR code by AtomicDEX?


[28-Sep-19 04:58 PM] Oszy#5734
qr gives back a string it is what it is, atomicdex doesn't change the output, where did you scan it from? scan it with a regular QR app as well you should see the same output

Where can I see all the orders in mm2?


[29-Sep-19 01:27 AM] Oszy#5734
you have to define a pair


[29-Sep-19 01:28 AM] Oszy#5734
like `"method\":\"orderbook\",\"base\":\"KMD\",\"rel\":\"HUSH\"}"`


[29-Sep-19 01:29 AM] Oszy#5734
do this for each pair you want to see and put ` > coinName.json` at the end

@hastrup If you time it right, orderbooks can be seen at https://oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/
To my shame though, server is having some issues until I have time/fiat to upgrade and or move some things around, so it has been failing every now and then, but I can revive it once I am aware.

Using smk's orderbook site I added up the volume using KMD as a base pair, currently there are orders for `658370.7239288847` KMD over all the current coin pairs

yea that's as orderbook shows, so definitely with multiplier


[29-Sep-19 09:13 AM] Regnar#6164
biggest pairs are DOGE/KMD, DGB/KMD, RFOX/KMD, RVN/KMD in that order

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #96 Portfolio Tab Bugged \(v0\.2\.0\)
So I've been using the Android public beta of atomicDEX for about a week. Did my first atomic swap which was neat. 

The issue I'm having is that after the latest update (0.2.0-e634e05ee) my balance is showing as zero and coins/tokens I've added to my portfolio are gone. Trying to add a coin/token again adds an empty space where it should be in the list.

This version is newer than what's on Google Play so maybe it got rolled out by accident? It's probably just a bug with that tab, my tra...

This text is correct - you need to use password to unlock (decrypt) your wallet before the deletion.
And after you input the password there is confirmation popup "Are you sure you want to delete your wallet"

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #97: The password confirmation screen for "Delete Wallet" says "Unlock wallet"
Of course the wallet needs to be decrypted before deletion. But the page doesn't signify that entering this password is only one step away from deleting the wallet.

If a user clicks the delete wallet button by mistake, why should a user enter his password without knowing exactly why they are entering it?

Each page should tell the user exactly what its purpose is, so the page that needs password entry for deleting the wallet should at least have the word delete in it.

@smkhound I did one now too, seems like maker issues for the rest.


[01-Oct-19 01:33 AM] smkhound#7640
Cant be certain, but I suspect that there could be situations where makerbots update order prices, but taker's orderbook has not yet been updated resulting in an attempt to match with an order which has since been cancelled by the maker. If so, the more frequently a makerbot updates prices, the more often this could happen.

@Seko thank you for the informations - we are investigating your reported issue - please try again with only a few coins active - i.e. launch the app and only activate 2-3 coins and see what happens. We are aware of this issue - seems an iOS limitation on concurrent (network) threads or similar where if you activate all/many coins that it will lead to DEX unresponsiveness. We will isolate and fix this shortly.


[01-Oct-19 02:38 AM] Seko#7408
Yeah, with a few coins, it seems to work. But as soon as it becomes more, it becomes an issue. Maybe a certain coin is also responsible for it?
Here is an overview of the coins I want to add: KMD, BTC, LTC, VRSC, HUSH, Chainzilla, USDC and ETH.

Ravencoin forked few hours ago. Can we continue to swap RVN in AtomicDEX or waiting an update ? Thanks


[01-Oct-19 11:52 AM] Oszy#5734
electrum needs to be update if not done already


[01-Oct-19 11:53 AM] cipi#4502
updates were already done before the fork
electrums and mm2 node are in sync with https://ravencoin.network/

By the way, after the fork,  rvn hashrate decrease from 22 to 11 TH/s. It's very hard to find blocks. APoW of jl777 would be appreciate. Komodo is one step ahead of others üòÉ

@QQ It's a beta. And we test it. And there are still improvements. AtomicDEX is not yet widely promoted. We are allowed to test here exclusively. And we still need a little patience. Everyone can speed up the process by getting involved.


[02-Oct-19 01:43 AM] CrisF#3405
Looking forward to the stress test, too. The BartedDEX test was where I first found Komodo.  Spent 40 hours that weekend trying to figure out the most basic things.  Got one trade in the end though!

```Spent 40 hours that weekend trying to figure out the most basic things.  Got one trade in the end though!``` not you have to spend like a 3 minutes to install the app and create wallet to be ready to perform swap by few clicks. Huge step ahead to the mass adoption imo


[02-Oct-19 01:58 AM] TonyL#3577
While ago I've not understood how to use BarterDEX tbh


[02-Oct-19 02:03 AM] CrisF#3405
The changes in that short time are really impressive.
For me BarterDEX was the first time I'd every really used a computer for anything other that the most basic of things.  
It was very eye opening to see what everyone was able to do.
Got me to find a whole new world that was hiding under the surface.

I think it fine for big project to pay up , especially with the exchange ban , however I do feel for the tiny cap project that would benefit greatly from atomicdex but cant pay thousunds of usd

Like as a developer I would want to help work on atomicDEX and improve it and continue to maintain the project, but being charged a fee, just knocks most devs out, especially the ones whom matter and truely believe in decentralized open source software.


[04-Oct-19 01:39 PM] cipi#4502
there is nothing coded in the mm2 backend, everything needed to trade a coin is here: https://github.com/jl777/coins
so to list a coin, make a PR to the repo and add all needed infos, like coin config, electrums, explorer
and don't forget to run a mm2 node for your coin, so it has liquidity

Yes I know that

@Satoshi AtomicDEX-API (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API) != AtomicDEX mobile GUI


[04-Oct-19 01:39 PM] Satoshi#3333
I mean the whole system as a backend


[04-Oct-19 01:40 PM] Satoshi#3333
I understand that guyys


[04-Oct-19 01:40 PM] Satoshi#3333
Denarius is already in jl777s repo


[04-Oct-19 01:40 PM] Satoshi#3333
We are in the HyperDEX


[04-Oct-19 01:40 PM] Satoshi#3333
Still shouldnt be charging devs to be listed on one of the GUIs for it


[04-Oct-19 01:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Why?


[04-Oct-19 01:41 PM] cipi#4502
That is the decision of the GUI devs


[04-Oct-19 01:41 PM] Satoshi#3333
So those devs shouldnt be in this industry


[04-Oct-19 01:41 PM] Satoshi#3333
It is not a DEX


[04-Oct-19 01:41 PM] Satoshi#3333
That GUI


[04-Oct-19 01:41 PM] Satoshi#3333
Since it is closed source and paid to list


[04-Oct-19 01:42 PM] Satoshi#3333
Like how does no one else see this?


[04-Oct-19 01:42 PM] Satoshi#3333
That is a money grab


[04-Oct-19 01:42 PM] Satoshi#3333
It only hurts devs


[04-Oct-19 01:42 PM] Oszy#5734
So if someone want to get paid for their work it is a moneygrab. Interesting


[04-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Satoshi#3333
Yes if they are advertising it as an open source DEX


[04-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Markus#5464
kmd didnt raise millions that they can spend on whatever like many other projects have, yet they manage to spend probably 100k if not more to get listed on certains exchanges and now 7500$ is a issue


[04-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Markus#5464
funny guy


[04-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Oszy#5734
Backend it is open source


[04-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Oszy#5734
Gui devs need to get paid


[04-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Oszy#5734
Simple


[04-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Satoshi#3333
You guys are missing the point


[04-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Satoshi#3333
That is okay your mods here


[04-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Satoshi#3333
They probably paid you at some point


[04-Oct-19 01:43 PM] Satoshi#3333
I do all this for free


[04-Oct-19 01:44 PM] Satoshi#3333
Ive been maintaining and updating my project Denarius with ZERO funding the past two and a half years now


[04-Oct-19 01:44 PM] Satoshi#3333
Any exchanges that did charge a listing fee we typically got donations for to get listed


[04-Oct-19 01:44 PM] Markus#5464
also can u explain ur scam hashtag in ur tweet, how is it a scam


[04-Oct-19 01:44 PM] Satoshi#3333
No one wants to donate for a "DEX"


[04-Oct-19 01:44 PM] Satoshi#3333
A DEX should just be able to be listed to as a coin developer


[04-Oct-19 01:44 PM] Satoshi#3333
A DEX would not charge a coin developer almost $10,000 USXXD


[04-Oct-19 01:44 PM] Satoshi#3333
USD*


[04-Oct-19 01:45 PM] Satoshi#3333
Because then you have people in here


[04-Oct-19 01:45 PM] Oszy#5734
Show me one exchange dex or cex that lists you for free


[04-Oct-19 01:45 PM] Satoshi#3333
Being like, yea open source coming soon, hit up PYTX


[04-Oct-19 01:45 PM] Markus#5464
So u can fork MM2 and make ur own gui, thats fine


[04-Oct-19 01:45 PM] Satoshi#3333
PYTX, oh yea, its closed source and $7.5k to list


[04-Oct-19 01:45 PM] Satoshi#3333
lmao


[04-Oct-19 01:45 PM] Satoshi#3333
That is a scam imo


[04-Oct-19 01:45 PM] Satoshi#3333
At least misleading to say the least


[04-Oct-19 01:45 PM] Satoshi#3333
I will do that Markus


[04-Oct-19 01:45 PM] Satoshi#3333
For sure


[04-Oct-19 01:45 PM] Satoshi#3333
But I just think its bad business and super bad publicity to be charging crazy fees


[04-Oct-19 01:46 PM] Satoshi#3333
Your only hurting us devs


[04-Oct-19 01:46 PM] Satoshi#3333

Are you spamming this to all exchanges that are charging listing fees?


[04-Oct-19 01:46 PM] Satoshi#3333
@Andersen Want to pay it? Put your money where your mouth is


[04-Oct-19 01:46 PM] Satoshi#3333
hahaha


[04-Oct-19 01:46 PM] Satoshi#3333
I dont get paid anything to do what I do


[04-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Satoshi#3333
I just do it


[04-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Satoshi#3333
and so do others that dont have a greedy vision in this industry


[04-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Satoshi#3333
I do yes


[04-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Satoshi#3333
I have called out HitBTC and Binance yes


[04-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Oszy#5734
That is your choice you can't expect anyone to work for free


[04-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Satoshi#3333
Bruh it isnt fucking work


[04-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Satoshi#3333
Adding a damn coin


[04-Oct-19 01:47 PM] Satoshi#3333
Takes like 5 minutes unless your codebase is complete shit


[04-Oct-19 01:48 PM] Satoshi#3333
Definiately not warranting a $7,500 fee


[04-Oct-19 01:48 PM] Satoshi#3333

lol


[04-Oct-19 01:48 PM] Oszy#5734
Developing the gui costed much more than listing a coin, i can tell you they didn't even break even yet


[04-Oct-19 01:48 PM] ca333#0333
Using the DEX and adding coins to our DEX is completely free and there is absolutely no limitation - i.e. the tech is fully open-sourced. However - the mobile DEX wallet integration isn't free since we do cover SPV server hosting, support agents, maintenance and the implementation from the 6500 USD "integration" fee. That is more than fair. If you don't like it you can still use atomicDEX core/API for your own implementation @Satoshi - but please calm down and stop spreading false information.


[04-Oct-19 01:49 PM] Satoshi#3333
I suppose if it is SPV lifetime server hosting


[04-Oct-19 01:49 PM] Satoshi#3333
But again that literally would cost me about $10 a month at most


[04-Oct-19 01:49 PM] Satoshi#3333
and about ten minutes to setup (maybe longer to get synced fully)


[04-Oct-19 01:49 PM] Satoshi#3333
I have five SPV servers running for Denarius (D)


[04-Oct-19 01:49 PM] Satoshi#3333
We maintain them etc.


[04-Oct-19 01:49 PM] Satoshi#3333
and doesnt cost anything like that


[04-Oct-19 01:50 PM] Oszy#5734
Go do it and stop this nonsense here


[04-Oct-19 01:50 PM] Satoshi#3333
I just dont see the cost break down


[04-Oct-19 01:50 PM] Satoshi#3333
Why stop man? I have a valid point and this should be a uncensored community.


[04-Oct-19 01:50 PM] ca333#0333
We invested a huge sum into this technology and won't even break even after 100 listings - correct @Oszy

üëå 

[04-Oct-19 01:50 PM] Satoshi#3333
Why would you invest such a huge sum into?


[04-Oct-19 01:51 PM] Satoshi#3333
it*


[04-Oct-19 01:51 PM] Satoshi#3333
Regardless


[04-Oct-19 01:51 PM] Satoshi#3333
Why charge developers


[04-Oct-19 01:51 PM] Satoshi#3333
You will make money off fees


[04-Oct-19 01:51 PM] Satoshi#3333
you could do all sorts of things to create revenue


[04-Oct-19 01:51 PM] Satoshi#3333
Other than charging other developers to list their projects which are the entire backbone of your system technically


[04-Oct-19 01:51 PM] Satoshi#3333
Also


[04-Oct-19 01:52 PM] Satoshi#3333
I highly highly doubt anyone paid $7.5k to list Bitcoin


[04-Oct-19 01:52 PM] Satoshi#3333
or Litecoin


[04-Oct-19 01:52 PM] ca333#0333
For the sake of decentralization and interoperability - we can't host a infrastructure, pay support agents, pay admins and infrastructure experts to monitor and maintain the network without charging for certain services - that doesn't work out if you want to offer a A+ service.


[04-Oct-19 01:52 PM] ca333#0333
Thats why we provide the base layer - the DEX core - completely for free. Anyone can literally just clone/fork it and build a DEX GUI on top of it.


[04-Oct-19 01:53 PM] ca333#0333
So you see - atomicDEX mobile is just a enduser product built on top of the free/open-source base technology.


[04-Oct-19 01:54 PM] Satoshi#3333
Im just saying man, regardless of all the costs etc. why charge developers.


[04-Oct-19 01:54 PM] Satoshi#3333
You didnt charge Bitcoin or Litecoin


[04-Oct-19 01:55 PM] Satoshi#3333
Like there would be no DEX without us cryptos


[04-Oct-19 01:55 PM] Satoshi#3333
I just dont see the logic in it, I am sorry we disagree, I do hear you though ca333


[04-Oct-19 01:56 PM] Satoshi#3333
It does just really really sucks for us smaller cap cryptos that have been hard at work for the past two + years that dont get funding like that


[04-Oct-19 01:56 PM] Satoshi#3333
Just a big slap in the face


[04-Oct-19 01:58 PM] ca333#0333
Anyway - you expressed your point - i personally believe its invalid and the statements irrational - have a nice weekend! 

I conclude by saying that if you need any help using the DEX core plz feel free to contact me or our tech support at any time - we d be happy to support you with whatever needed to introduce you to the DEX layer - the mobile wallet is really just on the application layer and does NOT prevent you or any other project from using atomicDEX - i hope thats clear for you now. AtomicDEX is free, open-source and reflects our vision of interoperability & freedom.

It looks like Carsen want his coin listed for free, dont think it work so well with centralized exchanges either unless u have somthing valueable to exchange with them for a listing. Also it seems that 7500$ is alot but im sure they had a ico or he was a early miner of his own coin


[04-Oct-19 02:02 PM] Satoshi#3333
Yes I did, but you didnt answer me on the Bitcoin and Litcoin being listed for free


[04-Oct-19 02:02 PM] Satoshi#3333
@Oszy Will do


[04-Oct-19 02:02 PM] Satoshi#3333
I mean I dont mind a fee as a developer if it is within reason


[04-Oct-19 02:02 PM] Satoshi#3333
We listed on Cryptopia, $30k USD


[04-Oct-19 02:02 PM] Satoshi#3333
Before it was defunct


[04-Oct-19 02:02 PM] Satoshi#3333
We listed on CoinExchange


[04-Oct-19 02:03 PM] Satoshi#3333
TradeOgre, Unnamed, Altily, NovaExchange, SouthXchange, etc.


[04-Oct-19 02:03 PM] Satoshi#3333
We had to pay for most, but most were reasonable


[04-Oct-19 02:03 PM] Satoshi#3333
Something the community could come together with


[04-Oct-19 02:03 PM] Satoshi#3333
We didnt have any ICO

I ninja launched Denarius (D) in 6/14/2017


[04-Oct-19 02:04 PM] Markus#5464
paying 7.5k for atomicdex will probably be worth all those together since u dont have fixed pairs on atomicdex, u can trade whatever u want towards any other coin listed


[04-Oct-19 02:04 PM] Satoshi#3333
The premine was small and used for bounties and paying services like Coinomi to add us


[04-Oct-19 02:04 PM] Satoshi#3333
So no I dont have any funding currently and I havent for the past two years, nothing at all from this project


[04-Oct-19 02:04 PM] Satoshi#3333
Or we could not pay $7.5k and just make an app that rivals it and takes all your users haha


[04-Oct-19 02:05 PM] Markus#5464
dont forget that any dex using MM2 have shared liquidity pool so it would not make any sense

@Satoshi If you think that developing your own Dex application will be cheaper than 7.5k you are sadly mistaken


[04-Oct-19 02:34 PM] dudezmobi#1945
actually i dont understand the issue.  is it the 7.5k or why btc is listed? or is it an evolving issue creep?

He's free to build his own app on the atomicdex network and api. However, he can't expect Komodo to list them for free just because he feels so. There's a reason for the onboarding cost and annual maintenance fee of the atomicdex app.

most developers are not that good in business and management and communicating


[04-Oct-19 02:43 PM] ca333#0333
first of all its 6.5k not 7.5k - and to answer the question why BTC or LTC is listed - do you think Binance, Coinbase or ANY other exchange or service charged Bitcoin devs for listing "their" coin? The answer should answer the question. 

It is pretty much always the case that the initial listings on exchanges, wallets, crypto-services,... do orientate towards the market and likely include some of the top 10 - 20 market-cap coins since these have a huge community and userbase. The services do that in the hope to draw attention to their product since the initial userbase likely has BTC, LTC and other top cap coins.


[04-Oct-19 02:45 PM] ca333#0333
Anyway - lets move on. FYI - AtomicDEX mobile v0.2.1 is coming out this weekend and brings some nice improvements!

@ca333 You may want to relay to @PTYX that it is $6.5k and not $7.5k, as that is what I was told.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #103: \[OTH issues\] listing fee issue
Thanks @dudezmobi 

To sum it up.

Cost to a developer to list their cryptocurrency on the atomicDEX GUI = $6,500.00 USD

Funding paid to a developer to develop a real cryptocurrency without an ICO = $0 USD

Cost of setting up and maintaining an SPV electrumx server = Roughly $5-10 USD per month

Cost of setting up integration with atomicGUI with a cryptocurrency already operating on the underlying layer MM2 / jl777/COINS repo = Maybe a few hours if that of "work"

The price just ...

I believe that the app has been translated into Japanese already.
I have experienced one user (live) not be able to use Japanese.  There phone was set to Japanese.
Will investigate.
@dudezmobi where did you see the Japanese user request?

Thank you for the issue.
However, it is not a directly GUI issue and it seems that it's better to resolve it on protocol side (if there is easy solution for sure). From other side it's possible to add handler to GUI if it's hard to implement in API. 
Moving this one to relevant repo for evaluation (sorry in advance if it's duplicate)

for now you can completely disable pin in settings if it annoying

or enable unlocking by face/finger instead - biometrical unlocking usually much faster then type pin

I'm getting blackscreen after update. (galaxy note 9 international version with exynos).


[06-Oct-19 10:13 PM] Chipmoon#7477
reinstall should fix the issue @NewbieDriver


[07-Oct-19 01:23 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
With the android app, I frequently get a message at the bottom of the screen about not having an internet connection. Only thing I can do to fix it is close the app with the multitask button


[07-Oct-19 01:28 AM] smkhound#7640
switching between wifi and 3g/4g, changing vpn etc may cause this


[07-Oct-19 01:28 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
It seems to happen when I have not used my device for a while


[07-Oct-19 01:29 AM] smkhound#7640
could be phone going into a "sleep mode" and turning off connection to reserve battery?


[07-Oct-19 01:29 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
maybe, but it doesn't happen with any other app I use


[07-Oct-19 01:30 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Also, it seems orders that I had on the books have all disappeared from my order list now


[07-Oct-19 01:33 AM] smkhound#7640
whenplacing orders, there is a message on the confirm screen that advises to keep the app open. orders may be timing out after a period of no connectivity.


[07-Oct-19 01:35 AM] smkhound#7640
you can send logs via DM though so we can confirm and add to github issues. which phone? do you have battery saving apps installed?


[07-Oct-19 01:37 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I just had the same issue as newbiedriver above when updating the app as well

the latest update requires the old version to be uninstalled first


[07-Oct-19 01:39 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
These were orders that were on the books for a few days though. All my orders were there just a few minutes ago, and then all went away


[07-Oct-19 01:39 AM] smkhound#7640
also doesnt hurt to reboot between uninstall and installing new version


[07-Oct-19 01:40 AM] smkhound#7640
orderbook might take a while to propagate to device if connectivity has been interupted


[07-Oct-19 01:40 AM] smkhound#7640
can you see them on here ? https://www.oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/


[07-Oct-19 01:45 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
no


[07-Oct-19 01:45 AM] smkhound#7640
could be the update cleared them from attempting to kickstart from your cache


[07-Oct-19 01:50 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I did the update after my order book cleared


[07-Oct-19 01:51 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
They were there, I went to open a trade, which failed and then when I looked at the orders tab it was empty. Seems a lot of orders disappeared from the book actually, not just mine


[07-Oct-19 01:52 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546

After updating to version 0.2.1 from 0.2.0 the app only shows a black screen when opened. My device is a Pixel 2 XL running Android 10.

I've tried forcing the app closed and opening it again, as well as restarting the phone with no luck.

my understanding is you can't have pirate on a mobile/lite wallet because the shielded transactions require the full node

@BobZilla Please backup your seed phrase, uninstall the application, and re-install from the app store


[12-Oct-19 02:48 PM] Oszy#5734

Hello I have black screen issue after recent update,, sorry if it has been discussed already I just joined here

see above please üôÇ


[12-Oct-19 02:51 PM] Oszy#5734
a simple re-install should fix your issue, make sure you have your seed backed up, you will need to re-enter it during setup


[12-Oct-19 02:52 PM] BobZilla#8096
I will try an install,, sorry I am trying to find where it is discussed but a lot going on,, asking for logs and such but in my case it's ot running so that would not be possible


[12-Oct-19 02:54 PM] Oszy#5734
the automatic update process creates this "black screen" bug, always do a clean install when you can


[12-Oct-19 02:56 PM] BobZilla#8096
OK I will go install fresh and I'm sure it will fix it since you guys are aware of it,, and I will keep that in mind for next time.. Thanks for your help

App update should work fine without uninstalling on the next update (v. 0.2.2)


[12-Oct-19 02:58 PM] BobZilla#8096
No worries,, I will let it try but if I have a problem I know what to do now. I was going to try a re-instal anyway but I wanted to reach out to this community before I mucked things up further.

Thanks for the suggestions - push-notifications are certainly coming in the near future @cyrelb - 3) too - as for 2) not sure if that makes sense since cancelled orders didn't execute any swap/blockchain logic - it might also fill your history with irrelevant data.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #112:  french translation for "Select a coin" is too long and causes the input field for amount to be too small
If a french speaker reads "Choisissez devise", he can think that a word was forgotten: "Choisissez **la** devise". I'll propose another translation if I found one (I'm native french speaker).

I heard that some dictionaries to translate laws and papers at EC have translation with the same number of words and/or characters. The aim is to have to be at the same page number when you read a text in all languages. I don't know if it can help here.

How do you use the DEX exactly? As a trustless escrow if you want to do a transaction already agreed upon with a friend/a third party?


[19-Oct-19 01:32 AM] Tank-RLP#5496
There's no market discovery, chart, order book, limit/spot orders or anything like that. So as an exchange set to provide liquidity it isn't efficient as there's no visibility on the other side (buyers when you want to sell or sellers when you want to buy)


[19-Oct-19 01:36 AM] Tank-RLP#5496
I tried a small test: buy few hush with KMD but I had to go on CMC to evaluate the fair value for the pair first. Then my order is pending and I have no visibility about the other side (Hush sellers / market depth and liquidity) so even if i would like to adjust the price to the opposite side in order to buy on spot (market price) I have no idea how to do that


[19-Oct-19 01:36 AM] gcharang#6833
@Tank-RLP 
> There's no market discovery, chart, order book
there is, though
we have a p2p orderbook

it is just not displayed in the app yet


[19-Oct-19 01:37 AM] Tank-RLP#5496
then it would be better to just have a spot buy (atomic swap only) at market price at this stage on the app


[19-Oct-19 01:38 AM] gcharang#6833
> I had to go on CMC to evaluate the fair value for the pair first

when the orderbook is visible, this problem mostly goes away
you can also create a new order at the price you would like


[19-Oct-19 01:38 AM] Tank-RLP#5496
So it matches the opposite side whatever the pair and even if there's no visibility then it is still possible to use it


[19-Oct-19 01:40 AM] gcharang#6833
you can click on "create an order" and set a price you like

[19-Oct-19 01:40 AM] Tank-RLP#5496
Cuz if I cancel the order multiple times with different prices (blindly) until it matches, first I pay lot of tx fees and second I might overpay for the coin I want to buy

no txfees for placing/cancelling orders

Should be if it's a dex. it opens a smart contract so a tx. What you don't pay is comission until order is fullfilled

posting/cancelling order does not create the contract, it indicates you are ready to enter into one. until there is a counterparty, there is no contract that can be created


[19-Oct-19 01:44 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, it is a good design. having to pay to place/cancel orders makes it pretty bad

please see the above doc to understand how our atomic swap protocol works


[19-Oct-19 02:12 AM] Tank-RLP#5496
you sure there's no tx fee at the root of the request to avoid DDOS? On the app I have 2 fees associated when I want to initialize a transaction: a (small) transaction fees and a (bigger) trading fee


[19-Oct-19 02:12 AM] Tank-RLP#5496
By forcing a would-be attacker to spend real money, attacking the network becomes costly. Without this spam prevention, AtomicDEX could otherwise be attacked at the protocol level by any person performing a plethora of trade requests.


[19-Oct-19 02:12 AM] gcharang#6833
taker has two txn fee
when you are filling an existing order, you are a taker


[19-Oct-19 02:13 AM] gcharang#6833
> By forcing a would-be attacker to spend real money, attacking the network becomes costly.
this is what the first fee you are seeing as a taker is, called the "dexfee"


[19-Oct-19 02:14 AM] Tank-RLP#5496
both are only paid if there's a matching order?


[19-Oct-19 02:14 AM] gcharang#6833
yes


[19-Oct-19 02:14 AM] gcharang#6833
if you are creating an order yourself, you are a maker and don't pay any trading fee


[19-Oct-19 02:15 AM] gcharang#6833
once you see a taker paying the dexfee, you (the maker) send your coins to a intermediate address(p2sh/contract)


[19-Oct-19 02:16 AM] Tank-RLP#5496

it is automated
I'm just saying how the atomicDEX of maker behaves


[19-Oct-19 02:18 AM] Tank-RLP#5496
Ok. As I have no such maker/taker option on the app I was a bit confused

actually the app is a kind of multi wallet with a blind swap feature to me


[19-Oct-19 02:19 AM] gcharang#6833
if you use the button that says "create an order", you will become a maker

the dexfees are paid to holders of an asset named DEX

[19-Oct-19 02:20 AM] gcharang#6833
the app is meant for end users who will mostly be takers
to become a proper maker, you need to run the cli and we are also creating a bot for liquidity providers

@smkhound my test was to swap a few KMD for Hush but I see on the order book you shared there's no liquidity for it (no maker). So on the app user experience isn't great as it's total blindness. Had to came here to figure the whole thing

[19-Oct-19 02:30 AM] smkhound#7640
I've been working on integrating gravies API into my maker node for pricing - at the moment I only trade what is priceable via binance API. onceGravies API is integrated, I'll be able to add HUSH


[19-Oct-19 02:31 AM] Tank-RLP#5496
Ok sounds good


[19-Oct-19 02:33 AM] Tank-RLP#5496
Also involved in OTC, I think you could addup later on a contract creation for people to load a contract with a coin (say BTC for KMD), load it with his coin and share it to a counterparty for him to load it too so the contract get executed. kind of what trader.airswap.io is doing but for any coin instead of just ERC20


[19-Oct-19 02:37 AM] smkhound#7640
there are provisions for private OTC trades using the atomic swap tech, though at the moment I believe it requires CLI (i.e. no gui)


[19-Oct-19 02:40 AM] smkhound#7640
```Will direct private trading be possible with AtomicDEX through private needs created on private nodes (not created on AtomicDEX)?

AtomicAPI allows making custom trading networks by netid parameter changing, but some basic infrastructure (seed nodes) is needed.```

Don't know if this is a common issue, but my AtomicDex on Android just showed a black screen when I tried to open it. Had to reinstall and recover the wallet to get it working again.

You mean dICO in atomicdex? It's so cool. I can't wait to see.


[20-Oct-19 02:40 AM] ca333#0333
This is already fully supported @polycryptoblog @Chipmoon - you can launch your chain within minutes on Antara Composer and get the atomicDEX mobile listing feature. In the next step you d announce your dICO and put up your initial cap as a market offering on atomicDEX (mobile) - this would basically represent a dICO.


[20-Oct-19 02:41 AM] ca333#0333
We could add a explicit "dICO" option so that Antara Composer even covers the last step: i.e. setting up a atomicDEX (mm2) node as the dICO marketmaker and putting the initial cap on there - with a "dICO config" through a dICO webinterface: initial price, price increments over N days, early adopters bonus, accepted currencies, and so on....

Anyone else having an issue creating an AtomicDEX trade, in which the "amount to receive" field won't accept more than 7 digits?


[20-Oct-19 07:15 AM] runpaint#7773
So far I've only experienced it when I sold Doge and Qtum for COMMOD.  The issue wasn't present when I sold ETH, LTC, USDC, RVN, KMD, BAT, and VRSC for COMMOD.


[20-Oct-19 08:22 AM] allbits#5898
Recently, if I try to take the entire amount on order for a particular coin (actually VRSC) the swap does not match and fails at 0/3.  If I take slightly less than the full amount everything is fine. However this is only true for large amounts.  If there is a small amount on offer (like less than one VRSC) then I am able to take the full amount without problem

üëå 

[20-Oct-19 08:37 AM] runpaint#7773
I've found a workaround: if your order total is more than 7 digits, just create 10 orders which are each 1-tenth the size.  It worked.

Yes, every coin has different blocktimes and minconfs/notarization time. It is normal. A BTC swap can take even an hour depending on network speed.

 whether a swap is complete or not is known to only the maker and taker
it can also be found by analysing the involved blockchains

what the website here: `https://oracle.earth/mm2_orderbook/` shows is the orderbook
the orderbook is constructed by each marketmaker node locally based on the info they hear on the network
offers are only broadcasted by makers till they are unfulfilled

what kind of wallet does altomicdex use? can i generate my own seeds and pin numbers etc?

How to Restore Wallet from Your Seed Using AtomicDEX Mobile
1. Launch the AtomicDEX Mobile app.  2. Tap the "RESTORE" button.    3. Give a memorable name to...


[21-Oct-19 05:01 AM] gcharang#6833
@Gig this seed phrase will be valid in the other Komodo ecosystem wallets like: Verus Agama, Verus mobile, hyperDEX, chainswap etc.,
the same seed phrase may not produce the same address+privkey in other wallets

the best way to have access to your address from any wallet: cli, komodo ecosystem wallets, outside wallets is to backup the wif
wif - a string of characters that start with "U" for Komodo

you can convert a seed to wif in the Verus Agama wallet or the Komodo Ocean QT wallet
Verus Agama:<https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024495-export-private-key-wif-from-a-wallet-seed-or-pin-password>
Ocean QT: <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000030461-convert-your-seed-phrase-from-agama-into-a-private-key->

currently there is no way to login to atomicDEX/export with a wif, but it will come

as you probably know I am asking for those with tin-foil hats who may not trust you to delete the seed phrase from your servers

Will AtomicDEX be added to blockfolio or will blockfolio retrieve AtomicDEX pricing when selecting BarterDEX?


[21-Oct-19 08:31 AM] Jimm B.#9993
if one assumes that several DEX use MM2, would not it make sense to add MM2 to blockfolio?ü§î

barterdex is added to blockfolio

I assume atomicdex/MM2.0 volume/prices will be as well after a while when the necessary volume requirements are met and blockfolio can connect to the required API

I just tried to pull 3.99 ZEC off Polo and send to my Dex ....they said it was an invalid address??? I copied it right from Dex and verified all the digits. So now my ZEC is gone from my Polo wallet and Not in my Dex either. I went to ZCash block explorer and searched the address that my Dex provided me with ... the block explorer said ‚Äúsorry, can‚Äôt find that address ‚Äú Heeeeellp.

But as stated above - the addresses are valid, just diff. format: https://explorer.zcha.in/accounts/t1V3CMUxXJHWupN1QvQmk4bS1QvzBAjyUjb - micro test transaction is now visible.

@TonyLipsey we will update the wallet so it has the expected format with the `t1` prefix - although its already "valid" it likely won't be accepted by most TX engines as these validate an address differently. AtomicDEX decodes the address and manages to send the coins even if an ordinary address validator would return `false` (= invalid). Sorry for the inconvenience. Our internal tests didn't catch this one as the differently formatted address is technically/mathematically valid. I will let you know when the new version is out.


[21-Oct-19 01:37 PM] Oszy#5734
Until then, if anyone wants to withdraw to atomicDEX just put your address in explorer to see the matching `t` address

somone seems to be trying to start the stress test early. My maker node is being spammed with Rick/Morty trades...

[25-Oct-19 11:37 AM] cipi#4502
same here too... maybe someone is testing a bit before the real stress test begins
my prices are like this
```curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"setprice\",\"base\":\"RICK\",\"rel\":\"MORTY\",\"price\":2,\"volume\":1000}"
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"setprice\",\"base\":\"MORTY\",\"rel\":\"RICK\",\"price\":2,\"volume\":1000}"```
i think it is best to have the same price on all mm-nodes, that way the load will spread evenly across all mm-nodes

I'll switch back. A while ago I was asked to do 1:1 for people running out of coins.


[25-Oct-19 11:41 AM] smkhound#7640
could be because so many orders hitting a hand full of bobs, waiting for utxos to return for the next trade cause a cascade in the queue. Might also do some utxo splitting to mitigate.

@Optimus On what version you was when black screen occured last time? Have you try to restart the device?


[25-Oct-19 01:26 PM] Optimus#6435
@TonyL half an hour ago it was updated for the third time in a row - the two previous updates did not give the same result! It turns out that the fourth update from the current one back is the last working! When I start, I have a couple of seconds to see the DEX logo and immediately the black screen


[25-Oct-19 01:47 PM] TonyL#3577
@Optimus Hmm, sounds like you updated from old version. Do you have your seed phrase saved in a safe place? If yes - please try to uninstall application and install again

Please re-check your seed phrase (words spelling, spaces and etc)


[25-Oct-19 02:08 PM] allbits#5898
Also check your address on an explorer, and compare to address shown in atomicdex. If they're not the same you put the seed in wrong.


[25-Oct-19 02:09 PM] allbits#5898
And the explorer will confirm to you that the funds are still safely in address

[25-Oct-19 02:15 PM] TonyL#3577
Good thing (which might be bad for sure if you lose it) is that you control the funds as long as you control the seed - no matter what happens with applicaiton or even with Komodo project


[25-Oct-19 02:19 PM] Optimus#6435
@TonyL Still such a question, will it be charged for stacking qtum in a mobile wallet?


[25-Oct-19 02:21 PM] TonyL#3577
Atm there is no possibility to stake QTUM in atomicDEX


[25-Oct-19 02:22 PM] TonyL#3577
If I remember correct QTUM full node requiring for staking and atomicDEX mobile wallet working in light (SPV) mode


[25-Oct-19 02:27 PM] Optimus#6435
@TonyL  and to seek liquidity, how does binance do for their DEX when they keep it from 14 days for a fee? Or how will liquidity come at Komodo DEX? After all, you need to force users to keep funds there not only for instant exchange and withdrawal! perhaps the charge for retention motivates users and bring us liquidity, or are there other ways in the near future? And then our competitors are not sleeping - the same DEX bnb can make atomic permutations in addition to the rest and will select most of the users!


[25-Oct-19 02:29 PM] Optimus#6435
binance however recently added such a QTUM reward option without a full client-side node as it used to be the only option for PoS


[25-Oct-19 02:31 PM] TonyL#3577
I'm not fully aware but I think Binance staking QTUM centralized way (what rasing question about user funds possession matter and decentralization and etc)


[25-Oct-19 02:32 PM] TonyL#3577
For liquidty our team developing easy to use marketmaker software and elso there are negotiations with potential huge liquidity providers (but first step is easy to use software)


[25-Oct-19 02:34 PM] TonyL#3577
` After all, you need to force users to keep funds there not only for instant exchange and withdrawal!` it's a wallet with DEX functionality - you can use it for funds sending/receiving, KMD rewards claiming. And also you can trade funds decentralized way. Not sure why insta withdrawal somewhere is the case

@dudezmobi transaction fee is just 0.0001 so it's more than enough for 30 trades (when you sell RICK for MORTY you can sell back MORTY for RICK)

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #113 REL amount incorrect in orderbook after deleting decimals of already selected BASE coin when creating new order
How to Replicate:

Select any coin to trade (base) that has decimals in the amount you have, put max volume

Select the coin you want to receive (rel) , don't select from orderbook, but press create order, enter any amount

Now go back and delete the decimals of the base coin and press Trade

Order will be pushed to the orderbook with an insanely large or a much smaller number for the REL coin that you did set. 

Example: 
BASE: 59.9216431 
HUSH REL:  1 BTC 
go ahead and delete ....

`So when I have an open order and it gets filled if I don‚Äôt have the app open it fails?`  @MorganJekyll 
On android, the app can run in the background to complete the swap. Depends on your phone's power saving settings (wifi/4g keep alive while screen is off), background data usage settings etc etc ) 
On iOS you have to have the app open and the screen on at all times until the swap is finished. 

If the app is closed, or screen is locked, or network connection terminated, and the swap has already started (fee was sent), you can open the app again in a few minutes, to kickstart the swap before it fails (timeouts). If this does not happen, it will fail, and refund will be given in 4 hours.

@Bernardo94 delete the application and reinstall it as previously advised - that will resolve the "black screen issue" and also prevent it from reoccurring in the future. FYI This is a backwards compatibility problem caused when you have not done a clean install after upgrading from a pre 0.2.1 to a > 0.2.1 version. 

@ubhillutd contact our support team - they can guide you through the process of manually installing the old version (downgrading) and keeping the application data to hopefully extract your old seed. PLEASE back your seed up the next time as advised in the account setup.

I've contacted support. Will do. Sorry for the inconvenience. You guys rock!

I think it should stay closed source until the team recovers the funds they invested in making it.


[28-Oct-19 04:49 AM] PTYX#6840
Once you open source it, forget revenue.


[28-Oct-19 04:51 AM] PTYX#6840
Dexfees aren't significant enough to give it away for free. At least not with the current volume. Licensing is the way to go.

@Acura as a dex holder you get revenue from anyone using the dex


[28-Oct-19 05:32 AM] PTYX#6840
Komodo being able to license their premium software doesn't affect you, in fact it benefits you. Without funds development would stall and there would be no incentive for users to use the DEX and hence, no dexfees for dex hodlers.


[28-Oct-19 05:32 AM] PTYX#6840
I'm confused why people think that free equals good. It's almost the opposite without a proper business model.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #6: feature requests
Failed swaps already displaying on the trades history page with "Refund" button in case when auto-refund failed by some reason. So unlikely displaying of failed swaps in one more place will stop the user from actions which deletes data about user swaps such as app uninstalling.

However it's good idea to add push notification about failed swaps with further recommendation as soon as push notifications feature will be implemented in general.

Whenever I open up a wallet in the portfolio and click receive I get the same wallet address. Am I missing something? Because this is insecure. The correct way to do it is to generate a new receive address every time.

I would assume that either I am not looking in the right spot for the setting, this is an over site on Komodo‚Äôs part, or there is a technical limitation as to why they chose not to correctly implement this.

You should get infinite. And you should always throw away an address after you spend from it

Ie. it is typically insecure to send coins to an address that you have already spent from

The other issue is that it leaks a little bit of data that would make that specific unlock hash more susceptible to a quantum attack.

And it is seemingly a simple ui issue. Granted there may be underlying issues as to why Komodo did this. If so, that should be explained in the ui


[29-Oct-19 08:00 PM] Regnar#6164
all those addresses, if it generated new one's each time, would be based on the same seed, just a different derivation path. Even a Hardware wallet (like Ledger, or Trezor) does this. It's all the same seed.


[29-Oct-19 08:00 PM] Deleted User#0000
@Regnar Yes, that is the proper way to do it


[29-Oct-19 08:01 PM] Regnar#6164
No. What I'm saying is there is no security benefit to doing that.

@PTYX That is not how it will be used though.


[29-Oct-19 08:04 PM] PTYX#6840
If you generate a new addrwss for each transaction you would need to move those funds to the new address which costs transaction fees. Therefore not practical.

So workflow: Send BTC to AtomicDex wallet, trade, retrieve BTC from AtomicDex. Now you would need to delete the wallet and create a new one?


[29-Oct-19 08:07 PM] Deleted User#0000
Before sending BTC back to AtomicDex?


[29-Oct-19 08:07 PM] PTYX#6840
If you didn't want to use the same trading address then yes, you create a new "profile"


[29-Oct-19 08:08 PM] PTYX#6840
The purpose of the dex is to facilitate P2P trading. Creating change addresses for each transaction seems irrelevant to that end.


[29-Oct-19 08:08 PM] PTYX#6840
Sure, change addresses improve pseudoanonimity but you can withdraw to an unused btc address and accomplish the same thing since the transactions can be traced back to the origin regardless


[29-Oct-19 08:09 PM] Deleted User#0000
Fair enough. Seems very clunky. Like there should be a refresh address/wallet button or something.

Possibly it would cater to users like you but that's not the majority


[29-Oct-19 08:10 PM] PTYX#6840
90% is users don't want to pay fees to create new change addresses.

Yes. I get that. It **is** the difference between being able to use AtomicDex as a wallet and using it as just a quick dip exchange. Since it looks like a wallet and is being promoted as a wallet it seems odd that a key wallet feature (that really should be enabled by default if someone is going to use this as a wallet) would be missing.


[29-Oct-19 08:15 PM] Deleted User#0000
Still the best exchange out there, but it is concerning to me that new addresses are not implemented when it is pretty obvious that people will use this as their main wallet


[29-Oct-19 08:15 PM] PTYX#6840
Does coinomi and testwallet create change addresses?

Generating a new address when you click receive and implementing change addresses is **not** the same

I heard coinomi is really secure - lol


[29-Oct-19 08:17 PM] PTYX#6840
If you've only used native wallets then this seems like a personal preference. Most lite wallets offer one address per seed for ease of use.


[29-Oct-19 08:18 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I suppose you could create multiple seeds

But atomicdex is in beta phase and right now focus lies on DEX protocol and improving the DEX core layer and multi-protocol support. And towards end of the beta program the team will certainly look into Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet capability with the desired BIP32 key derivation logic.

That is good to hear. I was even wondering if it had something to do with atomic trades and not splitting utxos. Like I said, it is not obvious why this was missing or if I was simply not looking in the right spot and there is currently no public documentation to find out.

It's not economic


[29-Oct-19 08:22 PM] PTYX#6840
Think about it, if you have 1 btc and make a trade for 0.1, now you have to move the rest to a change address


[29-Oct-19 08:22 PM] PTYX#6840
That takes more transaction fees unless you trade the full amount and the change lands on the new address.


[29-Oct-19 08:25 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Couldn't the transaction still be traced to the other address?

[29-Oct-19 08:29 PM] Deleted User#0000
@PTYX So are you saying that the transaction fees are cheaper if you do send to the current unlock hash? I don‚Äôt see how that would make a difference


[29-Oct-19 08:32 PM] Deleted User#0000
Wouldn‚Äôt you just have a pool of unlock hashes that you could spend from in your wallet and create a multi-tx spend with a targeted unlock hash (to whom you‚Äôre trading with) and then the left overs are sent to your new unlock hash?


[29-Oct-19 08:34 PM] Deleted User#0000
That should not cost any more than creating a singleton-tx spend with a targeted unlock hast (to whom you‚Äôre trading with) and then sending the leftovers back to your current unlock hash.


[29-Oct-19 08:36 PM] Deleted User#0000
Maybe you are forgetting that you always need to move the left overs to a specified unlock hash no mater what, even if it is going back to the same unlock hash.


[29-Oct-19 08:38 PM] PTYX#6840
If you have multiple utxos in the address that becomes more difficult. Your explanation seems overly complex compared to the current logic.


[29-Oct-19 08:39 PM] PTYX#6840
I don't think changing the logic of the atomicdex is high priority at the moment.


[29-Oct-19 08:39 PM] PTYX#6840

Maybe there is something with the atomic swap timelocks that do not play nicely with multi-tx transactions though? If so, it would be interesting to know that this is a technical limitation and not a ui limitation.


[29-Oct-19 08:46 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
I'm sure the "hand shake" would have to know more information than that already exist taking more time to verify the swap from the p2sh timelock address(es)+(es) - kinda like pole vaulting over mouse turds

it is a false sense of privacy, to use different change addresses. the only valid reason is much better resistance against quantum computers. the downside is that it would become UNUSABLE in lite mode due to the overhead of having to query all the addresses. so given the tradeoff off being unusable vs. subject to attack from QC, the choice was obvious. If you want actual privacy, use PIRATE. another benefit of reusing addresses is that over time reputations can be established

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #115 Sending coin amounts larger than five figures causes atomicdex to erase typing
Sending any coin from atomicdex that are over five figures causes software to erase typing and forces to only send amounts of 4 figures at most.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #115: Sending coin amounts larger than five figures causes atomicdex to erase typing
confirming, anything larger than 9999 gets deleted from the text box

using max amount and deleting off numbers doesn't help either as "X" deletes full amount not just lat digit

any coin

`I gota lot of timeout status on trade that I picked from the orderbook when it showed inprogress of 2/3 matched previously`
From telegram, should they send logs?


[30-Oct-19 10:18 AM] Acura#2748
It would be good if a hint appears in the trade window during a swap that says you shouldn't lock the screen and disconnect the internet connection - helpful for iPhone users. 
Some users don't know that.

Looks similar to this one: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX/issues/2
Investigating


[30-Oct-19 10:23 AM] Mark81#4505
Also one note when picking coins to trade on dex window. If you have set amount for specific base pair and choose another base pair then earlier choosed amount goes to new pair also. I think for safety it would be wise to reset amounts to zero always when changing base pair.

@here I've done some work on a leaderboard to track the best swappers during the stress test :)
There is the option to register your Discord username to an address. If you'd like to do so, please DM me the details - you'll also need to confirm address ownership via a small RICK Morty transaction to my address (which will be returned with a bonus). 
For the privacy conscious, if you want to register your Discord name, but redact the address, this can also be arranged üïµüèΩ 
Sneak preview below - link to leaderboard will be made public once active shortly before stress test begins üèÅ

[30-Oct-19 12:39 PM] smkhound#7640
you can do it if you want, but if it kills your stats it'll be visible. find the fastest swap rate with a good success rate would be commendable. Setting a bot to try and swap every 0.01  seconds is "excessive", just be reasonable. This is trying to test mobile swaps too, and spambots are obviously potentially a bit more viscious.

Hey. Are there Russian speakers here?


[30-Oct-19 02:40 PM] TS#6934
I was told to update the wallet to version 0 2 5. deleted, installed a new one, entered the saved SEED. It took 2 times to enter the password and 2 times to enter the PIN code. There are no test coins and transaction history inside. black screen. I don‚Äôt remember the name of the old wallet. It was required to give a name.


[30-Oct-19 02:44 PM] Oszy#5734
Name of the old wallet doesn't matter, only your `seed` is important. 
with reinstalling the app tx history will be always wiped. 
if you can't see your coins, double check the `seed` for typos, added extra spaces, and see if the R address is the same as before.


[30-Oct-19 02:46 PM] Oszy#5734
if the screen is still black after uninstalling from the phone, and reinstalling the app from the app store, please let us know, so we can investigate further.


[30-Oct-19 02:46 PM] Oszy#5734
android or ios by the way?


[30-Oct-19 02:47 PM] Oszy#5734
@TonyL you might be able to help him in russian?


[30-Oct-19 02:51 PM] TS#6934
android screen is black. There are no test coins on the balance. The SEED has been recorded and verified several times. I turned on the function of visual verification of the phrase at the input, that's right. Also opened the phrase in the wallet, there is no error. I was asked to enter the password twice after entering the phrase, should it be?


[30-Oct-19 02:52 PM] Oszy#5734
yes. twice to confirm they are the same.


[30-Oct-19 02:53 PM] Oszy#5734
cross question, if the screen is black, how can you tell there are no test coins in your wallet


[30-Oct-19 02:58 PM] TS#6934
I also had two unconfirmed orders, they are not there either. only btc and kmd with zero balance


[30-Oct-19 02:59 PM] Oszy#5734
if you reinstall those will be wiped as they are stored locally.


[30-Oct-19 02:59 PM] Oszy#5734
activate the other coins with the + sign


[30-Oct-19 03:01 PM] TS#6934
and get through the tap again? I activated, balance zero


[30-Oct-19 03:03 PM] Oszy#5734
I don't really understand. Is some coin balance missing?  which coin? how much is missing? what was the balance before you reinstalled?


[30-Oct-19 03:05 PM] TS#6934
I made several transactions between test coins. I had about 6.7, equal in quantity. Does the screen remain black? I also want to pay attention, when creating an order, the button for setting the number of coins is very small, you can‚Äôt see the numbers.

Just a note: I think we need faster transaction. I very like the atomicdex, but this speed is very slow... we need 1-2sec transaction speed, if possible....

Btw it is really not that fast as I expected


[31-Oct-19 01:34 AM] Chipmoon#7477
@ronyi the speed is depending on the blockchain speed, although if the speed can be reduced to 1-2 sec (maybe somebody can solve the problem, ex: btc is using lightning network ). It would be no need for CEX

i had the same reaction at first. important to remember that the trade (i think) is completed quickly, but the settlement depends on the speed of the chain you are swapping with


[31-Oct-19 01:38 AM] Dr.Crypto#8986
One thing that this DEX needs is price in usd

Can be little confusing for people who are not used


[31-Oct-19 01:41 AM] Gig#0273
i dont think so (but it should). devs are improving orderbooks iirc


[31-Oct-19 01:41 AM] ronyi#5719
@Chipmoon I know,  but this speed is not fast enough. Example: 4dc8ac47-fa7e-438d-8538-e255ca9bc264 this swap id is more than 15min in stage 1.... If we have 1m tx in 1min however imaginable...


[31-Oct-19 01:42 AM] Dr.Crypto#8986
When you trade it should say in a small box what those tokens you are trading are worth in usd, so people don‚Äôt accidentally sell a lot of tokens for very little


[31-Oct-19 01:43 AM] Dr.Crypto#8986

Thank you so much for all you efforts.  It's awesome! üöÄ

No doubt you are going to be even busier than usual in the next couple of days and especially over the next few hours. Please know that there are many who are very grateful.

Your hard work will benefit more people than you probably realize, most of whom have not yet heard of AtomicDEX.

Much respect üôá

Have a great stress test!

the problem with 1 to 2 seconds per trade, is that it will quickly saturate any blockchain that is being actively traded that way. remember blockchain space is a finite resource and each swap is doing the equivalent of exchange deposit, trade, exchange withdraw. compare the times on that basis and atomicDEX is very fast


[31-Oct-19 01:47 AM] jl777c#5810
if you want 1 to 2 second trades of imaginary crypto tokens that is on the CEX, then that is ok too. however, if you want to be actually trading the real crypto, you are limited by the blockchain speed and capacity

this is why i am advocating the multichain approach to solving scaling, so we can have million tx/sec, but that creates another problem of terabytes of data that needs to be synced. i solve that scenario by the dual-daemon using codaprototol https://medium.com/@jameslee777/dual-daemon-chains-to-integrate-non-bitcoin-protocols-6d5b1b1f221

That is true, I have had to wait up to 3 hours after depositing to Binance. However it took  1 sec to receive coins in my AtomicDEX


[31-Oct-19 01:52 AM] jl777c#5810
fundamentally an atomic swap is a trustless tx on two blockchains, as opposed to a CEX that is a DB entry for funds that have been deposited that has to be withdrawn. Most of the CEX now require burdensome privacy invasion to withdraw your coins. if that is ok, then you can pretend to be trading the coins in 1 to 2 seconds and trust that you will be able to withdraw your coins.


[31-Oct-19 01:53 AM] jl777c#5810
From a maker point of view, trades takes a lot longer than a few seconds, even on CEX as they have to wait for someone to take their offer.


[31-Oct-19 01:55 AM] jl777c#5810
maybe having the trades taking more than a few seconds will lead to less panic based trades and more thoughtful trades? it would be fantastic if we can get the speed with all the other benefits, but without removing the blockchain throughput bottleneck and then the data storage/sync bottleneck, it seems we are stuck with the relatively slow atomic swaps.


[31-Oct-19 01:58 AM] Artist#0765
Anyways dex on mobile is an initiative I am sure with development effort it will improve by time


[31-Oct-19 02:00 AM] jl777c#5810
once there are plenty of offers on the orderbook, the ordermatch should happen in most all cases and with 95%+ completion rate, in most cases, once matched, the trade will complete

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #112:  french translation for "Select a coin" is too long and causes the input field for amount to be too small
Similar issue with russian translation.
While it's just fine with at least 1080p screen resolution, on smaller screens(and so older devices) "MAX" button is too big, so it shrinks input field.

User-submitted screenshot:

It should be sufficient to change "–ú–ê–ö–°–ò–ú–£–ú" to simply "–ú–ê–ö–°" or even just keep it "MAX" as in english.

is the faucet empty? Entered my addy in both Rick and Morty like 10 mins ago but nothing shows up, not in app/explorer


[31-Oct-19 04:10 AM] moneystacks#7758
Worked for me 15 minutes ago

[31-Oct-19 04:11 AM] CrisF#3405
It was mentioned above that someone was spamming the faucet.


[31-Oct-19 04:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
as I typed it, it shows up


[31-Oct-19 04:11 AM] Cryptoon#3362
looks like there is some backlog on payouts or so üòÑ

if you can't get RICK/MORTY from the faucets just post your address and we will send you some


[31-Oct-19 04:14 AM] RNI#2666

QUESTION: We get 1 ticket for 1 swap. Do we also get 1 ticket if somebody fills an order we place?


[31-Oct-19 04:23 AM] Gig#0273
does it count as my swap for placing the order or their swap for filling it? Or do we both get a ticket?

Morty <> rick trade stuck at 2/3 which is the morty part of the trade I think for about 15 minutes ish

I can't swap more RICK than 7.76679099 right? Every time I fill in a bigger number, I get this number.


[31-Oct-19 04:26 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@Farl don't forget about tx fees.


[31-Oct-19 04:27 AM] Gig#0273
@Farl why would u want to swap it all anyway?


[31-Oct-19 04:27 AM] Cryptoon#3362
accumulate more morty


[31-Oct-19 04:28 AM] Farl#9964
Ooh I am confused about the dot and comma. I only have 7.777 RICK, which is not 7777 RICK right?


[31-Oct-19 04:28 AM] Gig#0273
there's that bug with the MAX button which shows a crazy high number


[31-Oct-19 04:28 AM] Gig#0273
i have 679099 RICK, except i dont

max shows 7.76 etc


[31-Oct-19 04:29 AM] Gig#0273

hi there, i followed all he steps and got 7.777 Morty but the Rick didn't come through


[31-Oct-19 04:39 AM] vanity33#9778
though the transaction was completed


[31-Oct-19 04:39 AM] Gig#0273
i had to try RICK twice


[31-Oct-19 04:39 AM] Yaconx#4625
I‚Äôve tried multiple times over the last two hours I‚Äôve had enough but I‚Äôll try again although it is extremely frustrating

Maybe you can help find a bug.

I cant seem to get RICK faucet to send.  it says it send but never shows up and when I go to check the explore there is a cert error that wont let me visit.


[31-Oct-19 04:43 AM] Yaconx#4625
Ok finally I‚Äôve got some Rick although it says unconfirmed so should I wait some more before starting swap

Hi @Hooftly , there are some messages above about it.

Same for me, restart of phone after changing settins (vpn) worked. trade going through now @Sir Seven


[31-Oct-19 04:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Another pro-tip, disable auto sleep mode on phone, so your phone doesnt lock up after not touching it for 10 sec or whatever

Morty just dissapeared

[31-Oct-19 04:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Not both


[31-Oct-19 04:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
When restarting the other one shows


[31-Oct-19 04:57 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Problem with connection on my side?


[31-Oct-19 04:57 AM] Gig#0273
i suspect KMD nodes overloaded


[31-Oct-19 04:57 AM] vanity33#9778
that could be my problem also as i can see the correct Rick balance

it's fillig up only 1:1 orders to me


[31-Oct-19 04:58 AM] Sir Seven#7158

it shows 0 Morty


[31-Oct-19 04:58 AM] Cryptoon#3362

Do I have to stay on the confirmation page until 3/3 steps are completed?

HINT: cancel your non-matched orders and try to swap against the orders with a big volume (one has 1000 and the other one a five figure RICK/MORTY amount) - this will release DEX network resources


[31-Oct-19 05:19 AM] wookie#7663

Creating new order for each swap is that ok????


[31-Oct-19 05:19 AM] smkhound#7640
you can only trade as many as you have utxos availble for. so if you only have one utxo, one trade until the unspent tx outputs return in next block


[31-Oct-19 05:19 AM] Cryptoon#3362
414 orders in the books


[31-Oct-19 05:19 AM] ca333#0333
there are MANY hundred orders ongoing - and the orders that are open in a maker-mode (the ones with the cancel button) are preventing most of you to swap


[31-Oct-19 05:19 AM] wookie#7663

you do need to stay in the app


[31-Oct-19 05:21 AM] smkhound#7640
leave app open is best. if you plug into charger, mine stays opne

you can go to other screen but dont close app

Creating new order for each swap is that ok?

@wookie `Do I need to stay on the confirmations screen to wait until 3/3 steps are completed?`
On iOS - yes, on Android you can swap freely in background.


[31-Oct-19 05:22 AM] ronyi#5719
Nothing happening, i canceled my open orders... created new, but step 0/3... so in my side is useless...

be patient, there is a flood as we begin and the script spammers try things. it should level out


[31-Oct-19 05:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
0/3 just means you are waiting to match

it is possible script spammers are trying to connect to all orders preventing you to connect, it will level out

[31-Oct-19 05:25 AM] smkhound#7640
@Dirty Moe the number of simultaneous swaps you can do it limiterd by the number of utxcos in your wallet. So creating too many all at once is kind of pointless and will likely lead to some fails


[31-Oct-19 05:26 AM] vanity33#9778
not even one swap so far

@Dirty Moe If you've just got funds from faucet - single one.


[31-Oct-19 05:27 AM] smkhound#7640
if you recieved all your funds in one transaction, one.


[31-Oct-19 05:27 AM] Dirty Moe#2091

[31-Oct-19 05:28 AM] smkhound#7640
you can make more utxos by sending yourself part of your funds


[31-Oct-19 05:28 AM] Dirty Moe#2091
i have 16k of each üôÉ


[31-Oct-19 05:28 AM] Farl#9964
16


[31-Oct-19 05:28 AM] smkhound#7640
but then your utxos might be too small, and will recombine on next trade


[31-Oct-19 05:28 AM] Dirty Moe#2091
oh thats right! i remember how it works now,


[31-Oct-19 05:29 AM] smkhound#7640
personally I think having more than 3 open orders on a single trade pair is a bit silly


[31-Oct-19 05:29 AM] dudezmobi#1945
In the real.world.you wont use dex like that @Dirty Moe


[31-Oct-19 05:29 AM] dudezmobi#1945
Yeah


[31-Oct-19 05:29 AM] Dirty Moe#2091
but if im making small trades they should be fine right because each utxo is 7.7 right?


[31-Oct-19 05:29 AM] Dirty Moe#2091
i was trading earlier today and it seemed to be working


[31-Oct-19 05:29 AM] smkhound#7640
yeah, as long as the person on the other side of your trade has available utxos


[31-Oct-19 05:29 AM] Dirty Moe#2091
sorry if i am painful, im a bit of a noob with this stuff


[31-Oct-19 05:29 AM] Dirty Moe#2091

gonna try some kmd swapsssss


[31-Oct-19 05:32 AM] smkhound#7640
in theory, but reality != theory. I wouldnt make 1 order per utxo. remember there are steps to the swap including fee transaction etc. So better to not spam too hard if you dont want to fail or wait for confirmations to the point it timesout


[31-Oct-19 05:32 AM] aume27Rrpmp.nft#2727
It not even matching

i do remember that and i found it difficult to use when we had the test with pizza


[31-Oct-19 05:37 AM] smkhound#7640
this doesnt, though I still think if you are waiting for unspent to return it will take longer and you may timeout. could be wrong though, the devs are pretty magic.

I've been told there is some voodoo with Electrum which allows less wait time for unconfirmed utxos to be made avaible for spend. Might be the electrums are a little warm at the moment with the flood tho üòÑ

I cancelled them,


[31-Oct-19 05:56 AM] ca333#0333
IF an order matches it matches - if not it will be automagically transformed into a maker-order and broadcasted across the network - this is why you re seeing hundreds of orders and also why you re not able to match @co2


[31-Oct-19 05:56 AM] Hooftly#1337
interesting


[31-Oct-19 05:56 AM] co2#1244
Well few days ago Ihad no problem like that


[31-Oct-19 05:56 AM] ca333#0333
as soon as you see the cancel button @Hooftly - i.e. give it 5 - 10 seconds to match and then check its status in the orders tab


[31-Oct-19 05:57 AM] RNI#2666
had 31k rick .. closed the app .. now i have 7.77

[31-Oct-19 05:57 AM] wsh_virgine#7054

[31-Oct-19 05:58 AM] ca333#0333
we could have deactivated the maker-mode and let this look like a perfect swapping experience which would not have helped us to improve the network protocol and DEX technology - since we are targeting to cover millions of simult. users we really needed to do it this way - with minimal DEX infrastructure and highest load possible

ok thats great it's going as expected for you guys but what about users who are unable to complete thirty swaps in the allotted time frame kind of unfair to put 4 hours in worth of effort to not be able to complete a single trade


[31-Oct-19 05:58 AM] ca333#0333
yes @wsh_virgine - cancel all pending orders if there is a cancel button

Hi @Hooftly, woul;d be nice to win a prize.  I could use the cash.
Even so I'll get more benefit out of the stats that this test collects.  The dex is a valuable tool.

[31-Oct-19 06:10 AM] Hooftly#1337
yeah but its unfair to offer a prize than only a few users are able to attain.  Just saying 30 trades might not have been the best determining factor for entry considering the beta state of the software @CrisF

the important thing is not to do 30 exchanges, the important thing is to saturate atomicdex so that the devs can check for errors

[31-Oct-19 06:12 AM] Dirty Moe#2091
I was keen for the prize but also thought it'd be a bit of fun to see how many transactions i could do! I'm personally not too bothered that its not working as it is a stress test


[31-Oct-19 06:12 AM] ubhillutd#3274
@dudezmobi will have to disagree with u on that mate. Some of us were here for the first stress test. There were no rewards then.

People please stop crying...this stress test helps devs to improve dex...so what have you expected??? This is the first ever big stress test for a new technology....its normal that not all work perfect...so stop crying and try to swap again and again so team can collect data to customizing and improve

it's nice to help great even but if you're going to offer a prize to users to participate all the users should be able to participate just saying it's about principles not about the prize

@ca333 if only taker order count,  no body want to be maker so all trade will not match except the one again official makers. hard to find makers in this orderbook of people trying to be takers


[31-Oct-19 06:34 AM] aume27Rrpmp.nft#2727
because people cancel as soon as they see cancel button meaning they are makers

What happens if few ppl took the same trade (from the same marketmaker)? The first person will got matched, i suppose?

If an order doesn't match check its status after 20 - 30 seconds and cancel it - try to do one swap at a time. Once matched you can start another one.

might help to target your swap with orderbook listings with higher max volume. I see a lot of small volume offers, which may be cancelled by people waiting to trade and trying again. larger volume also means more than one might match


[31-Oct-19 07:01 AM] CrisF#3405
The BarterDEX 48 hour test was a marathon.  I finally got 1 swap right near the end.

@aume27Rrpmp.nft if matched quickly to a selected orderbook entry, probably taker. if taker, address should show up on leaderboard.

someone has 7 now ;/


[31-Oct-19 07:26 AM] smkhound#7640
if swapping rick - morty, you;d be a maker on one and a taker on the other so either way you should register a swap


[31-Oct-19 07:26 AM] smkhound#7640
you can see in logs too, but its a bit more work

I dont think it's a bottleneck. I think the orderbook goes in and out too much. I can see it go from like 148 orders available to like 8 and back and forth


[31-Oct-19 07:43 AM] vanity33#9778

got one completed as failed so thats progress too


[31-Oct-19 07:48 AM] Yaconx#4625
Obviously the 777 reward goes to no one I can‚Äôt get one trade let alone 30. I hope this exercise was worth it for the network because I‚Äôve made a lot of effort for very little made a ton of orders for not one to get past 0 step of 3

So so sorry people ü§¶üèΩ Just noticed that some pubkey transaltion code I was using did not return the expected address. I've change code so it gets address directly without changing from pubkey.
Leaderboards have been updated with fix. Those who could not see their order count earlier please let me know if it is visible now

With stress test also your geological positioning matters. More closer you are servers that host matchmaking then better you are.

@Farl haha yeah exactly same. its weird since i was testing out swaps earlier before the test and they were fairly smooth for the most part. multiple successful swaps. but once the test started i've yet to have one pass the 0/3 lol

I go one by one, pick big volume orders, use 0.05 rick order size and leave a minute pass before leaving the trade screen and check if i can cancel. 
I got to swap successful

[31-Oct-19 08:45 AM] TonyL#3577
@Jaki 0/3 means that order not matching. There is a problem with ordermatching because of the stress on the DEX network this stress-test producing


[31-Oct-19 08:45 AM] Patrick Friggens#2418
what happened? Suddenly 4 out 5 orders in my list go to 1/3 order matched.

[31-Oct-19 08:59 AM] Cryptoon#3362
so check your adress in the explorer to see if your balances is confirmed on the blockchain


[31-Oct-19 09:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I was able to enter trades sometimes nonetheless even though balance wasnt really there, so maybe some are trying to connect with people trying to trade with unconfirmed balances. And that should not be possible offcourse!


[31-Oct-19 09:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So only logical your trades dont work in that case


[31-Oct-19 09:00 AM] Cryptoon#3362
You dont want to end up trading 10 BTC for whatever amount of kmd if one of both balances is not confirmed...


[31-Oct-19 09:02 AM] Cryptoon#3362
So my new gameplan:
1) check if balances are confirmed
2) try trading, put in order that matches the books
3) if trade not matches within 30 secs, remove trade: you are probably trying to match with someone with unconfirmed balance
4) rince and repeat

[31-Oct-19 09:33 AM] Goku#9007
I created a order for 0.04ltc against 320dgb
Can someone take my offer?

Spamming 1 sell order with 30 buyers isn't working very well


[31-Oct-19 09:34 AM] Farl#9964
I created a bunch of new orders 1:1 with 1 MORTY and 1 RICK, go fill them!

Besides the backend stuff my general impression is nice and easy to understand UI. Portfolio tab super easy to read balances. Dex tab for trading 6 simple steps to drop a market maker option -although, if there are a ton of maker options already , 1st time user might not realize to scroll all the way.- on Android S9+

anyone missing swap counts, send me logs once test complete. worst case we will review manually, and I will announce once stats site has verified counts


[31-Oct-19 09:49 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
For me the android app has many bugs and issues, the cli is more reliable.

So did anyone reach 30 swaps?


[31-Oct-19 09:51 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
One point for the android app, is that I can actually take orders(normally, not today) whereas on the cli I can only make, I can never get the cli to match an order


[31-Oct-19 09:51 AM] tese#3502
I still dont know how many Ive achieved but its possible


[31-Oct-19 09:51 AM] smkhound#7640
not that I am aware of, but dont think getting 30 in is the only way to win a prize


[31-Oct-19 09:51 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
But I need to constantly close the app with the multitask button to get anything to work


[31-Oct-19 09:52 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@Patrick Crypto Hm. It's not as easy as 2-click in app, yet had no problems matching as taker with cli.


[31-Oct-19 09:52 AM] PeLe | $ARRR#1096
Wasn't asking due to prize.. Was just honestly curious


[31-Oct-19 09:52 AM] Gig#0273
no i dont think anybody did


[31-Oct-19 09:52 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
@Sir Seven I've made about 30 swaps with the cli, but any order I place never matches it always just becomes a taker(fine by me)


[31-Oct-19 09:53 AM] Gig#0273
whoa


[31-Oct-19 09:53 AM] Gig#0273
CLI?


[31-Oct-19 09:53 AM] Gig#0273
is that permitted?


[31-Oct-19 09:53 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
Not during the test


[31-Oct-19 09:53 AM] Farl#9964

[31-Oct-19 09:53 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@Gig Not right now, in general.


[31-Oct-19 09:53 AM] flequillo1986#5387
What happened?


[31-Oct-19 09:53 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
I had about 12 failed swaps during the test and countless that never even made it that far


[31-Oct-19 09:54 AM] joker-h#1785
Did I win?


[31-Oct-19 09:54 AM] Farl#9964

@joker-h not yet


[31-Oct-19 09:54 AM] Patrick Crypto#1546
All my failed swaps were from orders placed prior to the test


[31-Oct-19 09:54 AM] joker-h#1785
I have only "failed swap", all orders.

```The Komodo team is extremely grateful for the overwhelming response we've received for the AtomicDEX Beta stress test. Due to this huge amount of participation, we hit bottlenecks in our infrastructure much sooner than we had anticipated. This led to a high percentage of swaps not matching properly. As such, we're adjusting the requirements for entry into the prize pool. All you need to do is match one swap and you're eligible to win prizes. It is not a requirement for the swap to successfully complete- one matched swap (1/3) is enough to make into the prize pool.```

I don't know - got 500+ attempts without any luck


[31-Oct-19 10:35 AM] Gig#0273
if i check my RICK address in KMD explorer should that show me any swaps i made?


[31-Oct-19 10:36 AM] Gig#0273
cuz i see nothing


[31-Oct-19 10:36 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, in general it's possible to check your swaps via RICK/MORTY explorers


[31-Oct-19 10:36 AM] TonyL#3577
by transactions from/to `b` address


[31-Oct-19 10:36 AM] Gig#0273
is that in the KMD explorer?


[31-Oct-19 10:37 AM] Strob#3417
There must be some trick cause someone got 19 and got 0 even though I tried since the first second of the test.

While an order is still in the "matching" (0/3) state and you navigate back, and click on the orders tab, then you can't get to the order again by tapping it. Usually, as soon as state 1/3 has started, tapping the order leads you back to its details. (Android)


[31-Oct-19 10:51 AM] Sir Seven#7158
@tese You can't get to details 'cause there are pretty much no details to show yet.

KMD chain in independent and 100% unrelated to this stress test


[31-Oct-19 11:45 AM] SHossain#0007
the only components were used for this stress test are:
0. maker nodes using servers which uses MM2 + MORTY + RICK coin daemon
1. AtomicDEX mobile app to connect to the above using Electrum servers and perform swaps

Is the team concerned that the first implementation of atomicdex was overloaded with ~2k users?


[31-Oct-19 02:21 PM] jl777c#5810
no


[31-Oct-19 02:22 PM] jl777c#5810
like the first GUI wasnt close to perfect, but has improved, so will the scaling capacity


[31-Oct-19 02:22 PM] jspook16#3059
Copy


[31-Oct-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
also, keep in mind that 2000 users all trading the same orderbook at the same time...


[31-Oct-19 02:26 PM] jl777c#5810
that is actually quite a high volume scenario, even for CEX


[31-Oct-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
and mm1 was able to achieve much higher throughputs, so mm2 just needs to catch up to it and go beyond it


[31-Oct-19 02:27 PM] jspook16#3059
I did. And I understand that its alot but wouldnt an official implementation need to handle many more than 2k users at a time?


[31-Oct-19 02:27 PM] jspook16#3059
Ok


[31-Oct-19 02:27 PM] jl777c#5810
per orderbook?


[31-Oct-19 02:28 PM] jl777c#5810
BTC/USDT pairs on the biggest exchanges would have that level of volumes


[31-Oct-19 02:28 PM] jspook16#3059
Im asking really. I dont know what is expected of each orderbook


[31-Oct-19 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
but not most other scenarios. that being said, we will get to where we can handle far more than this level

{Reactions}
üëç ‚òù 

[31-Oct-19 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
if you look at most exchange trade history, you have a few trades per minute on an active orderbook


[31-Oct-19 02:29 PM] jl777c#5810
how  many orderbooks have 30 per second of trades?


[31-Oct-19 02:30 PM] ca333#0333
also worth mentioning that the mobile DEX app itself is very stable - i.e. no crashs or other GUI issues you would expect from a beta


[31-Oct-19 02:31 PM] jspook16#3059
Ok with that said, do you forsee malicous spamming targeted at the atomicdex being a problem?


[31-Oct-19 02:32 PM] ca333#0333
we do def. include this in the refactoring and general spam-countermeasures - so even if it is being targeted we are confident to optimize the DEX system to be able to handle very high load as aforementioned by jl777


[31-Oct-19 02:33 PM] jl777c#5810
if a nationstate does a petabyte/sec Ddos against all the nodes... well nothing can withstand that, but short of some sustained insane level Ddos, with graceful degradation, things would be slower but not stopped. also, when we add filtering by known pubkeys, that will filter out a lot of spam


[31-Oct-19 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
this was the first atomicDEX stress test, it wasnt able to handle the load that was a lot higher than we expected


[31-Oct-19 02:34 PM] jspook16#3059
I understand, I just want to get an idea of what is expected as it progresses


[31-Oct-19 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
the key is for the load handling to continuously improve and we certainly have a lot of ideas on how to do this


[31-Oct-19 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
as things progress, this level of traffic will become easy to handle


[31-Oct-19 02:34 PM] jl777c#5810
then a higher level


[31-Oct-19 02:35 PM] jl777c#5810
after that, it seems it is ready for mass usage


[31-Oct-19 02:36 PM] jspook16#3059
what would you consider mass usage? on par with a typical CEX?


[31-Oct-19 02:36 PM] jl777c#5810
what is a typical CEX?


[31-Oct-19 02:36 PM] jspook16#3059
suppose one of the more popular ones...with high usage


[31-Oct-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
anything other than the major top CEX level of traffic i dont see any issues with, as the trade volumes are really not that big


[31-Oct-19 02:37 PM] jspook16#3059
Copy


[31-Oct-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
we cant have lot of small orders due to blockchain based


[31-Oct-19 02:37 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe it is possible to handle binance level trades, but that is not realistic for the blockchains to support, so it seems a moot point. really the load that needs to be able to handle is whatever load the blockchains can handle


[31-Oct-19 02:38 PM] jl777c#5810
and that is much less than the major CEX trade counts


[31-Oct-19 02:39 PM] ca333#0333
`what would you consider mass usage?` - being able to handle loads comparable to any CEX BUT with the big diff. that we will be able to scale this up dynamically - so even if the technical limits are reached (e.g. ~65k ports ) a dynamical scaling would allow us to cover hundreds of thousands if not millions of users once the system is near perfection.


[31-Oct-19 02:39 PM] ca333#0333
yes - blockchains being a limitation too - agree on that.


[31-Oct-19 02:39 PM] jl777c#5810
100 swaps per second, per orderbook seems the max the blockchain side can handle


[31-Oct-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
that is 6000 users doing a swap per minute (5 to 10 in parallel)


[31-Oct-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
which actually might be a level we touched today!

{Reactions}
‚úÖ (4) 

[31-Oct-19 02:40 PM] jl777c#5810
so when we can handle 6000 users doing 1 swap per minute, that handles the blockchain capacity


[31-Oct-19 02:41 PM] ca333#0333
on the other hand your multichain scalability solution could even bring the tech beyond this swap limit at some point in the future


[31-Oct-19 02:42 PM] jl777c#5810
yes, a cluster of fungible chains can do 100 tx/sec per chain, but we can isolate the trading of each on in a different netid


[31-Oct-19 02:43 PM] jl777c#5810
which means the 6000 users doing 1 swap per minute, per fungible chain can be handled across the netids


[31-Oct-19 02:44 PM] fat3lvis#6079
It seems an average trade time, or network traffic indicator would be helpful right now. As it is we are just trading blindly, not know if there is a technical issue with our swap, or if it is just network saturation


[31-Oct-19 02:47 PM] fat3lvis#6079
And is order queueing handled right now? I never waited more than a few minutes today. Would a swap go through eventually or are swaps attempted beyond the network capacity just going nowhere?


[31-Oct-19 02:52 PM] jl777c#5810
once the network got saturated, it is like a door that had too many people trying to use it at once. some made it through, but most were colliding with others trying to get through.


[31-Oct-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
we did not expect 2000 simultaneous swap attempts for this first stress test, but that is what allowed to find where things meltdown first


[31-Oct-19 02:54 PM] jl777c#5810
round 2, we will do much better, but it is not easy to reproduce such high levels of activity short of doing a public stress test, so until the next one, we wont know for 100% sure if the improvements are enough


[31-Oct-19 02:59 PM] phm87#7395

Hello,
I got a question about a possible collaboration between AtomicDex and Coinomi.
What do dev's think about for being able directly from Coinomi to initiate atomic swaps?

It would bring to the most crypto users access to this awesome technology.

@ca333 "DEX app itself is very stable - i.e. no crashs" while I haven't had the app outright crash and close itself, I have to basically restart it every time I use it because it seems to be unable to reopen connectivity once I switch away from it. Or even just going back from the order book and trying to open it again. It will go from showing say 7-10 orders to 1 to 'create an order'


[31-Oct-19 04:18 PM] ca333#0333

Hi, I was unable to make any swaps, tried for hours.. one of my main issues is most of the time, including now is the Rick and Morty coins were not available to even try to make any swaps. Seems quite unfair to have a contest that people that tried to enter could not...there was one time I was able to try to make some swaps and tried about 40 different ones, but not one even really tried to go through...I know a stress test is supposed to fail, but maybe the requirements to be eligible to win the contest should not have been related to active swaps...

Are you going to use the "news" section for news? I was expecting the stress test announcement appear there in-app as well, as other things maybe changelogs or  "what's new"

How are coin fund totals determined, where are prices being pulled?  I noticed DEX has no price, although sold for about 30 kmd

@polycryptoblog hope you got some good data

Hi, something strange, i make a swap, sell Kmd for Dex, i received Dex have 1 confirmation, but on history is showed like "swap failed", "unlock funds"


[01-Nov-19 10:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Submit log file seems like a bug.  Does the unlock funds button do anything might just be a visual bug

$KMD #KOMODO üí™

Over 2000 ppl trying to crush it
And so we CRUSHED it
And it was GOOD

And even tho at first I was sad I did so badly in the competition

@cryptoclueless | $ARRR  prices and amounts available are set by the trader offering it


[01-Nov-19 10:25 AM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
Yes I understand a swap is based off the prices offered by the trader.  I'm looking specifically of the value within my wallet.  If i have 10 kmd, there is a value listed in my wallet.  If I have 1 DEX, there is no value listed.  The wallet value is pulling prices from something, just curious what that is.  It makes sense because I dont think DEX is shown on coinmarketcap or coingecko, etc

Does the app add it own fees on top of dex fees? it seems so


[01-Nov-19 11:21 AM] Cryptoon#3362
How do you mean?


[01-Nov-19 11:22 AM] mobipoi#5774
What I wrote


[01-Nov-19 11:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
1/777 is the fee. x% of that goes to the creator, the rest to DEX holders


[01-Nov-19 11:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think


[01-Nov-19 11:22 AM] Cryptoon#3362
The percentage was 15% or so?


[01-Nov-19 11:23 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Also transaction fees


[01-Nov-19 11:23 AM] mobipoi#5774
Ok I'll check again was trying to test stable but looks a bit expensive


[01-Nov-19 11:23 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah yes tx fees!


[01-Nov-19 11:23 AM] mobipoi#5774
Ok so there are more fees on top of dex


[01-Nov-19 11:23 AM] mobipoi#5774
Fees


[01-Nov-19 11:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Tx fees are usually not that big %wise


[01-Nov-19 11:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
And are only a natural side effect of it being atomic swaps depending on on-chain transactions for each pair


[01-Nov-19 11:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Kmd and assetchains are 0.0001kmd regardless of amount


[01-Nov-19 11:26 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Eth can be expensive depending on gascost

[01-Nov-19 12:00 PM] TonyL#3577
It was very hard to find out all the data because of the issues dex network experienced during the stress-test. But no worries - all participants are in the same boat (like a approx same probability of some not-counted swaps)

If you can't find yourself on the list although you executed a successful or failed swap (at least reached status 1/3) please send a DM to @TonyL or @smkhound - our team will pick up the winners from https://oracle.earth/mm2_stresstest_combined_leaderboard/ and publish the information tomorrow as it took much longer to parse and analyse the whole dataset. We will also randomly send bounties to participants that couldn't execute a successful swap.

And what about who did like 2 or 3 successful swaps @ca333

They qualify for the lottery like raffle and get more tickets assigned = higher chance of winning the big prize.

does this still apply?:

[02-Nov-19 12:09 AM] Gig#0273
secondly, im 99.9% sure i got a screen saying i had a successful swap, yet can find no evidence of it in explorer, DEX order history etc. Is there any point in me sending logs to confirm whether or not this event occurred or should i assume from the explorers it didnt?


[02-Nov-19 12:27 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi! Yes, that‚Äôs still apply üôÇ You can check your RICK/MORTY addresses tx history on explorers - if there are transactions to b address that‚Äôs most probably means that swap was performed


[02-Nov-19 12:28 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
for the stress test correct criteria to win the prizes is on total number of swapps!


[02-Nov-19 12:29 AM] LuckyShadow#3212
no mather if is susccessful or not !!!


[02-Nov-19 12:32 AM] TonyL#3577
yep, in case of 0 succesful swaps one matched swap (1/3 stage) granting 1 raffle ticket (up to 1 in total)

[02-Nov-19 01:06 AM] TonyL#3577
Hi @Artist ! Attempts not granting additional tickets. If attempts not counted as failed swaps (what also not granting tickets) it means that it was failed before the ordermatching and not possible to track/count


[02-Nov-19 01:07 AM] Artist#0765
So what about succesful attempts


[02-Nov-19 01:08 AM] TonyL#3577
Do you have more than 2 succesful swaps?


[02-Nov-19 01:08 AM] Artist#0765

unsuccessful swaps are worth as much as successful ones?

nope, only succesful swaps counting and the fact of unsuccesful attempts in general as 1 ticket (in case if succesful swaps count = 0)


[02-Nov-19 02:25 AM] Artist#0765
So 2 successful count?

As you that announce yesterday and on telegram channel


[02-Nov-19 03:49 AM] Jimm B.#9993
Due to the extremely high load placed on the network, far fewer swaps went through than what the Komodo team had first anticipated. As such, we adjusted the requirements for entry into the prize pool lottery. Anyone who matched a single swap was entered into the prize pool.


[02-Nov-19 03:50 AM] Checking#6355

I dont think so


[02-Nov-19 03:58 AM] Artist#0765
And checking would get 77 kmd


[02-Nov-19 03:59 AM] Artist#0765
Cause he was 6th on the list


[02-Nov-19 03:59 AM] Artist#0765
20 of the top candidates would get 77kmd


[02-Nov-19 03:59 AM] Jimm B.#9993
they have changed the rules that everyone who makes a swap, gets the entry to the raffle.  after the old conditions (30 swaps) you would not even have gotten the entry.


[02-Nov-19 03:59 AM] Artist#0765
1rst and 2nd will get 777

That was the case but I think only 2 or 3 guys got 30 swaps xD

1 swap= 1 Ticket.... 28 swaps=1 ticket

So I have 2 successful swaps am I also a part of the draw?


[02-Nov-19 04:06 AM] Jimm B.#9993
Yes


[02-Nov-19 04:07 AM] Jimm B.#9993
come on people .... just accept that you just did not have any luck.


[02-Nov-19 04:07 AM] Artist#0765
It will be totally biased mate? @Checking I doubt about any cheating or stuff..


[02-Nov-19 04:07 AM] Artist#0765
Well still if I am in the draw I still think I am in the game


[02-Nov-19 04:07 AM] Artist#0765
What if the guy who was first in the list dont even appear in the draw.. wont that be unfair


[02-Nov-19 04:09 AM] Jimm B.#9993
anyone who has a successful swap has been admitted to the lottery.  no matter if 1 or 100 swaps.  Everyone had the same Chance.


[02-Nov-19 04:09 AM] Artist#0765
Ooh noice


[02-Nov-19 04:10 AM] Artist#0765
Then best of luck everyone


[02-Nov-19 04:10 AM] ca333#0333
@Checking - the raffle was fair and based on a random number generator - one of the most trustworthy humans managed this process and i can assure you 100% that this was totally fair. Please keep in mind that it was not ranking based but a lottery based raffle. So you d not only need successful swaps but also luck in order to be picked - and notice that we will randomly award others from the list who did not win. 

For the next big stress test we will use a blockchain based raffle method that will be publicly verifiable and provable fair.


[02-Nov-19 04:10 AM] Checking#6355
@Jimm B.  The more swaps you make, the better your chances of winning a prize.¬†

First AtomicDEX Stress Test Successfully Completed - Komodo

All winners can be seen here.


[02-Nov-19 04:14 AM] ca333#0333
I was thinking on using something that would deliver instant results the next time - what i proposed internally is:

We could actually even do something fully automated so that winners will be automatically picked the second the test is over:
e.g. we decide on a mathematical constant (stored in the blockchain BEFORE the stress-test starts) that gets combined (multiplied or other arithmetic operation) with a specific range of chars from the decimal repesentation of the pubkey/address of the stress-testers - now the final result after combination with the "raffle-constant" will be a decimal number - and then the FIRST mined Komodo block after the stress-test is over will be taken - then the hash of this block will be used to pick a pre-defined range from the HEX - transformed into decimal repr. - and now the closest number from the testers number will win - then the 2nd. and so on.

what do you think about this?

Don't understand what you're on about. We tried to break it; we broke it. We got enough data from the test to optimize it.

"it is not a dex" is unequivocally untrue


[02-Nov-19 08:23 AM] co2#1244
I think this whole 30 transaction was not realistic in first place


[02-Nov-19 08:23 AM] co2#1244
if some node can send 15 transaction


[02-Nov-19 08:24 AM] co2#1244
and 1700 can't send a single one... I think something is wrong


[02-Nov-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
wait for next test


[02-Nov-19 08:24 AM] jl777c#5810
2000 simultaneous orders for a single orderbook, this could not be handled with last iteration. we will fix it


[02-Nov-19 08:25 AM] jl777c#5810
you can keep repeating it didnt work, ok, we all know that it couldnt handle 250tx/sec sustained, and the degradation of the network was not graceful, it saturated and stopped for most


[02-Nov-19 08:25 AM] co2#1244
just my opinion anyway... you had 2000 people that tried to send 1 transaction for 6 hours.

clearly it could not handle it

why do you keep repeating what everybody knows?


[02-Nov-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
mm1 initial stress test was a bit similar


[02-Nov-19 08:26 AM] ¬∞‚òÜ slim [WONT DM FIRST]#1031
that is the entire point of doing these tests


[02-Nov-19 08:26 AM] co2#1244
Because you keep repeating that test was success


[02-Nov-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
by the third iteration, mm1 was able to handle the load


[02-Nov-19 08:26 AM] jl777c#5810
the test was a success in finding what broke


[02-Nov-19 08:26 AM] co2#1244
and I did not read other people comments here

I want to say thanks to Komodo as I was a lucky winner.  I participated in the stress test, not expecting to win anything, just hoping, and hoping to help improve this software.  With the on-going creep of government into all aspects of our lives, I think AtomicDex will be an essential tool in fighting for freedom, and will especially fulfill that goal with the implementation of Pirate (ARRR).  Can't wait to help with future tests, and ultimately see this released for the world to use.

@Liteliger  thank you for making an Atomicdex video and getting the word out


[02-Nov-19 10:50 AM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
Thats it Oszy, thanks!  I've seen 1 DEX valued at 20-30 KMD, at least thats what holders are selling them for.  I'm curious if thats based on some estimation of atomicDex transaction fees


[02-Nov-19 10:53 AM] Oszy#5734
right now it's based on nobody really selling it üòÑ some say it's worth even 100KMD, it's up to people to valuate it, surely has to look at in as a long term investment


[02-Nov-19 10:55 AM] Oszy#5734
but yes i've seen it between 30-40 in the past months


[02-Nov-19 10:56 AM] Oszy#5734
it's not a bad price now considering KMD is .57 cents not $1.50 as it was a few months ago


[02-Nov-19 10:57 AM] Acura#2748
@cryptoclueless | $ARRR Imagine a Dex that uses multiple GUI's...
Smartphone / Tablet (AtomicDex) + 
Native Web-based Dex

Plus other projects which will create their own GUI (e.g. HyperDex/Chainswap) and use Dex as engine - plus the potential when MM2 is ready incl. Z Address Handling (Pirate) + CEX Orderbook Connection

And not to forget the integration of Dex into existing wallet providers.

Everyone uses one and the same order book.
And you earn money with every trade.

My Point of view.

I'm looking anyway, and doing what I can to improve data collection etc. Got a bunch of logs to check, some up to 70MB. Each needs to be cleaned up to only the json, then filtered to only look at swaps during the window. Had a decent sleep today, so getting stuck in.

Word. I still keep testing it. I want it to work. 
Will it possible to offer a maker position and close the app/lock phone? That would be a HUGE + for me. Unless my phone is plugged in the screen times out


[02-Nov-19 11:25 AM] smkhound#7640
app needs to be running for swap process to initiate / progress.


[02-Nov-19 11:25 AM] smkhound#7640

I've been able to observe this:

I put in 2 different orders.
Once as an example: Dex/KMD and Dex/BTC
If I now switch the mobile phone to standby and then log in to the mobile phone after few seconds/minutes, then I'm back in AtomicDex and want to place another 3rd order for the same asset, the message "Order book is being loaded" appears - but then no existing orders from other people are displayed to me anymore. I can only create one myself.

I see as virtually no other available orders anymore. If it is a bug I don't know. But I noticed it.

Android system. Android 7.1.2

[03-Nov-19 02:50 PM] Oszy#5734
You sure you didn't try to buy? IT's still on the `b` address so it's an uncompleted swap. Do you see it in your swap history as failed?


[03-Nov-19 02:52 PM] vichiet#4058

First AtomicDEX Stress Test Successfully Completed - Komodo
Komodo held a community stress test of AtomicDEX Beta on 31 October from 12pm to 6pm GMT. The test provided the Komodo Development Team with an enormous amount of valuable data about potential bottlenecks in the networking layer, and will help the Komodo team perfect AtomicDE...

Litecoin Fees to be Reduced 10x to ‚ÄúHalf a Cent‚Äù with the LTC ...
Litecoin fees are about to get reduced 10 times with the new Litecoin Core launch due to a surge in its fees after Litecoin hit its all-time high (ATH) at $320.

Default fee should be 0.0001 LTC per transaction.

Hey @vichiet , yesterday i had sell 1 Dex for 35kmd - that was me üòÖ.
But unfortunately the trade didn‚Äôt go trough. 

the swap stopped at 2 out of 3 steps.
After a few hours I got my 1 Dex again.

[04-Nov-19 12:30 AM] jl777c#5810
@TonyL maybe txfee for LTC is still set to 0.001, if so, should be changed to 0.0001


[04-Nov-19 12:31 AM] applecider#7505
when can we expect other KMD asset to be listed on the atomic dex , such as MGW, Jumblr, Bot, etc


[04-Nov-19 12:34 AM] TonyL#3577
@jl777c yes, just checked - it's 0.001 now. Will be changed to 0.0001 in the next patch

On Atomicdex currently 1 kmd gets you 0.0333DEX.

are the other assets that it holds to be converted to KMD yet?

no, need to get enough in the other coins to convert


[04-Nov-19 06:22 AM] Lennart#9331
ah, so each individual asset collects 1 mio usd on its own and THEN gets converted?


[04-Nov-19 06:22 AM] jl777c#5810
well before that it would be converted

Is there a way, how to delete the logs from the App? After the last stress test my logs have like 30 MB. I would like to delete them so I can start with clear ones next time again.


[04-Nov-19 08:03 AM] Oszy#5734
1) You can reinstall
2) Go to App settings, delete cache/data

Either way you choose have to set up the wallet again so have the seed backed up.


[04-Nov-19 08:06 AM] Monstar#8630
That should be made simpler in the future IMO. Reinstalling seems like hunting a rabbit with a cannon. It would be great to have one more option, something like "clear logs and cache". Thanks. @Oszy


[04-Nov-19 08:23 AM] Oszy#5734
True


[04-Nov-19 08:23 AM] Acura#2748
On iOS i don‚Äôt have an Option to reset/delete the chache inside Atomicdex


[04-Nov-19 08:24 AM] Oszy#5734
Please open a github issue as `feature request`  so it won't just go into the air


[04-Nov-19 08:24 AM] Oszy#5734
@Acura On android it's in system settings not in-app. Not sure about iOS


[04-Nov-19 08:25 AM] Oszy#5734
But it's not an official solution to clear logs, this is the DIY mode.


[04-Nov-19 09:00 AM] TonyL#3577
Large logs on this point actually is the feature to make bug catching process easier. Some edge reported cases reproducing in a few days of active usage


[04-Nov-19 09:01 AM] TonyL#3577
Before logs stashed every time on app restart and in case of iOS was almost impossible to get something helpful from user log

[04-Nov-19 02:19 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
@coingirl87  there is 1 mio supply of dex and you get reward if the rewards from AtomicDEX get 1mio (kmd or usd?) so you get 1 kmd or usd? for every dex... why should someone pay 100,50 or 30 kmd for one dex??? üòÇ do the math...


[04-Nov-19 02:25 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
With all the volume from digitalprice I would say around : 30-50k$ per day - that‚Äôs around 15 usd or kmd as reward from one dex per year, if all the kmd assets only traded on AtomicDEX ü§ûü§ûü§û


[04-Nov-19 02:33 PM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
@vogelfreund88 i'm trying to calculate myself.  I believe the trading fees are 0.15% of a trade.  So if AtomicDex goes crazy and has $1,000,000 of trade volume per day, thats $365,000,000 per year.  0.15% of $365,000,000 is $547,500.  DEX holders receive half of that or $$273,750.  Divide that by 1 million DEX and its about 27 cents return per DEX coin per year.  I'm not sure if that math is right, but thats what I've been thinking about on whether to buy DEX or not


[04-Nov-19 02:45 PM] vogelfreund88#4534
that‚Äôs a lot of time get the money back if you buy for 30,50 or 100 kmd per dex


[04-Nov-19 02:54 PM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
yeah, I'm wondering if my math is wrong or something in my assumptions is incorrect


[04-Nov-19 02:56 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Where do you get half is paid to dex holders?


[04-Nov-19 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Ah wait nvm


[04-Nov-19 02:57 PM] Cryptoon#3362
50 to DEX, 15% to jumblr etc


[04-Nov-19 02:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
@cryptoclueless | $ARRR it will all depend on real volume... 1mio is only 100btc at todays btc prices, but if btc goes to 50k by 2021 its only 20btc volume...


[04-Nov-19 02:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If atomicdex supports ARRR it will become the largest possible mixer for any coin


[04-Nov-19 02:59 PM] Cryptoon#3362
How much volume do the mixer wallets take?


[04-Nov-19 03:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If atomicdex is used for dICO‚Äôs or whatever the name is


[04-Nov-19 03:00 PM] Cryptoon#3362
What will be the volume for that etc


[04-Nov-19 03:01 PM] Cryptoon#3362
You just cant predict what it will be, atm we just know the potential is there and is wider than simply trading because of arrr/dico/... other applications the protocol can have

What is 1% of binance volume for example?


[04-Nov-19 03:04 PM] allbits#5898
1,000,000 of daily volume is hardly "going crazy" for an exchange. That's a tiny, tiny CEX in today's environment


[04-Nov-19 03:06 PM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
1% of binance is 11 million


[04-Nov-19 03:06 PM] Cryptoon#3362
1 billion daily volume on binance. 1mio daily would be only 0.1%


[04-Nov-19 03:07 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yep


[04-Nov-19 03:07 PM] cryptoclueless | $ARRR#9519
I agree that ARRR could help in changing that too

I also saw that post on Dune the other day, so it definitely seems like there is a lot of potential even outside of trading on AtomicDex

Originally DEX was an an asset on NXT blockchain, created in 2014. It was issued to some early backers of jl777 in the nxt community.  Then an after market developed on NXT asset exchange and many people acquired from there. It was migrated to Komodo based chain a couple of years ago.

@Tylor zkFS can you check the order-item in the history tab - it should have a button there to release the funds IF they re stuck.

Hi, i have question about atomicdex. If both taker and maker had sucessfully send funds to the smart address start with b.. Will the swap still possible be timeout?


[05-Nov-19 06:57 AM] Oszy#5734
only if one of the tx-es remain uncomfirmed for a long time, I believe it could still timeout


[05-Nov-19 06:59 AM] JKLGamer#8218
I see. Thanks, i just tried swapping. My fund was send to a smart address but still ended up timeout. I'll wait for my fund to come back then


[05-Nov-19 07:00 AM] JKLGamer#8218
And another question, if timeout, that would means we'll lose some tx fees right?


[05-Nov-19 07:00 AM] Oszy#5734
yes, you get Dex Fee + amount back - minus tx fees


[05-Nov-19 07:01 AM] JKLGamer#8218
Thanks for the explanations


[05-Nov-19 07:01 AM] Oszy#5734

Really good localization overall, thanks a lot.

I did not check where these words are used in the real UI, so I don't know the contexts but here are some potential mistakes I detected:

Line 13: `login` is translated as `Giri≈ü`,  is uppercase G correct?

Line 523:  `By` is translated as `Yazan:` - is the colon(:) correct here?

Line 588 and 595 has `{index}. word`, the dot there with `-th, -rd` is missing at Turkish translation like `{index} kelime`. Index will be a number here like ...

Anyone else have swaps complete but screen doesn‚Äôt show it? Got to 2/3 and just stopped. It had been plenty of time to complete Rick/Morty swap, so I checked history and it showed completed. Don‚Äôt think the timing was coincidence, seems like the progress screen stalled.


[06-Nov-19 08:58 AM] tolken#2655
I never switched away or let screen go to sleep, fwiw


[06-Nov-19 08:59 AM] tolken#2655
As a matter of fact, I kept poking the screen to keep-alive.


[06-Nov-19 09:01 AM] tolken#2655
While I dig the simplicity of the swap progress screen, some additional details would be cool to see. If each ‚Äú3rd‚Äù section of the progress graphic had subtle subdivisions indicating other steps in the smart contract execution, would be sweet.


[06-Nov-19 01:33 PM] Oszy#5734
@ca333
Is there some sort of rounding up / down for BTC amounts when creating a new order in atomicDEX, or did I find another bug? at 6 digit amounts for the base coin it rounds way too much and actually down when entering into the orderbook, so if you don't watch out you sell  much cheaper than what you set. 

At 5 digits, it's rounding up 0.002-0.003 BTC depends on what number I enter for the base coin.
At 6 digits it's rounding down 0.0015-0.002! BTC depends on what number I enter for the base coin. (I used 99999 and 555555 amounts for COMMOD, and 0.0077777 for BTC in both cases)

Can DM screenshots, let me know.


[06-Nov-19 01:34 PM] Oszy#5734

[06-Nov-19 01:59 PM] Oszy#5734
i found a similar bug that had something to do with deleting the decimals, then posting to the orderbook gave stupid numbers,  now this is without decimals, just plain big numbers, there must be an error somewhere


[06-Nov-19 02:02 PM] Oszy#5734
it's not a big deal on a KMD pair but on BTC it's significant difference in price

**Line 523: By is translated as Yazan: - is the colon(:) correct here?** Correct, there is no equivalent word in Turkish grammar, actually having (tarafƒ±ndan) but you have to use after author name, this code coming before author name I guess, two optio...

How long atomicdex waits to trying get swaps done? Ie. if in another chain has long time between blocks then how long dex waits to  get tx through?

I would assume the app watches mempools of each chain, as long as the tx is still in the mempool it wont abort mission?

@Mark81 roughly 45 mins for maker payment to clean,  and about 2 hours to complete, according to my logs of a swap that did timeout


[07-Nov-19 03:17 AM] Oszy#5734
not sure actual times are specific to swap or a blockchain or just fixed, devs could confirm


[07-Nov-19 04:08 AM] colonelhoot#6448
I want to try this out but one thing I dont understand is who hosts the blockchains if not me?  Are there other nodes that do this?  Do you guys use Electrum or something like that? Or am I just confused here?


[07-Nov-19 04:16 AM] Oszy#5734
atomicDEX mobile uses SPV electrum servers to load blockchain data.


[07-Nov-19 04:17 AM] Oszy#5734
on PC, you can run marketmaker with native wallets, on mobile that would be a bit complicated and would eat more resources than a phone can handle.


[07-Nov-19 04:21 AM] Lennart#9331
can an open order somehow made into an hyperlink, so I can share my order in social media? If someone clicks on it, AtomicDex opens with all the fields prefilled, could it be done?


[07-Nov-19 04:22 AM] Lennart#9331
also, when you create an order, after submitting the order there could be the typical "share on social media" buttons


[07-Nov-19 04:23 AM] Lennart#9331
maybe that's all not needed with a lot of liquidity on the Dex. But for mor exclusive traiding pairs it could still be useful


[07-Nov-19 04:25 AM] Markus#5464
@Lennart Good idea, i quess there could be a button in the order tab to share trade but i think this would require quite some changes for this to work

Ah thanks.


[07-Nov-19 05:21 AM] Aquila#3547
What executes the final part of the atomic swap? say I offer KMD for BTC and later somebody fills the offer, so they claim the KMD. What process/machine then broadcasts the transaction to Bitcoin network to spend the BTC to my address and complete the swap?


[07-Nov-19 05:23 AM] gcharang#6833
@Aquila
the simple answer is: your atomicDEX app which has marketmaker2 inside it


[07-Nov-19 05:24 AM] gcharang#6833
this is the whole process. It is automated and all the steps are done by the mm2 of each of the participants
```
----------
A has BTC, B has KMD. They agreed on swap price `1 BTC = 100 KMD`
A is the maker, B is the taker.

1) Taker Sends <dexfee>

B pays the dex fee so that A will start the process by locking his coins.

2) Maker Successfully Sends <makerpayment>

A picks randomNumber: `secret_A`

A creates a utxo on the Bitcoin blockchain with 
value: 1 BTC 
encumbrance: the value can be claimed by A after 20 hours or by B if he knows the secret `secret_A`

3)  Taker Successfully Sends <takerpayment>

After seeing the above utxo, B creates the following utxo on the KMD blockchain:
value: 100 KMD
encumbrance: the value can be claimed by B after 10 hours or by A if he knows the secret `secret_A`

4) Maker Spends <takerpayment>

 A uses the `secret_A`  and claims the KMD revealing the secret 

5) Taker Spends <makerpayment>

B now uses the public `secret_A` to claim the BTC

---
The times can be adjusted based on requirements of security and "ease of use"
Normally, A should have a longer locktime so that B can have sufficient time to get his coins back if A doesn't reveal the secret `secret_A`
```


[07-Nov-19 05:26 AM] Aquila#3547
so if I place an order then turn off my phone I might not complete my swap and the counter-party could eventually spend those too?


[07-Nov-19 05:28 AM] Aquila#3547
OK thanks I think I understand, it's the mm2 app that does the lifting there


[07-Nov-19 05:28 AM] gcharang#6833
just placing an order doesn't make you lose coins
but, if you are the taker and don't claim your coins in the given time, you could lose them


[07-Nov-19 05:29 AM] Aquila#3547
Would you have a brief summary of how/where orders are stored / matched?


[07-Nov-19 05:31 AM] gcharang#6833
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/atomicdex.html#the-decentralized-orderbook>
orders are broadcast by each mm2 instance to the p2p network and relay nodes broadcast them to all the other mm2 instances that want to listen
each mm2 instance will create a local orderbook based on the orders they hear on the p2p network


[07-Nov-19 05:32 AM] gcharang#6833
similar to how txns are broadcast to the mempool


[07-Nov-19 05:38 AM] Aquila#3547
OK, that all makes sense.  So in terms of the Komodo platform, if you do an atomic swap between BTC and LTC then Komodo network (blockchain) is not involved


[07-Nov-19 05:39 AM] Aquila#3547
Interesting to contrast with the design of the Decred DEX. I think all atomic swaps there are with DCR base pair


[07-Nov-19 05:40 AM] Aquila#3547
Who provides all of the remote nodes for the supported blockchains on atomic?


[07-Nov-19 05:42 AM] Aquila#3547
Does support for swaps have to be implemented pairwise or is one implementation per chain enough? e.g. to add ZEN to the dex would somebody have to implement ZEN/KMD swap, ZEN/BTC swap, etc. or just a one-time implementation and then it can be swapped against all existing assets?


[07-Nov-19 05:42 AM] gcharang#6833

these are called electrum servers
some we maintain. some are run by the respective coin communities
most lite mode wallets for most cryptos use these electrum servers

Directly from the wallet that provided both the QR code and the text string. I wanted to compare the scanned string with the provided string, but the text field in AtomicDex didn't show the full address, and there does not seem to be a way to put the cursor back to the beginning, is there?

Or an orphaned block can happen also


[08-Nov-19 02:40 AM] TonyL#3577
As I remember there were some deadly stuck transactions from faucet (it's not AtomicDEX but faucet related)


[08-Nov-19 02:41 AM] TonyL#3577
For commod can't see transaction with such txid on blockchain


[08-Nov-19 02:42 AM] TonyL#3577
You can try to re-issue it, probably it's related to chain stall


[08-Nov-19 02:44 AM] Mark81#4505
I cant find it neither from Morty.


[08-Nov-19 02:45 AM] TonyL#3577
If you can see it with 0 confirmations it should be in SPV server mempool


[08-Nov-19 02:45 AM] Mark81#4505
Tx for commod was coming for me from pool so its lost forever.


[08-Nov-19 02:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Is your commod pool balance 0?


[08-Nov-19 02:46 AM] Mark81#4505
Yes it is.


[08-Nov-19 02:46 AM] TonyL#3577
You should contact pool operator - if transaction was not performed but your pool account balance was reduced he/she should restore it


[08-Nov-19 02:46 AM] Mark81#4505
So its wider problem.


[08-Nov-19 02:47 AM] TonyL#3577
It's not related anyhow to AtomicDEX since tx not reached destination (it's not on blockchain as you can see)


[08-Nov-19 02:49 AM] Mark81#4505
Well it is in that sence that atomicdex dont remove those off? Atleast if  they stick there till world ends.


[08-Nov-19 02:50 AM] TonyL#3577
AtomicDEX can't remove transaction from blockchain nodes mempool or from blockchain


[08-Nov-19 02:50 AM] Mark81#4505
And there is bug also in snop pool code.


[08-Nov-19 02:51 AM] TonyL#3577
Most probably tx hanged in a mempool, rebroadcast from pool side might help

@runpaint


[08-Nov-19 02:56 AM] Mark81#4505

AtomicDEX uses ETH checksum verification: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55. Thus, address input is case-sensitive. You should use mixed case as recepient (https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a0b54d5dc17e0aadc383d2db43b0a0d3e029c4c for example for this address mixed case one is 0x5A0b54D5dc17e0AadC383d2db43B0a0D3E029c4c)

Why is the minimum trading amount so high in this testphase


[08-Nov-19 05:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
trying to sell 25 KMD for btc but minimum trade is 0,0777. Bit lame that i need to put so "much" on to the app to test it


[08-Nov-19 05:46 AM] cipi#4502
BTC txfee is 1$, so trading lesser then 100$ of BTC makes no sense


[08-Nov-19 05:46 AM] Deleted User#0000
So if i trade kmd for dex i can do lower trades?


[08-Nov-19 05:47 AM] cipi#4502
yes, min. trade is 0.0077 and it applies to all coins


[08-Nov-19 05:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oh wait, kmd uses btc hashing power


[08-Nov-19 05:47 AM] Deleted User#0000
i understand, so its a bit of a bottleneck for smaller trades


[08-Nov-19 05:47 AM] Oszy#5734
That has nothing to do with it.


[08-Nov-19 05:47 AM] cipi#4502
yes, for coins with high txfees, like BTC... and sometimes ERC20


[08-Nov-19 05:51 AM] Deleted User#0000
So basically the DEX is not useful for transferring small amounts of money/value? Edit: wrong example. With mass adoption, most ppl will be transferring smaller amounts i imagine. Not everyone is a whale moving 2BTC around all the time.


[08-Nov-19 05:51 AM] Acura#2748
It's not a bug - minimal swap amount is 0.00777 determined by protocol and the same for all coins. I'm agree that it's quite high amount in USD equialent. But from another side it's better to trade huge amounts of BTC because of tx fees.


[08-Nov-19 05:53 AM] cipi#4502
use something else other the bTC or ERC20, eg BCH or LTC or KMD and you can transfer low amounts of money

Ah oke, ill give it a try

It worked, i am now the proud owner of 0,27 LTC. So the guy who put up the sell order of LTC didn't know what he would get for it in return?

Or did he need to accept my swap?


[08-Nov-19 06:23 AM] TonyL#3577
Guy on other side put the order like a sell X of coin A for Y of coin B

in $ it is not much but when you get used to the 0.0001 of KMD + Ecosystem, it seems pretty high.

so there is no way to get rid of the dust left over?


[08-Nov-19 10:15 PM] gcharang#6833
no way through atomicDEX directly
one solution is to import the private key into a doge wallet with balance and let the dust be used there in a future transaction

any way doge dust should be of very low value
other than cluttering the ui, there is no harm I think


[08-Nov-19 10:20 PM] Jimm B.#9993
You're right, it has almost no value.  I just do not like dustüòè .  first I thought of a donate button in the app ... but if you can not send the dust ...

Interest over time

 The values ‚Äã‚Äãindicate the search interest relative to the highest point in the chart for the selected region in the specified time period.  The value 100 stands for the highest popularity of this search term.  The value 50 means that the term is half as popular and the value 0 means that there was not enough data for this term.

Hmm, i cancelled the order, tried again and it worked instantly


[09-Nov-19 04:12 AM] Oszy#5734
if you tried full available amount for any of the coins, reducing it a little will make it trough

Maybe my wifi was gone for a second? I did not try full amount both times.


[09-Nov-19 04:27 AM] Oszy#5734
could be the amount was not avaiable as the maker had another swap started in the meantime


[09-Nov-19 04:27 AM] Oszy#5734
just have to redo it sometimes if it doesn't match in 20-30 seconds

From experience, if it doesnt match within the first minute, better to remove and retry

@ca333 - some feedback on AtomicDEX

I have been using the Atomic DEX app for a while now and have made a number of successful trades. It is really easy to use and the UX is generally fantastic. I do have one important piece of feedback on the trading interface, however.

You need to add the balance of each holding to the main trade screen when a sell or buy order is entered on the trading screens. Currently nothing is shown (at least on my version) when you select a particular coin to sell. If you don't want to trade your max balance, then as a user you are forced to go back to the previous screen and try to remember the balance and then enter ho much you want to trade. The balance of each coin account should be shown on the actual trade screen (& not just on the pop up window for coin selection). I have found that when demonstrating the App to others it is really easy to lose track of this information between screens. Other crypto wallet apps provide this information. You also provide it on the App's withdrawal screen. Ideally you should also show the equivalent value in USD.

I have also provided this feedback on the AtomicDEX website. Hopefully you will pick up this minor but important UX change. I can share a graphic of the suggested change if required.

@mercadinaut If you want to trade the maximum amount, you can just press max.


[10-Nov-19 09:54 PM] Jimm B.#9993
Sorry, I read wrong.  Nevertheless, you can find out the maximum by pressing Max.  nothing to remember.


[10-Nov-19 11:14 PM] Oszy#5734
What language  do you have set? IIRC in some languages the max button was out of screen. Post your phone model also, if you can't see max button might be a UI bug on a certain phone.


[10-Nov-19 11:14 PM] Oszy#5734
You can also see balance when selecting the coin, don't have to go back to main page.

@Oszy   OK - will do & will provide specifics on my phone model. The language set is English & yes I can see the "Max" button. I appreciate that the coin balance is on the previous screen and on the pop-up when you select the coin. My suggestion is to improve the UX as I have encountered this problem several times. Every other exchange I have used displays your balance on screen before you make a trade.

@Goku even if the coinomi mnemonic is supported, the existing seed phrases will work
they are the same format used in the rest of the Komodo eco-system like Agama and other wallets

right now, you can use Agama or the Ocean qt wallet to convert your AtomicDEX seed phrase to privatekey (wif) that will be accepted by most of the other wallets

I love the idea of AtomicDex and have tested it successfully a few times with real crypto.  However, one frustration as a user is if I'm in the middle of trying to fill out the DEX form, but I look away from my phone, to say check the price of the crypto I want to receive, when I come back to my phone, it's locked and after I put the phone password in, I then have to put the AtomicDEX password in, and THEN the form has reset.  It would be nice if the form didn't reset,  Thank you!

other than the makers publishing the details themselves, the only way to find a trading history is to have a mm2 node always online
and observing the orders that are broadcast and checking the involved blockchains if a disappeared order has been fulfilled

such a system is not implemenmted yet and is a huge undertaking (servers+storage and man hours to code), I don't know if the team is interested in implementing it

Improvement proposal to atomicdex coins transaction listings.  If you go through older transactions and always when atomicdex updates transactions from electrum servers it also relists them from beginning and you have to  start scrolling them through all over which is very annoying especially when you need to look some transaction.

Hi everyone!
I would like to know how the conversion of mnemonic (seed / 12 word) is converted to addresses?
When I import my mnemonics, I get completely different addresses through the Trust wallet and iancoleman.io/bip39/ service.

My version of ios 13.2


[12-Nov-19 05:18 AM] Oszy#5734
It may use a different derivation path? 
seed created in atomicdex & agama are 100% compatible with atomicdex
make sure you don't have extra space at the end / type it don't copy/paste see if it works that way


[12-Nov-19 05:24 AM] gcharang#6833
@AndrewVV you need to convert the atomicDEX seed words  to a wif using Agama <https://support.komodoplatform.com/support/solutions/articles/29000024495-export-private-key-wif-from-a-wallet-seed-or-pin-password>

the wif should be usable in all the other wallets

the way seed words are converted to addresses is different in the Komodo ecosystem compared to other wallets


[12-Nov-19 05:38 AM] Oszy#5734
@gcharang he can't use wif in atomicdex, i think he wants to use a trust wallet seed with atomicdex which might have been created on a different path


[12-Nov-19 05:39 AM] gcharang#6833

In your wallet accidentally there is no password overlay on the seed phrase?


[12-Nov-19 06:01 AM] Oszy#5734
I am not sure what is the path used in the other wallet, best if you create a new seed with atomicdex and send the coins over to the new address


[12-Nov-19 06:02 AM] Oszy#5734
copy/pasting, exposing seed that has coins on it, is never a good idea anyway


[12-Nov-19 06:42 AM] AndrewVV#0430
I tried creating a new account. I also tried to open my new seed in the Agama wallet. I see the same addresses. How do I know the relevant  derivation path?

My derivation paths
BTC: m/44'/0'/0'/0/0
ETH: m/44'/60'/0'/0/0


[12-Nov-19 06:50 AM] SHossain#0007
you can't use bip39/bip44 or similar seed phrase in atomicDEX or Agama. 
just create a new seed from atomicDEX or Agama and both of them will be interchangeable

[13-Nov-19 08:35 AM] Oszy#5734
I think it may be case sensitive? is the address you have all lowercase?


[13-Nov-19 08:36 AM] FtrSaroth#2069
Yes, all lowercase


[13-Nov-19 08:37 AM] FtrSaroth#2069
This is the address 

0x60d66ebed042f60120b552bee8f6c9e2af7d81d5


[13-Nov-19 08:55 AM] Oszy#5734
Do you have the non-lowercase version of this address?


[13-Nov-19 08:58 AM] FtrSaroth#2069
No, its from a exchange and its the only showed


[13-Nov-19 09:01 AM] TonyL#3577
@FtrSaroth `0x60D66eBED042f60120b552bEE8f6c9e2af7d81D5` mixed-case version - this one should work for you


[13-Nov-19 09:02 AM] TonyL#3577
https://etherscan.io/address/0x60d66ebed042f60120b552bee8f6c9e2af7d81d5 It's generating on etherscan lets say `Contract 0x60D66eBED042f60120b552bEE8f6c9e2af7d81D5`

why no USDT?

last i heard, the USDT erc20 contract is not compatible


[13-Nov-19 11:44 AM] jl777c#5810
and most of the USDT is some strange omni protocol if i remember right

are there are plans to USDT in future?


[13-Nov-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
maybe they will update their erc20 to a more standard form, maybe some other variant could be supported. with all the stablecoins supported, not sure USDT is a high priority


[13-Nov-19 12:05 PM] jl777c#5810
but it isnt up to me


[13-Nov-19 12:08 PM] Gig#0273
so OMNI not supported by DEX?


[13-Nov-19 12:09 PM] jl777c#5810
not now. not sure OMNI supports CLTV and hashlocks


[13-Nov-19 12:21 PM] Gig#0273
is this acceptable:


[13-Nov-19 12:21 PM] Gig#0273
``Notable by its absence is the beleaguered Tether (USDT), whose operations are being investigated by the NYAG. However, according to a source close to the project the omission is more likely due to USDT's non-standard ERC-20 contract which is incompatible with AtomicDEX. Additionally the platform lacks support for OMNI assets.``


[13-Nov-19 12:37 PM] jl777c#5810
not sure tether is beleaguered, they seem to be doing fine


[13-Nov-19 12:38 PM] jl777c#5810
why make any big deal out of it, it isnt supported due to technical reasons, nothing else.


[13-Nov-19 12:42 PM] Cryptoon#3362
For now, the platform lacks support for OMNI assets.

[13-Nov-19 08:53 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
What privacy mechanism does it use ?


[13-Nov-19 08:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Cryptonote and MW will require a good bit of work on their end to make it work .  Optional privacy coins shouldn‚Äôt be an issue.    There is a fee for the GUI integration as well


[13-Nov-19 08:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It depends on the difficulty of the chain

Improvment sucestion: when choosing ie. Kmd and next to which  coin to trade it might be good to atleast show coin ticker next to icon since when all coins are enabled its very hard to start quessing what is that ie. Pax coin if not familiar with icons.


[14-Nov-19 05:37 AM] Deleted User#0000
When is there gonna be a BNB-like solution for all the dust? Got like 10 dollars worth of dust spread over 5 coins. Would be nice to be able to swap them with 1 button click to the best KMD offer or something


[14-Nov-19 05:37 AM] jl777c#5810
i would imagine somebody would need to setup a service for such a thing, it is not really atomic swaps


[14-Nov-19 05:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
Isnt that the same as 5 little swaps (but automated to look for best offer with all 5 KMD pairs)?


[14-Nov-19 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
you overlook that dust amounts vs txfee for coins are rather large


[14-Nov-19 05:40 AM] Oszy#5734
if it's "dust" it may not be eligible for the minimum trade amount ofo 0.00777


[14-Nov-19 05:40 AM] Oszy#5734
+tx fee


[14-Nov-19 05:40 AM] jl777c#5810
and incurring the cost for swap is not worth it


[14-Nov-19 05:41 AM] jl777c#5810
however someone might offer a service of you sending them dust amounts in N different coins and sending back some KMD


[14-Nov-19 05:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
Ah ok yeah i forgot about that. Well its quite annoying to have dust laying around allthough the dollarvalue is low. Maybe its my OCD that i dont like those odds numbers

He could not completely understand it so far.


[14-Nov-19 09:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
order matching is p2p


[14-Nov-19 09:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
how can it be on chain if there are 2 different chains?

@gcharang maybe you can answer that too ?


[14-Nov-19 09:50 AM] gcharang#6833
there hasn't been an external audit on mm2 yet
it is still in development and new features constantly added
it will definitely have an audit before full public release

>  if the order matching is "on-chain" ? 
it is not on-chain, it is better than that: fully p2p
every mm2 instance creates its own local orderbook based on the orders it hears on the network
more info: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/atomicdex.html#the-decentralized-orderbook>

> how can it be on chain if there are 2 different chains?
on-chain happens in proxy token DEXs; it is better than some DEXs that follow a similar protocol as ours but use a centralised orderbook like a website

ours is better than both of the above cases as it is completely p2p and works with home desktops, mobiles with 3g/4g/wifi etc.,

People who are doing big transactions with exchange otc desks likely wont care about atomic swaps via mm2 until they understand how much they could save on fees and by cutting out middlemen.                     They likely already have bulletproof legal entities in crypto friendly countries and dont have to worry about door kickers and alphabet agency extortion.

hi guys, i've a quick question on atomic dex, if I have orders open the phone has to be on and connected to the internet for possible matching? If I shut down the phone the orders are still matchable? I asking because in other dex like bisq etc. is that way.

As it is peer to peer, if a peer shuts down, you cannot match orders anymore

@Cryptoon but the app has to be open too? I have a pin code to go in so I don't know if the app is not open my peer is still active


[15-Nov-19 07:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Which os? Ios or android?


[15-Nov-19 07:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think on ios for now the app needs to remain open, best to keep the screen from going into standby. For android it can run in the background.


[15-Nov-19 07:05 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Best to doublecheck with @ca333

@jorian which coin were you swapping DAI against?

I was trying to get some DAI with KMD


[15-Nov-19 07:31 AM] jorian#4555
must say i wasn't using mobile atomicdex, so i might be doing something wrong. i made sure i had ETH balance, but still it only sends the takerfee, then waits a while and then times out


[15-Nov-19 07:56 AM] ca333#0333
ok i see - feel free to DM me your config and i will try to reproduce it through CLI


[15-Nov-19 08:10 AM] cipi#4502
i found the problem: someone bought all ETH from that node, so there is not enough ETH left to pay txfees for other ERC20 tokens
the only solution to this problem is to disable ETH orders... and that is what i will do now...


[15-Nov-19 08:12 AM] jorian#4555
that's what i expected


[15-Nov-19 08:13 AM] jorian#4555
it might be an idea to remove orders from the orderbook for ERC20 tokens, once ETH doesn't have balance.


[15-Nov-19 08:13 AM] jorian#4555
but not sure if that is a workable solution


[15-Nov-19 08:13 AM] ca333#0333
or keep the ETH orders and just set max. volume to a value under the ETH balance to not run into the same situation again


[15-Nov-19 08:14 AM] ca333#0333
it would be like "reserving" the diff. between maxvol and balance for ERC trades


[15-Nov-19 08:14 AM] jorian#4555
could also work


[15-Nov-19 08:15 AM] cipi#4502
orders are updated every minute... with `max:true`, i do not check the balance before posting orders


[15-Nov-19 08:19 AM] cipi#4502
ok, DAI swaps should work again... ETH orders removed...


[15-Nov-19 09:04 AM] paia#7713

sorry, 
<https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/atomicdex-walkthrough.html>
in the step that says "Setting Up the Coin List"
you can add the coin you are interested in

for now, most BTC forks and ERC20 are supported out of the box

[16-Nov-19 09:15 AM] gcharang#6833
@HighOnLife this is for adding to the cli, which you can do locally for yourself and submit a PR along with the proof of swaps (5 txns) - this is free
for adding into the atomicDEX mobile, there is a listing fee

Out of curiosity, about how much time (hrs) on average, does it take to add a project like BNB, an Ethereum based ERC20) project, or one in the Komodo Ecosystem?
Btw we are very appreciative of your hard work and very proud of the project.


[17-Nov-19 10:06 PM] gcharang#6833
I am not sure which blockchain tech BNB uses, so can't comment on that

adding  a Komodo Smart chain is just writing a json and submitting a PR to the coins repo <https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins>
```json
{
    "coin": "LABS",
    "asset": "LABS",
    "fname": "KMD Labs",
    "rpcport": 40265,
    "txversion": 4,
    "overwintered": 1,
    "mm2": 1,
    "required_confirmations": 2
  }
```
adding erc20 is similar but, the contract has to be verified if it has all the necessary methods. most standard erc20 should be compatible


[17-Nov-19 10:07 PM] gcharang#6833
* electrum servers and explorer links should be submitted too


[17-Nov-19 10:10 PM] J-Dog#9487
BNB is BEP2, which is Binance Chain token type (BEP2)


[17-Nov-19 10:11 PM] J-Dog#9487
It is similar to Tendermint.


[17-Nov-19 10:13 PM] gcharang#6833
we haven't integrated any tendermint protocol coins/tokens yet
so it will take a lot of time to implement the first one

Lol CZ probably enjoys weighing down the Eth network


[17-Nov-19 10:17 PM] gcharang#6833
yeah, if it is ERC20 and has the required methods, it can be added very easily to the cli


[17-Nov-19 10:20 PM] gcharang#6833
> I'm been using it since initial beta and I'm trying to get an idea of the time and the effort, put into it.
we have ETH/erc20 and btc protocol (btc forks, zcash and its forks and komodo and its smart chains) swaps already implemented
so adding one of those is just adding their details to a file and doing a test swap

for new protocols, it is a completely different story
we need to get in touch with their developers and code their swap entirely from scratch. So, it depends

or maybe just squeeze a clause in there
`17.(c). You agree unequivocally, for the duration of usage of this software, to automatically transfer 50% of every transaction received to mrlynch.`

p.s.: i am in no way associated with atomicdex, but that looks like a good clause since most will agree anyway

there's also a thing called reasonable effort just in case someone decides to sue atomicdex devs maybe.. if a user loses funds due to his/her own mistake (bad trade) one can argue reasonable measures have been taken to highlight to the user that trading is risky

I never agreed with the bitcoiners who wanted to do a kind of ATM/OTC between people to exchange fiat to BTC with unlimited amounts and without KYC. They are serious about this idea. Whatever I disagree with them, I like them and we talk frequently


[18-Nov-19 01:45 PM] mrlynch#5735

[18-Nov-19 01:46 PM] phm87#7395
CG: their original idea was to do everything without fiat ... but after more discussions, they aimed for a combo fiat/BTC (still a project)


[18-Nov-19 01:46 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
fiat = KYC
learn it, accept it, or don't use it


[18-Nov-19 01:47 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
`their original idea was to do everything without fiat ...`
that is exactly nowhere in the whitepaper (as off-topic as it may be)


[18-Nov-19 01:48 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
direct transfer of value neither implies or forbids the use of fiat


[18-Nov-19 01:51 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
also, as my final bit to your off-topic obsession:
BTC is not Bitcoin as described in the whitepaper (the current design cannot handle adoption)

Any stable based orders to buy kmd seems like there is none

I think @siu had some orders up to buy DAI with kmd

so where can i find what assets are listed on atomicdex?


[20-Nov-19 08:12 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Download it


[20-Nov-19 08:14 AM] Torankoku#4818
why do i have to download it to see the assets listed?


[20-Nov-19 08:14 AM] Torankoku#4818
it should be listed to let users know before they decide to download it


[20-Nov-19 08:18 AM] Torankoku#4818
someone should list the 25 assets the komodo blog says the dex has on the website or something

Noob question: do the swaps on the atomicdex app make use of the komodonetwork or is it completely independent of each other?


[20-Nov-19 10:13 AM] Alright#0419
does not rely on komodo network, is it's own separate off chain network


[20-Nov-19 10:13 AM] Alright#0419
barely a "network", just a way to get two peers connected reliably


[20-Nov-19 10:14 AM] atlas#9008
So no need for kmdcoins to do the swaps?


[20-Nov-19 10:14 AM] Alright#0419
don't need KMD

One additional question: is atomicdex a protocol or an app or both? I mean can anyone build an app that can do swaps with the 'atomicdex protocol'?


[20-Nov-19 12:33 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Marketmaker 2.0 is the engine. Atomicdex is the chassis

@Cryptoon ok, thanks. Was just wondering how censorship resistent doing swaps is?

How do you mean? If its possible to ban peers?

as censorship resistant as a normal tx on the respective blockchains

I encountered an error after the following command

If you require these components, please install and use the latest successful build version,

After determining the correct date, install it with a command such as:

    rustup toolchain install nightly-2018-12-27

Then you can use the toolchain with commands such as:

    cargo +nightly-2018-12-27 build```
I tried the following command but I encountered the same problem:
```rustup update nightly```
How can I fix my problem ?


[20-Nov-19 02:02 PM] TonyL#3577
@phm87 looks like you don't have any problem - it's just info prints

```rustup install nightly-2019-10-06

[20-Nov-19 02:03 PM] phm87#7395
I don't know which version of nightly of rust I can use, I've never used rust before today. I'll try with your commands thank you


[20-Nov-19 02:04 PM] jorian#4555
that's really all there is to do. if you're on macos, some additional step might be involved


[20-Nov-19 02:04 PM] phm87#7395
first command return info prints but also an ``error: some components unavailable for download for channel nightly-2019-10-06: 'clippy', 'rustfmt'``

I'm on ubuntu


[20-Nov-19 02:04 PM] jorian#4555
then just build, it should all be fine

[20-Nov-19 02:10 PM] phm87#7395
ok it is working now, I had to do this:
```git clone https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/
cd atomicDEX-API
rustup install nightly
rustup override set nightly

cargo clean

it's peer to peer swap, not a centralized orderbook.

if there is no peer there is no swap


[21-Nov-19 06:05 AM] keda666#1678
why can't it just push noticfication me when thats a match?


[21-Nov-19 06:05 AM] Oszy#5734
1) because it's beta now
2) because Apple


[21-Nov-19 06:05 AM] keda666#1678
so android work?


[21-Nov-19 06:06 AM] Oszy#5734
on android you can leave the app running in the background and it matches trades yes

I found an error creating a transaction in atomicDEX when I try to exchange several coins, in particular 10kmd for QUTUM, the transaction does not work, but when I change the same 10 coins individually 10 times in a row, everything happens


[21-Nov-19 07:12 AM] Oszy#5734
You mean the order doesn't match?


[21-Nov-19 07:14 AM] Oszy#5734
In that case always try to swap a little bit less than the max available amount

@ca333 Wow, that's really great!


[21-Nov-19 11:06 PM] Mark81#4505
Hmmm... AtomicDex in is really good gor trading. So my idea for feature to add later on road is to make it able to change software keys ie. to gameplatform such as steam, uplay, origin etc for coins.  So trade keys for certain amount of coins or even better for certain amount of usd value for selected coins. User can list their keys description and set ask price for it.


[22-Nov-19 02:40 AM] J-Dog#9487
How does someone ensure that they aren't buying the same keys, as someone else?  @Mark81


[22-Nov-19 02:43 AM] Oszy#5734
it's data in exchange for coins, i am not sure if atomicdex is the best for that idea. just set up a webshop with kmd / verus payment gateway and sell the keys for crypto


[22-Nov-19 02:44 AM] Oszy#5734
everything is possible but not in the current state of mm2 i believe


[22-Nov-19 02:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
guess you would have to tokenize the keys @Oszy ?


[22-Nov-19 02:52 AM] Cryptoon#3362
only benefit to do so is you can prevent people from selling counterfeit keys or whtaever, but not sure how much of a problem that is in reality


[22-Nov-19 02:53 AM] Oszy#5734
even if you get a key that doesn't work, how do you get refund after tx is done?

Hi,
I'l trying to test AtomicDEX-API, I was able to build it, thank you Oszy, TonyL, jorian and others. Now, I'm trying to do <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/developer-docs/blob/master/docs/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/atomicdex-walkthrough.md> I'm following the document in the order it is written. After executing the command ``~/atomicDEX-API/target/debug$ stdbuf -oL ./mm2 "{\"gui\":\"MM2GUI\",\"netid\":9999, \"userhome\":\"/${HOME#"/"}\", \"passphrase\":\"xxx\", \"rpc_password\":\"yyy\"}" &
[1] 50855`` there is no output and I don't see ``mm2`` in output of ``ps aux | grep mm2`` Did I miss a step ? Should I replace ``HOME`` ?


[22-Nov-19 02:53 AM] Oszy#5734
also would have to include key as memo or something


[22-Nov-19 02:53 AM] phm87#7395
(maybe I should ask the question in #dev-marketmaker I'm not sure if it is the right discord channel)


[22-Nov-19 02:54 AM] Oszy#5734
looks okay to me ü§î


[22-Nov-19 02:55 AM] gcharang#6833
removing `&` at the end should show the output


[22-Nov-19 02:55 AM] Oszy#5734
ah yes


[22-Nov-19 02:56 AM] gcharang#6833
and check htop to see if mm2 is running


[22-Nov-19 02:56 AM] phm87#7395
I tried when removing it but I saw nothing. And no mm2 process in ps aux


[22-Nov-19 02:56 AM] phm87#7395
I can check htop but I think that I will see the same processes that I see in ps aux


[22-Nov-19 02:57 AM] phm87#7395
Nothing related to mm2 in htop


[22-Nov-19 03:02 AM] Oszy#5734
any terminal output at all? do you have to terminate it or it doesn't start at all?


[22-Nov-19 03:04 AM] Mark81#4505
Reputation system for sellers would be of course needed.   Sellers would buy these directly from suppliers and try to make profit in between. Joltfun.com is good site that sells games for btc.

@phm87 I just built the latest and used the exact command you have posted

there is output and I can see mm2 in `ps aux`
maybe your instance is crashing ?

Are there plans for DEX asset to be made compatible to hold on a ledger (and receive the rewards which are going to be in KMD i understand)?


[22-Nov-19 03:39 AM] jl777c#5810
you can just use the same address as your ledger KMD for DEX. you dont need to do anything with the DEX other than to just have it


[22-Nov-19 03:40 AM] phm87#7395
Ok I will try to rebuild it and retest. I had issues with rust, maybe I am not using the right rust version @gcharang thank you

{Reactions}

[22-Nov-19 04:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
@jl777c so i can send them right now to the KMD "app" on the ledger and hold then there? Will they be visible in the ledger live program?


[22-Nov-19 04:38 AM] gcharang#6833
@Deleted User say your DEX coins are in Address Raaaaaa in agama
and your KMD address on ledger is Rbbbbbbb

you can send the DEX coins to the Rbbbbbbb address and verify that they reached in an explorer
when the KMD rewards for DEX holdings are sent, they will be received by the Rbbbbbbb address

you won't be able to see the DEX on ledger live
if you want to move the DEX coins in the future, you will have to export privkey of the Rbbbbbbb KMD address from ledger and import it in Agama


[22-Nov-19 04:39 AM] Deleted User#0000
Oke, thx for the clear explanation


[22-Nov-19 05:28 AM] phm87#7395
it did not start at all : no output at all. I used ``cargo build`` to build it, I'll rebuild it with the other command


[22-Nov-19 05:29 AM] gcharang#6833

@Hember actually Komodo team did all the code for COMMOD, and they host the mining pool and explorer, etc.  

My only real contribution is paying thousands of dollars to Komodo team, and continuing to pay them every month if I want the coin to keep working.  It barely works anyway, and AtomicDEX still says it's worth 0 even though it's being traded at Unnamed.  We never got a compiled desktop wallet, or an explorer with an API that CoinGecko can use, so the coin will probably be dead next month if I can't pay the monthly fee for AtomicDEX.

[23-Nov-19 03:40 AM] CHMEX#0686

The coin itself will not die just because its not on atomic dex there are enough nodes running to keep the coin alive

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #129: Scrolling problem in wallet transactions
When you have a lot of transaction history in atomicdex wallet with certain coin and you go through those transactions by scrolling down them and every time wallet is updating transactions from spv servers wallet reset to most view history to most recent transaction. This makes impossible to check transactions in that time period especially when there are lot of transaction to scroll down and search it in time between checks from SPV.

[24-Nov-19 08:54 AM] jl777c#5810
without a homomorphic crypto signing method that is supported by the blockchain, it is hard for me to see a way to do a decentralized 2FA. most likely these other systems use some sort of multisig with a centrally controlled (or decrypted) privkey


[24-Nov-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
the problem is that if it is on the blockchain, it is on the blockchain and so everybody can extract the privkey


[24-Nov-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
if it isnt on the blockchain, then it requires trusing whomever to produce the key (or signature)


[24-Nov-19 08:55 AM] jl777c#5810
just because someone uses the words "decentralized 2FA" to describe something, it doesnt mean that it is actually a decentralized 2FA

I can confirm this problem with 0.2.7 on iOS. It's impossible to view old KMD transactions since after scrolling down to them, after 1-2 seconds, the page "resets" itself and jumps back to the newest transactions.


[24-Nov-19 09:13 AM] wl#4107
When we introduce the desired amount to swap, the input of the asset we are trading for should be auto filled with the the amount based on the latest value. That way we know if the orders available are fair...

Right now I have to access coinmarketcap or another and see how much is kmd (for ex) and how much is rvn (for ex) and do the math to know if the orders in the book are fair or to set my own order...


[24-Nov-19 09:14 AM] wl#4107

QR scanner supposed to read QR address to send to. And it's what it does in a way - reads json in Agama QR and pastes it to Address field.
We will consider to add json scans support as feature.

I had another instance with a QR code generated from an older version of the Ledger Live App (the wallet software for the Ledger Nano S hard wallet). After scanning its QR code, a string like 
komodo:R...
was put into the address field which was also not a valid address. Not reproducable with the latest version of Ledger Live app anymore, however. But still maybe something to consider.

Anyone understand how their atomic swap process works in practise? On paper it looks a lot like atomicdex, but they dont show the technical side of things...


[27-Nov-19 12:23 PM] steinsg8#0288
Can I use atomicdex for trades yet?


[27-Nov-19 12:23 PM] steinsg8#0288
Is it safe?


[27-Nov-19 12:23 PM] steinsg8#0288
What DeX is safe to use at this moment (as an alternative to escrow)


[27-Nov-19 12:27 PM] t_dan#3334
@steinsg8 Yes it's working and it's safe. I don't think there's another DEX supporting KMD yet.


[27-Nov-19 12:28 PM] t_dan#3334
Even if a swap fails, your funds will be fetched from the temporary escrow address by the app after a while.


[27-Nov-19 12:39 PM] actionslacks#4072
It seems like decred is planning to have a considerable amount of human administrators oversee the swaps. I don't really understand the advantage of such a system besides complying with regulatory oversight.


[27-Nov-19 12:42 PM] jl777c#5810
```Penalties
The primary penalty for breaches of conduct is a ban, which includes loss of trading privileges, forfeiture of registration fee, and immediate revocation of any unfilled orders.

Less drastic punitive measures such as a cool-down period may be considered for minor, first-time or infrequent conduct violations.```


[27-Nov-19 12:43 PM] jl777c#5810
seems totally unenforceable to random pubkeys on the internet


[27-Nov-19 03:36 PM] PTYX#6840
It's probably just legal mumbo jumbo


[27-Nov-19 06:57 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
They probably make you register and whitelist pubkeys


[27-Nov-19 09:42 PM] PTYX#6840
Yeah that would be an option


[27-Nov-19 09:42 PM] PTYX#6840
I see that as viable for a regulated market like derivatives


[27-Nov-19 10:12 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes,  this is why I suggested this functionality awhile back.  If the idea is to get exchanges and professionals involved they need to know who they are trading with  for compliance purposes.


[27-Nov-19 10:24 PM] jl777c#5810
who manages the registration and blacklisting?


[27-Nov-19 10:27 PM] jl777c#5810
i would imagine they become subject to the regulations. maybe somebody wants to setup the registered DEX and make a special mm2 that uses the centralized DB of valid pubkeys. personally, i have no interest in such things, but i do understand maybe this is something that some people would want. nothing prevents this from being done, but it would take mm2 changes to automate the blacklisting


[27-Nov-19 11:07 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@jl777c  if a DEX were to create a modified mm2 would it still be sharing liquidity with the original DEX or is it its own system at that point?


[27-Nov-19 11:10 PM] gcharang#6833
if the only parts changed are related to whitelisting pubkeys, then liquidity will be reduced to only those pubkeys


[27-Nov-19 11:12 PM] jl777c#5810
depends on the details of the blacklisting.


[27-Nov-19 11:12 PM] jl777c#5810
if it is a blacklisting only, then most of the liquidity would be shared, but if it requires whitelisting to trade at all, it would create a separate liquidity pool


[27-Nov-19 11:13 PM] jl777c#5810
of course, if there was just a single whiteliested pubkey that ran something similar to the CEX liquidity bridge, this would effectively pool the two liquidity together

How long are your funds locked when a swap failed


[29-Nov-19 09:43 AM] TonyL#3577
If you have your taker payment locked inside the failed swap just keep app alive and funds will be returned eventually (usually it taking just few hours for not BTC and not BCH as taker payment)

I tried swapping kmd for some dex but it timed out, now it says on the main screen in still got my balance. But when i try to swap that kmd for something else it says that the majority (the amount i tried to swap the dex for) is locked. Its hours since the timed out swap

@marktylerhere is info on the supernet asset


[29-Nov-19 11:41 AM] marktyler#0324
So if i have 100 DEX, then what? Explain like I'm your grandmama


[29-Nov-19 11:45 AM] Deleted User#0000
You will have 100 of 1 million DEX coins, so you will be eligible for 100/1.000.000th of the fee rewards by users who use the DEX api


[29-Nov-19 12:05 PM] LocoMB#8593
which will be paid out in .. KMD? to the same KMD address that the DEX are held in?


[29-Nov-19 12:07 PM] Oszy#5734
yes


[29-Nov-19 12:34 PM] marktyler#0324
The kmd in the dex address, at what point does it payout?


[29-Nov-19 12:37 PM] Markus#5464
@marktyler when the total balance in the fee address reaches 1 mil usd


[29-Nov-19 12:40 PM] hastrup#8742
@marktylerSo that means if the dex api gets to be in the top ten daily volume for an exchange, as of right now that around 1b usd. The fee is around 0.15% so for 1b daily volume you get 1.5 m in fees the dex coin gets 50% of the fee to share in 1m shares, that's 750k so if you got 100 dex coin and the daily wolume is 1b you would get 75 usd rev share for that day. The good think about dex api is everyone can make a gui on top of it So it's not only atomicdex that needs to get to 1b in daily volume but every other dex combine there is about 5+ project right now working on guis for dex api. :)

Where can you find how many times some torrent has been downloaded?


[29-Nov-19 11:27 PM] Oszy#5734
on whatever site you downloaded it from? what do you mean? that number is on the tracker server, how does this relate to atomicdex?


[29-Nov-19 11:32 PM] Mark81#4505
Real P2p networks are not sql servers that save data to central points.


[29-Nov-19 11:35 PM] Oszy#5734
then you also know that real p2p network doesn't count that, you can only see uploaded data , because not all your peers are necessarily downloading all the files from just you.


[29-Nov-19 11:35 PM] Mark81#4505

But as I understand it. You can calculate it though the fees collected?

That's true.


[29-Nov-19 11:39 PM] hastrup#8742

How applicable is the model in atomicDEX where the market maker no longer determines at what prices they are ready to buy or sell tokens. Instead, use a mechanism that combines everyone's liquidity and creates markets in accordance with a specific algorithm. This algorithm, known as the automated market maker (AMM), sets prices for the user according to some predefined set of rules. An example of a very simple AMM is a bot strategy, which puts out buy and sell orders exactly one dollar respectively lower and higher than the average market price and constantly reviews order placement as the market moves.

I‚Äôm talking about using an option like the ‚ÄúMarket Result Maker Model‚Äù. (Link in the repository for review: https://github.com/runtimeverification/verified-smart-contracts/blob/uniswap/uniswap/xyk.pdf) This AMM has the feature of being able to always provide liquidity, no matter how the size of the application is large or how small the size of the liquidity pool is. The trick is to asymptotically increase the price of a coin as the desired amount of purchase or sale increases. Despite the fact that large orders are disadvantaged in this system, the system never needs to worry about a lack of liquidity. Liquidity will literally always be.

A common liquidity pool, in combination with the above technology, would provide liquidity on demand and add value to the KMD token as a liquidity pool that is blocked on atomicDEX, which is completely absent. the question is how difficult it is at this stage to import it into the exchange or a separate browser plugin. But for this, the DeFi concept at Komodo

Just give an example, an example using the KMD / KmdUSD trading pair. Let's assume that market makers co-financed a pool of 100,000 KmdUSD and 1,000 KMD. DEX takes these two values and multiplies them (100,000 x 1000 = 100,000,000).
initial conditions: KmdUSD liquidity                    KMD liquidity                          product
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† 100,000                                         1,000                                   100,000,000
¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†    x                                                     y                                                 k


[30-Nov-19 02:38 PM] Optimus#6435
The purpose of DEX for this particular trading pair is to preserve the result, i.e. multiplying these two values, equal to 100 million, regardless of how many trading operations take place. The key formula to keep in mind is x * y = k, where x and y are the number of coins in the liquidity pool and k is the result. To keep the constant k, x and y must be inversely dependent, i.e. if x goes up, then y goes down, and vice versa. When a trader makes a KMD purchase under this contract, he increases x (since they add KmdUSD to the liquidity pool) and decreases y (when they remove KMDUSD from the liquidity pool). But this scheme does not scale linearly. Trying to buy 100 KMD instead of 10 KMD does not just require 10 times more KmdUSD. In fact, it increases asymptotically.

The price depends on the size of the order the further you move along the curve, the less you get for one unit of currency that you give away


[30-Nov-19 03:00 PM] Optimus#6435
This is good food for thought! For example, the Chinese will give us the necessary liquidity if there are collateral DeFi instruments and stablecoin based on KMD support so I leave it here maybe someone can implement this in the form of code all the more there is the opportunity to work with python - go for it guys:KMD:

[01-Dec-19 12:07 AM] Optimus#6435
@polycryptoblog Yes, this was discussed already, I remember! But the suggestion is to implement, at least as a plug-in in the browser, the concept of solving the liquidity problem that I described using just # cc-pegs! Moreover, the liquidity pool if it is replenished not only with stable coins tied to the dollar but also with assets such as gold and stock exchange shares, then the pool will very quickly attract those who will block their KMDs and thus increase the value of the token and the whole platform as a whole, but the problem is the market makers will be resolved

[01-Dec-19 10:29 AM] jl777c#5810
to receive what you buy, you need to transfer the ERC20, to do that it requires ETH for the gas


[01-Dec-19 12:38 PM] Regnar#6164
I meant just ETH, not a token or anything. Exchanging KMD to ETH requires the person with KMD to also have ETH. That was what confused me, that you can't buy ETH unless you have ETH and pay the gas fee (makes sense with tokens) I figured the TX fee was paid by seller of ETH


[01-Dec-19 12:40 PM] jl777c#5810
it should be possible to spend part of the proceeds for the ETH gas fee. that isnt the case?


[01-Dec-19 12:42 PM] cipi#4502
the taker who buys the ETH also needs to pay gas afaik, because the maker (selling ETH) only pays for the tx from his address to the contract address... but the taker needs to call the contract in order to get the ETH from the contract address to his own address

afaik, the contract should not have any balance... the balance is just ETH/ERC20 that are still stuck from failed swaps

a successfull ETH swap should be represented by 2 txs in the contract https://etherscan.io/address/0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871
both are shown as incoming, one has the swapped ETH value in column `Value`, the other one has 0


[01-Dec-19 12:55 PM] cipi#4502
eg
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x303d81e8bf1b514dc8212164d807f21a9d0974e0e4fe9d433c6437ed115e8a7b
and
https://etherscan.io/tx/0x935bc784fcba9b1fccf963691418d2ffb44b9f8198ba83b9540d0fc49b813e49


[01-Dec-19 12:59 PM] cipi#4502
if you look closer at the second transaction, you see that it contains the call to the function `receiverSpend` of the contract
this is what transfers the ETH to the taker (buying the ETH)... and this is what costs gas for the taker... the call to this function of the contract to get the bought ETH


[01-Dec-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
so it is due to ETH design that you need ETH even as taker


[01-Dec-19 01:00 PM] jl777c#5810
for other coins, it isnt needed


[01-Dec-19 01:01 PM] cipi#4502
yes, or the design of the contract... i have no idea if it is possible to design the contract a bit different, so it takes the needed ETH for the gas from somewhere else (eg, maker sends a bit more ETH then needed)


[01-Dec-19 01:02 PM] cipi#4502
https://etherscan.io/address/0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871#code
this is the code... someone who knows solidity can tell us üòâ


[01-Dec-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
it would likely require an extra transaction, which costs more gas... and only makes sense for the first one when the taker has no ETH


[01-Dec-19 01:07 PM] jl777c#5810
probably not unreasonable to expect someone doing ETH/ERC20 stuff to have some ETH

[02-Dec-19 01:15 AM] Markus#5464
@zenosama atomicdex do not allow privacy swaps as of now, therefore not supported but its being developed atm. I read somewhere that it would be ready Q1 2020. Not sure if that includes XMR tho but u will be able to swap Pirate which is more anonymous than XMR


[02-Dec-19 01:16 AM] zenosama#5371
@Markus and where could I read about Pirate, to understand why is it more anonymous?

i wonder if that can penetrate KNOX chip on Samsung phones to steal from the sandboxed apps ü§î


[04-Dec-19 09:24 AM] Oszy#5734
How to spot it:
```
An app or service that you‚Äôre already logged into is asking for a login.
Permission popups that does not contain an app name.
Permissions asked from an app that shouldn‚Äôt require or need the permissions it asks for. For example, a calculator app asking for GPS permission.
Typos and mistakes in the user interface.
Buttons and links in the user interface that does nothing when clicked on.
Back button does not work like expected.
```


[04-Dec-19 09:30 AM] SHossain#0007
KNOX works like secured virtual machine which is like Qubes OS. But, users can't copy paste info to/from host. Also, when you run an app from Secure Folder, you can't make any screenshot due to security policy. So, if you use Samsung KNOX for banking or crypto wallet, your funds might be safe. But, still would be open to other vulnerabilities like mic and camera usage by the malware.


[04-Dec-19 09:31 AM] Oszy#5734
only if you give the permission


[04-Dec-19 09:31 AM] Oszy#5734
but why would you give a banking app microphone and camera perms


[04-Dec-19 09:31 AM] SHossain#0007
banking app might need camera permission to scan cheques.


[04-Dec-19 09:31 AM] SHossain#0007
microphone, not sure why would they

[04-Dec-19 09:33 AM] SHossain#0007

Hi! If your funds were locked in a failed swap you'll get it back eventually. Please note that if you're on iOS you need to keep the app opened / screen turned on for some time (mm2 can't work on this OS in background yet but it'll be improved in one of the coming updates)

@Oszy sound notifications playing if you have maker order up or if you have swap in progress. Also there is custom notification on swap finishing.
 It was implemented mostly for iOS (will allow mm2 to work in background). In AtomicDEX settings you can minimize the sound volume of these notifications

for android we can certainly implement a "silent sound" - for iOS we simply can't. However, we can work out a sound/format that isn't annoying. Maybe being able to chose the sound will be an improvement: "Female with irish accents" vs. "Male with scotch accent", "Beeps", etc.


[06-Dec-19 09:15 AM] Oszy#5734
a beep every minute would still be less annoying than a continuous sound


[06-Dec-19 09:16 AM] jl777c#5810
you cant have a very low volume (close to inaudible) sound on iOs?


[06-Dec-19 09:18 AM] ca333#0333
you can - but the goal is to get the app approval from apple - so we had to declare the application as an app which needs sound-notifications (key-feature) since that is one of the few options we had to be able to keep the app running in the background. If there is no sound it will be interpreted as a bypass of the "no app can run in the background" rule - and that would bring us back to the old situation.

[06-Dec-19 09:21 AM] jl777c#5810
24khz at the lowest volume that is still a notification would indeed not be heard by most people

{Reactions}
üëç 

[06-Dec-19 09:23 AM] ca333#0333
the "mute" config setting basically sets the volume to a very low level where it still can be heard minimally - and that "still can be heard" is very essential for the way we presented the DEX app to apple.


[06-Dec-19 09:23 AM] jl777c#5810
ok, i understand apple can have some strict rules


[06-Dec-19 09:24 AM] ca333#0333
our plan B would be a VOIP integration - basically a OTC feature so that DEX clients can have VOIP calls with each other based on pubkey. But this would be an overkill at this stage since the sound solution seems to work well so far...


[06-Dec-19 09:25 AM] ca333#0333
(VOIP apps are another classification that allows execution of background process on iOS)


[06-Dec-19 09:25 AM] ca333#0333
yea - Apple has some strict rules. The reason is that otherwise apps could drain the battery and let it look like poor apple device/tech...

[06-Dec-19 05:29 PM] saturday#4156
recent version, the fee is comming out  once and coin is out once.


[06-Dec-19 06:59 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
Playing silent sounds on iOS is unlikely an option, it is an old and infamous trick, iOS reviewers are well-aware of it and it gets applications banned most of the time.


[06-Dec-19 07:01 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
But reading this discussion I see that the annoying sound is mostly the one we have when there are active orders but no ongoing swaps. I think we can tune the volume of that one even lower. And we can turn it off altogether on Android, where we don't have to play the sound all the time to stay alive.
Just my two cents.


[06-Dec-19 07:55 PM] 9oklp#8901
HEX is now the 2nd largest erc20 by tx after tether, their Telegram community is growing rapidly, Richard Heart is a master at promotion and marketing, it would be great to see HEX  traded on AtomicDEX,  the exposure for Komodo would be awesome!

AtomicDEX could be the wings above HEX's wind, RH blows a lot of hot air!


[06-Dec-19 08:16 PM] J.J.#3939
Phones make annoying sounds so I always keep the volume off anyway. Besides that, AtomicDEX is really cool. Makes it very easy to diversify a portion of my crypto holdings. Not to mention getting exposure to some cutting edge projects.

Thats not possible cuz of strict release requirements. Sound notification needs to be app-related and not a OS conditioned feature to bypass background process limitation.

"cuz of strict release requirements."

No they are not setting but in source code this playing sound cannot be ruled out by software automaticaly in terms  of  operating system where it is running.


[08-Dec-19 03:07 AM] Mark81#4505
So if Apple sees in code that software is checking if you're in ios then play sound and if in Android then dont they won't pass it. It affects in this way to both worlds by their market leader position.

@ca333 when sound is neccesary, why not make sound of waves or better....fighting komodowaran?


[08-Dec-19 09:20 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
AtomicDEX is in beta and we're only just started testing this functionality. The major question now is whether the Apple would approve the background mode. If they will, then we'll be further improving this functionality with things like choosing different sounds, allowing you to use the sounds from your own sound library and such. Anyhow, thanks for testing the app!

Keeps crashing after update. Delete and redownload?


[08-Dec-19 11:40 AM] Optimus#6435
now, during a swap, there is still some terrible sound of the voice of screaming children of some snatches of adult voices and this against the background of ringing coins and the sound of a drain

@MorganJekyll Downloading a previous build  (such as 0.2.7) should help for now as a workaround, TestFlight allows you to pick a previous build.

@NNoperator you should check your config too
https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins#L2988
DEX needs `txversion:4` and `overwindtered:1` set, just like KMD, else it will not work

Short feedback on the new version on the iPhone:
I made the sound quieter in the settings, then turned it completely quiet in the soundless mode - so I could go to sleep overnight and still keep my order online without any disturbing sound. Great

How to Android soundless mode??? Ive put my Media volume at zero for now.


[09-Dec-19 08:49 AM] gcharang#6833 (pinned)
>>> 10:32 PM]TonyL: sound notification  was implemented mostly for iOS (will allow mm2 to work in background). In AtomicDEX settings you can minimize the sound volume of these notifications

10:45 PM]ca333:for android we can certainly implement a "silent sound" - for iOS we simply can't. However, we can work out a sound/format that isn't annoying. Maybe being able to chose the sound will be an improvement: "Female with irish accents" vs. "Male with scotch accent", "Beeps", etc.

10:46 PM]jl777c:you cant have a very low volume (close to inaudible) sound on iOs?
[10:48 PM]ca333:you can - but the goal is to get the app approval from apple - so we had to declare the application as an app which needs sound-notifications (key-feature) since that is one of the few options we had to be able to keep the app running in the background. If there is no sound it will be interpreted as a bypass of the "no app can run in the background" rule - and that would bring us back to the old situation.

 8:29 AM]artemciy_dice:Playing silent sounds on iOS is unlikely an option, it is an old and infamous trick, iOS reviewers are well-aware of it and it gets applications banned most of the time.
[8:31 AM]artemciy_dice:But reading this discussion I see that the annoying sound is mostly the one we have when there are active orders but no ongoing swaps. I think we can tune the volume of that one even lower. And we can turn it off altogether on Android, where we don't have to play the sound all the time to stay alive.
Just my two cents.
10:50 PM]artemciy_dice:AtomicDEX is in beta and we're only just started testing this functionality. The major question now is whether the Apple would approve the background mode. If they will, then we'll be further improving this functionality with things like choosing different sounds, allowing you to use the sounds from your own sound library and such. Anyhow, thanks for testing the app!

should be sorted out soon... sounds like it can be turned off in Android with a future update to that code... apparently it has to stay for iOS to keep the app open for posted orders.

if it is good enough for Gilfoyle it should be OK for us.  Not annoying is it?

Is the atomic dex as a wallet as safe as any other wallet? Or is it more vulnerable b/c its a wallet on a mobile device?


[14-Dec-19 06:09 AM] gcharang#6833
it should be as "safe" as a mobile wallet can be
safety in general:
always offline device > hardware wallets > desktop native ~ mobile > web browser

ofc, there are always caveats and one person's opsec can make their mobile wallet safer than someone else's hardware wallet

Hi, I made a few exchanges on the AtomicDEX and have quite a bit of BTC leftover. I keep trying to withdraw from the app and it keeps saying "Error, please try again later". Is there a fix for this? I keep trying and nothing is working. Thanks.

I think you have to minus the fee, so try.0069 when you type amount of BTC you want to swap for HUSH

[15-Dec-19 11:17 PM] gcharang#6833
> Why is $50 not a large enough amount to trade?
it is about the ratio `(transaction fees)/(trade amount)` 
we use dynamic transaction fees for bitcoin
if you had to pay a $2 transaction fee, the swap is most likely not worth it for many people

I've tested on multiple devices and there is no such menu as a `my style or writing` or `my words`. Moreover even if you have such functionality on your phone it's OS related thing - with such features enabled on your side your phone should keylog/store all your input


[16-Dec-19 02:43 PM] TonyL#3577
By description it has nothing similar with coinomi issue - we not sending encryption password anywhere (they sent it to google spellchecker API)

``` if (obscureText) {
            // Note: both required. Some devices ignore TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS.
            textType |= InputType.TYPE_TEXT_FLAG_NO_SUGGESTIONS;

@Oszy as we said above `although we knew from the code that no data is leaked.`  - we can try to dig into the flutter engine as soon as we know which devices ignore these flags. Its weird since OS shouldn't behave _that_ different. Actually interesting if that is "by design".

@ca333 could you please check difference between columns <2 columns to create password when restoring> and <column where to enter password when logging back to existing wallet>. First <2 columns> seems like leaking, but second not leaking....

just create and confirm password by restoring offers word autocomplete.

Good day. I just sent BTC from the AtomicDEX Android app to a segwit address starting with 3. Or I tried, because after sending I saw that the app did not send to my address, but it sent to a legacy address that I don't know and that never received funds before. How come the Android AtomicDEX sends to an unknown legacy BTC address when sending to a BTC segwit address?

Steps to reproduce:
1. Use AtomicDEX on Android, version 0.1.4-6d
2. Tap Bitcoin
3. Tap Send
4. Fill in amount & segwit adres
5. Tap "Withdraw"
6. See segwit address show up in confirmation screen

@TonyL Thanks for your replies! The Play Store said I installed the latest version. Though the app still said 0.1.4-6d.

To recap, we can't disable the sounds for now, but we're making them configurable. The option to pick a local sound file is in the works.

Now, I wonder if someone else likes to create sounds, with https://tonematrix.audiotool.com/ ( https://youtu.be/TaeeiLzfVmc ) and the like? I wonder what the consensus would be on adding support for such custom sounds into the AtomicDEX sound configuration.

Hellow, yesterday i was testing atomic-dex password leak as plaintext into "user custom learned words db" on multiple phones and android versions like android 5, 6... and all leaking.
By analysis, input fields ARE NOT protected when user clicks on unhide button before clicks on input field.
If user password is like "LetterLetterLetterNumSpecialSymbol" only special-symbol from pass is not stored in. But if hacker uses dictionary attack, pass can be broken by few minutes.

"Maker generates a "secret", creates a hash of the secret, and shares this hash with Taker"
If the maker creates the secret to unlock the makerpayment, then the maker can always access his makerpayment or not?


[18-Dec-19 09:33 PM] Audo#5667
The youtube video linked above is outdated. We upgraded the atomic swap process so few of the steps shown on the video are no longer there.

The 5 steps on our documentaiton page are correct & up-to-date


[18-Dec-19 09:39 PM] Audo#5667
_ _

2. Maker sends <makerpayment>
3. Taker now sends <takerpayment>

After this step both of the payments are in a temporary holding address.

There's a shared secret between the two payments, neither party has the full secret. At this stage only the maker can spend the <takerpayment>, and by doing that he reveals his part of the secret to the taker. With that information the taker can claim the <makerpayment>

4. Maker now spends the <takerpayment> (to spend it he has to reveal the secret to taker)
5. Taker now "spends" the <makerpayment>


[19-Dec-19 01:23 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Goku Hi, maker knows the secret, but he can only refund the maker's payment since there're following constraints (I will define a couple of terms first for more clarity):
0. `Swap secret` - the secret which hash is used to lock the swap payments. `Maker's and Taker's persistent secret keys` - main secret keys derived from seed phrase to which all maker's or taker's coins belong too.
1. Spending maker's payment with Swap secret also requires taker's persistent secret signature so maker just can't spend it.
1. Refunding maker's payment requires not only the timelock to pass, but also maker's persistent key signature.


[19-Dec-19 01:23 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
@Audo 
`There's a shared secret between the two payments, neither party has the full secret.` - there's no shared secret, the maker generates `Swap secret` randomly when swap starts so maker's knows the full secret. If there're any mentions of `shared secret` in such sence in our docs these mentions should be  deleted or changed accordingly.

E.g. from UTXO coins AtomicDEX-API code: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2/mm2src/coins/utxo.rs#L302
There're 2 public keys, `pub_0` signature is required to refund the payment. `pub_1` is required to spend the payment using `Swap secret`.  These pubkeys are Maker's and Taker's persistent pubs (corresponding to their persistent secrets).

@artem.pikulin   @Audo
I think I understand now better.
If the Maker spends the <takerpayment>, Maker will reveal his persistent secret key in this tx and the Taker can extract this second key to spend the <makerpayment>.
Thanks for explaining


[19-Dec-19 04:38 AM] gcharang#6833
@Goku one small correction, the Maker reveals the "Swap secret" when he spends the takerpayment


[19-Dec-19 04:39 AM] gcharang#6833 (pinned)
this is the whole process for swaps between utxo coins:
```
----------
A has BTC, B has KMD. They agreed on swap price `1 BTC = 100 KMD`
A is the maker, B is the taker.

1) Taker Sends <dexfee>

B pays the dex fee so that A will start the process by locking his coins.

2) Maker Successfully Sends <makerpayment>

A picks randomNumber: `secret_A`

A creates a utxo on the Bitcoin blockchain with 
value: 1 BTC 
encumbrance: the value can be claimed by A after 20 hours or by B if he knows the secret `secret_A`

3)  Taker Successfully Sends <takerpayment>

After seeing the above utxo, B creates the following utxo on the KMD blockchain:
value: 100 KMD
encumbrance: the value can be claimed by B after 10 hours or by A if he knows the secret `secret_A`

4) Maker Spends <takerpayment>

 A uses the `secret_A`  and claims the KMD revealing the secret 

5) Taker Spends <makerpayment>

B now uses the public `secret_A` to claim the BTC

---
The times can be adjusted based on requirements of security and "ease of use"
Normally, A should have a longer locktime so that B can have sufficient time to get his coins back if A doesn't reveal the secret `secret_A`

-------------------
```

@gcharang
Understand thanks  so far.

Just one thing, how can B create the <takerpayment> so that it can be spend with "secret_A" without knowing the "secret_A"?


[19-Dec-19 04:56 AM] gcharang#6833
both B and A are locking their payments to the other party on condition that the other party knows secret_A
the "knows secret_A" is implemented through a hash lock
A hashes `secret_A` and adds it to the lock
B can see the hash of `secret_A` on the block chain and adds the same hash to lock his payment too

hope I made sense


[19-Dec-19 05:01 AM] Goku#9007
Ah ok, B will reuse the hash of the <makerpayment> lock, that used the hash of "secret_A". I think I understand now the whole process, thankful for the explanation!

AtomicDex is a mobile wallet right? Why is it not mentioned in the rich lists?


[19-Dec-19 08:02 AM] gcharang#6833
which rich list? @Deleted User


[19-Dec-19 09:49 AM] Deleted User#0000

Noticed issue when coin is removed from atomicdex. It leaves orders still there even when coin is nit present, dont know if this can cause other issues.

On this website fetching orderbook for a whole AtomicDEX P2P network (not only for assets added into mobile GUI)


[20-Dec-19 06:05 AM] TonyL#3577
AtomicDEX mobile is just an interface for AtomicDEX-API


[20-Dec-19 06:06 AM] TonyL#3577
there might be infinity amount of interfaces (GUIs/TUIs and etc) each with same or own coin set. Supernet you can trade via AtomicDEX-API by CLI


[20-Dec-19 06:07 AM] TonyL#3577
https://github.com/smk762/pytomicDEX also you may try terminal interface (but please note that it's just demonstrational/testing software so it's better to not trade huge amounts)

`why this keeps happening all to projects that touch kmd platform?`
because, "Joe Average" cannot afford the corporate-level prices?


[21-Dec-19 04:26 AM] Mark81#4505
Its slso joe averages that invest into these projects. Now they must be kicking them selves that coin is delisted. And same time a lot of coins get atomicdex support for free.


[21-Dec-19 04:35 AM] Mark81#4505
Wouldnt it be easier to get kmd name out with low level entry to it? Of course there must be costs to kmd team with rented hardware from AWS but could that market be decentralized to users providing base layers for such service and get paid from that?


[21-Dec-19 04:42 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
the key is not to confuse or conflate atomicdex the GUI with atomicdex/mm2 the system
listing in the system, and being available to any GUI maker, is in fact free (there's an entire repo dedicated just for usable coins and their use params)
however, this "official" GUI is under a different structure and the team charges for things they don't have a vested interest in having on there


[21-Dec-19 04:45 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
imo, the system and the "reference/official GUI" should never have the same name (but I said this with "BarterDEX" too ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)


[21-Dec-19 05:02 AM] Deleted User#0000
It is confusing i agree, i would like to see the mm2 system to be named to something like DEX Market Maker 2.0 or something and let the GUI Atomic DEX stay the same (has made some name for itself now).


[21-Dec-19 05:03 AM] Deleted User#0000
If it confuses people, you lose business


[21-Dec-19 07:31 AM] smkhound#7640
Confirming mm2 compatibility is quite simple, and there are a few open source options and great docs for anyone wanting to. With much open source tools available, it's fair enough for developers to add a cost to further development, and given the docs available, for other projects to do their own development if they have the capability. 
Look at the ecosystem projects which have been around for a while (like LABS/PIRATE).  Apart from having a well defined use case, they do thier own dev, and often also contribute / participate within other ecosystem projects.
Komodo has so many modules that are language agnostic that one bloke, with enough time and motivation, can build a few things in their spare time while working a day job (as long as they are prepared to ignore passive recreation like watching TV etc). Basically it boils down to: do you want to learn and build, or do you want to pay someone else?

How could I ignore the following error:

 I would have to search the text for "already initialized" or?

] follows stack trace information (allowing you to readily find the relevant source code). We have plans to introduce maintainable error codes. As of now you'd use `ends_with("] Coin MORTY already initialized")`

AtomicDEX


[22-Dec-19 11:15 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
@alcadi  how much kmd do you have in your address?


[22-Dec-19 11:16 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Minimum to generate reward is 10 KMD in a utxo .


[22-Dec-19 11:17 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
So if you sent 4 transactions, 3 + 3 +3+1 ,  that would not generate reward.  But if it is all in one utxo as 10, it will .  Easiest way to make sure is just to send your balance to yourself


[22-Dec-19 11:17 AM] alcadi#7378
@polycryptoblog, I'm doing a test with 11 kmd initially


[22-Dec-19 11:20 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Ok,  try sending your balance to yourself and try claiming in one hour, though with a small amount like that it may not be enough to overcome txfee. May want to wait on claiming for a bit

@polycryptoblog Thank you very much for your support. One last question; whenever I make a deposit or claim a reward I will have a new balance, should I do the same procedure so that the new rewards are on the total balance?


[22-Dec-19 01:23 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Use the etomic approach for integrating z coins is my opinion @mrlynch - @artem.pikulin should be capable of seizing some ARRR booty pretty quickly....I think he's the one that made etomic work..


[22-Dec-19 02:06 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
just  change it to ztomic and away you go!


[22-Dec-19 04:46 PM] gcharang#6833
@alcadi use <https://www.atomicexplorer.com/#/rewards>
to check if you are receiving rewards for an address
if you receive coins to your wallet from an exchange, sending the whole balance to yourself will correct any problems


[22-Dec-19 06:12 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
@Deleted User  z transactions are invisible on the  blockchain called  "shielded" transactions - google  zk-snarks  - ALL Komodo asset chains are capable of  this  function including Komodo itself obviously.  Zcash, Hush and Pirate / "ARRR" currently have working  models where the default for most coins is  using  standard unshielded transactions,  ARRRs  ONLY  choice is a  "z" transaction  or  shielded transactions which  makes swaping almost impossible because of the lack of data transmitted between Maker and Taker.. There  may  be  other  workarounds but I  am  suggesting a unshielded token swap of ztomic and final stage of swap would  be  done  with  the zCOIN  of choice ...  want  to  talk about a Blur Network? wrap that puppy up  in  tor and VPN with  ALL  Komodo-Platforms assets using the new shielded  method for  transaction and  you just  created  the Holy Grail trading platform for all  man kind --- It pretty much  is the missing  piece of the entire Decentralized  / Anonymous goals trying to be reached .   --- quite a few github locations to  find starter code for anyone  willing to  take  on  the challenge -  https://github.com/zcash/zcash-android-wallet-sdk   |||"These  are  kmdkrazy  opinions  and  are  not intended to sound  like  factual  statements  in  any  way, nor  are  they  endorsed  by  SuperNET and  or  its  subsidiaries."|||  ~ lol

@Tylor zkFS How does a ARR wallet know how much ARR somebody has? When he or she received the coins the wallet has to acknowledge that, can't u use the same principle for the swap (which basically is A to B through C)?


[22-Dec-19 11:47 PM] Deleted User#0000
Further if you swap a zk-snark coin you always have to finish the swap shielded i imagine van start to end. If not, part 2 of the swap will make part 1 visible or at least reconstructable (for example is you swap ARR for non-shielded KMD, the output of KMD to the address ARR came from is now known for swapping a non-visible amount that equals the value of the received KMD.

Is there a ETH/BTC pair?


[22-Dec-19 11:53 PM] gcharang#6833
there has not been an instance of lost funds yet
but still, swaping low volumes is recommended for now


[22-Dec-19 11:54 PM] Deleted User#0000
Ethereum is available, liquidity may be limited. Most swaps happen around KMD (BTC/KMD, KMD/DEX etc.)


[22-Dec-19 11:55 PM] gcharang#6833
there is no concept of a pair  being available in AtomiocDEX
if the coins are listed, they can be traded against each other

If I create a large order, do I have to wait for a single user to fill that order or many  users can grab a piece of my order?


[23-Dec-19 12:25 AM] gcharang#6833
> many  users can grab a piece of my order
this
but there might be slight delays from one user filling the order to the next one as actual coins on the blockchain need to move and confirmations on blockchains take some time

Hi dev,
I use my seed phrase for exodus, which I generated in atomic dex
I have bitcoin in atomic dex but after I transfer my phrase to exodus there aren‚Äôt my btc
why?


[23-Dec-19 03:46 AM] Oszy#5734
@alesha123 It is not a bip39 compatible seed. You can use your seed in Agama, not in exodus.


[23-Dec-19 03:46 AM] Oszy#5734
same as you can't use ledger seed in atomicdex


[23-Dec-19 03:47 AM] alesha123#1898
Oh so does this only work for Komodo funds?


[23-Dec-19 03:49 AM] Oszy#5734
yes, the addresses generated will be different in other applications not related to komodo


[23-Dec-19 03:49 AM] Oszy#5734
but it will always be the same in agama / atomicdex


[23-Dec-19 03:50 AM] alesha123#1898
So basically it is used only for authorization?


[23-Dec-19 03:51 AM] Oszy#5734
no, it has the same security and purpose as a regular BIP39 seed, but it uses a different method, only used by komodo. 
someone correct me if I am wrong üôÇ


[23-Dec-19 04:06 AM] alesha123#1898

@Deleted User I an not a  computer  science  major  - but I did play one on TV  - Basically you  would be swapping the ztomic with  standard Atomic Dex then releasing the zadd  funds  from  timelock p2sh add  at  final  stage --- i think ---http://stevengoldfeder.com/papers/ZKCSP.pdf


[23-Dec-19 08:11 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
as far  as  trading  a  Z add for R add -  you are  correct - but it would/will  be a safer  decentralized  trade

@alesha123 to use the same address from AtomicDEX/Agama in another wallet, you can export the wif for each coin you want
then use the wif to login

nice! yeah just doin a rick / morty swap right now. I'm mainly looking into trying this out to buy / sell verus since i don't think any exchanges have wallets open atm

so, if i deposit like say 1 VRSC i'll be able to see the whole orderbook for VRSC pairs i'm assuming?


[24-Dec-19 11:56 PM] gcharang#6833
I think there might be some issues with SPV servers of Verus too, becase of the recent network upgrade
if they are upto datea and online, it shouls work


[24-Dec-19 11:56 PM] gcharang#6833

Is the order book decentralized? Are orders placed off-chain? As a user, do I need to trust third parties to find out the price and to find the best possible counter-offers?


[25-Dec-19 08:20 AM] jong#4037
Other question: Would it be possible for a single order to be matched against multiple counter-offers in the future or there is a fundamental reason why it must be 1-to-1?

> Is the order book decentralized? Are orders placed off-chain? As a user, do I need to trust third parties to find out the price and to find the best possible counter-offers?
the order book is decentralized and p2p
more info here: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/atomicdex.html#the-decentralized-orderbook>
> Would it be possible for a single order to be matched against multiple counter-offers in the future or there is a fundamental reason why it must be 1-to-1?
a maker order, once placed, does allow multiple takers who need lower volumes to fill it
but, it might happen with some delay as each taker's offer has to be filled by hash and timelocks on a blockchain(for utxo coins) and some confirmations are needed for confident trading


[25-Dec-19 09:03 AM] jong#4037
@gcharang Thanks, that sounds good. Can the order go through partially if one of the counterparties is offline/slow?


[25-Dec-19 09:03 AM] jong#4037
or it's an all-or-nothing situation


[25-Dec-19 09:05 AM] gcharang#6833
if one party is slow, the order can still go through (the blockchains have blocktimes and confirmation requirements for safe trading )
but if one of them is offline, the swap won't go through


[25-Dec-19 09:07 AM] gcharang#6833
the taker and maker need to execute alternate steps
if one of them doesn't execute a step, the swap timesout/fails and the coins will be refunded to the respective users after a fixed time


[25-Dec-19 09:11 AM] jong#4037
Interesting. Thanks.


[25-Dec-19 09:59 AM] criptobear#6402
Where can i find the withdrawal fees?


[25-Dec-19 10:00 AM] Dankin#0524
Has anyone had any luck running Atomicdex on bluestacks or any other PC android emulator?


[25-Dec-19 10:13 AM] allbits#5898
There are no withdrawal fees because the coins are already in your own wallet that only you control and there is no concept of "withdrawal". If you wish to send to another address you control you will need to pay the typical transaction fee for that chain.

any way to completely disable sounds for the android app? I see the options to not play at full volume but still get annoying change sounds coming through. Also, it looks like each time I load atomicdex on phone i have to go in to settings and un-choose 'play at full volume'.

question- as a maker, do i need to have app open and screen on in order for others to participate in my orders that i've already setup in atomicdex?


[25-Dec-19 06:35 PM] gcharang#6833
> as a maker, do i need to have app open and screen on in order for others to participate in my orders that i've already setup in atomicdex?
there is no need for the screen to be on (this is what the sounds fix was for)
but the app must be open in the background


[25-Dec-19 06:47 PM] CiPhEr#2091
oh i see. I have my phone setup to hibernate quickly after screen goes off, i may have to install this onto my other phone and just keep it on all the time. Are there any user inputs needed on the part of a maker for trades to happen that are already setup to be advertised on orderbook?

And on that subject, if i have the same atomic dex seed running simultaneously on two phones will that cause issues?


[25-Dec-19 07:07 PM] gcharang#6833
> if i have the same atomic dex seed running simultaneously on two phones will that cause issues?
yes, there may be issues
the case of same seed running on two devices is undefined. that is , it wasn't considered when atomicDEX was  developed
it is not recommended to do so

> I have my phone setup to hibernate quickly after screen goes off
this will cause the maker to go offline, that is no swaps

>  i may have to install this onto my other phone and just keep it on all the time
good idea

> Are there any user inputs needed on the part of a maker for trades to happen that are already setup to be advertised on orderbook
nothing else is needed. have sufficient balances and place orders. thats it


[25-Dec-19 08:01 PM] CiPhEr#2091
thanks for your help gcharang! I'm also assuming I could import the seed from the atomic dex into agama wallet and monitor activity, transfer funds, etc through agama right?


[25-Dec-19 08:04 PM] gcharang#6833
np!
>  I could import the seed from the atomic dex into agama wallet and monitor activity, transfer funds, etc through agama right?
yes. but transferring funds out while there is an active order may cause swaps to fail

@CiPhEr those aren't past volumes
those are quantities and prices of coins that were available for swap 15 minutes ago
you can see current orderbook in the app if you have some balance for a coin

@gcharang It's something @phm87 reported back on 11/20/2019. When doing the 'dustup install nightly-2019-10-06 (they posted a fairly thorough report /errors) it outputs "... error: some components unavailable for download for channel nightly-2019-10-06 'chippy', 'rustfmt'"


[25-Dec-19 11:15 PM] tolken#2655

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #132 The password requirements are bad
The android app asks for a password that is at least 12 characters long, contains an upper case and lower case letter, and a special character. These are the ultra-common password requirements (plus a longer length requirement) and they are pretty [bad advice](https://www.tomsguide.com/us/password-advice-wrong,news-25617.html) for a strong password. Easy to forget, easy to guess, all around bad.

[28-Dec-19 12:30 PM] tolken#2655
any idea why AtomicDex might be displaying a different KMD address than when I use the address in mm2 cli? I have checked/rechecked that I typed it in the same probably 20 times. I've checked the formatting/spaces to the best of my knowledge. I should be able to use the same exact pass phrase (generated from AtomicDex) in mm2 cli and have it display the same address right?


[28-Dec-19 12:31 PM] tolken#2655
Certainly not ruling out user error, I just don't know what the discrepancy might be. Everything looks identical.


[28-Dec-19 12:35 PM] tolken#2655
ahh, i see docs are calling for a 24 word phrase, atomicdex generates 12 word. I suppose that's the root of the prob.


[28-Dec-19 12:56 PM] tolken#2655

sorry to ask but I'm curious @tolken


[28-Dec-19 01:56 PM] tolken#2655
well, I for whatever reason put the passphrase in all caps the first time, in the start.sh and then the mm json. Address was  wrong, so made sure case was the same, but forgot to update the mm Jason, that‚Äôs all.


[28-Dec-19 07:22 PM] smkhound#7640
its not recommended to use same address on multiple devices

@smkhound wasn't going to actively trade on both, just wanted to use one to generate/verify the passphrase. Thanks for the heads up.

i'm looking at best way to use agama verus wallet for staking verus while using that verus amount to provide some liquidity on atomicdex. 
I would like to keep everything encrypted that can be (I realize the address that I use for staking Verus wont be encrypted since it has to be on full node wallet).
I created a litemode custom seed wallet on agama desktop with my seed from atomicdex. It looks like I can only encrypt this seed after creation, not during such as when using a non-custom seed. 
If I go into agama wallet settings and enter the seed under 'encrypt seed', supply an encrypt password, is this too late? Is the wallet already stored on my computer in non-encrypted form? Hmmm, maybe I should have done that step first THEN accessed the wallet in agama...
I believe the atomicdex wallet is encrypted upon creation, correct? If so, that solves that part.


[29-Dec-19 09:19 PM] CiPhEr#2091
While on the encryption topic, may i ask- when atomicdex app is open and running on my phone, is the wallet still encrypted? I suppose the answer might be: "the wallet is decrypted in ram while in use but there is never a decrypted file on the drive"?

Also, I noticed that when creating a wallet in agama with default 'iguana (256 bits)' selected, it generates a 24 word mnemonic phrase (15 word with waves checked and 12 word with nxt checked), yet atomic dex generates a 12 word phrase. Could i create a 24 word phrase in agama and restore it into atomicdex?


[29-Dec-19 11:31 PM] gcharang#6833
> Could i create a 24 word phrase in agama and restore it into atomicdex?
yes. Just use the "Custom seed" option while restoring the wallet

> I believe the atomicdex wallet is encrypted upon creation, correct?
yes

> I created a litemode custom seed wallet on agama desktop with my seed from atomicdex. It looks like I can only encrypt this seed after creation, not during such as when using a non-custom seed. 

creating a seed(non-custom) in Agama and restoring it in AtomicDex solves the issue


[30-Dec-19 12:00 AM] CiPhEr#2091
cool, thanks gcharang! Yes so I now created an encrypted non-custom 24 word seed in agama and restored it into the atomicdex app. I then exported my verus address in wif format and imported it into my agama native wallet so now i can stake the funds i am trading on atomicdex, sweet!


[30-Dec-19 01:26 AM] CiPhEr#2091
question- I remember back in the barterdex days when setting up to be a liquidity provider, the software would query some outside data providers and you can set it up to price your orders for a certain % over or under that value. Does mm2 have that functionality?

Hopefully i'm remembering barterdex correctly, but perhaps i'm getting confused with it just querying its own orderbooks' prices?


[30-Dec-19 04:34 AM] cipi#4502
that functionality is not in mm2 any more, but several people have written their own scripts and tools to do that
so did i: https://github.com/cipig/mmtools
it uses coinpaprika as price source and sets bid/ask-margin according to the settings in mpm.conf.dex

I'd like to think that we've already *released* a beta version (a "beta release", cf. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Beta). And we're making new releases often! There are also concepts of a *stable release* (when we're happy with where we are), *opening the source* and *store release* (when the application is freely available in application store search and can be installed without subscribing to a beta testing).

MM is an integral part of order matching, yes, but different layers can participate in it and in different capacity. Right now, for example, the user is essentially selecting a specific order. There is up-matching (an order with a better price can be used automatically), but if I select a best price (with no better prices past it) then I've essentially picked a specific order, which might be in fact unavailable due to a number of reasons.

initial version of the decentralized orderbook transport layer tested out better than expected with a limit of about 50,000 orders per hour and 4000 orders in one minute burst limit.
this is with the simplistic internal searching algo. still need to get it validated with much higher number of nodes than the 12 nodes i used, but this is a very good start and the goal of being able to handle much much higher levels of traffic is now within reach.

one of the design goals was to minimize wasted bandwidth transmitting the same data to the same node, but still making it fast enough so orders propagate in a few seconds. in my three hour test of 30,000+ orders, all the nodes were 100% in sync and there was less than 1% of excess bandwidth


[31-Dec-19 05:49 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
also this p2p layer in komodod is a general-purpose technology! (giving us more freedom in how to use it for order matching)


[31-Dec-19 05:56 AM] jl777c#5810
yes, for any usecase where 100% consensus isnt critical, this can be very handy. it is like UDP as opposed to TCP. usually it will be just fine, but if things get overloaded, it will start dropping packets randomly


[31-Dec-19 05:57 AM] jl777c#5810
however, it shouldnt ever end up getting deadlocked and when the load reduces, things will get back in sync again

[31-Dec-19 10:17 AM] Aquila#3547
So, using the android app. if you create an order, do you need to have the app running when somebody fills it so that you can complete the trade? also, not sure if this is a bug but the app continuously makes the sound of coins clinking after I create an order


[31-Dec-19 10:19 AM] ca333#0333
yes - thats a limitation and affects ETH/ERC swaps only. Technically we likely could redesign the atomic-swap protocol in order to enforce the ETH/ERC side of a swap to cover all gas fees. This is something we might look into at some point.


[31-Dec-19 10:20 AM] Aquila#3547

[31-Dec-19 10:21 AM] ca333#0333
`if you create an order, do you need to have the app running when somebody fills it so that you can complete the trade?` yes the app needs to run (at least in background mode) to execute swaps. There aren't only mobile clients/peers - the network also consists of a set of server/desktop based DEX nodes/peers.

now my 10 test nodes are able to sustain 2000 tx/sec (capacity is 8192/sec)
CPU usage of 15% on a receiving only node, bandwidth between 2MB and 8MB/sec, using 1kb datablob size. RAM usage is whatever amount of data in an hour with a half GB overhead.

i think these are sufficient performance for DEX orderbook usage, assuming it can maintain this level of performance as the network size scales up.


[01-Jan-20 05:48 AM] jl777c#5810
keep in mind this is just the low level transport layer for the datablobs. it uses a fully decentralized p2p network and current tests show the datablobs are 99.99% in sync across the nodes. at this rate of order flow, the bandwidth usage was about 4MB/sec, with peaks of 12MB/sec. not that much for any decent bandwidth provider


[01-Jan-20 05:50 AM] jl777c#5810
if this survives a burn in test, then i will be ready to add an api wrapper for the querying of the datablobs. this can be used by mm2, or any other dapp that needs a mostly synchronized set of data across all nodes. think of it as a UDP level instead of TCP. so it will always be fast, just that if you oversaturate things, it will drop some packets

`success_events` and `error_events` are just a list of all possible success/error event types that are possible


[03-Jan-20 12:34 PM] cipi#4502
not the ones that actually occured in the swap


[03-Jan-20 12:40 PM] cipi#4502
finished =! successfull
you need to check if one of the events of the swap is of type `error_events`, if so the swap failed


[03-Jan-20 12:45 PM] cipi#4502
```
my $json = decode_json(read_file($ARGV[0]));
my $events = $json->{'events'};
my $error_events = $json->{'error_events'};

LOOP: foreach my $event( @$events ) {
    my $event_type = $event->{'event'}{'type'};
    foreach my $error( @$error_events ) {
        if ( $event_type eq $error ) {
            print "failed swap\n";
            last LOOP;
        }
    }
}
```
i do this in perl... `$ARGV[0]` is the path to swap json-file which contains the same info displayed by `my_recent_swaps`


[03-Jan-20 12:47 PM] cipi#4502
maybe you can do the same with `jq`

[03-Jan-20 11:25 PM] gcharang#6833
@ronyi the amount missing is the dex fee
as the liquidity improves, the number of failed swaps should go down considerably


[03-Jan-20 11:31 PM] ronyi#5719
Why we paying dex fee for the nothing? That is not correct and I losing control above my money more than 4hrs and therefore have to pay.


[03-Jan-20 11:42 PM] gcharang#6833
you can read more about the dexfee here: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/atomicdex.html#the-dex-fee>

tldr: it is necessary for initiating the p2p swap according to the protocol. If there was enough liquidity, there shouldn't be many failed swaps. you won't notice the quantities lost to failed swaps in your total time using AtomicDEX as the fee is aready tiny compared many CEXs. Every successful swap should offset fee lost due to a failed swap


[03-Jan-20 11:59 PM] ronyi#5719
My DEX/KMD swap I think failed again DEX left my wallet (4 conf) and not receive KMD and paid fee again.


[04-Jan-20 12:06 AM] ronyi#5719
Another question: How and when we receive the DEX holder "bonus"?


[04-Jan-20 12:06 AM] gcharang#6833
if the swap fails, you should receive the dex back in about 4 hours
I think there is a maker for DEX that is on a older version of the app, causing swaps to fail
a new version is in development which will ban(locally) pubkeys that cause failed swaps


[04-Jan-20 12:07 AM] gcharang#6833
> How and when we receive the DEX holder "bonus"?

when the fees collected reach a fiat value of $1 million I think
the same KMD address your DEX are held will receive the bonus


[04-Jan-20 12:08 AM] ronyi#5719
So if i holding my DEX in AtomicDEX, i receive the bonus.


[04-Jan-20 12:11 AM] ronyi#5719
if the swap fails, you should receive the dex back (-dex fee) in about 4 hours


[04-Jan-20 12:11 AM] gcharang#6833
> So if i holding my DEX in AtomicDEX, i receive the bonus.
yes, you will receive it in the KMD address that is same as your DEX holding address

Is there a list somewhere to see minimum amounts for swaps


[04-Jan-20 03:37 PM] cipi#4502
min. trade amount is 0.00777


[04-Jan-20 04:24 PM] CiPhEr#2091
question- when placing a trade on atomicdex, it looks like the transaction fee for a coin is not dependent on the amount traded, however the trading fee goes up in relation to amount listed. 
I'm assuming this trading fee, upon listing an offer for sale on the dex, is for full amount being sold. So, if a taker chooses to trade for say, only half the amount I have listed, this trading fee for this transaction would be half as well, right?
Also- It appears the transaction fee is based solely on the coin being sold by the maker and has nothing to do with what coin it is being paid for by the taker, correct?


[04-Jan-20 06:54 PM] cipi#4502
@J.J. problem with AXE identified: for some reason AXE-transactions can take a very long time to propagate to the mempool of other nodes (AtomicDEX waited 50s then gave up)... problem "solved" by directly connecting the wallet of the maker node with the ones from the electrums... but this is more a AXE problem, then a AtomicDEX problem, txs should not take that long to make it into the mempool of other nodes


[04-Jan-20 06:59 PM] cipi#4502
@CiPhEr the transaction fee is the normal network fee for the involved chains and not dependent on the amount
trading fee (dexfee) is 1/777 of the takercoin amount (maker pays no dexfee)


[04-Jan-20 07:02 PM] cipi#4502
this also means: coins with high txfees (BTC, often ERC20) should be swapped in bigger amounts, else txfee can be a significant part of traded amount


[04-Jan-20 07:02 PM] dan.#2473
Will the min amount be raised for certain coins?


[04-Jan-20 07:04 PM] cipi#4502
the min. amount is now fixed at 0.00777 for all coins
but i would like to have the possibility to set it for each coin in part, so i made this issue: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/473

[04-Jan-20 07:07 PM] CiPhEr#2091
one other question- say my phone loses connection, how long do i have to get it back online and go back into adex if i am in the middle of a swap to have it complete?
and if i don't make it in time, the locked transaction goes back into my wallet at a certain time?


[04-Jan-20 07:09 PM] dan.#2473
Can I suggest at the very least having the option to disable in settings.


[04-Jan-20 07:09 PM] dan.#2473
The reason being is that in its current state atomicdex cannot be used for dust


[04-Jan-20 07:09 PM] cipi#4502
that also depends on the involved coins, not sure though
i think with BTC and BCH you have more time to get back online and ccontinue the swap
if the swap fails (timeouts or other error) and if funds were already been sent, they are refunded
the time also depends on the chains... here i am sure that it is that way, but not how long the times are exactly... 4h or something like that


[04-Jan-20 07:10 PM] CiPhEr#2091
ok thanks


[04-Jan-20 07:12 PM] cipi#4502
@dan. don't know how much sense it makes to send small amounts and pay a higher fee then the transferred amount... better "collect" the dust üôÇ


[04-Jan-20 07:13 PM] dan.#2473
Sure in the instances where it makes sense to. But in its current form of 0.00777 that isn't always the case depending on the crypto


[04-Jan-20 07:14 PM] dan.#2473
I know this is an edge case but it would likely increase usage a little bit if people could dust out their wallets with atomicdex


[04-Jan-20 07:14 PM] cipi#4502
sure, the fixed 0.00777 was/is just a quickfix and will be changed


[04-Jan-20 07:15 PM] dan.#2473
Alright. I get the safegaurd, but it would be good to see it changed

Adding it to marketmaker is free if it's compatible:
https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-tutorials/additional-information-about-atomicdex.html#add-your-coin-to-marketmaker-2-0

Adding it to mobile DeX has a listing fee, and you need to contact the team.

It would be great if the wallet actually told the user that this was the problem instead of telling to try later if a user wants to withdraw BTC to an Segwit Adress.


[05-Jan-20 07:44 AM] Deleted User#0000
Imo it would be better if segwit was supported as it would be more compatible and potentially reduce fees for trading and deposit/withdrawal


[05-Jan-20 07:47 AM] PTYX#6840
I think the team will add segwit in the future

If you also add custom TX fees I think it could be a very competitive multi-coin mobile wallet as well as a Dex. Looking at Dexstats it seems btc/kmd has the most volume so it should be seriously considered

yes, you will be able to withdraw BTC, LTC and so on from AtomicDEX to another segwit-address, e.g. on a CEX

@PTYX have an atomic dex issue, tried to make a swap with kmd. It timed out after an hour. Komodo never refunded back to me. Suggestions?


[05-Jan-20 02:28 PM] PTYX#6840
I'm not entirely sure how to fix failed swaps if the kmd wasn't returned. Do you have a transaction ID? @marktyler


[05-Jan-20 02:46 PM] cipi#4502
there are no infos about this swap uuid on the seed nodes
you need to look in the logfiles on your device
are you sure that anything was sent?
dexfee is not refunded, only MakerPayment and TakerPayment
you can now lookup the errors that happened with a swap with this link: http://dexapi.cipig.net:8080/public/error.php?uuid=c65d9539-11ec-4d35-8d02-eb3f3ed2aa52 (if there is anything on the seed nodes)


[05-Jan-20 03:18 PM] smkhound#7640
@Nacho Figx  to get the checksummed version of your erc20 address, search for it at https://etherscan.io/
then copy what is returned.
e.g. if you search for `0x331953f1fd954af6c162a3243809337fd938272d` it will display as  `0x331953F1fD954AF6c162A3243809337fd938272D`

hi there just slowly learning more about and using atomicdex, have a question (thanks for the answers yesterday by the way)
As far as the transaction fee in a transaction (aka network fee that goes to miners on chain) which side pays this, the maker, taker or both? 

Am I correct in assuming it is both, of which the fee is taken from each leg of the transaction's journey? i.e. tx fee #1 from taker sending dex fee to originate trade, tx fee #2 from taker sending to hold address, tx fee #3 sending from hold address to maker, tx fee #4 from maker to holding address and finally tx fee #5 from holding address to taker.

In this case, for the transaction fee that is displayed in app when setting up a trade (for instance 0.00006038 btc for a btc trade right now) is that amount an estimate for total needed for all 5 payments to go through, or is that the fee for each tx (so for maker would be the above fee * 2, the taker would be the above fee * 3?)

correct
>  i.e. tx fee #1 from taker sending dex fee to originate trade, tx fee #2 from taker sending to hold address, tx fee #3 sending from hold address to maker, tx fee #4 from maker to holding address and finally tx fee #5 from holding address to taker.

it should be tx fee #1 from taker sending dex fee to originate trade (chain A),  tx fee #2 from maker sending to intermediate address(maker payment, chain B),  tx fee #3 from taker sending to intermediate address(taker payment, chain A) , tx fee #4 maker claim (chain A), tx fee #5 taker claim(chain B)


[06-Jan-20 12:47 AM] gcharang#6833
> for instance 0.00006038 btc for a btc trade right now
it is for the dexfee and taker payment


[06-Jan-20 12:50 AM] CiPhEr#2091
ok so in my app it lists 0.00006038 btc for tx fee separately from 0.00001596 for trading fee (1/777) dex fee


[06-Jan-20 12:50 AM] CiPhEr#2091
so i guess the 0.00006038 i as a maker would pay twice and the taker would pay it three times


[06-Jan-20 12:51 AM] CiPhEr#2091
and i (as a maker) wouldn't pay the trading fee as only takers pay that fee i believe


[06-Jan-20 01:05 AM] gcharang#6833
not quite
you see, taker pays tx fee twice(dexfee and taker payment) on chain A, once(taker claim) on chain B (I think, the fee for taker claim is taken from the amount maker has already locked)
maker  pays tx fee once(maker payment) on chain B, once(maker claim) on chain A

@wolzie , "during an order" is ambiguous. as of now the following modes are in place: when we've just created an order we're in a "taker" mode, after 30 seconds and no match we switch into a "maker" mode, and if we've matched and the swap is ongoing then we're in an "active swap" mode. the sound files where provided by various members of the team so we'll need some investigative work to pinpoint the origin.

Question on how orders are matched- I know in a typical exchange if I put an order in for say 200 sats and there are orders for 150 sats 175 sats and 200 sats, the coins offered at lower prices will be matched first. 

How does adex work in this regard? I noticed there are numerous orders listed, would it let me 'pay too much' if I chose the wrong one?

@CiPhEr you can think of it more like localbitcoins (p2p) where you can choose a different 'ad' with a higher price rather than a regular CEX which will match the top of the order book.

Any one have input on kmd to dex swaps. I have tried about 10 times since Sunday, with all different amounts of kmd all timeout or i get unsuccessful swap. Fyi i Have been able to swap in the past.

strange thing i'm noticing with the android app is that I'll place a bunch of orders in the morning on my phone, phone runs all day with screen on at work so it can properly host orders with internet (mostly) always connected to it and now at night the orders are still on my phone, yet 90% of them are not showing up on the oracle orderbook. This is not with the latest app, but I installed about a week ago.


[07-Jan-20 08:27 PM] CiPhEr#2091
do orders sometimes disappear if connectivity fails for a while?


[07-Jan-20 09:02 PM] CiPhEr#2091
so with new version of app I was FINALLY able to get rid of the change sounds. For anyone else wanting to do the same just: 
download audacity, create a new (empty) project and then go to Generate > Silence... default length of 30s is fine. Then go to File > Export audio, and choose MP3. Put this file on your phone and link every sound to it and voila sound free experience.

When will CHIPS and ARRR be added to the DEX?


[07-Jan-20 10:39 PM] MorganJekyll#8355
And once ARRR is added is it still technically a ‚Äújumbler‚Äù for other blockchains via atomic swap? Basically use it as a cloak bridge between blockchains, is this the idea?

[07-Jan-20 11:08 PM] CiPhEr#2091
@MorganJekyll i doubt arrr will be added since it is private transactions only. I believe visibility of transactions is necessary for atomicdex to work with the coin, but i'm not positive


[07-Jan-20 11:34 PM] CiPhEr#2091
any suggestions on how to get orderbook queries looking better? I am using jq but at any of these brackets [ ] it makes it a line by itself so one order book entry takes up my whole vertical screen practically


[07-Jan-20 11:36 PM] TonyL#3577
For human readable format it more practical to use or make GUI


[07-Jan-20 11:39 PM] CiPhEr#2091
true. yeah i built an excel sheet that queries market data and compares it to the csv oracle download but i'm finding out that oracle orderbook page only has some of the markets, finally found that out after just now compiling and using mm2 for the first time. I was able to see my orders that my phone says exist but don't show up on the orderbook oracle.


[07-Jan-20 11:51 PM] CiPhEr#2091
hmmm i wonder how difficult it would be to use the orderbook api on mm2 to build & keep up to date a database of trading pairs, just like the oracle orderbook but just for myself with the pairs I want to track.


[08-Jan-20 12:14 AM] CiPhEr#2091
hi @smkhound sorry to bug you but do you have any info on documentation / recommendations for me to do the above? I believe you are the one currently maintaining the atomicdex orderbook oracle, no? I'd like to see about making one for myself that has the pairs i'd like to watch üôÇ or, maybe you could check if it is functioning properly, it used to list all sorts of rel's for kmd but now only shows vrsc and axe.

Some of the other coins might be missing some rel's too like VRSC I think was showing FTC but not anymore

[08-Jan-20 12:32 AM] CiPhEr#2091

hey any ideas for this- my app goes into order matching but doesn't proceed to next step, i've tried different amounts, does this mean that maker is already engaged with another taker?


[08-Jan-20 01:36 AM] gcharang#6833
what is the pair?


[08-Jan-20 01:36 AM] CiPhEr#2091
zec / kmd

i'm trying to be the taker with kmd


[08-Jan-20 01:37 AM] gcharang#6833
is there only 1 order?


[08-Jan-20 01:37 AM] CiPhEr#2091
it is the one for .018 price


[08-Jan-20 01:37 AM] CiPhEr#2091
max vol 9.78692999 zec


[08-Jan-20 01:39 AM] gcharang#6833
if one order doesn't work for you, it is recommended to try matching another order
the non working order could have unupdated node or bad connectivity

ZEC recently had a network upgrade and if the maker didn't update, swap won't go through


[08-Jan-20 01:39 AM] CiPhEr#2091
oh ok i see


[08-Jan-20 01:40 AM] CiPhEr#2091
so there would be no advantage to just let order matching sit and work right? if order doesn't get matched right away that is probably bad sign


[08-Jan-20 01:41 AM] gcharang#6833
that's correct most times

[08-Jan-20 04:08 AM] cipi#4502
btw, there is maker on the network with ZEC that uses `atomicDEX 0.2.7 Android` (also as maker) and fails all swaps (last 2020-01-08 10:05:05 and 2020-01-08 11:52:18), simply because this version can't handle ZEC... so if ZEC-swaps are failing, try another maker

I got them mostly stored on the atomicdex wallet, don't want that for longterm HODL


[08-Jan-20 08:00 AM] gcharang#6833 (pinned)
@Deleted User when you move DEX out of ledger, the privatekey of Komodo (as they are the same) will also be exposed to a computer.
If that is ok, here are the steps:
To store:
1) Just send to a KMD address from your Ledger

To move them:
1) Open this webpage in an offline computer: <https://iancoleman.io/bip39/>
2) Input your ledger seed words in the field "BIP39 Mnemonic"
3) Select KMD in the field named "Coin"
4) In "Derivation path", select the tab "BIP44"
5) you should see the addresses and privatekeys of your ledger addresses
6) copy the privatekey of the address with your DEX coin and use it to login to Verus Agama and you can move them

https://github.com/jl777/coins/tree/master/electrums you can find list of electrums there, however BUSD is ERC20 so you need to specify swap smart contract and ETH node: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/ethereum/ETH

so a little confused on connecting mm2 to an erc20 token (such as busd). 
The BTC based coins are easy I just copy one of the connect scripts to a newly named one, open it and change say for instance KMD to VRSC, save and run and i'm connected.
It looks like BUSD is listed in the coins file already, but it seems there is an additional file that I need to create in order to connect, what file and where do i put it?

seems there might be an "Ethereum info file" required that starts out with "swap_contract_address":"0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871" would this address be the same for any erc20 token? Would this file be placed into my atomicDEX-API/target/debug/ folder?
I have no idea what I would put in the url / contact fields, all of this seems more like if I was applying to have a coin listed into adex?

Can I make a suggestion to update the github page at https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX
I know there is a lot of work going on in the background but github looks a bit dead.
I suggest adding a bit of info in the readme and perhaps a link there to the playstore app.
Also if it's possible, you should be adding the release versions to the 'releases' tab, even if it is just links to the playstore. Perhaps adding what fixes/features etc. have been done.
I expect more serious people will be looking for info on github rather than playstore and at least they can see something is happening.

@CryptoSurfer they don't go away
they just stop accumulating

if you collect atleast once a month, you get 5.1% per year

Was trying to do an atomic swap with someone, ios AtomicDex, Kmd/redfox they were the maker, I‚Äôve done many successful swaps, this was their first time. Couldn‚Äôt get to step 0 with them even after many minutes. Other makers would start within seconds for me. Tried multiple intetnet connections on their end, no change. What‚Äôs the best way to report this type of situation? What info should be gathered?


[10-Jan-20 10:36 AM] gcharang#6833
@tolken was the other person able to perform any other swaps? tried rick/morty?
the info needed is: device model and OS version, the log file and swap id if any


[10-Jan-20 11:34 AM] tolken#2655
Doubtful that they tried Rick/Morty, pretty sure this was their first time. Thanks @gcharang  I‚Äôll see if we can try again

[11-Jan-20 07:59 AM] coingirl87#6489
In atomic dex an order will only match if both sides have switch on barter dex correct? 

So if i want do a swap i have to wait until the seller or buyer starts atomic dex?

Is that possible to integrate a notify (push notification, email) to inform the seller or buyer that someone waiting for complete the swap?


[11-Jan-20 08:15 AM] coingirl87#6489
I have start 4 dex/kmd swaps
All starting going to step 2/3
Now they are still waiting in step 2/3
First swap starts 20 minutes ago


[11-Jan-20 08:15 AM] coingirl87#6489
What is the problem?


[11-Jan-20 08:26 AM] gcharang#6833
> Now they are still waiting in step 2/3
> What is the problem?
there is no apparent problem yet
the swaps take time because atomicDEX is waiting for notarizations on both DEX and KMD
if the swaps fail, then there is a problem to be investigated

the compulsory long wait time is temperory
in the future there will be an option to set a minimum volume to wait for notarization


[11-Jan-20 08:32 AM] gcharang#6833
> In atomic dex an order will only match if both sides have switch on barter dex correct? 
correct
> So if i want do a swap i have to wait until the seller or buyer starts atomic dex?
you won't see an order if the maker is offline
> Is that possible to integrate a notify (push notification, email) to inform the seller or buyer that someone waiting for complete the swap?
does the answer to the previous question clear this one?

they mean that, the ISP's dns wasn't able to resolve the ip addresses of the electrum servers 
I suggested him to add google's DNS 8.8.8.8 to his connection settings and it worked

Is it normal that i must wait multiple times every time atomic dex started for "activating...." that startup recovery never works for me... than every time i must add all coins again and twice, once i add first time its not added but second time it is added, and must be added one by one, because adding multiple at once causing timeout and see only "activating" for long time.... any plan to fix this?

anyone know where i can find out more about DEX coin? I see it is on AtomicDex but anything i find just refers me to a korean exchange, coinbit can't really find any info on it besides it has medium volume on the adex


[12-Jan-20 01:15 AM] Mark81#4505
i am pretty sure its not same coin that is traded on adex. You must watched it from blockfolio?

That will take long time. Payouts happen once collected dex fees are in usd value of  1 million dollar --->  then fees payout will pay 1 dollar per owned DEX to investor.

Segwit support what is It? Creating a bc1 address or only being able to send to a segwit address?


[13-Jan-20 09:36 AM] gcharang#6833
@igor l $ARRR you can now withdraw to segwit addresses
the btc address you control on atomicDEX is still the legacy one (starts with 1)
and the segwit version supported is only the Nested SegWit (P2SH) (addresses start with a 3)
@TonyL please confirm


[13-Jan-20 09:39 AM] TonyL#3577
For the BitCoin I've tested withdrawals on `3` SegWit addresses and it's works fine


[13-Jan-20 09:40 AM] igor l $ARRR#5852
@gcharangThat is, when creating a new wallet in atomicDex, my BTC address will start with 3???

There appears to be a weird UI bug with pricing. Kind of dangerous really. Was in previous and in latest 02.12 AtomicDex IOS 13.3.  In my case, selected Redfox to sell in Dex, hit Max for sell amount. Selected KMD. It said I'd get something like 800KMD for the 154k Redfox. I hit backspace on the 154k (shortening/eraseing the float number) down to 154... then hit zero four times, then the KMD amount goes from 800KMD to the 'max' volume amount the KMD seller specified (which was about 2400KMD) If you hit ok to start the swap, it doesn't confirm final price, it reverts to the 800KMD without warning.

[14-Jan-20 10:40 PM] gcharang#6833
@Camilo Lopez It takes that long because each transaction has to be confirmed on their respective blockchains
righ now, KMD transactions are considered confirmed after they receive atleast one notarization (may take 10 minutes)
in the future you will be able to set your own security requirements
Ex: if the amount being traded is low, you can set 2 - 3 confirmations as final

How do you create an order like the `ZEC/KMD       74.096844650 KMD      9.98692999 ZEC` which sticks around but can't be bought? If it's easy you could just spam the exchange with unlimited fake orders?


[15-Jan-20 12:42 PM] CiPhEr#2091
I notice there are a high percentage of orders that I try to buy but never make it to the order matched status but those orders are listed for sometimes hours at a time. 

Kind of frustrating when I purposefully transfer funds to the dex to buy an order only to find out it is basically a fake order.

Is there a functionality that could be added in the future that the network could self verify maker orders are available for purchase and if not drop then from order book?

@CiPhEr Good question! If you can have one 'fake' order there for 12+ hours, what stops you from posting hundred of them?


[15-Jan-20 12:45 PM] CiPhEr#2091
Oh cool


[15-Jan-20 12:48 PM] CiPhEr#2091
Well the thing is that it is most likely an unintentional fake order. For instance maybe strange firewall/network/DNS issue etc. So would be unfortunate for a rep system to exclude people from marketplace that simply need help with configuration and or software bugs that need addressed.


[15-Jan-20 12:50 PM] CiPhEr#2091
I would almost prefer a rep system for certain errors (someone disconnecting as to avoid an unprofitable swap in progress) and a quality control system for everything else maybe


[15-Jan-20 12:53 PM] Acura#2748
I would say that the ZEC problem is that the person with the order is using an outdated AtomicDex version.


[15-Jan-20 12:53 PM] Acura#2748
Because there was a Fix for ZEC on AtomicDex

Hi, question about installing atomicdex on IOS.
Should testflight ask for a code to install AtomicDEX?
Last night that's what happened to a guy with a Japanese phone.


[15-Jan-20 12:55 PM] Acura#2748
Yes, a code is needed for the installation on Testflight iOS


[15-Jan-20 12:55 PM] Acura#2748
I would think that the code is in the respective email of the user, or on the homepage - I am not quite sure


[15-Jan-20 01:01 PM] cipi#4502
it is an outdated version with ZEC... just like in: http://dexapi.cipig.net:8080/public/error.php?uuid=88892ac6-b6ea-42fd-9a77-cea07b58850e
`atomicDEX 0.2.7 Android` can't send any ZEC


[15-Jan-20 01:03 PM] scubapanda#2485
Is it possible to spam the orderbook with unlimited 'fake' orders?


[15-Jan-20 01:03 PM] CiPhEr#2091
Oh I see ha yeah I think that is the same order I was wanting to buy last night scrubpanda ha ha


[15-Jan-20 01:04 PM] cipi#4502
when you try and it fails, your node bans the other node, so no second try with same node possible
ban is cleared when mm2 is restarted


[15-Jan-20 01:05 PM] scubapanda#2485
I don't get it. Why is this KMD/ZEC order still there, visible after 12-24h?


[15-Jan-20 01:06 PM] cipi#4502
because the node that posts it is still there


[15-Jan-20 01:06 PM] scubapanda#2485
So you can post unlimited amount of fake orders?


[15-Jan-20 01:07 PM] cipi#4502
define `fake`... you can post whatever order you like as long as you have the necessary balance


[15-Jan-20 01:09 PM] scubapanda#2485
In this case 'fake' would be an order way below the market that stays there and no-one can actually buy. Your mobile app shows it hour after hour.


[15-Jan-20 01:09 PM] scubapanda#2485
Trying to buy it makes no difference. It'a 0/3. Cancel order. And it's back.


[15-Jan-20 01:10 PM] scubapanda#2485
So my question is how do we stop an evil player from posting hundreds of orders like this. I don't think they have any risk in doing it?


[15-Jan-20 01:10 PM] cipi#4502
that's why we need the reputation system...
you need to let the swap fail, not cancel it... if you cancel it, nothing will be banned


[15-Jan-20 01:11 PM] scubapanda#2485
Ah, how many hours do I keep my phone on to see the swap fail?


[15-Jan-20 01:12 PM] cipi#4502
i don't know... try it out


[15-Jan-20 01:17 PM] cipi#4502
you can simply skip this order from the beginning if you know it is a bad one and take the second best order from orderbook... till we have a good working reputation system... all still WIP


[15-Jan-20 01:20 PM] scubapanda#2485
Yes, thanks, I'm just a little worried that this is a way for an evil actor to make the whole dex unusable.

Is it safe to clear data and cache on Android ?


[15-Jan-20 05:20 PM] CrisF#3405
Ahh, where can I get a. Code?


[15-Jan-20 05:55 PM] CiPhEr#2091
Perhaps if it is mainly (in this case for the zec order) an issue of outdated version of mm2 being ran, maybe latest version enforcement could be coded in. Such as if your version is reporting older than others on network it won't allow connection or something?

I know it's probably more complicated than that but just an idea. I know it's beta software and big thanks to all those that are making mm2 a reality!

[15-Jan-20 10:24 PM] Deleted User#0000
@CiPhEr I've noticed people having problems with erc20 addresses, maybe this will help:
'to get the checksummed version of your erc20 address, search for it at https://etherscan.io/
then copy what is returned.
e.g. if you search for 0x331953f1fd954af6c162a3243809337fd938272d it will display as  0x331953F1fD954AF6c162A3243809337fd938272D'

hmmm i search on there and it doesn't change my address at all


[15-Jan-20 10:46 PM] CiPhEr#2091
grrr two different exchanges i've tried but they don't provide checksum deposit address wallet wont let me send


[15-Jan-20 10:46 PM] CiPhEr#2091
i'm assuming that is the issue


[15-Jan-20 10:46 PM] smkhound#7640
it should change a few chars to capitalise via etherscan search


[15-Jan-20 10:46 PM] smkhound#7640
yeah it is the checksum


[15-Jan-20 10:47 PM] CiPhEr#2091
i checked each and every letter, no difference


[15-Jan-20 10:48 PM] CiPhEr#2091
oh shit actually when i go to next page there is a difference lol that worked, thanks! I was just looking at the drop down after pasting in the address. You have to click and go to next page. Funny how Binance, the creator of BUSD, doesn't have an option to display checksummed address....

[16-Jan-20 04:35 AM] Deleted User#0000
My KMD/LTC swaps usually take 20-30mins. I guess this is due to kmd requiring a notarized confirmation as well as there being multiple txs for maker and taker payments before the swap goes through.


[16-Jan-20 04:45 AM] TonyL#3577
Yes, that‚Äôs correct: for KMD and Komodo assetchains it‚Äôs waiting for one notarization to secure trade participants by dPoW mechanism

What also sucks a bit: DEX is valued at 0 on the app, which makes my account balance look pretty sad every time is start the app :P. Maybe display DEX value as the highest bid on the app itself as that's basically the current market price as it's not listed anywhere else currently

I‚Äôm preparing for my first Atomic Swap on AtomicDEX: just need help with 1 question.  BTC is on my own wallet outside of AtomicDEX which I‚Äôd like to convert to a different coin.  Does this mean I‚Äôd have 2 BTC network fees‚Ä¶ one, to transfer into my Receiving Address assigned by AtomicDEX, and a second network fee to send those BTC to the peer that exchanges it into my target currency?


[21-Jan-20 04:01 AM] rphair [COSD]#7279
p.s. I see the Bitcoin fees are pretty reasonable now‚Ä¶ I just want to make sure I adopt a best practice & not make 2 transfers when it might be possible with 1.


[21-Jan-20 04:16 AM] gcharang#6833
@rphair [COSD] it is more than 2 network fees unfortunately
if your BTC are currently in an address that is generated by a wallet from outside the Komodo ecosystem, you have to transfer them to the address created by your atomicDEX wallet
then, if you are the taker(fills an already existing order), you pay BTC tx fee twice(dexfee and taker payment) ,and one more txn fee on the other chain(taker claim) --> this one's value should be negligible for most coins


[21-Jan-20 04:18 AM] gcharang#6833
you can read about the exact protocol here: <https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/start-here/core-technology-discussions/atomicdex.html#introducing-taker-and-maker>
it should help you understand the need for more than 2 txns

Tezos POC is done and official support should come in 2 - 3 months
ETC integration should be straight forward  as ETH is already supported. but, it needs  a contract to be deployed and some additional dev + testing. I don't know the ETA for it as there are other higher priority tasks.

Yeah, that's a good feature request, but somebody needs to make reliable API with DEX/USD price based on dex trades history. Maybe @smkhound will be interested to make such in a free time (like a coinpaprika/coingecko but with DEX/USD price based on last known performed swap)

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #132: The password requirements are bad
Nope. As discussed [here](https://protonmail.com/blog/protonmail-com-blog-password-vs-passphrase/), "XKCD assumes the attacker knows the user has generated a passphrase by choosing four of the most common (top 2,048 in this example) dictionary words at random. Even so, the passphrase contains more entropy than the password."

@fazer , I often add multiple coins at once, e.g. RICK and MORTY, and it works. can you remind me where the bug report is for that? and for wallet config? we have an internal PR on num+char queued (issue 622)

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #132: The password requirements are bad
That might still depend on the calculations I guess. The article you cite says that in a password with special characters there can be 94 variations per character, which gives us
94^12=475920314814253376475136
which seems like more entropy than, again from that article, four of top 2048 words
2048^4=17592186044416

Looking at http://ascii-table.com/ the number 94 seems reasonable.
If we use a wider vocabulary of 20000 then
20000^4=160000000000000000
still doesn't beat the random passw...

That is unlikely to be the case. As the XKCD comic discusses, the additional entropy gained by requiring capital letters, numbers, and special characters is usually extraordinarily limited because of human psychology (not combinatorics). The password Tr0ub4dor&3 is really a single word with common additions and substitutions, which is what you get when a normal person makes up a password. A capital first letter is the most likely way to add a capital only doub...

i notice that when i use the suggested .json method of running mm2 (so as to minimize visibility of seed to other processes) the mm2 running window doesn't show any nice info like it used to such as progress of swap, etc. Is there any way of having the info and doing it this safer way?


[27-Jan-20 10:47 PM] CiPhEr#2091
i'm in the process of creating a script file that will connect my mm2 to all the electrum servers i need and have a few questions:

Should I place all electrum servers for a coin in the file (for instance VRSC has 3)? Is it for backup in case one goes down, or does it connect to all 3 all the time? (wouldn't mind conserving resources on the machine if not needed)

Do you suggest using ssl in connecting to the electrum servers? I'm assuming no sensitive info is sent back and forth, but wouldn't mind it being private. Do most of them support it?

Thanks in advance for the help!


[28-Jan-20 01:37 AM] Oszy#5734
just list all of them in the connect function, it will connect to one that works

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #132: The password requirements are bad
On a related note, in our "wallet unlock" screen the password field does not currently allow to *paste* a password, which prevents the random passwords from being used via the [password managers](https://lifehacker.com/the-five-best-password-managers-5529133).
The "view seed phrase" action doesn't have that limit, so it might be an accidental behavior on our part.


[28-Jan-20 05:52 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
The extra electrum servers are for reliability, we switch to the next server if there's a problem with the existing connection, IIRC. TLS is recommended of course, but I am not sure if the servers have the proper key chain for that (via something like letsencrypt). @artem.pikulin and @cipi will know this in fine fine fine detail.

I'm starting to think atomicdex will fail. The average crypto noob doesn't care about decentralized or centralized. They want speed and volume. Also, probably want it on the eth network.

Time depositing a coin to a cex trading and withdrawing vs loading up your key/passphrase and doing an atomic swap.  Which is faster?


[29-Jan-20 06:02 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
As currently Atomicdex is still in development ,  it is not expected to have much use.  Still building and refining it.   When it is ready for production use then we will acquaint various coin generators and providers with it.

Atomic swaps are no doubt the future of trading cryptocurrency between users. This space will become so heavily regulated eventually it will be the only thing that survives aside from giving the tax man a running tab of all your activities.

@cipi I think that we might want to spin up at least 1 Geth node for backup in such cases. We're sticking with Parity because they provide custom tracing API allowing to retrieve ETH transactions history directly from nodes without using 3rd party explorers. 
So if only Geth node is working up to date ETH transactions history won't be available, but all other functionality will work that is definitely better than situation when it's not possible to activate ETH/ERC20 coins at all.


[30-Jan-20 06:11 AM] cipi#4502
i restarted the parity nodes with `--jsonrpc-apis=safe,-traces`, to disable the `trace`-calls that are crashing the node... and i was able to enable all ERC20 tokens... but 2 nodes died anyway couple hours ago... so it is not 100%
question about geth: does it have its own database? do you know how much GB it takes?


[30-Jan-20 06:21 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Geth uses leveldb engine (https://etherworld.co/2019/02/06/reading-ethereum-geth-database-leveldb/) I've not used Geth for a while, but according to this article the fast sync DB took ~130Gb with 1.9.0 version: https://blog.ethereum.org/2019/07/10/geth-v1-9-0/. Should not increase too much after six months I think.

Just discovered a rather unique & rare bug in AtomicDEX: I tapped to claim rewards (Komodo), and as it was loading, my iPhone reached 10% battery and the pop up to warn me and offer to switch to low power came up. I chose to switch to low power but when the pop up went away, AtomicDEX interface went fully black screen, had to exit the app and reopen. Never seen this before, but then I suppose it‚Äôs a rare circumstance for occurrence

they have to make themselves compatible first, it's not really about what we plan

@gcharang okay üôèüèº


[31-Jan-20 05:02 AM] cipi#4502
problem is that the parity nodes continue to answer to rpc-requests from AtomicDEX even if the node is not synced... very bad design... and you can not switch nodes in AtomicDEX GUI without changing source code
atm eth2.cipig.net is resyncing and every request to that node returns nonsense
guess it does not make sense to resync every node one after one, since AtomicDEX GUI will fail anyway
will start the complete resync on all nodes... and till the resync is done, no ERC20 in AtomicDEX

@Oszy thx a lot for these links, this might be very helpful in the future. For now, Id like to use some earning from other coins to eventually invest in more HUSH, it is more, or less wishful thinking for now, as Im only reverse counting from my potential gains from the past, which havent capitalized, though I wish to make it right this time, if theres another opportunity and use lets say something in range of 0.33-1 BTC at once to buy HUSH, if price is really interesting at that time. (So, hopefully several 10K) Of course, Id need several X in other currencies to make this happen, hence its purely hypothetical. üòÑ

Do you think it would be possible to get something like hummingbot configured to run a marketmaking/arb desk to atomicDEX and bring in some liquidity?


[31-Jan-20 06:14 PM] gcharang#6833
> yes, hummingbot is on our radar. more generally, we are creating a bot that can bridge atomicDEX with any external APIs ex: the CEXs. it should help liquidity as the marketmakers can offer coins on the dex for a higher price than the CEX. it is still in early dev though

there's no easy way to get pubkey from the atomicDEX app right now
if you have a native wallet installed(verus agama native/ocean qt wallet), you can use the "validateaddress" rpc

ok, thanks!
Question- when I am starting mm2 in linux, are there any problems with starting it with just stdbuf -oL ./mm2 as opposed to stdbuf -oL nohup ./mm2 ?
I believe the nohup command just specifies that if I exit that window it will persist, no?
I just like all the extra info that comes along in the window as it is running which isn't there when I use the nohup command.


[01-Feb-20 03:26 PM] CiPhEr#2091
Also, I notice in the documentation that terminal output is expected while swaps are initiated, showing the various steps as it progresses. My terminal doesn't show any of this. Is there a way I can have this displayed?


[01-Feb-20 03:30 PM] cipi#4502
start it with `stdbuf -oL nohup ../../target/debug/mm2 "{\"netid\":9999,\"gui\":\"nogui\",\"client\":1,\"userhome\":\"/${HOME#"/"}\",\"passphrase\":\"$passphrase\",\"rpc_password\":\"$userpass\"}" > /tmp/mm.log &` and use `tail -f /tmp/mm.log` wo watch the output
if you don't use nohup, the mm2 process will die if your ssh session dies


[01-Feb-20 04:02 PM] CiPhEr#2091
great, thanks! I will try that


[01-Feb-20 04:04 PM] CiPhEr#2091
having trouble doing a swap between my phone and the mm2 on my linux vm. I set up the order selling morty for rick and i see the order on the orderbook in my phone's app and initiate it but it stays at step 0/3 order matching and never proceeds.


[01-Feb-20 04:08 PM] CiPhEr#2091
in my log on mm2 linux vm it shows this:[seed_connection some ipaddresshere:47772] Error connection reset by peer (os error 104) writing to socket, dropping connection...


[01-Feb-20 04:08 PM] CiPhEr#2091
then it says connecting... and then connected on next line


[01-Feb-20 04:20 PM] cipi#4502
should be ok if it does not happen too often... looks like your node is loosing connection to the seed nodes and reconnects...
if it happens too often, networking is overloaded or overall load too high on that node


[01-Feb-20 04:20 PM] CiPhEr#2091
ok sounds good. Any ideas on being unable to do the rick morty swap from phone to pc?


[01-Feb-20 04:21 PM] CiPhEr#2091
oh i just tried again and it is going weird


[01-Feb-20 04:21 PM] cipi#4502
hmmm, sounds like networking trouble
is it always the same IP, or does it loose connection to all 3 seed nodes at once?


[01-Feb-20 04:25 PM] CiPhEr#2091
shoot it is probably my vpn


[01-Feb-20 04:25 PM] CiPhEr#2091
i just turned it off will try without that


[01-Feb-20 04:25 PM] CiPhEr#2091
i think the vpn switches ips from time to time


[01-Feb-20 04:28 PM] cipi#4502
mm2 should survive an IP switch, but maybe not so good during a swap, never tried that
is it possible that the VPN is blocking some ports?


[01-Feb-20 04:29 PM] CiPhEr#2091
possibly, i for sure will keep it off from now on while testing this


[01-Feb-20 04:33 PM] CiPhEr#2091
as far as the connections dropping and reconnecting this one is doing it:

[seed_connection 195.201.116.176:47772] Didn't receive any data in 30 seconds, dropping connection
[seed_connection 195.201.116.176:47772] Connecting...
[seed_connection 195.201.116.176:47772] Connected
and this one:
[seed_connection 46.4.87.18:47772] Didn't receive any data in 30 seconds, dropping connection
[seed_connection 46.4.87.18:47772] Connecting...
[seed_connection 46.4.87.18:47772] Connected

Both do this around once every 5 min or so


[01-Feb-20 04:35 PM] cipi#4502
that is not good... every 5 minutes is too often... this happens when ip switches... or when it looses connection for some other reasons


[01-Feb-20 04:35 PM] CiPhEr#2091
hmmm yeah ip is constant now that vpn is off


[01-Feb-20 04:36 PM] cipi#4502
there are btw 3 seeds, 46.4.78.11, 46.4.87.18 and 195.201.116.176


[01-Feb-20 04:36 PM] cipi#4502
but i don't see the errors on my nodes


[01-Feb-20 04:38 PM] CiPhEr#2091
when connecting mm2 it complains that it cannot listen on my ip address (this is a local machine behind a router). says it couldn't bind to external ip, so nat is likely to be present. says 'we'll be okay though'


[01-Feb-20 04:40 PM] cipi#4502
yes, that is ok... all nodes behind NAT (Network address translation) have this, but that is ok...
but the node needs connection to the seed nodes... they are used for the orderbooks


[01-Feb-20 04:41 PM] CiPhEr#2091
ok, i just reconnected so i'll see if it stops dropping connection, etc. might be ok now i'll see. Sure helps watching the tail -f log thanks for that


[01-Feb-20 04:42 PM] cipi#4502
yes, you basically see everything that happens when it happens üôÇ


[01-Feb-20 04:55 PM] CiPhEr#2091
still dropping connection / reconnecting... I placed another rick/morty test order on there and took a few minutes for some reason for order to be matched after initiating it on my phone.


[01-Feb-20 04:55 PM] CiPhEr#2091
i would like to use mm2 on a vps instead but am super weary about putting seed on a vps seems pretty risky


[01-Feb-20 05:08 PM] cipi#4502
as long as you keep the login stuff safe (disabling root login, disabling password authentication and only allow ssh login with key) it should be safe... especially if you are the only user and mm2 is the only app that runs on that node


[01-Feb-20 05:15 PM] CiPhEr#2091
yeah may try it with just test wallet to see if i'm getting same issues as i am with home machine just don't know why the orderbook servers keep losing connection.

This last swap, I had this in log: 
[seed_connection 46.4.87.18:47772] Error Connection reset by peer (os error 104) writing to socket, dropping connection
[seed_connection 46.4.87.18:47772] Connecting...
[seed_connection 46.4.87.18:47772] Connected
then 1 second later:
Entering the maker_swap_loop MORTY/RICK

so looks like this issue is definitely hampering trades


[01-Feb-20 05:16 PM] CiPhEr#2091
it is lubuntu in a virtualbox virtual machine on windows, hmm i'll try with bridged connection instead of NAT see if that makes difference


[01-Feb-20 05:17 PM] cipi#4502
yes, you will surely manage to do some swaps even with this issue, but it will not be much fun... many swaps will fail or not even start...


[01-Feb-20 05:17 PM] CiPhEr#2091
true yeah hopefully bridged mode helps


[01-Feb-20 05:19 PM] cipi#4502
yes, maybe the issue is some sort of double NAT, like when your home router does NAT and the VM on your PC running mm2 does a second NAT... eliminating the last NAT might help


[01-Feb-20 05:23 PM] CiPhEr#2091
nope still same issue while running bridged üò¶ also turned off firewall which apparently doesn't help either


[01-Feb-20 05:23 PM] CiPhEr#2091
maybe it just needs to be able to accept connections from worldwideweb


[01-Feb-20 05:25 PM] cipi#4502
no, it should work without beeing able to accept connections from outside... that would be hard to achieve anyway if you are forced to use NAT (and that applies to almost all home internet connections)


[01-Feb-20 05:26 PM] cipi#4502
i assume your connection does not really change IP every 5 minutes...


[01-Feb-20 05:30 PM] CiPhEr#2091
no no my ip is always the same even after weeks


[01-Feb-20 05:30 PM] CiPhEr#2091
does your mm2 do the same by chance? I don't know if you looked at your logs lately or not


[01-Feb-20 05:31 PM] CiPhEr#2091
now it is saying error broken pipe (os error 32) writing to socket, dropping connection


[01-Feb-20 05:31 PM] CiPhEr#2091
for the 195.201.116.176:47772


[01-Feb-20 05:33 PM] cipi#4502
atm i have only nodes running on VPS or dedicated servers, they don't have the issue... haven't started mm2 at home for a week or two, but it worked fine before... i will boot my second PC and try it out :-)
if it is loosing connection to only one seed node and not to all 3 at once, it should be ok, still it should not happen that often... let me see what my home mm2 has to say


[01-Feb-20 05:35 PM] CiPhEr#2091
cool, thanks! I googled the os error 104, this means that the server is sending me a rst packet, closing the connection


[01-Feb-20 05:38 PM] cipi#4502
my mm2 started up fine and connected to all 3 seeds... will try a swap


[01-Feb-20 05:38 PM] CiPhEr#2091
i wonder if how i start my electrum server connections with mm2 has something to do with it. I have a script that starts all of them at once


[01-Feb-20 05:39 PM] cipi#4502
i do the same :-)
it is ok


[01-Feb-20 05:40 PM] CiPhEr#2091
so your log may not show the reconnections until a few minutes, maybe like 10 for the first time


[01-Feb-20 05:42 PM] cipi#4502
if you start it with `stdbuf -oL`, the output should be visible instantly (one line), else it is buffered, indeed


[01-Feb-20 05:43 PM] cipi#4502
looks fine on my end... started a VRSC/KMD swap (buy VRSC with KMD as taker)... no disconnects so far


[01-Feb-20 05:43 PM] CiPhEr#2091
hmm interesting problem i'm assuming is in my router configuration


[01-Feb-20 05:44 PM] cipi#4502
`11,3 Mbit/s down 1,2 Mbit/s up` is my current internet speed here at home, so pretty low


[01-Feb-20 05:46 PM] CiPhEr#2091
I have 93.70 Mbps down, 11.18 Mbps up


[01-Feb-20 05:46 PM] cipi#4502
lol... so that is not the issue


[01-Feb-20 05:46 PM] CiPhEr#2091
9ms ping to the speedtest.net


[01-Feb-20 05:46 PM] cipi#4502
there is something with the setup, but i don't see where the problem could be


[01-Feb-20 05:47 PM] CiPhEr#2091
yeah well thanks for looking to it for me!


[01-Feb-20 05:56 PM] cipi#4502
btw, i don't think it has something to do with your router, more with the virtualbox networking settings... i would google/look into that stuff


[01-Feb-20 05:56 PM] CiPhEr#2091
hmm ok will look into that


[01-Feb-20 10:04 PM] CiPhEr#2091
trying to run mm2 in an ubuntu guest os on windows 10. I keep getting:
[seed_connection 46.4.87.18:47772] Error Connection reset by peer (os error 104) writing to socket, dropping connection
[seed_connection 46.4.87.18:47772] Connecting...
[seed_connection 46.4.87.18:47772] Connected
as well as

[seed_connection 195.201.116.176:47772] Connected
Like literally every 30 seconds or so.

cipi helped me out earlier but we couldn't find the problem. Does anyone have any ideas on this? Swaps sometimes go through but usually dont because of this connection problem. I've tried plugging directly into my modem (bypassing router), tried bridged networking and nat as well as various ethernet adapters in the virtualbox settings. Would really like to run this on a vm until I get dedicated hardware. Any ideas?


[01-Feb-20 11:06 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Dual boot or use a USB ubuntu OS - VM not set up right with the system.... @Cipher


[01-Feb-20 11:07 PM] CiPhEr#2091
i just may have found a setting that prevents this issue- i haven't had the problem for several minutes after choosing the most basic adapter in virtualbox settings

i see a lot of this (every 10 seconds) in my mm2 log:

started happening after i had a swap fail. Restarted mm2 and it is still spamming this. Is this normal?

right on. It is working great on virtualbox now. For anyone out there that is having the problem of orderbook servers disconnecting / reconnecting be sure to choose the PCnet-FAST III (aM79c973) adapter type in the network settings of virtualbox.


[02-Feb-20 12:27 AM] CiPhEr#2091
I might have found a possible bug in one of my failed swaps. I will have to repeat it a few more time to see if it is real or not but it seems:
midway through a swap if you create another order for the same pair you are swapping and the same taker bites on that order too, it may get confused and use the original swap inception time for the second swap as well which will lead to a false timeout.

i'll check back though if i can validate it

Question, I have a few assets I‚Äôm trying out AtomicDEX with and I created their corresponding wallets and added them to the wallet, closed the app last night and reopened this morning and now I have non of those wallets in AtomicDEX and it says I have 0 assets. Where did they go? None of the wallets I created are still there, help please, lol

[02-Feb-20 12:09 PM] Oszy#5734
@fat3lvis not a bug, it's needed to keep the app alive in background on iOS. you can set a muted sound in the settings yourself


[02-Feb-20 12:17 PM] fat3lvis#6079
Where? All those labels are strange. I mean what does an unmarked toggle next to the phrase ‚Äúplay at full volume‚Äù mean anyway? Will they play at half volume then? Also based on what your saying I‚Äôm guessing this sound I am hearing is the ‚Äúactive‚Äù event. Why do I have to go and make an audio file in order to mute this? Why wouldn‚Äôt you just add a ‚Äúmute‚Äù bottom that swaps the file for a prepared silent one? This is a really strange, and unnecessarily complex user experience as it is now.

hope this answers your question


[02-Feb-20 12:22 PM] Acura#2748
@fat3lvis This is necessary so that the app in the background does not lose the Internet connection and the order remains open.
You can turn down the sound in the settings, or use the volume keys to set the sound completely to silent.
However, the whole process will be optimized.

setting up my mm2 for use with eth right now and have question- i would like to include more than just one Ethereum RPC node, so should I write it like this?:
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"enable\",\"coin\":\"ETH\",\"urls\":[\"http://195.201.0.6:8555\",\"http://eth1.cipig.net:8555\",\"http://eth2.cipig.net:8555\",\"http://eth3.cipig.net:8555\"],\"swap_contract_address\":\"0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871\",\"gas_station_url\":\"https://ethgasstation.info/json/ethgasAPI.json\"}"
is this proper format? It works, but doesn't show each rpc node as being connected to in the log just don't know if i'm constructing this correctly or if I should use {} these to form an array?


[02-Feb-20 08:29 PM] CiPhEr#2091
hmmm discord is putting a bunch of extra stuff in my post above. Basically on the urls part, I want to know if it should be like: \"urls\":[\"urlofserver1here\",\"urlofserver2here",\"urlofserver3here\",\"urlofserver4here\"], or I should do something like: \"urls\":[{\"urlofserver1here\"},{\"urlofserver2here"},{\"urlofserver3here\"},{\"urlofserver4here\"}],

oh ok cool i'll use what you have there, thanks! Do you ever get the log listing the servers you are connecting to like the electrum servers do?


[02-Feb-20 08:34 PM] cipi#4502
no, it only shows `03 04:32:26, lp_coins:477] ticker = "ETH", etomic, block_count = 9407401`
but i know it is using all 3 nodes, because it shows an erro when i switch one of the off :-)
and the reason to add more than one url is that mm2 will loadbalance between the nodes and also send the requests to a working node (in case one of them goes down)

@fat3lvis 

I agree. I basically never open the app now because I hate the sound so much and I'm not sophisticated enough/can't be bothered to create/find a silent audio file to replace it. At least include a silent file to switch to with the app

@CiPhEr 
Just follow what I posted above a while back


[04-Feb-20 12:55 AM] Oszy#5734
`At least include a silent file to switch to with the app` 
Can't do anything that would compromise the chance to get the app accepted in the App Stores. 
They have very strict rules, and bypassing them with tricks like muted sounds to get background process access, is one of them. 
users have to do it themselves.


[04-Feb-20 03:46 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
Some ideas for alternative sound defaults (sound themes):
singing bowl sounds ( https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2156587216668109 ), maybe different compositions based on order and swap status;
brain wave sounds ( such as 40 hz, https://youtu.be/wDZgzsQh0Dw ), perhaps configurable as it's just a number.


[04-Feb-20 03:49 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
Also everybody's welcome to gather alternative sound themes (accessible via http). When we have some, we can make the UI switch between them.

So I tried to exchange 75 KMD to BTC that's roughly 0.0058 = ‚Ç¨53,00 at the time of the transaction, but since the total is less than 0.00777 it doesn't accept the transaction, that is unfortunate because as BTC value increases, that limit is way too high... Or am I missing something about how the dex works?


[04-Feb-20 09:57 PM] gcharang#6833
0.00777 is kinda an arbitrary limit set in the software to prevent users from making trades where the on chain transaction fees represent a large percent of the trade volume
this limit will be configurable in the future

[05-Feb-20 01:07 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
@Pumtchak , I like the existing sounds. The idea is for someone *with a different taste* pick a different sound theme, make it available via http, then we can make such themes easily downloadable through the app. In the future we might even share the most popular theme URLs via the p2p gossip protocol (should be easy enough when the gossip infrastructure is there).


[05-Feb-20 01:14 AM] Pumtchak#0362
Ok cool feature. What format the audio file should be ?


[05-Feb-20 01:14 AM] gcharang#6833
mp3

{Reactions}
üëç 

[05-Feb-20 01:20 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
sound theme URL should have (any of the) following files: active.mp3  applause.mp3  failed.mp3  lastSound.mp3  maker.mp3  taker.mp3
for example, if the URL is http://bit.ly/beat then it might have http://bit.ly/beat/active.mp3 and http://bit.ly/beat/maker.mp3


[05-Feb-20 01:25 AM] Pumtchak#0362
ah ok. so need to create some sound theme and share it via http

[05-Feb-20 01:25 AM] Pumtchak#0362
was going to ask if we could listen to live radio stream, but i guess this answer my question


[05-Feb-20 01:26 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
if there are free stream urls then we might try to implement streaming


[05-Feb-20 01:27 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
but it will be a more complex task than switching the sound theme


[05-Feb-20 01:27 AM] Pumtchak#0362
there are a lot. but various format though (mp3, m3u, wsx ...)


[05-Feb-20 01:28 AM] Pumtchak#0362
ok thanks


[05-Feb-20 01:28 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
if m3u is simply a list of mp3 URLs then we can download these files as needed and play them as usual mp3s; hence maker.m3u with a list of URLs might be a low-hanging fruit for "streaming"

not atm, the min amount is fixed at 0.00777... it will be changed in the future to something more dynamic though
but swapping BTC worth 20 USD does not make much sense, since the average txfee is 0.65 USD as of  https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/, so more than 3% of the trade volume, which kills any decent margin the maker has set

[06-Feb-20 04:43 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
no


[06-Feb-20 04:44 AM] ComputerGenie#7004
they added many coins from within the community because there was little integration overhead after they added KMD, but no direct relationship

Update: We are still evaluating the damage done by the recent attack. 
At the moment we have completed calculations on KMD token and there seems to be a loss of 1066 coins out of 48015, therefore 46949 will be returned to users.

Hello Kmd, community.  It's been a while since I've been by and i was curious as to the current state of the atomicdex if anyone would be willing to update me.  I generally stay fairly active on reddit/twitter social media and anytime I see questions about "what's everyone using now that binance split to a US version"  & "which dex do people actually use"  I take 5 minutes out to comment on KMD and it's atomicdex project.  However it's time I update myself a little bit to keep informed.  
If this isn't the right channel please guide me to the correct place to ask and update my info, thanks.

Any plan to include Marmara (MCL) on AtomicDEX? I think AtomicDEX will be flooding among university students if we add MCL to AtomicDEX. Web version of AtomicDEX may be used for ecommerce site that we are planning to create a platform to run with cryptocurrencies only. We can add perhaps credit loop functionality in there.

question- i want to use custom fees on transferring some eth but why are there two fields gas [gwei] as well as gas price [gwei] do i just enter the amount i want to spend in gwei twice?


[08-Feb-20 07:50 PM] cipi#4502
`gas_price` is what you are looking for... `gas` is only the max. amount of gas allowed for the operation, i just set it to `55000`, but it is not really relevant for a simple operation like sending some tokens from one address to another


[08-Feb-20 07:52 PM] CiPhEr#2091
oh ok so gas field is actually gas limit. I put 21000 in there and says i don't have enough eth it think i am saying i am willing to pay 21000 eth


[08-Feb-20 07:53 PM] cipi#4502
no, it just means you don't have enough ETH to pay the gas... what tokens are you trying to transfer?


[08-Feb-20 07:53 PM] CiPhEr#2091
trying to send eth


[08-Feb-20 07:53 PM] CiPhEr#2091
hmmm maybe it isn't gwei as it says it is and i have to convert it to gwei


[08-Feb-20 07:55 PM] cipi#4502
`curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"withdraw\",\"coin\":\"ETH\",\"to\":\"0xFwhatever\",\"amount\":1,\"fee\":{\"type\":\"EthGas\",\"gas_price\":\"3\",\"gas\":55000}}" | json_pp`
i always use that to tranfer ETH (i simply add 1 to the standard gasprice i get from here https://www.etherchain.org/api/gasPriceOracle


[08-Feb-20 07:56 PM] cipi#4502
maybe it does not like your gas:21000... but i don't know why, not an erc20 expert


[08-Feb-20 07:57 PM] CiPhEr#2091
ok yeah and i try to enter 0.000000001 and it doesn't like that either ha


[08-Feb-20 07:57 PM] cipi#4502
no, not as gas_price... it is indeed in gwei


[08-Feb-20 07:58 PM] CiPhEr#2091
ok


[08-Feb-20 07:59 PM] cipi#4502
after you call `withdraw`, mm2 will show you what exactly it will do (used gas_price and so on), so you can check before calling `curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"send_raw_transaction\",\"coin\":\"ETH\",\"tx_hex\":\"RAW_TX_HERE\"}"` and really sending the tx out

[08-Feb-20 08:01 PM] cipi#4502

[08-Feb-20 08:02 PM] CiPhEr#2091
well aparently it isn't :troll: i guess i'll just use agama


[08-Feb-20 08:04 PM] cipi#4502
are you trying to withdraw the entire amount? could be related to that... but i am just speculating


[08-Feb-20 08:05 PM] CiPhEr#2091
yeah it worked just fine through agama, i'm guessing the ui has the custom fee stuff there but it just isn't quite supported yet


[08-Feb-20 08:07 PM] CiPhEr#2091
wow transferred for less than $0.01 goes to show what a scam exchanges are with their withdrawal fees, usually it is about $5 of eth to withdrawal eth


[08-Feb-20 08:09 PM] cipi#4502
yes, indeed, most exchanges are simply charging a fixed fee and almost never change it


[08-Feb-20 08:09 PM] CiPhEr#2091
oh i guess binance is just around $0.681 to withdrawal just checked


[08-Feb-20 08:09 PM] CiPhEr#2091
still high though


[08-Feb-20 08:10 PM] cipi#4502

[08-Feb-20 08:11 PM] cipi#4502

[08-Feb-20 08:17 PM] CiPhEr#2091
oh cool yeah i'm a little leary on using it on a vps with the seed on there. I'm sure altsbit had a better security design than i could ever dream of implementing myself and they still got hacked


[08-Feb-20 08:18 PM] CiPhEr#2091
probably will just use it on hardware at home i found my mm2 ran quite stable on a vm believe it or not


[08-Feb-20 08:18 PM] CiPhEr#2091
all that stuff in there for the other exchanges I just delete all of that if all i am using mmtools for is managing prices on adex right?


[08-Feb-20 08:20 PM] cipi#4502
no, i don't think they did it better than you could do it with a linux VPS and some basic settings...
i can help with that, btw
you can use mmtools for AtomicDEX, Binance, Coinex and Crex24 atm, it just depends how you call it
there are examples in the repo how to call it (the .sh-scripts)

agreed re:altbits. Basic server security is often more secure than a desktop with a bunch of other stuff installed. Also you are a bit less of a target unless you are storing huge value. You can even setup some simple encryption of your mm2.json, and use a password to decrypt it at runtime via python.

i see, so that way the mm2.json would be encrypted in memory as it runs but at least the file wouldn't just be sitting there unencrypted

AtomicDEX uses ETH checksum verification: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-55. Thus, address input is case-sensitive. You should use mixed case as recepient (https://etherscan.io/address/0x5a0b54d5dc17e0aadc383d2db43b0a0d3e029c4c for example for this address mixed case one is 0x5A0b54D5dc17e0AadC383d2db43B0a0D3E029c4c)

> front running
this problem is mostly seen in case of onchain orderbooks  for DEXs that serve only ETH and ERC-20 on the ETH chain

AtomicDEX is crosschain and p2p

@coolermaster thats by design to circumvent iOS from shutting down AtomicDex when it‚Äôs in the background. Annoying that Apple requires this. I think you can change the sound yourself though.

I think it would be useful to have more verbose output from the swapping process. 
Currently it shows "swap onging" 0/3 1/3 2/3 3/3 
This can give a little insight on what is going on, why it's taking long at one stage and what issue that caused a failure if it happens.

Have you guys seen flash loans from aave? Basically, they allow someone to borrow without collateral for a brief period 1 block. If the loan is not repaid within that one block the order does not go through.

how can i restart a swap that's only partially finished?  currently at TakerPaymentSent step


[16-Feb-20 11:06 AM] cipi#4502
you can't restart it, it either completes or failes... if you cancel it, it is failed and you have to start a new one


[16-Feb-20 11:10 AM] webworker01#3884
Ok, so if both sides funds are in limbo, what should be done? Seems like it just needs to be  told to do the final spends now


[16-Feb-20 11:11 AM] webworker01#3884
If I cancel the order both sides spend back to original accounts?


[16-Feb-20 11:13 AM] cipi#4502
if it fails, funds will be returned automatically after some time
if that fails for whichever reason, you can call ` recover_funds_of_swap`: https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#recover-funds-of-swap
what do you mean by "cancel"? cancel the order or the swap?

probably about 8 hours now


[16-Feb-20 11:22 AM] cipi#4502
you need to wait till it is finished... till it didn't failed it is not failed and could be completed succesfully
your node is likely wiating for makerpayment... likely some KMD with notarization... what are you trading? what is makercoin?


[16-Feb-20 11:24 AM] webworker01#3884

that is `recover_funds_of_swap`, which only works if swap is finished (event type `Finished`)

if swap is finished it is sent to the seed nodes and you can look up the error with the URL... just need to know your swap uuid

@Oszy Would be useful the app communicated that with the user to clarify that is happening (something like "trying to reconnect..." and then "connection restored, initiating  swap"

what would be suggested as best practice if I wanted to use a full node instead of an electrum for say VRSC for my mm2? Or should I just make my own VRSC electrum server? And if so i guess i could just make an electrum locally? They are just all down right now and I would like to do some testing on mm2 involving VRSC


[17-Feb-20 01:56 PM] CiPhEr#2091
or actually the better question to ask- since my mobile atomicdex app is working with vrsc just fine how do i see what electrum it is using?


[17-Feb-20 01:56 PM] cipi#4502
VRSC electrum is broken because the electrum server starts showing `WARNING:BlockProcessor:daemon blocks do not form a chain; resetting the prefetcher` error and does not advance further... i tried it myself
in mm2-API you can simply enable native VRSC: `curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"enable\",\"coin\":\"VRSC\"}"`


[17-Feb-20 01:58 PM] CiPhEr#2091
oh interesting, so with that api command it will just download chain and run native? Guess I may be able to download bootstrap to help it along


[17-Feb-20 01:59 PM] cipi#4502
you need to run VRSC daemon first and sync the chain
bootstraps can be found here: https://dexstats.info/bootstrap.php

the mobile atomic dex app on android seems to be working ok, although a bit slow interfacing with VRSC maybe it uses a different electrum that is working?


[17-Feb-20 02:03 PM] cipi#4502
i don't know why it is showing something... i only know of this electrums: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/electrums/VRSC
el1.veruscoin.io in answering, the other 2 are down... i don't know why the one is still up or on which height it is... i only got the info that it is broken and after trying to run servers myself ran into the same issue

Most probably this, and we can add an option to update the electrum URLs. No such option YET.

right those are the only ones i know of too


[17-Feb-20 02:08 PM] cipi#4502
but first, the `daemon blocks do not form a chain`-issue must be solved... and there is also another issue i know of: when you start/restart the VRSC electrums, they take 24-48h to actually be online... that does not happen with any other coin, so it must be an issue with the verus_hash-imlementation

For fellow developers, a Docker + macOS question.
I'm working on a dexp2p+sqlite prototype and hitting what seems to be a port forwarding problem?
I'm exposing 14869, dexp2p RPC port ( https://gitlab.com/artemciy/mm-pubsub-db/-/blob/master/docker/Dockerfile#L89 ) but instead of the expected `HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed` I'm getting an `Empty reply from server` on that port ( https://gist.github.com/ArtemGr/93f30d0226104ec5f4588e3bf644599b ). Not used the Docker on a macOS (Mojave) a lot so not sure if I'm missing something obvious...


[17-Feb-20 02:13 PM] CiPhEr#2091
yeah i was thinking of trying this one: VerusCoin/VerusServicesSetup/blob/master/ElectrumX.md


[17-Feb-20 02:18 PM] cipi#4502
interesting... didn't knew of this repo https://github.com/VerusCoin/electrumx... i used my own... maybe they chenged/fixed it, but i have no info about that
will try to use that too, but need to check it first... can't simply replace it on the main electrums, since all coins use the same code, so it must in sync with master branch of main electrum repo.. maybe i make my own repo again... but best would be if they would make a PR to the main repo


[17-Feb-20 02:22 PM] CiPhEr#2091
yeah i may try following those directions on making my own for now, looks like pretty detailed instructions even I may be able to do it üôÇ


[17-Feb-20 02:27 PM] cipi#4502
@artemciy_dice i never used docker, but are you sure that this is the correct IP to access the exposed stuff from outside docker? https://gist.github.com/ArtemGr/93f30d0226104ec5f4588e3bf644599b#file-mac-port-forwarding-fails-txt-L37
i would expect that the docker image has another IP, maybe 127.0.0.2 or something


[17-Feb-20 02:33 PM] cipi#4502
@CiPhEr i had a quick look at the code, but to me it looks the same as mine: https://github.com/cipig/electrumx/tree/verus_hash2b
nothing new, so not fixed


[17-Feb-20 02:33 PM] CiPhEr#2091
so to run the vrsc daemon locally i would just download or build the vrsc cli wallet and start it, yes?


[17-Feb-20 02:34 PM] cipi#4502
yes


[17-Feb-20 02:34 PM] cipi#4502
and use the bootstrap before you start, syncing from scratch will take too long


[17-Feb-20 02:34 PM] CiPhEr#2091
ok cool i'll try that. any different .conf file settings or anything since i'm really not using it as a wallet or same?


[17-Feb-20 02:36 PM] cipi#4502
the default settings will work... if you are using it on a VPS with a real IP you may want to disable it listening on the external IP to save traffic, but you can leave everything else default... `listen=0` is the magic setting


[17-Feb-20 02:38 PM] CiPhEr#2091
cool ok


[17-Feb-20 02:40 PM] cipi#4502
before sending funds to the VRSC address of AtomicDEX, you need to call `importaddress` once... best is to do it before any funds are sent because than you can use the paramaters `verus-cli importaddress RWv8PKHmwnXepCeinnZU43BPju6CN8rkcM "" false` (use your own address) so it does not scan the entire chain for txes to your address (because there are none if you use this address for the first time). this will also save you a lot of time


[17-Feb-20 02:49 PM] CiPhEr#2091
funds were already sent to the atomicdex address of vrsc that i have


[17-Feb-20 02:50 PM] cipi#4502
oh, sure, i forgot üôÇ


[17-Feb-20 02:50 PM] CiPhEr#2091
should i still do the import address, is that like a watch address or something


[17-Feb-20 02:51 PM] cipi#4502
yes, you need that importaddress, else AtomicDEX can't see your funds on that address


[17-Feb-20 02:52 PM] cipi#4502
they are also "recorded" in the wallet.dat, like the "normal" non-watchonly-addresses


[17-Feb-20 02:52 PM] CiPhEr#2091
ok great i will do that


[17-Feb-20 02:56 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
thanks, @cipi! ip wasn't the case, but I felt more confidence investigating this together. on macOS docker container instance binds at `0.0.0.0` and pretends that everything works, except it does not... (https://superuser.com/a/1471412/50938, https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/pull/4968/files, https://github.com/AlmirKadric-Published/docker-tuntap-osx workaround). guess I'll be using a different server. or different docker.

P.S. switched to Docker Toolbox and configured port forwarding
can share my notes if someone needs to run Docker servers on macOS


[17-Feb-20 02:59 PM] cipi#4502
interesting... does it have to be Mac? üòâ


[17-Feb-20 03:00 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
i'm using it to build MM (sometimes even using two servers to parallelize the builds), so there was a chance to reuse the builds. but yeah, it'll work with a Linux server as well. never had a networking docker on Mac though, might come handy. and to participate in dexp2p groups. this server also has a lot of RAM


[17-Feb-20 03:10 PM] cipi#4502
DEXP2P does not need a lot of RAM, at least from what i saw... i am rebuilding the daemon on a new machine atm and will start posting orderbook-entries again... i let you know how much RAM the daemon will consume

@artemciy_dice it runs, but there are no peers any more, seems nobody is running that chain
but that is not a problem, you can add my node `komodod -ac_name=DEXP2P -dexp2p=2 -ac_supply=999999 -addnode=152.89.105.66 -daemon` and lookup orderbooks with eg `komodo-cli -ac_name=DEXP2P DEX_orderbook 0 0 BTC KMD`... there are 60 KMD-pairs updated every 60s... the daemon currently uses 80MB, but without any peers


[17-Feb-20 03:36 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
@cipi, awesome! will connect tomorrow.
would it be easy to feed swaps and swaps_failed there? will be more natural getting them from dexp2p than from mysql, even if it's just the raw JSON data (no problem later recreating the structure with sqlite, mm-pubsub-db is about adding that structural ability to dexp2p)


[17-Feb-20 03:45 PM] cipi#4502
likely :-)
the broadcasted data can be 1MB in size: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/dexp2p.html#dex-broadcast
and the swap jsons have less than 10kb, so we could just send them over DEXP2P completely... but they will be lost after 1h afaik


[17-Feb-20 03:48 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
> but they will be lost after 1h afaik

hopefully for just the two minutes in future ( https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/455851625915875338/664500542961090580 ).
MM caretakers will index and persist the data for as long as needed.
(design I'm evaluating is for dexp2p to be used as a pubsub transport layer ( https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/373#issuecomment-569398755 ) for sqlite replication)


[17-Feb-20 04:03 PM] cipi#4502
are we talking about orderbooks or about swap data? because orderbooks don't need to be preserved for a long time, just the swap data


[17-Feb-20 04:05 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
depends on what you're calling an orderbook. in a decentralized system a peer needs much more information than a list of orders to trade efficiently.


[17-Feb-20 04:07 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
dexp2p was never about just porting an orderbook anyway, it is about *order matching* and about the gossip protocols that will be evolving to better support it in the UI.


[17-Feb-20 04:12 PM] cipi#4502
i meant the difference between orderbook data that is used to start a swap, compared to data about finished swaps
currently the finished swap data is sent to the seed nodes, saved there on disk, read by my parser and written to the SQL database
so you want to save the data for the orderbook to databases too? and the mm2 nodes are talking to the caretaker nodes and not to the dexp2p-network directly?


[17-Feb-20 04:17 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
currently if you'll publish the swap data to dexp2p then the caretaker prototype will pick it from there, persist it as needed and share it with the UI prototype


[17-Feb-20 04:21 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
> so you want to save the data for the orderbook to databases too

i'm not thinking in terms of the existing orderbook. i'm creating a layered system (transport - database - structure prototypes - logic prototypes) for next level orderbook that we'll need soon
( cf. https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/373#issuecomment-569390335 )


[17-Feb-20 04:23 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
at first it'll mostly contain the data that is currently missing from the order matching information that we already have in UI (e.g. missing from existing orderbook)


[17-Feb-20 04:24 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
storing the existing orderbook there will be trivial, but also not as important


[17-Feb-20 04:40 PM] cipi#4502
ok, i think i see now a bit clearer after reading through... that sounds like a massive restructure... it will be like a hardfork for AtomicDEX


[17-Feb-20 04:44 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
not really, more like a shift in how we think  D


[17-Feb-20 04:45 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
and it will be gradually adding bits of useful information here and there ( cf. gossip use cases in https://gitlab.com/artemciy/mm-pubsub-db/-/blob/master/373-p2p-order-matching.md ) before it matures enough for the orderbook proper


[17-Feb-20 05:04 PM] cipi#4502
i will broadcast the swap data into the DEXP2P, the entire json, tagged with tagA=swaps and tagB=failed/success
storing the entire json is better anyway, because it allows for more analysis, like timing


[17-Feb-20 05:05 PM] cipi#4502
oh wait, there is also the difference between maker and taker (same swap uuid, different directories on the seed nodes)
need to address that too


[17-Feb-20 05:06 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
we can probably detect this in the caretaker prototype based on the JSON content


[17-Feb-20 05:07 PM] cipi#4502
hmmm... what about the uuid of the swap? maybe we should use that in the tag too...


[17-Feb-20 05:08 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
every new tag value means a separate new pull request to dexp2p


[17-Feb-20 05:09 PM] cipi#4502
how about using 2 different chains, one for the finished swap data and another one for the orderbook data?


[17-Feb-20 05:10 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
i *think* using just tag values, maybe four of them, is all right. but if that's easier on your side to use a separate chain, then no problem whatsoever


[17-Feb-20 05:11 PM] cipi#4502
we can only use 2 tags, as per doc: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/dexp2p.html#dex-broadcast


[17-Feb-20 05:12 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
i mean the tag values, they shouldn't be as limited


[17-Feb-20 05:12 PM] cipi#4502

Turn volume lower on the phone or you can load a custom sound file ( such as one that is silent ).  Coin sound is because App Store stupid requirements about apps running in the background

@CiPhEr afaik it takes around 44 hours if btc is involved
recently, the functionality that reports approximate refund time has been added to mm2. So future versions of AtomicDEX mobile should be able to inform you the refund time directly.

@here Please note that if you are trading RVN, they recently increased thier TX fees from 0.00001 RVN per KB(kilobyte) to 0.0100 RVN per KB(kilobyte). 
If you are using an older version you will likely see failed swaps via RVN, or may end up with funds in a "stuck" state and will be required to do a manual recovery.
The latest version of AtomicDEX includes an update to the new TX fee cost  - **please secure your seed and update as soon as possible**
For more information on the manual recovery process, please refer to this guide: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/qa/recover-atomicDEX-mobile-swap-desktop.html

Fellow android users here, i am asking for your cooperation if you use atomicdex on your phone.
I recently discovered that the app is using a lot of storage data on my phone, 20-30GB!! in a few days.

If you have atomicDEX on android can you please check in `Settings>Apps>AtomicDex `what is the storage usage for you, and if it's big like mine, send me a message with your phone model and android version, so we can identify the issue.

Thank you!

@Oszy yeah my android atomic dex uses tons of storage, it is mostly from log files. mm.log is the main offender, log.txt is the lesser one that still gets big. Every few days I have to delete them as mm.log grows about 2 to 3 gigs a day (app is always running). You need root access to do this, but can't imagine someone having an android phone and not having root access.


[25-Feb-20 10:50 PM] Oszy#5734
Thank @CiPhEr exactly what my suspicion was, mine isn't rooted so couldn't confirm. 
@gcharang it's the mm.log as suspected..

Hello i'd like to report a possible bug: i am trying to swap KMD for DEX and if i pass to another app then return to atomicdex after i use my fingerprint to authorize it shuts down, currently on step 2/3, also i would like to know when the sound effect will have the option to be eradicated from the app forever. thx


[26-Feb-20 08:52 AM] criptobear#6402
i am on android, the phone is a redmi note 5


[26-Feb-20 08:52 AM] Oszy#5734
@criptobear you can set any sound (mp3) in settings download a silent mp3 and set it 
the fingerprint crashes the app for me too i believe dev know about that


[26-Feb-20 08:53 AM] criptobear#6402
oh ok, sorry i did not know it was known


[26-Feb-20 08:53 AM] criptobear#6402

doing and LTC/KMD swap and the LTC was taken from my wallet with 8 confirmation but trade is still 2/3 and didn't receive any KMD


[26-Feb-20 03:40 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
does this mean the swap will fail ?


[26-Feb-20 03:40 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
usually in the past when the balance was taken away after 1 confirmation the trade completed 3/3


[26-Feb-20 03:40 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
and I would receive the KMD after 1 confirmation of LTC beind deducted

@BoBot-LunaMaxi problem with LTC found and fixed: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/commit/3ef17e6daadf65e26258812af5510cf3436ab237
should work again
but swaps with KMD and KMD ACs take longer, since AtomicDEX waits for a notarization, not just one confirmation


[27-Feb-20 10:23 AM] rongarvin99#8336

do you have seed backed up? did you try reinstalling it?


[27-Feb-20 11:52 AM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
So my LTC/KMD swaps timedout I got my LTC back but I didnt get back the fees .....was like 0.22 LTC that I'm short now..seems like a glitch how do i know someone isnt gaming it to just get the DEX more fees as the swaps fail


[27-Feb-20 11:54 AM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
How can swaps fail and i lose out on my 0.23 fees worth of LTC doesnt seem fair now I will have to pay the fees again hoping the swaps don't fail


[27-Feb-20 11:56 AM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
4th swap timeout again after deducting my LTC and taking the fees? How is this fair that i lose out on like $15 worth of fees and no successful swaps

[27-Feb-20 12:51 PM] cipi#4502
dexfee is not returned after a failed swap... but dexfee is 1/777 of the takercoin amount, so can't be 0.22 LTC... or have you tried to swap 200 LTC at once?


[27-Feb-20 04:43 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
Tried to swap 200 LTC in 5 transactions so im down .23 LTC now which seems unfair considering I did everything right on my ends....seems like a flaw


[27-Feb-20 05:44 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
is there something wrong why the swaps keeps failing? everything is working on my end keeping the app open


[27-Feb-20 05:45 PM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
seems there is incentive to have failed swaps if dex keeps the fees

Is it normal for the app to remove all the wallets from the list apart from BTC and KDM, when it is reinstalled? I always have to set them back afterwards. Is there a possibility that this could change the adresses, if I had any balance there, making these coins unreachable? (with the exception of BTC and KMD assetchains, which use the same address, so for example LTC, ETH and others)

no, the same seed words always give the same address

I guess it is possible to auto enable coins with balances in the future. I will add an issue with this feature request

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #138 Feature request: Auto enable all coins with balance above a preset fiat value
Allow users to set a minimum fiat value in the settings. If set, the app should query an API(maybe dexstats.info or other explorers) for balances of all supported coins based on the pubkey and then multiply the balance with the respective fiat prices. If the fiat value of the balance of a coin exceeds the value set in the settings, the coin should be enabled and displayed in the portfolio tab.

This is a full uniswap front end running on sia skynet. skynet.net is a portal to sia skynet which is a decentralized file sharing system. Right now, most users are forced to rely on centralized websites to use their defi apps, giving the hosting company control over the ecosystem. Using sia skynet eliminates that point of control.  This would be good for web version of atomicdex.

@coolermaster if it is showing the correct balance, then it is ok.

Problem solved with Atomic DEX sending RVN to mine Bittrex wallet.

The issue is fee.
When I send RVN from Bittrex to Atomic DEX it cost 0.483 RVN.
If you don't select Custom fee in mobile app it will use a too low network fee and transfer is canceled.
When you checked custom fee and add network fee (I choose 1 RVN) it transfer successful.

I meanwhile I will setup MM2 to use it for making orders.

[07-Mar-20 12:29 AM] cipi#4502
latest version from https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API supports dynamic txfees and i tested it with many coins... the ones that worked now have the setting `txfee:0` in the coins file: https://github.com/jl777/coins/blob/master/coins
if you use it like that, the fee will always be correct and during a swap this setting leads to using lower fees for the entire swap (often only 1/4 of the fees compared to the old fixed fee setting)
has no influence on BTC and ETH/ERC20 though, this ones are already using the dynamic fee setting

Implementing atomicdex api on web? good idea?


[07-Mar-20 03:00 AM] Oszy#5734
Regarding RVN there was an announcement a few weeks ago:
```Please note that if you are trading RVN, they recently increased thier TX fees from 0.00001 RVN per KB(kilobyte) to 0.0100 RVN per KB(kilobyte). 
If you are using an older version you will likely see failed swaps via RVN, or may end up with funds in a "stuck" state and will be required to do a manual recovery.
The latest version of AtomicDEX includes an update to the new TX fee cost  - please secure your seed and update as soon as possible
For more information on the manual recovery process, please refer to this guide: https://docs.komodoplatform.com/qa/recover-atomicDEX-mobile-swap-desktop.html```


[07-Mar-20 04:12 AM] Mylo#8306
@Artist not at the moment. The api can be compiled to wasm and run locally in users browser like the magnum webwallet.

But currently only the kmd devs know how to do it.

This example is browser with the process running on the web host. It is not suitable for web implementation until wasm properly supported.

@Artist atomic swaps are a different technology to smart contract exchanges of ethereum & liquidity pools of kyber.  making a GUI with binance orderbook, already done too.  the bot integration of @smkhound development is in his github repo.  he is also in the notary election.  https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/NotaryNodes/tree/master/season4/candidates/dragonhound

I want a one world coin, an asset pegged to an allocation of world assets backtested with stability in mind. I think it would be a cool selling point. A world asset. Ex: 5% gold, 5%  oil, 20% usd, 20% cny, 20% inr, 10% steel, 5% btc, etc. It would be so cool to have a back tested asset comprised of the most diversified and stable portfolio possible. I know such a basket would be difficult to come up with, but it would still be an amazing selling point.

Perhaps something like SDR: Christine Lagarde, IMF managing director, held up the organization‚Äôs special drawing rights (SDRs) as having a possible digital future at a Bank of England forum last week, and put what she said was a ‚Äúquestion mark‚Äù over whether SDRs could replace existing international currencies. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a far-fetched hypothetical,‚Äù she said, and the IMF needs to be ready.

The SDR is a long way from the digital disruption that cypherpunks hope cryptocurrency can deliver. Dreamed up in the 1960s, SDRs are a kind of artificial currency whose value depends on other currencies. Dollars are a part of it, but so are euros, sterling, renminbi and yen. An SDR is a bit like a currency mutual fund for central banks.

Hello team!
You need to greatly reduce the number of confirmations for returning from a b-address after a failed swap!
time factor reduces the advantages of such trade to zero üòê 
Within a couple of hours, half of my trading deposit was withdrawn by fake swaps to b-addrs - and accordingly blocked for several hours!  üò¢ 
I don‚Äôt know if this behavior is malicious. But from my point of view, of course  ‚òπÔ∏è 
¬†¬†Do you plan an option in future releases to ban bad actors? 
¬† Reducing the time to return coins from escrow?


[11-Mar-20 04:00 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
* The number of confirmations will be configurable in the UI
* Going to experiment with showing predicted swap time for different orders, based on gossiping of those settings
* Information on peer reliability is going to be available as well
* Banning is not a solution, it is a problem, it bans good peers, reducing liquidity and.. next time you might be such a peer, complaining that your swaps fail for no good reason
To give you an example, if an IP packet is lost, the TCP/IP is resending it, and not banning the entire IP address "to make your internet more reliable"
* Automatically picking a more reliable peer should be possible in the future for order types that give the AtomicDEX more freedom in choosing the orders


[11-Mar-20 04:14 PM] Railrain#5728
It is probably very difficult to find out if the fake swaps were intentional. Reducing the number of confirmations partially solves the problem. But as a tool, fake swaps remain at the mercy of dishonest traders. In decentralized trading, this is a serious problem  ü§î


[11-Mar-20 04:44 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
We'd usually learn to identify something manually before we automate such identifications. If you find an "intentional fake swap", be sure to tell us.

> it is the cheapest offer, but it does not work

that's why I think that automatically switching to cheaper offers is not that good an idea in a decentralized exchange. we should have offer types that allow the exchange to pick an order withing a given price range even if the said order isn't necessarily the absolute best.


[12-Mar-20 09:06 AM] smkhound#7640
is it possible (or worth) attaching mm version/gui version to orders json to allow (or auto) filtering

of course! and we're going to experiment with that by indexing the UI version with the swap-based gossip, for starters

Meaning that you go in #üìà‚îÉtalk-trading  and post an offer.  You can use Atomicdex mobile app for some of them currently, I believe there is a supernet and DEX market right now if you don‚Äôt want to look for a counter party  otherwise will need to find an escrow. It‚Äôs good that Komodo inspired you,  we have much in the way of documentation now that wasn‚Äôt around before at developers.komodoplatform.com ,   Any questions you have regarding code you can ask in the dev channels.

@daemonfox this is why the 44 hours is implemented. if it goes trough, you'll get it. even if gui shows timeout

How exactly do I deposit into my DEX wallet? Can I buy bitcoin through the app?


[21-Mar-20 12:32 AM] hastrup#8742
@aryn if you are referring to buying whit fiat though the app that features is not yet implemented but you can deposit coin if you swipe the coin name from left to right there you get the option

Using AtomicDex on Android. My app appears to be updated to version 0.2.13. no update appears in the Play Store. Having issues swapping RVN, does anyone know if there are updates to the AtomicDex App, if so where is it available if not on the Play Store?

@ZaferGraph (Don't DM) both OOT electrums are down... so i have setup own electrums: https://github.com/jl777/coins/pull/429/files
next version will use the new electrums


[24-Mar-20 07:41 AM] cipi#4502
@StoeTubby RVN increased the minrelayfee, but AtomicDEX uses the old setting, which results in transactions beeing rejected by the network... it is already fixed, but you will need to wait a bit for the next release
buying RVN should work though, the marketmaker nodes are already updated

We should put resources toward a proper (trustless, serverless, maximally Uniswap-like UX) ETH <-> BTC decentralized exchange. It's embarrassing that we still can't easily move between the two largest crypto ecosystems trustlessly.

@VitalikButerin This is already possible today with #AtomicDEX, a mobile-friendly atomic swap powered DEX. 

You can make P2P swaps from #ETH or ERC-20 tokens directly to BTC or a number of different #BTC-protocol coins.

Download and try it out for yourself: https://t.co/9YL...

I also have a question about the swapping process. If there is already a match and the swap is ongoing ( step 2/3 ), why does it take a good amount of time for the swap itself to complete?


[26-Mar-20 09:01 PM] gcharang#6833
@bfresh if you are comfortable with cli, you can run the atomicDEX-api on your desktop and export privatekeys for any supported coin from your seed words
How to setup: <https://docs.komodoplatform.com/qa/atomicDEX-quickstart.html>
the command to use is `show_priv_key` <https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#show-priv-key>

re: `why does it take a good amount of time for the swap itself to complete?`

it depends on a lot of factors. the response time of your counter party, the block times on the different chains and latency. also 0/3 -> 1/3 -> 2/3 are not steps that should necessarily take the same amount of time


[26-Mar-20 10:25 PM] dudezmobi#1945

[27-Mar-20 02:14 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
> it depends on a lot of factors

Most usually though, the delays are - waiting for a given number of blockchain confirmations and for notarization.
(We have a version that shows the time of these steps in more detail. It's up to the release team (@ca333 and friends) to get it into the stores now).


[27-Mar-20 03:56 AM] ca333#0333
`to get it into the stores now` - not directly up to us, but up to the review progress. An internal and external secure code review (ref. 3rd party dependencies) is still ongoing. I expect the new release in the coming weeks.

@bfresh In total, the atomic swap consists of five blockchain transactions, each of which needs at least one confirmation. In times of high network congestion, bitcoin transactions, especially with small amounts such as the taker fee, can take several hours to be included into a block.

[28-Mar-20 07:18 AM] jorian#4555
i don't think the netid converts to a pub port

[28-Mar-20 07:52 AM] 0x03#8822
you can check against `netstat -tnlp` to see that the ports are indeed in use as per output above.


[28-Mar-20 07:53 AM] 0x03#8822
for some reason i can't run netid 9000 now, i'm guessing the seednodes for that are down, or something. it worked before however. but i don't need 9000 anyways


[28-Mar-20 07:55 AM] 0x03#8822
ah, there it goes again. same output as above, different timestamps obviously.


[28-Mar-20 08:19 AM] jorian#4555
ah, pubport. wasn't paying attention


[28-Mar-20 08:19 AM] jorian#4555
anything different than netid 9999 and the seednodes creates a whole new network, if i recall correctly


[28-Mar-20 08:28 AM] 0x03#8822
obviously, yes.


[28-Mar-20 08:28 AM] 0x03#8822
9000 also is active


[28-Mar-20 08:29 AM] 0x03#8822
anyways, the question is if 9999 always turns into 47773, as that would be pretty useful üòÑ

[28-Mar-20 08:46 AM] jorian#4555
so it depends on both netid and rpcport

We should only use one or two UDP ports, IIRC. Look for that message in the logs - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/21b8a576f9de32b7289e907c4d5094216679af28/mm2src/peers/peers.rs#L1397 - and see if the actual UDPs are happening from that `preferred port`, or from a port immediately adjacent to it.

this here may be relevant to lp node admins tho:

los artemes, under which circumstances does ipv4 or ipv6 get selected to `external_ip_alert` for `mm2`? - after x-amounts of launches it chose v6 here for the first time

What's up?


[31-Mar-20 03:16 AM] Oszy#5734
@0x03 I don't think it chooses, but uses what's active at the ISP at the time.


[31-Mar-20 04:34 AM] 0x03#8822
@Oszy i can rule that out right away. both v4 and v6 are statically configured and "active all the time".


[31-Mar-20 04:36 AM] 0x03#8822
(in fact i actually had active connections on both transport types while mm2 launched)


[31-Mar-20 04:37 AM] 0x03#8822
seeing the other end of this `external_ip_alert` seems to be amazon, i'd guess they have their connectivity in order, too


[31-Mar-20 04:51 AM] Oszy#5734
hmm okay, was just a thought, as I've never seen ipv6 but i have it disabled


[31-Mar-20 04:54 AM] 0x03#8822
you should start using ipv6 too if possible. just a thought, tho.

@manga you need to unlock your wallet only when you need to claim the rewards, i.e., once a month.

[31-Mar-20 11:44 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
@0x03 , `external_ip_alert` should usually happen when the IP changes. it'll show the IPv6 address if that's the address that was changed. it's just some libtorrent mechanics I wanted to observe, you can safely ignore it

Guys, is it right that atomicdex pro first release does not support Verus coin (VRSC)?

@MrBizzy it isn't even released to the community yet. currently we are testing it internally

[01-Apr-20 04:33 AM] 0x03#8822
thats the PR that will add verus


[01-Apr-20 04:34 AM] 0x03#8822
in the meantime you can edit the coins.json file - but the icons seemingly are compiled into the finished product


[01-Apr-20 04:35 AM] 0x03#8822
so ...just adding verus to the coins file wont show the icon for it, guessing a rebuild is necessary for it - you can however use it without the icon already


[01-Apr-20 04:35 AM] 0x03#8822
(which is kind of unfortunate imo)


[01-Apr-20 04:54 AM] 0x03#8822
why doesn't it just use the coins repo in the first place, just wondering - whatever is in there and has `mm2` set to 1 will be made available, and bam.


[01-Apr-20 04:58 AM] Oszy#5734
i think it's a different format at the moment


[01-Apr-20 04:58 AM] 0x03#8822
well it's both json, so thats a bad excuse üòâ


[01-Apr-20 04:59 AM] Oszy#5734
i meant within the json, they must have a reason using a different format otherwise they'd use coins repo


[01-Apr-20 04:59 AM] 0x03#8822
but yes, the atomicdex pro coins file resembles more the config of the old mm1


[01-Apr-20 04:59 AM] 0x03#8822
i see what you mean by different format


[01-Apr-20 04:59 AM] 0x03#8822
still - there was a source of all the info, so my question stands, why not use it from there but recompile it into another data source üòÑ

i'm smelling a language barrier here üòâ


[01-Apr-20 05:03 AM] 0x03#8822
yes you're right, thats obviously easy to accomplish. my question is if there is a repository that has all the coins to start with, why scrape it from there, and not just use that as the information source. 
it's literally a bunch of lines of code to get the reformatting of the json structure done


[01-Apr-20 05:03 AM] Oszy#5734
no  i understand your point


[01-Apr-20 05:04 AM] Oszy#5734

in the meantime i'll be fiddling on with mm2, it's awesome. very well done everybody involved. i remember vividly the old mm1 experience, i'm probably responsible for about 30% or more of all added coins *ducks*

thanks, @0x03 ! i'm curious whether you have any particular focus or direction in regards to that fiddling?


[01-Apr-20 07:29 AM] 0x03#8822
right now mainly trying to build a useful 'tradebot' kind of thing, starting off 'against' mm2, it's the perfect playground


[01-Apr-20 07:30 AM] 0x03#8822
or, to be more specific, a liquidity provider bot, but using bash and gnu/other opensource utilities only


[01-Apr-20 07:30 AM] 0x03#8822
no nodejs, no perl, ...


[01-Apr-20 07:32 AM] 0x03#8822
where it goes from there i'll see (it's mainly driven by the fact that i have some spare time again), but i assume i'll add support for graviex, or another centralized exchange. 
i still need to 'release' it tho, i'm not yet sure enough it won't just do bad things and lose peoples money, so i'm very hesitant. but i'm testing for almost 2 weeks now on the 'live net' (netid 9999) and so far, everything smooth

@0x03 
Interesting! I've made a note ( https://gitlab.com/artemciy/mm-pubsub-db/-/commit/f103870b86de37fad5fffebaea1859dd2352ed44#1cc07d0f2ec351f3812c9e8510cdcb843434c2ce ) recently of making any (mobile) app into a trade server via dexp2p/caretakers. (One of my goals is to make development of new decentralized dexp2p/caretaker protocols as simple as possible, and a way to go there is to keep adding new protocols and refactor the things that keep coming up into reusable functions/traits. Also I like for automatic trades to still be accessible via UI, and to use any mobile phone as a server).

dexp2p + atomicdex = ultimate exchanger suite


[01-Apr-20 08:14 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
dexp2p is a publish-subscribe transport layer on top of which we're fitting an embedded database layer (for structure and transparency, ease of retaining and indexing information) and the next layer after that has to deal with issues of trust

I requested a trade about 5 minutes ago and picked a pre-existing option, but for some reason it hasn't order matched yet. I chose an order that was already there not a new one.


[01-Apr-20 11:28 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
my order is well under the max volume for the one i chose too


[01-Apr-20 11:28 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
I tried choosing a different order and that one matched


[01-Apr-20 11:28 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
so maybe an issue with the one i was trying idk

ah, you did already. yes, as you witnessed, some orders dont match


[01-Apr-20 12:15 PM] 0x03#8822
may be related to a config issue or networking setup detail, that is my guess


[01-Apr-20 12:30 PM] Oszy#5734
the other side has a bad maker, it happens, try another one


[01-Apr-20 01:23 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
detecting bad makers is our nearest goal


[01-Apr-20 01:42 PM] Oszy#5734
@artemciy_dice maybe before matching could check the app version in addition to the pubkey check?


[01-Apr-20 02:10 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
Hardcoding specific version incompatibilities is certainly an option!
We can also compare the time difference between the MM versions. If the difference is too big then this might be treated as a warning sign, reducing the reliability score.

üç¥ 

[01-Apr-20 02:25 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
It's also quite possible for the decentralized caretaker nodes to automatically detect coin-specific incompatibilities between certain version ages (e.g. probability of successful matching and swap between RICK and MORTY for versions 1 month old is X, for versions 2 months old is Y).

if it wasn't your fault then no.

very unlikely to have timeout as a maker an it's your fault

[04-Apr-20 12:48 PM] cipi#4502
if the price changes between the moment when you select the offer and the moment the swap is sent to network, the order will not match (assuming the price of the coin you want to buy goes up)... that is one possibility, the other one is that the maker you have selected has some problems

[05-Apr-20 12:56 AM] gcharang#6833
as anonymous as using a lite/SPV wallet to manage your own coins
you can see the orderbook for enabled coins in the app itself, or all the available orders at https://komodod.com/atomicdex/orderbook?pair=KMD-BTC

either you fill an available order if the price suits you. or you create a new order with a price you like

>  no blockexolorer to track?
each involved coin's blockexplorer can be used to track coins on its chain


[05-Apr-20 01:01 AM] gcharang#6833
but no direct way to associate an address with "you" if you don't do it your self


[05-Apr-20 01:03 AM] gcharang#6833
re: privacy. 
research the privacy implications of "address reuse" and using an electrum server. those same apply to atomicDEX users
Ex: <https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=4592394.0>


[05-Apr-20 01:15 AM] CryptoJesus#3041
I dont fully understand id like to stay private so would dex allow that. Also can i change addresses each time i receive


[05-Apr-20 01:19 AM] gcharang#6833
can you tell me an example of a situation, like "I hold ltc in the wallet named ABC and the level of privacy it gives me is enough"? then I can tell you if atomicDEX can give you the privacy level you need

privacy is always a spectrum. you have to choose the level of it you need

> can i change addresses each time i receive
you have to keep creating new wallets/seed phrases inside tha app. the default behavior is: you create a wallet, backup its seed words. those seed words are used to create 1 address each for different coins.


[05-Apr-20 01:21 AM] gcharang#6833
by private, if you mean keeping your real identity seperate from the addresses on blockchain, yes, atomicDEX allows that. but if you use the same address to send/receive coins to a kyc'd exchange, your privacy is lost


[05-Apr-20 01:22 AM] CryptoJesus#3041
I get you then if i want everytime new seed, new address. And when i exchange coins no one can track that right?


[05-Apr-20 01:24 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, sure


[05-Apr-20 01:25 AM] CrisF#3405
Tracked / traced and connecting an address to your identity are different, aren't they?


[05-Apr-20 01:25 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, there are various levels of things that can be done

{Reactions}
üíØ 

[05-Apr-20 01:31 AM] gcharang#6833
if you used an address from wallet A to buy BTC on a kyc exchange and  then transferred those same BTC to a wallet B created using atomicDEX and sold it for ltc now, this trade on the dex can be linked to the id known to the exchange.

as long as cex are not involved, only addresses can be correlated
if a kyc cex is involved, identity can be attached

also, there is never absolute privacy. if an entity with enough resources wants to break your privacy, there is nothing a regular person can do. they can compromise your ISP/use zero day attacks on your devices or whatever else

thats why, you have to understand who you are guarding against and take actions that mitigate their attacks. 
if you are guarding against ad/social networks/or similar, it is inconvenient, but fairly easy to get rid of their tracking

there is a version + reputation check in development to recognize possible bad makers. once live, it should alleviate this issue

the ux with a hw wallet will be like: user waits at the app and approves the signature of txns on the hw devices. it will be 3 in case of taker and 2 in case of maker. and there will be a gap of 2 minutes to more than 1 hour between each approval. it will be very tedious, but technically possible to do. once we have the desktop and mobile apps out and all the low hanging features ready to use, hw wallet integration can be considered

After the coins went from the maker to the b-address. Maker can close the application on his phone, and the deal will still take place?

I am testing the atomicDex.io app on IOS and Android. I created a wallet on iOS and got a seed phrase. I then created a wallet on Android using the seed phrase. I moved in a small amount of ETH on IOS app and then tried to do a swap for KMD. It failed . So I switch to Android and the swap worked. However on IOS I lost the balances for the wallet
This morning on Android I have also lost the balances for the wallet and there is no history. I recreated the wallet and still there are no balances or history. Looks like a big.

Bug


[12-Apr-20 10:18 PM] TonyL#3577
@nickm Do you see same addresses on iOS as on Android for receive ? If not please recheck your seed input - even one missed/added whitespace means different seed and different addresses


[12-Apr-20 10:25 PM] nickm#2507
On IOS the coins I displayed BTC KMD ETH just disappeared. I cannot add any coins back


[12-Apr-20 10:26 PM] nickm#2507
On Android this morning the same coins had also disappeared and I could not add them back with +


[12-Apr-20 10:29 PM] nickm#2507
On Android I decided to recreate the wallet from the seed to see. I got the two coins KMD and BTC but with zero balance. I have added back ETH and looked at the receive address generated. It is not the same as the address I sent my ETH to yesterday.


[12-Apr-20 10:32 PM] nickm#2507
I saved my seed to a file so I copy pasted to recreate the wallet on Android. I will enter my seed manually to make sure there are no spaces etc


[12-Apr-20 10:45 PM] nickm#2507
O


[12-Apr-20 10:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
@nickm  if it is not the same address it‚Äôs not the same seed


[12-Apr-20 11:10 PM] nickm#2507
Well let us recap. I copied the seed generated on iOS  to a file. I was able to recreate a wallet with balanes on Android. The wallet on iOS lost its coins but the wallet is still present and so is the seed. This morning the wallet on Android lost its coins but the wallet  is still there and so is its seed.
BRAKING NEWS I just went back to my Android wallet original one created yesterday and now KMD is shown with the balance but ETH  is missing. So on two different occasions today I have had two different results BOTH are incorrect. 

In addition I have checked the seed and it is the same as the one I manually entered. I assume I enter each word separated by a space and I do not need a new line after each row of four words.


[12-Apr-20 11:10 PM] nickm#2507
I think there is a bug


[12-Apr-20 11:11 PM] nickm#2507
I have screenshots but Discord will not allow me to add them.


[12-Apr-20 11:17 PM] nickm#2507
As for manual data capture of seed I checked in settings and one word was entered as blank giving me a total of 13 . So that is my bad. Same applies to copy paste some words got concatenated so only 10


[12-Apr-20 11:23 PM] nickm#2507
I have now manual ly entered the seed correctly and I can see KMD and BTC but like the original wallet I cannot see ETH. I will try to add ETH


[12-Apr-20 11:26 PM] nickm#2507
Also note that on iOS the seed is the same - it is the original wallet - but no balances are shown.


[12-Apr-20 11:29 PM] nickm#2507
Finally on my correctly recreated wallet when I add back ETH I get back my balance. So apart from a not so nice user experience all is now OK on Android.üêÆ

@vogelfreund88 the zilla chain is stuck. once it starts moving again, and your app is running, either the swap will conclude or you will get the coins back

Probably when the full release happens. The mobile version is in beta, and desktop is in alpha. At this point it is better to prioritize backend development and UX/UI. However, I think any erc20 token can be listed to the mobile if they sign-up as a customer.

because https://blockchair.com/bitcoin shows that BTC txfee is 0.50 USD in average... atm... it was 1 USD a week ago or so
so paying 2 USD for a swap, only for txfee, does not make much sense... trading 10 USD worth of BTC and paying 2 USD txfee simply does not make any sense

what is a sub atomic swap? Saw a reference to it


[18-Apr-20 06:14 PM] cipi#4502
they are different from atomic swaps... they are not secured by the protocol, so you send your funds directly to the other party, and hope they will in turn send you the coins you bought... so it is meant to be used for small amounts, or in case you want to swap large amounts. you do it in many different transactions... so if the other party stops sending coins, you stop too and loose only a small part of the coins...
i hope i haven't said anything wrong, haven't looked at it in detail

sub atomic is for low amounts and you will have to trust the counterparty with 1/100 th of the trade amount at any moment

if you have just extracted the zip file and used the program from inside the folder, just deleting the extracted folder is enough.
if have installed it using the "installer" , you can do it like any other program on windows, through the control panel

its mobile wallet


[19-Apr-20 12:25 AM] PureHate#9411

[19-Apr-20 12:34 AM] gcharang#6833
@PureHate you don't need KMD to send the Vote coins your address already has
how much Vote coins does your address have exactly?


[19-Apr-20 12:38 AM] PureHate#9411
its showing  0.00002554


[19-Apr-20 12:38 AM] PureHate#9411
this was the old kmd  balance


[19-Apr-20 12:39 AM] PureHate#9411
perhaps im doing thing wrong


[19-Apr-20 12:39 AM] gcharang#6833
even if the 0.00777 limit wasn't there, the txn fee is 0.0001. you can't move those coins from the wallet


[19-Apr-20 12:39 AM] PureHate#9411
how to vote then


[19-Apr-20 12:39 AM] PureHate#9411
i send "more" 0.15


[19-Apr-20 12:40 AM] PureHate#9411
but they keep showing only on kmd not in vote


[19-Apr-20 12:40 AM] gcharang#6833
from where are you sending the 0.15 ?


[19-Apr-20 12:40 AM] PureHate#9411
i can send u screenshoot here "we cant put img"


[19-Apr-20 12:41 AM] PureHate#9411
i buy them with the wallet


[19-Apr-20 12:41 AM] gcharang#6833
> we cant put img
you can use a image sharing site like imgur and share the link here


[19-Apr-20 12:41 AM] PureHate#9411
i change VRSC to kmd


[19-Apr-20 12:41 AM] gcharang#6833
the airdrop is done already. any new KMD you get now won't give you Vote coins


[19-Apr-20 12:41 AM] PureHate#9411
ah ok


[19-Apr-20 12:42 AM] PureHate#9411
well i cant vote then


[19-Apr-20 12:42 AM] gcharang#6833
sorry about that, only the people who held KMD in their addresses on April 12 received the Vote tokens


[19-Apr-20 12:45 AM] PureHate#9411

@gcharang Thank for answer, but I dont see the app in the list of apps in order to uninstall it


[19-Apr-20 01:20 AM] gcharang#6833
did you use/download the file named "komodo-qt-install.exe" or "komodo-qt-win.zip" to install? @doktor27


[19-Apr-20 01:20 AM] doktor27#2718
"komodo-qt-install.exe"@gcharang


[19-Apr-20 01:22 AM] doktor27#2718
I checked the list of apps installed on my PC but I dont see it there


[19-Apr-20 01:23 AM] gcharang#6833
```
In the search box on the taskbar, type Control Panel and select it from the results.
Select Programs > Programs and Features.
Press and hold (or right-click) on the program you want to remove and select Uninstall or Uninstall/Change. Then follow the directions on the screen.
```
did you check using the above steps?


[19-Apr-20 01:30 AM] doktor27#2718
Yes, I know how to uninstall programs from my PC, I have done it before


[19-Apr-20 01:30 AM] doktor27#2718
But  I dont see Komodo wallet in he list of installed apps to uninstall it


[19-Apr-20 01:30 AM] doktor27#2718
therefore I asked question


[19-Apr-20 01:30 AM] gcharang#6833
do you have a shortcut on the desktop?


[19-Apr-20 01:30 AM] doktor27#2718
yeah


[19-Apr-20 01:32 AM] gcharang#6833
right click it and select properties, then go to the "Shortcut" tab, what text does the Target field have?


[19-Apr-20 01:33 AM] gcharang#6833
btw, lets move to the #ü§ù‚îÇgeneral-support channel


[19-Apr-20 01:34 AM] doktor27#2718
I dont see support channel @gcharang

[19-Apr-20 01:41 AM] gcharang#6833
@doktor27 deleting the file "C:\Program Files\KomodoOcean\komodo-qt-win.exe" should work


[19-Apr-20 01:42 AM] gcharang#6833
if you need to delete the blockchain data also, backup the wallet.dat file and delete the directory "%appdata%/Komodo/"


[19-Apr-20 01:43 AM] doktor27#2718
it is normal that I dont see the komodo wallet in the list of installed apps?


[19-Apr-20 01:44 AM] gcharang#6833
yes, I just verified it
it just copies the exectubale to the location
it also downloads zcash parameters and creates a komodo.conf file


[19-Apr-20 01:44 AM] gcharang#6833
also, check your messages. there should be one from a bot called yagpdb.xyz , follow its instructions to get "member" tag in this discord. then you can access all the channels


[19-Apr-20 01:49 AM] gcharang#6833
you can also delete the folder: `%appdata%/ZcashParams` @doktor27


[19-Apr-20 01:54 AM] doktor27#2718
OK, Thank you for your help. sorry  I a new at dicord, I dont see any messages

We've got most of the visuals for showing the order books in the AtomicDEX mobile. Week 17 we'll be adding some extras there to show the health of the network (volume, number of finished and failed swaps in a pair, relative liveliness of individual orders).

Hi, is anyone else getting stuck using Android 7.0?
Multiple attempts at different currency swaps are getting stuck at the 1st step.


[20-Apr-20 04:35 AM] coolermaster#4963
@V__C yes but i think its prob the other party cancelling order or their phone going to sleep both devices the app must be open/running for swaps to work...... Keep trying it does work i have made quite a few swaps wih the app now


[20-Apr-20 04:37 AM] V__C#6587
Thanks, so do I just leave the screen open? I think I only left it 5-10 min


[20-Apr-20 04:51 AM] coolermaster#4963
Im not sure i think as long as the music is playing the app is running........ The music is needed to keep app open i believe.
 it could still be other user canceling also


[20-Apr-20 04:51 AM] coolermaster#4963
Im just a user :)

[20-Apr-20 05:27 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
On Android we'll also need a ‚Äúforeground service notification‚Äù to stay alive in background, otherwise any amount of user activity outside of the app tends to put it to sleep, and sometimes even just having the phone in the sleep mode.


[20-Apr-20 05:32 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
(We have some progress on that front. @yurii-khi has worked on swap status notifications, @MateusRodCosta prototyped the ‚Äúforeground service‚Äù mode and yours truly solved some Android-Flutter portability issues in the libraries, temporarily breaking Android biometrics in the process = )

@coolermaster @artemciy_dice
Ok thanks, I managed to get to step 2 leaving the screen/app open - but swap failed.
Should I be losing a fee even when the swap fails?


[20-Apr-20 06:45 AM] V__C#6587
I also have to restart the app to regenerate the order book.


[20-Apr-20 09:07 AM] V__C#6587
Viewing dexstats order book, when it doesn't progress it just gets added as a sell - is it something to with price not matching in time?


[20-Apr-20 09:13 AM] cipi#4502
yes
https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#buy
```
The GoodTillCancelled order is automatically converted to a maker order if the order is not matched in 30 seconds, and this maker order stays in the orderbook until explicitly cancelled
```


[20-Apr-20 09:13 AM] V__C#6587
Thanks


[20-Apr-20 09:14 AM] cipi#4502
i think most of the time it does not match, because price changed in the meantime... i update prices every 90s


[20-Apr-20 09:15 AM] V__C#6587
Ah yes, I was about to say it seemed this way.

trading the entire balance is indeed a bit problematic... AtomicDEX is keeping some funds back to avoid dust transactions on some chains... maybe the devs will find a better solution for the problem, but atm there are some other things with higher priority

there is a short (sic) explanation at https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/373#issuecomment-598652989


[21-Apr-20 07:36 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
yes, numerator/denominator, much simpler than the format used in https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#note-about-rational-number-type actually


[21-Apr-20 07:49 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Oh my. Of course it's a price!  D
The point of the exercise is for the orderbook to take less space and traffic.
Originally we've been thinking about fitting the ‚Äúprice vector‚Äù into libtorrent DHT entries of limited size, but conserving the space scales to other areas as well.
The orderbooks we're seeing right now are laughably short. With time they will begin to grow. The size of the raw ‚Äúprice vector‚Äù will influence how much time we'll have until we'll need to switch into a ‚Äúvirtual orderbook‚Äù mode, where instead of real orders there are approximations.
It's like the COVID-19 self-isolation which gives us the time to find a better cure.


[21-Apr-20 07:50 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Converting it is trivial. Just think hexadecimal and hexatridecimal. There's also http://ct.cipig.net/base62/KKOErl7

will this new orderbook format be used directly from mm2.getOrders RPC in the future as well?


[21-Apr-20 07:58 AM] Mylo#8306
cool use of encoding to save space.

_orderbook_ sorry i was used to calling my "middleware" abstraction :D
https://developers.atomicdex.io/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html#orderbook


[21-Apr-20 08:25 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
the ‚Äúprice vector‚Äù approach isn't compatible with the ‚Äúorderbook‚Äù call.
it transfers just the minimum of short order id, price and volume (also going to add order liveliness/reliability estimation there later this week).
while the ‚Äúorderbook‚Äù RPC returns the ‚Äúfull‚Äù information.

if some of the ‚Äúcaretaker prototype‚Äù looks useful and if you want to access it via MM then tell us and we'll make the corresponding MM PRs (file issues with https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues or https://gitlab.com/artemciy/mm-pubsub-db/-/issues or tell us here)


[21-Apr-20 08:30 AM] Mylo#8306
noted, thanks.  will only be looking at mm2 stuff this week.  when caretaker docs are available i'll check it out, but for the short term, i just want to get the basics of orderbook for web communities shipped.

[22-Apr-20 02:17 PM] cipi#4502
the orderbooks are the same
look at https://coinpaprika.com/coin/hush-hush/#!exchanges
hush price differs from 0.02 to 0..04 only on citex
so it is clear that marketmakers need to use a huge spread

@stamphh 
> Will atomicdex essentially be hack proof?
no one can guarantee that any software is hackproof. If anyone gives you that guarantee about a particular piece of software, they are lying. that said, our developers are taking every measure possible to make it as secure as possible
> Can‚Äôt it suffer from dependency attacks?
it can, because every software that is created has dependencies. if you think about it, the programming language itself is a dependency that can be exploited to hack software written on it. that said, AtomicDEX-API is written using Rust, which has better support for common programming features than js and doesn't need the devs to use a random package written by a random person. 

Also, the code is security reviewed periodically to catch these issues. This is the best any developer can do to create secure software. @artem.pikulin and @artemciy_dice can correct me/add more points

Right. Says public Alpha available, closed Beta this month. I have been a part of betas before. I was asking about a specific development stage where I can be most useful. That is when the features are mostly done, but the UX is not as far.  A UX guy can't do so much once the UI & workflows are already 'locked down'.

Thank you!


[23-Apr-20 03:42 AM] jansako#3330
@gcharang Please let me know if there is a more appropriate channel. Looked at the instructions:
- Step 1 says 'Install QT' which either comes as a 10 day trial or a paid solution. Does that mean no more testing after 10 days if you release a new build unless I have a paid version? (I know I can fake it & build a new Linux VM every 10 days but... a bit unethical :)

- The instructions are for building the installer yourself (then you install it & look at it I presume). If that is still the only way to get it, I am a bit to early üò¶


[23-Apr-20 03:50 AM] cipi#4502
i installed qt with the online installer... i had to use a mail address and register, but it is open source in the end
the latest version in dev branch has an installer for Windows, MacOS and Linux, but i haven't tried it myself, just built from source
i guess the next release will have the installer

to whom it may concern- i have a 3 chainzilla/kmd failed swaps from weeks ago but they keep showing as 2/3 complete under "orders'  they never go away.     question about DEX coin/token, do I have to do anything to claim my DEX token KMD rewards?

@coolermaster    Do this brother:
!!! this will delete all your wallets and settings !!!
1. Carefully backup seeds of your wallets
2. Clear atomicDEX application data
3. Restore wallets

! Important remark
this is possible if funds returned to you from the b-addresses or were not sent at all. If your funds are stuck on b-addresses - contact the developers.

@P.Washington uuid 35d2f045-de0f-4cf8-a189-3ec88565c7b0 failed because it took too long for the tx on the ZILLA chain to be notarized: `Waited too long until 1586538115 for transaction xyz to be confirmed 2 times`

@Deleted User cryptocurrency and decentralized systems are not needed much in advanced countries such as the U.S., Europe and Japan. on the other hand, in countries such as Africa and South America, decentralized banking, and access-free financial transactions are urgently needed. people in Africa and South America don't have money and property, but they have almost smartphones.

@mobipoi  that is obviously a different scenario. What do you mean by KmD based assets?


[24-Apr-20 12:54 PM] mobipoi#5774
It the same scenario mgw is a kmd based asset a  legacy Dex asset if I am correct

Kmd based asset are supernet Dex,  mgw , chips ..

the USD prices are approximate but are current and not of the time of the swap

so there might be some price gaps but that is probably due to coin A going up and coin B going down since their swap

I have had a glitch for a long time, still here on atomicdex 0.2.14, i can hear a coin shuffling sound when app is open, even when it's in the background. Gotta force it closed for it to stop.


[25-Apr-20 08:00 PM] Bastol#5205
Thought it had to do with kmd rewards to claim but it happens even if there are no rewards to claim. Android 9


[25-Apr-20 08:16 PM] smkhound#7640
the sound is due to app store policies requiring an audible indicator of app running.
Check app settings under sound - you can set a custom mp3 to events by click on the folder next to the event type. You can use an "empty" or silent mp3 file.
Here's a good open source app which you can create mp3s (e.g. custom ringtones) with - https://www.audacityteam.org/download/

Could take a while...


[26-Apr-20 08:42 AM] cipi#4502
0/3 means not matched... likely because price changed in the meantime (i personally update my prices every 90s)

[27-Apr-20 12:37 AM] qont#0397
@smkhound   Thanks!   üôÇ 
  Somewhere here is flawed in the logic of processes :(
Maker sends his part. The transaction is notarized several times.
But the taker does not see this and therefore does not send his part.
(Failure MakerPaymentWaitConfirmFailed)
The process lasts more than an hour and ends with a fail.


[27-Apr-20 12:41 AM] smkhound#7640
which pair? The logic is sound, as failure events should initiate a refund - though if the chain being refunded has stalled or has a flooded mempool this might cause a delay. Notarisation does not apply as not all tradable coins (e.g. ERC20 and non-Antara UTXO based coins) are notarised - it is confirmations that are tracked.
Send me the logs of the swap in DM if you want I can review it.


[27-Apr-20 12:47 AM] smkhound#7640
fail events may also be due to the other side of the trade clsoing the app or losing conectivity - so they are unable to see a confirmation

switching IPs mid swap (as some VPNs might do) could be causing a problem. Try a swap without VPN to confirm.

@smkhound  Directly without vpn, I also tried. The provider sees P2P traffic and starts to be naughty - I do not see the order book at all.
 It is especially discouraging that over vpn my orders are visible everywhere: oracle_earth/mm2_orderbook  , komodod_com  , beta_orderbook_live ...  
but still they end in fails. 
It would be great if the Devs would do something to be resistant to a bad network at the level of smart contracts.

@smkhound  I haven't gotten to the documentation yet, however
one idea popped into my head. What if the maker and taker at the beginning of the deal will immediately exchange b-addr among themselves. And then - regardless of the ISP and the accidental change of IP - follow the tx confirmations on the blockchain.
  I am not a developer. Sorry if I wrote a banal long-discussed stupidity. üôÉ

@smkhound how was it? ok now?


[27-Apr-20 08:44 PM] smkhound#7640
logs revealed some potential situations that we are trying to replicate - seems fails were not related to a single specific cause. 
will be doing further testing. Your logs seemed to indicate numerous utxos - can you try consolidating KMD funds by doing a self send then see if you have success? There is also potential if the address has too much transaction history that electrums have trouble with "TMI" in response, so it could be worth setting up a second account with a fresh address to see if that yields success.
a few of the fails were related to this issue - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/593
and others due to `waited too long until {timestamp} for transaction`, which is likely related to connectivity.

slight chance an electrum server that did not overcome this may have had a hand in the fails. FWIW, I just did two KMD -> VRSC swaps successfully on iOS v0.2.14

how to find minimum trade amounts?
i currently have 3 maker orders in KMD/DGB to test out.  47.777, 48.777, 49.777

There was a bid at 50+, but we didn't match.   Just wanted to make sure my small amounts of 1-2KMD are above the minimum trade amount.

Anyone else having DOGE->KMD swaps fail? Seem to fail at the "TakerFeeSent" stage everytime.


[28-Apr-20 05:53 AM] cipi#4502
https://github.com/dogecoin/dogecoin/pull/1615
DOGE code was changed, so dust is now 1 DOGE, which means you can't send tx < 1 DOGE, they will be rejected, just like this one: https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/error.php?uuid=ec61ee65-938d-450d-9f44-d7c5db5cc89a
the same dust error message should be visible in the app

[28-Apr-20 05:54 AM] cipi#4502
atm, the workaround is to swap at least 777 DOGE (because dexfee is 1/777)


[28-Apr-20 05:56 AM] cipi#4502
this only affect takers trying to sell DOGE, makers don't pay dexfee

@cipithanks for the info.


[28-Apr-20 06:22 AM] StoeTubby#7366
Forgive me if this is foolish, but couldn't logic be written to apply the 1/777 fee ratio and then round to nearest full number? Seems like most won't worry about a fraction of a DOGE.


[28-Apr-20 06:28 AM] cipi#4502
that would be ok for coins like DOGE, but for BTC it wouldn't be that good (fees on BTC are already much too high)
but i had a similar idea: set the treshold depending on the used coin... unfortunately there are no RPC calls that would show you what this treshold should be, so we would either need to configure this for every coin in our coins repo, or derive the correct treshold from some other values that are available as RPC calls... for DOGE this would simply be the value of `relayfee`, but this doesn't apply for all coins the same way... BTC relayfee is 0.00001000 whereas their treshold is 3 x higher, 0.00003000...

@Bastol app stores can be harsh on denying a spot in their market, especially if they are crypto related and designed to run in the background with an active internet connection. We dont make the rules for the Apple store review process, but you can understand the potential issues a "run silently in the background while sending data" app could involve. I'm not sure why the mp3 is not working for you, I'll try on my phone tommorow.


[28-Apr-20 07:58 AM] Bastol#5205

[28-Apr-20 08:01 AM] smkhound#7640
`taker, maker, active, failed, applause` folder icons should let you set the mp3. `active` = background.

this is how the protocol works. For the process to be atomic, trustless, p2p, this is the best protocol that is available. Note that your device can go offline for a small amount of time and can comeback to resume the trade most of the time if the interval is small. this is one of the reasons we have launched mobile version before a desktop app. mobiles of most people are always on

> if you(taker) is not online, the last step i.e., taker claiming "maker payment" won't go through
this is the price of non custodial. as no one other than you (and your app) knows your private key, no one can claim those coins on your behalf either

Seem to have an issue with AtomicDEX latest version - very little success with SUPERNET swaps - pasted a few swap uuids in case anyone has the time to troubleshoot. I can send a log file too but will be huge, really need to use a new seed with fresh install :)

New update seems to be unstable ATM, impossible to swap SUPERNET, DEX swaps are taking longer tan last update. And from 5 tries 2 would work 45 or more minutes for swap.

thanks for a feedback! configuration in 0.2.14 waiting for two notas for KMD/ACs and for some coins notas gap is too huge and blocks might be inconsistance
we'll try to tweak it for more smooth UX for these assets

[01-May-20 07:02 AM] ver_User#6608
hello


[01-May-20 07:02 AM] ver_User#6608
I'm attempting to swap VRSC for BTC and seems I've crashed/failed twice now


[01-May-20 07:02 AM] ver_User#6608
in the app I'm at 0/3 and just have an annoying change sound looping


[01-May-20 07:04 AM] ver_User#6608
same thing happened earlier


[01-May-20 07:05 AM] ver_User#6608
restarted app, there's no history

the bid was gone from the books though


[01-May-20 07:34 AM] cipi#4502
i strongly advise against using BTC till the fee returns to normal levels
https://blockchair.com/bitcoin
Average transaction fee: $3.1833


[01-May-20 07:36 AM] ver_User#6608
fun times


[01-May-20 07:36 AM] ver_User#6608
well, I forgot to check that, and kind of want the price that's on offer as $3 might not be the issue


[01-May-20 07:37 AM] ver_User#6608
thanks for pointing it out though


[01-May-20 07:37 AM] ver_User#6608
will that affect the transaction?


[01-May-20 07:37 AM] ver_User#6608
technically?


[01-May-20 07:41 AM] cipi#4502
that depends how the fee evolves... if you start a swap when fee is x and then the fee rises to x+y, the swap willo not progress till the fee returns to the level when you started the swap


[01-May-20 07:42 AM] cipi#4502
you need 1 confirmation on BTC, no matter how


[01-May-20 07:42 AM] ver_User#6608
I see, maybe that's the issue? I was trying in the last couple of hours


[01-May-20 07:43 AM] ver_User#6608
@cipi


[01-May-20 07:45 AM] cipi#4502
that only applies if your swap matched... 0/3 in the app shows that it didn't match... if that happens your taker order will be converted to a maker order and waits for a taker to come and fill it
so if you see 0/3, you can cancel the order and create a new one
not matching can eg. happen if the price changes


[01-May-20 07:46 AM] ver_User#6608
earlier the bid offer that I took did diminish the number of coins exactly the amount I took, when I refreshed on the browser


[01-May-20 07:47 AM] ver_User#6608
currently the app says I have an order up, for the price that is on offer


[01-May-20 07:47 AM] ver_User#6608
in the orders tab


[01-May-20 07:48 AM] ver_User#6608
however in my browser it's showing that there is still an order up at the price I asked, same amount, not touched yet


[01-May-20 07:48 AM] ver_User#6608
(I'm looking at the orderbooks from my desktop)


[01-May-20 07:48 AM] ver_User#6608
@cipi


[01-May-20 07:50 AM] cipi#4502
orders are changing often... i update my prices every 120s (normally i do it every 60s)
no idea how often the webpage updates the orderbook... i would click on refresh


[01-May-20 07:51 AM] cipi#4502
2 maker orders will never be automatically filled, so there can be an ask for price 1 and a bid for price 1.5, it will not be filled automatically


[01-May-20 07:52 AM] ver_User#6608
I'm asking the exact price of the bid


[01-May-20 07:52 AM] ver_User#6608
trying to take the bid


[01-May-20 07:54 AM] cipi#4502
could also be that the maker is not answering, even if his order is visible in the orderbook... would need to ask the maker to look in his logs


[01-May-20 07:54 AM] cipi#4502
or simply choose an other maker/price


[01-May-20 07:55 AM] ver_User#6608
there's basically only 1 üòâ


[01-May-20 07:57 AM] cipi#4502
there are usually much more orders with KMD as with BTC, simply because most people don't want to pay $3 for a tx
i have 3 nodes with KMD as base, one with LTC and none with BTC


[01-May-20 07:58 AM] ver_User#6608
yeah but I can't trade shitty cfds with KMD, can I?


[01-May-20 07:59 AM] cipi#4502
cfds?

i don't know, i never trade derivatives, not on blockchain and not on Wallstreet


[01-May-20 08:00 AM] Mylo#8306
Binance futures is like CFDs.


[01-May-20 08:01 AM] ver_User#6608
but all of the daily liquid action is still in traditional markets


[01-May-20 08:01 AM] ver_User#6608
like forex


[01-May-20 08:01 AM] ver_User#6608
it's a strange paradox


[01-May-20 08:01 AM] ver_User#6608
trading for financial freedom from the system, by betting the dectralised coin against the price movements within the system


[01-May-20 08:02 AM] ver_User#6608
anyways, my history tab is the spinning wheel of fun, in the atmoicdex app


[01-May-20 08:03 AM] ver_User#6608
when I click confirm for the trade now, I get the sound of a change moving around on loop


[01-May-20 08:04 AM] ver_User#6608
it seems like a crash each time


[01-May-20 08:04 AM] ver_User#6608
unless the maker is just trolling me?


[01-May-20 08:04 AM] cipi#4502
yes, it looks for a trading partner/waits for the trading partner to answer to the request
it will start a trade with the first that answers... if one of them answers


[01-May-20 08:06 AM] ver_User#6608
hmm, OK so I can seemy order and it's at a different price to the bid


[01-May-20 08:06 AM] ver_User#6608
but within the app I chose the price on offer


[01-May-20 08:07 AM] cipi#4502
that price can change any time... so it can happen that it changes between the time you choose it and the time you click on "confirm"


[01-May-20 08:07 AM] ver_User#6608
how do I set the exact price of my ask?


[01-May-20 08:08 AM] ver_User#6608
or how do we make sure the ask matches the bid?


[01-May-20 08:08 AM] ver_User#6608
am I just being impatient?


[01-May-20 08:09 AM] cipi#4502
looked in the app... and seems you can only set an exact price if youi create your own order


[01-May-20 08:10 AM] cipi#4502
but that will be a maker order then


[01-May-20 08:10 AM] ver_User#6608
OK


[01-May-20 08:10 AM] ver_User#6608
I clicked confirm super quick this time


[01-May-20 08:10 AM] ver_User#6608
and it's at 1/3


[01-May-20 08:10 AM] ver_User#6608
finally....


[01-May-20 08:11 AM] cipi#4502
cool


[01-May-20 08:11 AM] ver_User#6608
been doing this for 2.5 hours


[01-May-20 08:11 AM] ver_User#6608
otherwise I guess it's a matching issue?


[01-May-20 08:11 AM] cipi#4502
yes, i think that too


[01-May-20 08:11 AM] ver_User#6608

Hey just had a swap fail and was trying to figure out what exactly had happened. Is there a way for me to check? It looks like it wasn't on my end as my funds were sent but didn't receive the corresponding trade (also I'm assuming those will be returned? üòÖ ) I'm still pretty new to using atomic dex and still working my way through the documentation but have been pleased using it so far


[02-May-20 04:26 PM] artemciy_dice#0049 (pinned)
Use https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/error.php?uuid=$YOUR-SWAP-UUID to check if we're indexed the failed swap. It usually shows both sides of the swap.


[02-May-20 04:27 PM] artemciy_dice#0049
Pinned a message.


[02-May-20 05:25 PM] austone#4795
Thanks, I just updated the wallet too and can view the info. The failure message I have from that is "Failure TakerPaymentValidateFailed"


[02-May-20 05:29 PM] austone#4795
what's the procedure now? sorry if the questions are basic, the help is much appreciated!


[02-May-20 11:06 PM] gcharang#6833
@austone depending on the coins involved, the refund will take between 4 to 44 hours. keep your app running in the backgroud for the refund to be processed

it should go away with timeout or failed


[03-May-20 11:47 PM] gcharang#6833
it might not. there is a bug where the ui doesn't treat some failed swaps as finished. they may stay in the orders tab like that. afaik, the solution for now is to reinstall the app after backing up the seed ofc, or wait for the next version


[04-May-20 12:08 AM] Mylo#8306

because of the increased number of orders in the orderbooks

by logs I've get from mobile/desktop so far looks like that's the case of problems, yes:

 (``` 06:33:12.31 mm_service:421] mm2] üòü 2020-05-04 06:33:12 +0100 [seed_connection 46.4.87.18:47772] Error Broken pipe (os error 32) writing to socket, dropping connection
``` )

```
yeah whats with the order matching? I get negotiate failed all the time
```

```
What is going on with latest AtomicDEX version? Not matching with any trades for days now? And we try to promote AtomicDEX on social media?!
```

Looks like that we need rework for orderbooks part  and AtmoicDEX development team working on that (https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/573#issuecomment-622360520 thats the current plan afaik) - desktop GUI caused orders amount increase and now most probably we reached similar bottleneck as during the stress test.

I have a question about the Atomicdex app


[04-May-20 03:16 PM] TheOmy#1987
What's the max amount of currency to exchange per transaction? For example, from BTC to USDC?


[04-May-20 03:37 PM] Regnar#6164
What is the "Custom seed" setting for in mobile?


[04-May-20 03:38 PM] TonyL#3577
`What's the max amount of currency to exchange per transaction? For example, from BTC to USDC?`
There is no limit - only limit is order size üôÇ


[04-May-20 03:38 PM] TonyL#3577
`What is the "Custom seed" setting for in mobile?` 
Thats for seeds usage which doesn't match mobile seed generation dictionary. You can use WIF lets say if enable "Custom seed" tick üòâ


[04-May-20 03:39 PM] Regnar#6164
So if you are using a seed from a desktop, should you click that?


[04-May-20 03:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep


[04-May-20 03:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Should generate same address I think


[04-May-20 03:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Since for both apps mm2 derivate seed


[04-May-20 03:41 PM] Regnar#6164
what about a seed from a wallet like Jaxx


[04-May-20 03:44 PM] TonyL#3577
Unlikely it's compatible. Should be compatible with Agama tho


[04-May-20 03:45 PM] Regnar#6164
unfortunate


[04-May-20 03:49 PM] TheOmy#1987
@TonyL so for example, can I convert 100 BTC to USDC in a single transaction?


[04-May-20 03:50 PM] TonyL#3577
@TheOmy Yes, if there will be someone who want to buy 100 BTC with USDC


[04-May-20 03:51 PM] DropShip IO#2877
On ios if you remove BTC you can't add it back.

So certain seeds won't work in atomicdex?

or won't generate the same addresses that they will in other wallets?


[04-May-20 03:55 PM] DropShip IO#2877
I'm using a seed that I use on OpenBazaar, Atomic, Exodus, Trust, and Jaxx wallet. No funds appear on DEX and the receive addresses are different, and no transaction history.


[04-May-20 03:55 PM] TonyL#3577
```

or won't generate the same addresses that they will in other wallets?
```
There might be different logic of seed -> address(es) conversion. If it's the same as in AtomicDEX-API it'll work (=generate same address), if not - it will generate differnt address


[04-May-20 03:57 PM] TonyL#3577
` OpenBazaar, Atomic, Exodus, Trust, and Jaxx wallet` if all these wallets using same conversion logic I think in general it's possible to add such feature to AtomicDEX-API

[04-May-20 03:59 PM] DropShip IO#2877
@TonyL They are not completely compatible. Some share same coins. The coins I use appear in at least two wallets out of the list.


[04-May-20 04:00 PM] DropShip IO#2877
Example BTC will appear in OB, Atomic, Exodus and Jaxx. BCH will appear in all of them, ETH will appear in OB and Atomic. LTC will only appear on OB. ect...

[04-May-20 05:25 PM] TonyL#3577
(if swap is finished and status is on caretaker node already)


[04-May-20 05:26 PM] TonyL#3577
@DropShip IO From first screenshot it looks like you've not matched order but placed own maker order instead


[04-May-20 05:27 PM] TonyL#3577
Swap time will depends on how fast you'll get needed confirmations amount for ETH and BCH transactions


[04-May-20 05:27 PM] DropShip IO#2877

[04-May-20 05:27 PM] TonyL#3577

@TonyL Ok, so I can choose the price?


[04-May-20 05:36 PM] TonyL#3577
Yes, you can place order with your own price (be a maker) or fill somebody order (be a taker)


[04-May-20 05:38 PM] TonyL#3577
It's more reliable to be a maker from desktop tho because you need to be online (= application should work in background) to match and sign/broadcast txs, but in general possible from phone as well


[04-May-20 05:38 PM] DropShip IO#2877
I'm on ios.


[04-May-20 05:39 PM] DropShip IO#2877
Oh, so the app has to be running?


[04-May-20 05:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Yep - app should be running during the swap.
We've added background music to keep app alive on iOS


[04-May-20 05:40 PM] TonyL#3577
Without that it was possible to keep app in background for 20 seconds only

I noticed the following with AtomicDex on my smartphone:



If I have a trade going on, no matter if I buy or sell and the app is running in the background, then everything is running fine.

But if I make a voice message via Whatsapp during this time, the music is interrupted and the app doesn't run in the background anymore.

With iOS I know that the music playback stops during such processes.


[06-May-20 11:01 PM] Acura#2748
I sometimes wondered why the app was no longer running in the background.


[07-May-20 03:05 AM] artemciy_dice#0049
Just so. Due to changes in iOS we had to reimplement the audio player recently and we don't have the resume-after-a-call figured out yet. And without the sound the OS kills the app.

a decentralized trading of SIA would suit them very well IMHO.. so far only available through CEX

they offer decentralized cloud storage and file sharing systems. these systems would make even more sense when you can acquire SIA in a decentralized way to begin with

[08-May-20 06:38 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
ah yes, may have sent it from a source that didnt set the locktime.  in that case just need to send the balance to yourself ( from and to your atomicdex address) to set it


[08-May-20 06:39 AM] V__C#6587
Ah ok, that would explain why the button works now.
Thanks didn't realise that the previous transaction would affect this.


[08-May-20 06:39 AM] Regnar#6164
Yep, I think Coinomi still doesn't set locktime on transactions. So  the Coinomi wallet didn't set locktime and AtomicDEX was just holding it. When you sent do yourself (with a wallet like AtomicDEX that does set locktime) then it will accrue rewards regardless of the wallet it is in. The sending wallet has to set locktime

Oh, so maybe a feature for AtomicDEX could be to spot KMD balances that don't have locktime set and notify the user `It appears N amount of your KMD is not accruing rewards, by using the claim rewards button you can set this so these coins earn KMD` or something

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #139 Notification/indicator if locktime not set
A feature to spot KMD balances that don't have locktime set and notify the user.

For example a little red ! icon/bubble next to the balance with an explanation on how to set it. This may require additional criteria for displaying the "claim rewards button". Swap the "claim rewards" logo with a "!" logo when there is KMD not accruing rewards, you click on it and it tells you there is N amount of KMD not accruing rewards, and lets you send full balance to yourself.

Hi, I have a request for the mobile app. Currently you can only add a list of pre-defined coins in the app. I like to have the ability to add other coins as well. I know by ERC20 tokens this can be done with contract address in some apps such as MyEtherWallet. Not sure if there is a way for Komodo based coins (is there a term such as ERC20 for ETH blockchain at Komodo?) such as CoinCollect?


[11-May-20 01:39 PM] Jurjen#9294
Or even better, if the app would scan per blockchain which coins had transactions, and only show the coins with transactions automatically such as https://ethplorer.io/address/0x6f7b74aa23cabd638d7ebe804577043c435192b9 is showing coins, but then without the spam coins (spam report button per contract address or so). And some popular coins + adding by contract address for receiving address.


[11-May-20 08:19 PM] smkhound#7640
Coins can be added to this repo to indicate mm2 compatibility once a successful swap is recorded - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins
This is generally done via CLI, or a TUI like https://github.com/smk762/pytomicDEX/ by adding the coin to https://github.com/smk762/pytomicDEX/blob/master/lib/coinslib.py
You can see the contract address used for ERC20 coins in that config file.
Inclusion in the mobile app is another story, but wont happen until a coin is reported as compatible with swap details here - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/tree/master/swaps
Compatibility doesnt ensure inclusion on the AtomicDEX mobile app, though it opens the possibility of inclusion by gui developers (there are a few using mm2 backend). Depending on the app, devs might require an integration fee (or if the project is open source, you can fork it and add it yourself).


[12-May-20 04:31 AM] Jurjen#9294
@smkhound Thank you for all this explenation. To be honest it is very hard for end-users like me. Just want to add it as e.g. doing in MyEtherWallet, er even better see it directly such as ethplorer. I hope developers will consider to make it more user friendly in one of the next releases.


[12-May-20 04:55 AM] cipi#4502
problem is that not every erc20 token works by simply adding the contract address... so it should be tested if a atomic swap is possible... for example, USDT is not working because they are not using an default ERC20, they changed how fees are paid and that breaks AtomicDEX


[12-May-20 05:07 AM] libscott#8867
I tried to exchange btc for eth, why is the btc transaction fee 17 usd? Also I couldn‚Äôt do it because I need an eth balance.

`why is the btc transaction fee 17 usd?` you sure it's just the tx fee, not the dex+txfee? do you have a screenshot?


[12-May-20 06:25 AM] cipi#4502
https://blockchair.com/bitcoin
`Recommended fee: 91 satoshi per byte`
AtomicDEX uses the output from `estimatesmartfee 1`, so the network tells AtomicDEX what fee is to be used
i had to do a BTC-tx yesterday... and paid 8$ for it, at the same `Recommended fee`-level
this is BTC... use KMD, LTC, BCH instead, they have normal fees


[12-May-20 06:27 AM] cipi#4502
and yes, you need ETH in your wallet to send or receive ERC20 tokens... that is how these tokens work... the fee is payed in ETH... i would tell Vitalik that this is nonsense and had to be changed quickly üòÑ


[12-May-20 06:32 AM] cipi#4502
btw, made this PR to electrumx https://github.com/kyuupichan/electrumx/pull/1001/files
to be able to use `ECONOMICAL` as estimate fee mode for BTC... but needs to be accepted and then implemented in AtomicDEX too... but atm, it would not help much, since the recommended fee is already at 90 sats... it helps if the fee is returning quickly to a normal level... the non-ECONOMICAL mode simply takes much longer to adjust the fee (if it changes between blocks)


[12-May-20 06:38 AM] cipi#4502
here you can see the fees on the ETH network: https://www.etherchain.org/api/gasPriceOracle
afaik AtomicDEX uses the "normal" setting...
and i remove ERC20 orders from orderbook if that fee rises above 26 or 35 ... i use 2 different nodes with different settings and different spreads... to compensate for the high fee
but the easiest thing is to avoid BTC and ERC20 altogether, it will save you a lot of fees üôÇ


[12-May-20 07:13 AM] libscott#8867
@cipi I would have thought the counterparty could pay the eth fee


[12-May-20 07:28 AM] cipi#4502
both parties have to pay ETH-fees, the sender for sending ERC20 tokens and the receiver needs to pay it too, when he claims the funds sent by the sender... in order to do that the receiver needs to call a contract and that costs gas (fees)


[12-May-20 07:32 AM] paco#7277
i tryd to make a swap and it failed on[ maker payment validated and confirmed] and [maker payment wait confirm failed] but there is a red tick at finish, still saying swap ongoing, been like this few days and cant get back coins


[12-May-20 07:32 AM] libscott#8867
This is why I think AtomicDEX should be non custodial but benefit from centralized assistance


[12-May-20 07:34 AM] libscott#8867
Ie; a 3rd party could take a fee, pay the fee in the currency that you are swapping for, for instance


[12-May-20 07:35 AM] libscott#8867
Needing eth to swap to eth is a bit of a barrier to entry


[12-May-20 07:42 AM] cipi#4502
you are right, many people complained that they can't buy ETH without already having ETH
but i don't know how this can be solved... especially the part where you pay gas to call the contract to claim your funds... i am not an expert though, maybe the devs can tell us more about htis


[12-May-20 07:46 AM] cipi#4502
@paco `maker payment wait confirm failed` happens when it takes too long for the tx to be confirmed or notarized, depending on the settings of your node... those swaps will be reverted (maker and taker refunded), but only after the locktime expired... if one of the involved coins in the swap is BTC, it can take a very long time, since locktime is much higher on BTC (because blocktime is also high, with 10 min)

TokensCC + GatewayCC + FaucetCC for ETH
user gets small amounts of tokens of ETH tokens with FaucetCC
cash-out the ETH tokens via GatewayCC
spends it to buy ETH on AtomicDEX
In that case the trouble is how does the tokens ETH gets the initial amount.
Probably from donations?? But this route is dicey...

[12-May-20 08:04 AM] libscott#8867
@cipi, you can solve it by having a 3rd party to the process. They would not be able to block it at any point, but they would be able to take a fee in bitcoin and release your eth for you by posting the preimage. Might require a change in your eth contract. There might be more roles for a 3rd party too

https://etherscan.io/address/0x8500afc0bc5214728082163326c2ff0c73f4a871#code
this is the contract that is used atm for erc20-swaps


[12-May-20 08:23 AM] cipi#4502
@paco KMD/DEX should refunded quicker... you can try to restart the app, maybe it got stuck somehow
but the swap jsons (that contain all infos needed for the refund) are saved on disk, so they are not lost


[12-May-20 08:36 AM] libscott#8867
It would require a small change to post hash on behalf of a receiver

@paco if you look at the detailed stages of the trade you can see where it did stop, if takerpayment wasn't sent, refund is not applicable, it is only a visual bug. 
order being stuck on the orders page is a known bug and will be fixed in the next release

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #140 Cache previous balances, interaction during "activation"
It was brought up on Telegram that the app is slow on startup "activating coins" this is likely just a feeling of it being slow because there is no interaction with the app during "activation". A solution to make this feel faster would be to skip the "activating N coin" loading, and jump right to coin balances from the previous logout. 

Most users just logging in aren't expecting to see different balances from the last time they logged out, so loading balances from cache would work well fo...

We're going to improve the coin activation step. The ordering is currently based on coin balance so we have to activate the coins and load their balances before we can show the list of coins. @artem.pikulin is working on a batch version of APIs to make that faster.
(If we switch to starting with an alphanumeric ordering by default, then the list of coins can be loaded instantaneously, with coin activation and balance fetching happening in background).

I'm not too familiar with how AtomicDEX code runs, I would think it would be quick and easy to write a JSON that has activated coins, their balance, maybe USD value, last update timestamp, etc. If no JSON is present it does what it does now, then orders them and creates the JSON in the order where balance is largest. Then on following starts you show the coins in the JSON with their balance, in the order you stored them, and then run a background update of their balance/USD values, save to JSON after updates to balances are made, new coins activated etc.

@TonyL  I met references to swap problems due to the large number of transaction history at the Atomic DEX trading address.
How many transactions should there be at the trading address in order to need to change it?
  Will this issue matter after a stable release? ü§î


[14-May-20 01:39 AM] TonyL#3577
I'm not aware about transactions amount specific problems in relation to swaps. There might be overall SPV limitation in case of many many not-consolidated UTXOs (in case when you mine to your address lets say)


[14-May-20 01:55 AM] qont#0397
@TonyL  That is, for a successful swap, the transaction history at the Atomic DEX trading address does not matter. Here for SPV it is important how much UTXO contains the address?


[14-May-20 01:57 AM] gcharang#6833
@qont atomicDEX uses SPV servers to get the transaction history of an address. If the same address used in another SPV wallet struggles to display the transations, then atomicDEX will have the same difficulty as well


[14-May-20 02:02 AM] qont#0397
@gcharang  You mean: when a atomicDEX with the same seed is running on more than one device?


[14-May-20 02:04 AM] qont#0397
I had this ... for 30 seconds. But I quickly logged out


[14-May-20 02:05 AM] gcharang#6833
no. I mean, atomicDEX is just like another SPV wallet. If a SPV wallet struggles with 10000 txns, atomicDEX mobile will as well

oh yeah ... understand


[14-May-20 02:08 AM] qont#0397
@gcharang  Nevertheless, let me ask: if you run two dex with the same seed on different devices - could this be the reason for the double transactions of the maker?


[14-May-20 02:10 AM] gcharang#6833
> if you run two dex with the same seed on different devices
this is not recommended in general. the software isn't designed to take this situation into account. it might work well until it doesn't because of some edge case


[14-May-20 02:11 AM] gcharang#6833
> could this be the reason for the double transactions of the maker
afaik, this is an unrelated bug


[14-May-20 02:19 AM] qont#0397
@gcharang ok fine
However, on the road to excellence, it will be great if the developers make the situation with the simultaneous launch of the same seed on different devices impossible. Or at least embed a warning in the GUI  ;)
  this is my humble opinion üôÇ


[14-May-20 02:21 AM] gcharang#6833
> make the situation with the simultaneous launch of the same seed on different devices impossible
this is impossible, as the user can do whatever they want with their seed words.
>  embed a warning in the GUI 
this is a good suggestion!

@gcharang using the same seed on different devices is a use case I'd like to support actually. We're going to have a way to offload orders to a server component, and as a side-effect there might also be an option to move orders between devices, or a kind of HA

While such option is possible It might be quite hard to support it especially when it will come to the point when devices will need to decide which one should run the swap and send transactions, all possibilities of double sending the payments must be thoroughly checked and eliminated.

Not going to transfer the swaps, at least in the first run, just the Maker orders, but we'll have the facilities necessary to check that a coin pair is served by only a single instance of the app.

[14-May-20 08:11 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
one suggestion: can we have it so users can view orderbooks for all assets (even ones they dont have activated)?


[14-May-20 08:11 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
so if i only have the kmd and vrsc chains active, i can still view the orderbook for say, BTC <> BCH


[14-May-20 08:12 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
this would make it easier so users dont have to have a portfolio full of empty wallets and dont have to active all the coins at start up, but can rather just browse orderbooks and activate/deactivate coins as necessary


[14-May-20 08:31 AM] artemciy_dice#0049

Couple questions, 1) Will atomicdex eventually integrate with other dexs and cexs to improve liquidity? 2) When will easy to use bots be integrated with atomicdex in for arb and  automatically changing prices (ex: I want to sell BTC for KMD but it is often the case that CEXs will lead DEXs on price discovery?) 3) Can I currently extend the use of my coins by spreading the same amount across different orders? (Ex: I have 1 BTC and want to set a buyorder for KMD and DEX with 1 BTC each, which ever triggers first goes through - 1 BTC equals multiple BTC of liquidity). I think these options can help solve the liquidity problem, which can also help solve the user issue.

2) We have a prototype of marketmaking bot (CEX integration with Binance API) with GUI for AtomicDEX-API protocol: https://github.com/smk762/mmbot_qt/blob/style/docs/README.rst
In the future bot functionality will be embeed into AtomicDEX-Pro GUI

@Teq It is a known issue, Apple will hibernate (or whatever the term is) the app on the background if it is not 'doing something', e.g. playing a sound. If it sleeps, the trades cannot happen. The workaround is to set the app sound to a file with no sound in it.

i'm on android 9, the lenovo/motorola stock 'flavour'. the update pack is called `up to 2020-04-01` and was OTAed around europe the last 2-3 days.

thats half the problem I think, even if you disable it, your counter party will continue to wait. may be you can save half the time ?

there is an expected pause when the application is first started between the version updates as we update the MM binary; in adb logcat you should see `Loading assets/mm2‚Ä¶` at the time; it isn't that long usually, but some devices might have a slower memory?

> could disable the notarization requirement and other stuff then

also we'll have the number of confirmations and the notarization of an orderbook order displayed in a few weeks (and we'll try to predict the time of a swap with a particular order based on these); the option to change the settings will also be rolled out with this

Seems just a visual bug,  doesn‚Äôt seem they left if the explorer says they are still there

PSA: i'll be doing maintenance on the verus litemode servers soon, one by one. should you, before i report back with success, have any issues on the litemode, just restart your atomicdex mobile/desktop app to have it select another one of the servers.


[22-May-20 05:41 AM] 0x03#8822
ok, a part completed. i'll postpone the others over a change of plans, tho. i'll let you know when i get back to work. 
for now, all inconveniences should be ended. until next time üëã

For the AtomicDEX developers, what are your thoughts on working in Dart and Flutter? I'd like to bring this to #üíª‚îÉdev-general but figured I'd get responses here from those who actually use it, I'll also post there so not to be too off topic here.


[22-May-20 12:06 PM] OrgiOrg#1001
sorry if someone post it allready ... think i found a small bug: if i do a DEX and trying to take the full anount of a placed order the process never go to step 1. If I do the same a few seconds later and left over some pence of the order i can do the dex without problems

@Regnar , to map the space I'd mention that c++ is driven by committee, Haskell by crazy scientists and Rust has a strong democratic bone (a kind of managed democracy, closer to China maybe). Dart, strangely enough, is like a Soviet Union, it's hard to sidestep their "opinionated" decisions, and in a lot of things it is a mediocre technology, but still more consistent and reliable than most other cross-platform UI technologies out there, IMHO. (Where Dart is "opinionated" Rust is the exact opposite: if there are different opinions in the community on how to do stuff then in Rust these areas are left in the package ecosystem where they can compete; Dart people will try to tell you what to think and how to think it). Going to keep using Dart for some years (after which there's a chance that Rust and WASM will give birth to another decent UI).

thanks for the thoughts. I only really know Python so I was looking for a new language to get into building mobile apps. I'm giving Kivy a try since the apps I'm thinking of are all smaller, not like wallets etc.

the checking of transactions and validation is all automated by the above linked software


[26-May-20 04:15 AM] gcharang#6833
there are 2 modes supported. one is spv and other is native. atomicDEX-API can query either to check the validity of transactions. atomicDEX mobile uses SPV servers


[26-May-20 04:20 AM] gcharang#6833
in some of the steps, if the taker client goes offline indefinitely, they might lose coins

> but what if block explorers go offline
it doesn't matter if a block explorer goes offline. block explorers are just showing you what the blockchain already has. spv servers are nodes maintained by a blockchain's community to support lite wallets. if it goes offline, it goes offline and mobile atomic swaps won't work. if you are a business providing a atomic swaps between certain pairs to your customers, you might want to maintain your own electrum servers and scale them based on demand


[26-May-20 04:20 AM] gcharang#6833
spv servers == electrm servers btw


[26-May-20 04:25 AM] gcharang#6833
some by the kmd team, others the respective coin communities. you can see the servers for all the supported coins here <https://github.com/jl777/coins/tree/master/electrums>

whenever you are using a lite wallet, you are using spv/electrum servers

@SirSevenG please make a wallet with huge amount of txs in tx history and try to navigate as users described above

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #123: Eye icon on password page is incorrect
Thanks for the issue creation

for one person crossed eye means that on press it text will hide (motivation to hide), for another person it means that text is hidden right now (motivation to display hided).
so visual experience important and now if user press on this button text hide/unhide so I don't think that eye icon will change something and that there is any issue.

@Bitfinger Could you please clarify why do you think that it's wrong right now and how icon change will fix it?

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #133: warn user if local clock not in sync
`orderbook` rpc returns a timestamp (at a glance the only one to do so that doesn't involve trading).
This timestamp appears to be same as device time (expressed in UTC) - 
```bash
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"$userpass\",\"method\":\"orderbook\",\"base\":\"RFOX\",\"rel\":\"DEX\"}"
```
```json
{"askdepth":0,"asks":[],"base":"RFOX","biddepth":0,"bids":[],"netid":9999,"numasks":0,"numbids":0,"rel":"DEX","timestamp":1590663060}
```
vs 
```bash
date +"%s"

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #82: Total asset display
@tonymorony just finished with this test on iOS (KMD<=>RFOX), the good news is that no weird total assets value fluctuations were noted on any stage of the swap but at the end of the swap (Stage 3 I suppose), the unconfirmed transaction was indeed put in the total asset value before it was confirmed. So the issue is still there if it was about the unconfirmed transaction being in the total asset pool. But no double quantities or anything weird like that.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #140: Cache previous balances, interaction during "activation"
`We're already in the process of trying to make it feel faster, hopefully, we will deliver in the next update.`

Coins activation process was already patched in 0.2.16 by new Atomicdex-api batch method usage - now it works really fast

Balances information caching is definetly an interesting idea

Recommendation from Telegram: When making an order on empty orderbook, or just setting your own price, you should be able to set the price per coin you'd like to receive (or better) for the amount of coins you are trying to sell. Instead of just putting in the amount of coins you'd like to receive. 

Steps:
select coin to sell
select amount to sell
select coin to receive
select satoshi amount per coin

@tonymorony Exact same behavior.
Additional note: on smartphones with dedicated fingerscan (not onscreen one), user will see pin code input page on app start. This way app can be unlocked either with biometrics or correct pin.
Just fingertip icon will not be present.

It's quite arguable topic on how app should behave with both protection options enabled.

@Regnar idea: if you put the coin logos first and the pair names second, it might look better... the logos would be aligned and since it is the most "dominant" element on the page, it could have a big effect

So, lately, I was typing in a seed to restore a wallet and since I actually typed it in instead of copypasting I made a few typos and ofc could not restore a wallet so I had to fix those typos. I then pressed the show button and tried to navigate the cursor to where the actual typo is, and it was very hard because you have to be swift enough to point the cursor until it hides the seed again. Obviously an edge-case because doubt someone would type it in by hand, but by getting rid of that time...

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #147 Podcasts tab
Just a random idea/mindflow:

Since we got audio player functionality we can add cryptotalks podcasts right into the app (maybe News change to Content and on Content two sub-categories News and Podcasts)
something like that:
https://pod.co/crypto-radio
and I've seen many good podcasts with @ca333

P.S.
I have a general strong feeling that AtomicDEX GUIs (mobile/desktop) might great with some social elements that connect DEX with our community (community portal / SMM channels ), probab...

Posting this so it doesn't get lost:
Smartwatch notifications for order matches, swaps, incoming transactions,... would be epic. Maybe we can even use the watch as a "DEX remote control" and issue swaps and transactions.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #150 Add possibility to convert usual case address to mixed case one right in the app
At the moment users are very confused when trying to withdraw ETH/ERC-20 and input non-mixed case address as the recipient.

I suggest to add the possibility to convert address to the mixed case right in the app - because now support just recommends to input address to etherscan website to get the mixed case version what is the sub-optimal way.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #152: Repeat order when failed
don't know if that is such a good idea
it can make things worse if network is overloaded and you send more network requests in a loop
and if timeout is because of dead/faulty maker, it will not have any positive effect

I think it might be quite helpful for the user to have on this screen the total amount of orders for a given pair

Since there might be many possible pairs options in DEX and since we're on a stage where there is not many orders user might need to click a lot of options to find the pair with >0 amount of orders. To not break overloads we might just highlight VRSC and user will learn what that means

@Goku AtomicDex is running electrums, those electrums run the latest working release of a coin's repo if that's what you mean. I don't think there is a way to check the *version*

That's means there is always the current version running?

99% of the electrums are hosted and updated by Cipi. I think I've only seen 3rd party electrums for BCH

I'm starting to get too many opened files on Xr in release mode with 9 coins already (around 210 from 250 descriptors used). So I think it might be worth to force users to not activate many coins for now for better and smoother user experience and disappointment avoiding :)

But if implement that we should carefully think about the case for users who'll update to this version and has more than 10 coins activated already (to prevent bricking/locking)

Looks like AtomicDEX calculating transaction amount as `amount - fee` or something like that

Actual transaction:

Now in AtomicDEX txinfo in such case looks not clear (like I sent 0.58 KMD instead of 1)

Imo in case of tx with rewards usage we just need to display the amount of sending to destination vout as a number on top in AtomicDEX so it'll be clear like now in explorer.

It's already on Bisq, and since the project is so big on decentralization, makes sense to have it on a DEX


[05-Jun-20 11:52 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
could probably bring a good amt of liquidity since I think several ARRR people hold LBC


[05-Jun-20 11:53 AM] FlyingDutchman#5213
and currently theres no KYC to withdraw LBC from LBRY, but the exchanges are kyc, so atomicdex can solve that for them

@Audo @ca333 @B. G√ºltekin √áetiner I see that pirate community exploring lamassu ATMs, and came across the code which supports Zcash.
sharing a copy of these 2 links from pirate discord, thanks to @CHMEX 
Node commands: https://github.com/lamassu/lamassu-server/blob/dev/lib/plugins/wallet/zcashd/zcashd.js
Address validation: https://github.com/lamassu/lamassu-machine/blob/dev/lib/coins/zec.js

So, I looked a bit on their server code and I found they also support centralised cryptocurrency exchanges:
https://github.com/lamassu/lamassu-server/tree/dev/lib/plugins/exchange

bitstamp's example:
https://github.com/lamassu/lamassu-server/blob/dev/lib/plugins/exchange/bitstamp/bitstamp.js
https://github.com/lamassu/lamassu-server/blob/dev/lib/plugins/common/bitstamp.js

By the quick look at the code it looks it must be possible to add atomicdex support as one of the decentralised exchange to this Js code too.
So, just leaving it as an idea here for the future when things are bit stable in AtomicDEX mobile and Pro projects, to explore the idea of support ATMs with AtomicDEX support, to bring a bit of liquidity. I'm sure when we'll have the stable-coins ATMs probably would be good idea to have support at that time.
Just sharing what came to my notice and kind of a feature request for future. üôÇ

@gcharang  can someone simplifie orderbook section in atomic dex. I mean like in pair supernet/kmd when watching specified orders in buy and sell side it changes pairs what is selling. If i want to swap supernet to kmd i want to see ordrs of supernet that are either selling superney or buying supernet. Now all orders are selling either kmd or supernet.


[09-Jun-20 03:21 AM] Oszy#5734
by swapping the pairs you achieve the same thing no?


[09-Jun-20 03:21 AM] Oszy#5734
its just a question of point of view what is buy and what is sell


[09-Jun-20 03:25 AM] Mark81#4505
View  wording is inverted. If you want to trade supernet for kmd then orderbook between spread should be worded  selling supernet and buying supernet.  Not selling supernet and selling kmd.

@gcharang No, i noticed this issue while clickking on orders itself on orderbook. It gives you additional info about order. Lets use example like KMD/BTC. On red orders clicking them will show --> Selling KMD xxxx amount fro BTC xxx amount. Now when goign back and you click below KMD/BTC green orders  it will show Selling BTC xxx amount for KMD xxx amount. It should show Buying KMD xxx amount for BTC xxx amount.

[09-Jun-20 02:27 PM] jansako#3330
You can use the same coins to provide liquidity on many different pairs. The same 1 BTC can sit on BTC/KMD, BTC/ETH, BTC/BCH pairs ready to be traded. Once a trade happens, just refill the BTC & the specific pair that traded, the other orders are still good to go.

> Anyone have insight (and can explain to me in simple words üôÇ )in if and how the DEX protocol could be interesting for liquidity providers?
@GoeieDagSchotel   1) Exchange mirroring,  LP can mirror exchanges and capitalize on the arbitrage 2) Place multiple orders across different pairs with same coin 3)  Trustlessly exchange large amounts 4)  Less fees

@grewalsatinder  


That is very good idea to integrate AtomicDex with ATM machines. We are planning to have at least one ATM if possible inside the University campus Next to other bank ATMs and also convince some cafes, restaurants nearby the campus to have. Both KMD and MCL with TRY is the priority, but it would be great to add other Komodo family currencies.

[12-Jun-20 06:56 AM] Regnar#6164
Is there a simple way in the RPCs for GUI developers to add their own trading fees? I'm thinking something like a setting to set fee amount as a percentage of total trade amount, possibly with "stepped" fees if you have a balance of KMD or something. Or is that something that would have to be done by the GUI where it calculates the fee amount and sends a regular transaction to a "fee" address?


[12-Jun-20 07:48 AM] Mylo#8306
is a good idea, like an "include donation".  seems like a can of worms, not simple.  do-able (in the everything  is do-able), but not simple. imo


[12-Jun-20 11:02 AM] Regnar#6164
might be a way to make the same transaction that claims the trade amount also split off some to the GUI fee address.

[13-Jun-20 10:01 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
@vogelfreund88 Would be a good idea, but without any CEX you can trade the DEX asset i figure those sites can't come up with a marketprice. So get in on a CEX first, Upbit might be the best option seeing that a lot of price action on KMD comes from there too.

I read everything and it was difficult to understand.
But it seems it's not what I meant.
```This method requires that we decide how many total gateway signatures we desire (N), and how many signatures are required to withdraw funds (M).```
This part show's, that just a group of signaters will control the real coins on a multisig and not "the blockchain".


[15-Jun-20 08:06 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Whoever has the keys for the address in the BTC chain is who controls the coins.   Multisig decentralizes it.     By requiring your key the other signers can‚Äôt just withdraw the coin.    All transactions can only be spent when appropriately signed.    Explain how ‚Äúthe blockchain ‚Äú can tell who has the right to spend which coins without programming it in?  Regardless WBTC, is custodial Through Bitgo ( most likely use multisig to protect customer funds ) and required KYC.


[15-Jun-20 08:25 AM] Goku#9007
The trust for a pegged token, which represents a coin of a other blockchain, should idially be as secure as the used blockchain itself.

Not sure how this can be technical be developed, but there should not be a individualy group of key holders.
Instead, the block producers (="the blockchain") should automatically withdrawal the coins, if certain condition are fulfilled.

@allbits 
It works without kyc i guess?


[15-Jun-20 08:50 AM] Goku#9007
But the problem is here the same:
```Instead of storing the BTC within a centralized or trusted custodial setup, RenVM stores the BTC in a network of decentralized nodes (called Darknodes).```


[15-Jun-20 08:50 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
It‚Äôs still multisig ,  the only difference is the multisigners supposedly don‚Äôt know the key


[15-Jun-20 08:50 AM] Goku#9007
Yes


[15-Jun-20 08:52 AM] allbits#5898
no kyc - it is a permissionless system


[15-Jun-20 08:52 AM] allbits#5898
could also bridge to komodo with a little work


[15-Jun-20 08:56 AM] Goku#9007
Yeah but how can we get completely rid of the need of multisig, and using somekind of skripthash address which automatically does the same thing?

it is an orderbook, just like on a CEX: https://komodod.com/atomicdex/orderbook?pair=VRSC-KMD
you buy and sell at the best price possible, but if the difference between best bid and ask is 30%, you will loose 30% if you buy and sell at the same time


[19-Jun-20 07:24 AM] cipi#4502
you can simply post your own offer/order, instead of taking what is already there... and than wait for a better price... same as on a CEX

I have many failed/stuck swaps, but I‚Äôm not sure which ones. If I provide my log file to one of the devs/support, would it take very long to sweep it and try and recover funds? I tried grabbing some of the UUIDs and using the recover  funds api via mm2, but complains there are missing swap files. Hopefully there‚Äôs some other way to get them back with just the data in the log dump from AtomicDex?


[20-Jun-20 04:17 AM] smkhound#7640
tolken - I can scan and see if it picks up anything, but cant be sure all cases not detected. How many UUIDs?

I'm having an issue with doge wallet.
Swap was fine, but I'm having a prob sending doge out.
It shows unconfirmed in wallet (nothing on the explorer) and then 2nd or 3rd time I try it sends.


[20-Jun-20 08:22 AM] cipi#4502
the problem with DOGE is that the dynamic fee calculation can sometimes result in using a fee that is below the min_relay_fee, which is 1 DOGE, so most DOGE nodes will not relay that tx
there is a fix in mm2, but not sure if that made it to the app, i think not: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins#L676
please check if the fee used in this txes is indeed lower than 1 DOGE


[20-Jun-20 08:23 AM] cipi#4502
or post the txid, so i can check


[20-Jun-20 08:28 AM] V__C#6587
Atomic swap is working fine.


[20-Jun-20 08:29 AM] cipi#4502
could be, doesn't happen all the time... it depends on the specific tx (size of it)


[20-Jun-20 08:29 AM] cipi#4502
you can also set custom fee on withdraw to 1 DOGE


[20-Jun-20 08:30 AM] V__C#6587
The swap was flawless.

It's when I withdraw from aDex that is the problem. 
Fee is below 1 doge but I have to try and send a few times - it withdraws eventually.


[20-Jun-20 08:31 AM] cipi#4502
yes, some DOGE nodes may accept the tx into mempool even if below 1 DOGE and after some time it will also be mined... but it takes much longer


[20-Jun-20 08:32 AM] V__C#6587
Ok - much appreciated!
I will try custom fee if it's urgent.

@smkhound I‚Äôm not sure how to parse the log efficiently to tell which one failed or not. It‚Äôs about a 5mb log, so quite lengthy. There may be 10-20.


[20-Jun-20 01:03 PM] tolken#2655
Or if there‚Äôs any resource that explains how you recover the funds. I assume it isn‚Äôt easy or else someone would release a tool that scans the logs and automatically releases the stuck funds.


[20-Jun-20 01:04 PM] tolken#2655
that‚Äôs my main concern with using AtomicDex at moment, I get stuck funds and I don‚Äôt have a easy way to know what‚Äôs stuck in limbo, but I know I‚Äôve got quite a few now.


[20-Jun-20 01:10 PM] cipi#4502
```for i in `grep -l '"type":"MakerPaymentRefundFailed"' DB/*/SWAPS/MY/*`; do ls -la $i; done```
searches the swap jsons for MakerPaymentRefundFailed... you can try TakerPaymentRefundFailed too, in case you are a taker... and then call recover_funds for all these uuids
and you can use https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/error.php?uuid=63f8de7a-e7b0-46db-83e0-4a9a85bb2c7a
if it returns something, there was an error on either maker or taker (doesn't mean stuck, just error, but all stucked swaps had an error)
if it doesn't return anything, there was no error and nothing stuck


[20-Jun-20 02:23 PM] tolken#2655
@cipi it seems I need to export the DB from AtomicDex mobile somehow to do this?


[20-Jun-20 02:28 PM] tolken#2655

I certainly have swaps that have the ‚ÄúTakerPaymentRefundFailed‚Äù In some of my swap files. I use that UUID with the recover_funds_of_swap, but they all just immediately error with: ```{"error":"rpc:305] lp_swap:762] swap data is not found"}```


[20-Jun-20 04:39 PM] tolken#2655
I placed the swap files in their respective swaps/stats/(maker/taker) directory.


[20-Jun-20 05:22 PM] tolken#2655
Are docs possibly incorrect here? I just put the files into the MY folder and I‚Äôm getting a response


[20-Jun-20 05:31 PM] tolken#2655
No recover funds, but it is telling me things like maker payment spent, so it appears to be finding the log data. Unsure why nothing was recovered, I‚Äôm pretty sure some funds are in limbo, but I‚Äôll keep digging.


[20-Jun-20 05:46 PM] tolken#2655
One specifically i was a taker. Sold KMD for USDC. When i attempt to recover it says ‚Äúmaker payment is spent, swap using not recoverable‚Äù After a certain amount of time, can you no longer recover coins? The swap was from mid April I believe. Never receive the USDC, never got the KMD returned either.

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #163 Pressing "unlock funds" button on a unrecoverable swap involving ETH/ERC\-20 repeatedly, spends gas fees repeatedly
This may be an edge case that occurred because of a bug in AtomicdEX-API/(smart contract code), but I think every button press that costs something should report the cost before the button is pressed. or at least ask for a confirmation before the action is performed. 

In this particular case, the swap involved ETH and was stuck(unrecoverable)

@grewalsatinder your point is correct. we should only be using the komodoplatform version as the source of truth. mine is upto date right now because I have sent a PR recently, but can't guarantee it will stay the same all the time. so, it's best to use <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins> @Nabob | $ARRR @zatJUM

A feed back to the Devs , in the app under "Markets" where you have the "price" and "order book" under price when I click on a coin it shows a list of potential pairs , will it be possible to show in that list the coin that has an active order e.g like on Dex pro where is says 2 orders live, just a number will suffice , this will prevent sellers or buyers have to click through the list to find an already active market

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #165 Amount of orders on orderbooks page
I think it might be quite helpful for user to have on this screen total amount of orders for given pair

Since there might be many possible pairs options in DEX and since we're on stage where there is not many orders user might need to click a lot of options to find the pair with >0 amount of orders. To not break overloads we might just highlight VRSC and user will learn what that means

dust threshold on DOGE chain is 1 DOGE, all tx below 1 DOGE are rejected like that: https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/error.php?uuid=0059f397-8b87-4978-9dbc-764988784ccd
i assume you tried to sell < 777 DOGE, so the takerfee tx is < 1 DOGE (takerfee is 1/777 of takercoin)

will be fixed in API: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/545

Hey. I tried atomicdex beta, and I was confused by the minimum transaction amount of 0.0077 btc. Maybe at the testing stage and in general it would make sense to make the minimum section of the deal smaller? For example, 0.001 btc


[14-Jul-20 11:48 PM] gcharang#6833
@bloleg 
`0.0077 btc` is an arbitrary number we selected based on what it would cost a user to pay the trade fees and btc txn fees and what percantage of the swap volume these costs go up to. There may be an option for the user to set minimum amounts by the time the app goes to full public release.

> `testing stage vs general`
many people are already using it for real trades with real values even though we generally advise them not to. so we have to keep some safe guards

`Hey. I tried atomicdex beta, and I was confused by the minimum transaction amount of 0.0077 btc. Maybe at the testing stage and in general it would make sense to make the minimum section of the deal smaller? For example, 0.001 btc
`
Hey! avg. BTC tx fee right now is 1.6$. 0.001 btc is ~9.2$ atm. 
Taker will need to broadcast two BTC txs in swap: 1) taker fee 2) taker payment so with such avg. txfee 3.2$ in fees will be paid what is `33% from swap value amount`. So this magic const is mostly for protecting users from such situatuions.

[15-Jul-20 02:19 PM] TonyL#3577
Hi @Remedy | eth4ever.eth (‚àû) 
You've sent your payment to swap address when it's temporary locked.
Since swap was failed on stage when you've sent your payment but not received it back your funds will automatically return back after timeout (~8 hours atm). For now just keep application up and running and funds will eventually return back.

[16-Jul-20 10:46 PM] Mylo#8306
the atomicdex api (marketmaker) is written in rust.  one of the most portable languages available.  the future with a base level protocol that runs on toasters, iot devices, vending machines is a boon for operators to accept any currency, and then in their backend network swap to their desired currency.
any utxo can be swapped.  the first 10 years of utxo was only satoshis.  the next 10 years (already starting) contains data.
devs have already swapped xtz with ltc.  however the other interoperable protocols work, interchain/cosmos, polkadot may also be integrated given more dev time.
i'm sure there's more.


[16-Jul-20 10:49 PM] Mylo#8306
these are powerful "add-ons" for projects that adopt the smart chain for their applications.  interoperability to other blockchains from an application. for instance, i am working with a team on a simple supply chain.  the future of supply chain/traceability/sustainability can include payments.  whatever currency that is, accept it. swap it to desired. trustlessly. it is a powerful suite of products.

this is one product lifecycle bonus for using komodo smart chains and antara for application level customization. we can have a far horizon for a project, but incrementally build it, gain adoption, continue building.

@Dxdbro we can add LN into AtomicDex (submarine swaps and reverse submarine swaps). Far from finished but not so complicated (submarine swaps htlc (identical to normal atomic swaps) and p2sh non standard signature already exist in mm2)

How do I turn off the annoying active swap sound?

[18-Jul-20 12:50 AM] Cryptoon#3362
song without sound*


[18-Jul-20 12:51 AM] Pringle#4720
You mean replace that sound with another sound?


[18-Jul-20 12:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
not allowed to do it as default


[18-Jul-20 12:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
yes, it's needed for ios to 'allow' it to run in the background


[18-Jul-20 12:51 AM] Cryptoon#3362
at the same time apple doesnt allow it to be a null sound from default üò¶

@Pringle you can do it through settings

android possible to turn it off I believe


[18-Jul-20 12:52 AM] gcharang#6833
its the same code on android and ios, so its the same behaviour


[18-Jul-20 12:52 AM] Pringle#4720
It's annoying as hell


[18-Jul-20 12:52 AM] gcharang#6833
you can replace with silent sound file in both android and ios


[18-Jul-20 12:56 AM] Pringle#4720
Doing that is a burden on me, not a very pleasant UX to deal with. As a user of the app, I shouldn't have to deal with replacing sounds with other sounds where I have to go and download a 'silent sound'. Why not just have the app come standard with silent sound? or be able to mute the sound in app


[18-Jul-20 01:00 AM] Pringle#4720
Also when I try and unlock my wallet, I click on the field to enter my password and the my keyboard comes up and covers half the screen, this also covers the password field so I can not see how many characters i've entered


[18-Jul-20 01:09 AM] gcharang#6833
@Pringle @zatJUM the app is in beta and we are considering alternate ways to deal with the iOS issue. the public release candidate will likely not have this issue.  for now, optimizing the atomic swap ux is the No:1 priority

@Pringle no, if you kill it from background, the swap is not active


[18-Jul-20 02:10 AM] Pringle#4720
Will this be fixed when the app goes live?


[18-Jul-20 02:13 AM] Cryptoon#3362
it's not a bug, as it is fully decentralized peer to peer trading you need to have a node (your app) running to be able to communicate with the network


[18-Jul-20 02:14 AM] Cryptoon#3362
otherwise you will need to rely on other parties to run your order for you which inheritly makes it centralized and less safe.

@Pringle in addition to what cyptoon said, no one other than you and your app knows your seed words, so your app needs to be online to sign transactions in the various steps
https://komodoplatform.com/atomic-swap-technology/
CTRL + F "Atomic Swaps in 7 Steps" for a summary


[18-Jul-20 04:03 AM] Pringle#4720
Thanks for the info, both of you. I killed the app and then logged back in to amoticDEX and the order was still there (along with the sound) does this mean that it has reactivated?


[18-Jul-20 04:08 AM] gcharang#6833
@Pringle it will either continue executing if it is able, or will timeout on its own
you should see its status and its current step if you select the order


[18-Jul-20 04:16 AM] Pringle#4720

@Pringle what do you have in the place of `1/3 order matched` ?


[18-Jul-20 04:25 AM] Pringle#4720
Where yours have 1/ order matched, mine just says 'Cancel'


[18-Jul-20 04:26 AM] gcharang#6833
it means the order is a "Maker order" and it stays so till you cancel it or someone else fills it


[18-Jul-20 04:26 AM] gcharang#6833
canceling it doesn't have any negative consequence


[18-Jul-20 04:27 AM] Pringle#4720
Yes but will it continue to stay active even though the app is killed in the background?


[18-Jul-20 04:28 AM] gcharang#6833
no, it will only be available for others to fill as long as your app stays alive. but, your app will put up the order everytime it is relaunched


[18-Jul-20 04:28 AM] Pringle#4720
Ok I see


[18-Jul-20 09:26 AM] ejuliano#8606

you can DM me logs to check if something going wrong with activation, or export seed, uninstall/reboot/reinstall


[26-Jul-20 11:42 PM] smkhound#7640
or use the seed in another wallet to recover funds, then start a fresh atomic dex login with new address and send back


[26-Jul-20 11:43 PM] smkhound#7640
as far as I can tell with the info given, all I can speculate is that something is going wrong with activation. A clean slate might fix this.


[26-Jul-20 11:46 PM] Nostradamusx#6140
in general, everything is clear - these are the next "innovations" of the best wallet!


[26-Jul-20 11:48 PM] smkhound#7640
I'm trying to help. Not much more I can do with the information provided beyond
- ask for logs
- suggest a seed export and recovery in another wallet
- suggest a seed export and a uninstall/reboot/reinstall


[26-Jul-20 11:48 PM] Nostradamusx#6140
well! but explain to me why earlier, when I tried to display QTUM to a third-party address, I got an error every time in ALL scenarios! With all updates and servers? I couldn't get him out for more than six months

Hi, is an atomicDEX api available where we can integrate its functionality into another project ?


[26-Jul-20 11:49 PM] smkhound#7640
@Nostradamusx if this is your experience, perhaps exporting the seed to use in another wallet would be best option for you. If you are feeling adventurous, there is an atomicDEX desktop wallet.


[26-Jul-20 11:50 PM] smkhound#7640
@Hassaan yes, the docs are here -  https://developers.komodoplatform.com/basic-docs/atomicdex/atomicdex-api.html
and latest binaries at https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/releases


[26-Jul-20 11:53 PM] Hassaan#5627
@smkhound do you have idea what sort of language wrappers might be supported for this ?


[26-Jul-20 11:55 PM] smkhound#7640
I've done some work with python. As the API can work via cURL, most languages it should be simple to wrap with. Which language did you have in mind?


[26-Jul-20 11:57 PM] Hassaan#5627
Oh thats awesome and we we're kinda hoping for Javascript.


[26-Jul-20 11:58 PM] smkhound#7640
I believe some have used js, leeme see if I can find something


[27-Jul-20 12:00 AM] smkhound#7640
here's an equivalent mm2 proxy class for python anyways, might help - https://github.com/smk762/mm2_metrics_docker/blob/master/lib_mm2.py


[27-Jul-20 12:03 AM] smkhound#7640
https://github.com/atomiclabs/hyperdex was working on js implementation. They were looking for more community contributions last year, so code has not been updated for a while but should demonstrate how to do it.


[27-Jul-20 12:06 AM] smkhound#7640
This repo is for Komodo RPC via NodeJS, but looks like it uses the curl/jsonrpc, so you could probably do something similar with the mm2 methods.

^ nodejs.  web gui implementation https://ikomodo.com/atomicdex-orderbook-tutorial-part-2/ tutorial running in docker.  it links to part 1, which has info on that nodejs middleware https://beta.orderbook.live/docs/
i was updating the webgui, with < 2 days work porting the webgui functions in the vue app to a new gui, got it looking like https://atomicdex.orderbook.live using same nodejs middleware.
but i'm on another project atm for next few months


[27-Jul-20 12:20 AM] Mylo#8306
the gui is good in js, but would be better served up from a go app & Qwebchannel in qt packaging for cross platform and reduces js usage.  very much like the bitbox hardware wallet app.

[28-Jul-20 08:30 AM] dimsum#6195
what is this "Not enough ETH for the transaction fee" do i have to transfer eth too in wallet?


[28-Jul-20 08:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
it's real money @dimsum not testnet


[28-Jul-20 08:35 AM] Cryptoon#3362
you need ETH to pay for GAS (tx fees)


[28-Jul-20 08:36 AM] dimsum#6195

[28-Jul-20 08:38 AM] dimsum#6195
@Cryptoon what about sync my desktop wallet to my android ? I mean how?


[28-Jul-20 09:45 AM] hastrup#8742
@dimsum you can use the same seed for desktop and mobile wallet


[28-Jul-20 09:58 AM] dimsum#6195
same seed,wallet name and same password ? @hastrup


[28-Jul-20 10:01 AM] hastrup#8742
@dimsum wallet name and pass can be different. Pass is for encrypting the seed on device, And the name is for when you have multiple seed in the wallet. the seed wallet addy will always be the same.


[28-Jul-20 08:20 PM] gcharang#6833
@dimsum it is currently not recommended to use the same seed words in two different devices running atomicDEX. your swaps may fail if you do so.


[28-Jul-20 08:20 PM] gcharang#6833
there might be a feature in the future that allows such usage, but the current versions don't support it

I skimmed it, it's a completely different approach from ours. the required cryptography doesn't even have a proper software implementation, that is their next goal. once implementation is done, integrating it into atomicDEX won't be straight forward at all. swapping monero to any of the utxo coins will be a different flavour compared to the current implementation. So, for the best UX, we might need to list XMR in a seperate tab if and when we implement it.

All  of this is going to take time. first they need to get funding, then implement the crypto algorithms, then implement their atomic swap protocol, open source it and test it. then we might integrate it into atomicDEX

[03-Aug-20 08:46 AM] Dochteur#1751
Perhaps a basic question, but just to be sure - should I leave wallet for ethereum open to fully sync in order for the DEX to work properly?


[03-Aug-20 08:49 AM] tolken#2655
@Dochteur if I'm understanding your situation correctly, Atomicdex Mobile (I assume pro as well) doesn't rely on synching a wallet, they use svp connections to circumvent the requirement.


[03-Aug-20 08:50 AM] tolken#2655
For Ethereum on Atomicdex, just add the coin,thats it.


[03-Aug-20 08:50 AM] tolken#2655
(and add some eth for fees)


[03-Aug-20 08:52 AM] Dochteur#1751
@tolken Oh thx for the info, I just added it and other ERC-20 tokens - mostly stablecoins and upon opening the wallet it started syncing slowly, so I wanted to be sure, if I tried to cash out this way not to screw it up. üòÑ Yes its mobile app. Perhaps to add - do I need to have some ETH there in first place, if I wanted to actually swap it, or some supported stablecoin for something like KMD, or just, if Im the one selling them?


[03-Aug-20 08:54 AM] tolken#2655
Yes, you need some eth to trade (for gas fees) to trade. You don't need KMD, unless you're trading KMD. If you trade ETH for LTC, you'll need ETH and LTC, thats it. If you trade some ERC-20, you'll need that ERC-20 coin, ETH, and LTC.


[03-Aug-20 08:56 AM] tolken#2655
Yeah, adding 20 tokens may take some time. The issue is that you're asking Atomicdex to query potentially 20 elecrum servers at startup. It shouldn't take TOO long, but if any of those electrum servers are slow to respond, it could stall or really slow down the startup. So it may be best to only enable what you use most. If you remove a coin from your list, the coins are still there, but they won't initialize every time you start Atomicdex.


[03-Aug-20 08:59 AM] Dochteur#1751
Concrete example - I have KMD, I want to swap it and get ETH, do I still need some eth in my wallet for gas fees?  (Isnt it the sender paying the fee?)


[03-Aug-20 09:06 AM] tolken#2655
That's a good question, I honestly don't remember if I've tried that exact scenerio yet, so may need to have someone more knowledable weigh in on this. I would presume the smart contract that releases the final ETH 'MakerPaymentSpent' would be an Ethereum smart contract thereby requiring ETH for that transaction.


[03-Aug-20 09:08 AM] tolken#2655
I assume the taker (you) is the one responsible for unlocking those funds (MakerPaymentSpent), once they're eligible for release. Assuming that's true, you'd need eth to do so.


[03-Aug-20 09:16 AM] polycryptoblog#1173
Yes both sides need eth

{Reactions}
üëç 

[03-Aug-20 09:36 AM] tolken#2655
@Dochteur for this reason, it's particularly important to be mindful to trade large enough amounts (of ETH or ERC-20)  to make it worthwhile (so fees aren't a disproportionate amount of total trade) ETH gas unfortunately can be extremely high at times.


[03-Aug-20 09:37 AM] tolken#2655

Thx for clarification and your time. üôÇ So trading into ERC-20 stablecoins via AtomicDex, its good to trade symbolic amount of said coin for ETH at some other exchange and send it to AtomicDex eth wallet to be sure to cover the cost of a gas fee. Id say its good to learn this and plan ahead not to be stranded, once it is actually necessary. üòÑ

Dex-kmd swap takes 58 minutes...is it only in early access? Will it be faster in future?


[04-Aug-20 01:18 AM] gcharang#6833
@Deleted User it is because the app is waiting for notarizations on each step. in one of the next releases, there will be an option for the user to set the required confirmation numbers, then the swap can be done much sooner.

That sounds good and is more user friendly but why not set required confirmation on minium as standard?  What pros have many required confirmation? Is 1 confirmation much less secure than for example 2 or 10 confirmation?


[04-Aug-20 03:00 AM] Audo#5667
The steps 1, 2, and 3 on the app are referring to the atomic swap process and not to tx confirmations. e.g. step 1: makerpayment, step 2: taker payment, etc.

I believe the tx confirmations for swap is set to 1 by default. Is that right @gcharang ?

You could increase it if you are making high-value swap and want even more security.

This is good feedback though. We definitely need to better explain what those confirmation steps are and what is happening on the background.


[04-Aug-20 03:38 AM] Deleted User#0000
Step maker payment validated (19 min) and taker paynent spent (38 min) are the longest steps...in both step confirmations are needed? But if at the moment confirmations for swsp is set to 1 by default its already the minimum time?

> Dex-kmd swap takes 58 minutes...is it only in early access? Will it be faster in future?
@Deleted User It can be faster only if notarisations will be faster what is quite hard to achieve (especially economically reasonable way) or if disable notarisations protection (what is obv quite unsafe for low hashrate assets).


[04-Aug-20 04:22 AM] TonyL#3577
However, quite soon we'll add options into GUIs to "tune" notarisations and confirmations requirements for every particular trade incoming transactions so each user will be able to personally select desired security level.
`Dex-kmd swap takes 58 minutes...is it only in early access? Will it be faster in future?` 
in initial TierNolans atomicswaps algorithm discription up to 48 hours considered, so overall 1-2 hours seems quite reasonable for such barter


[04-Aug-20 04:24 AM] TonyL#3577
"Default" (recommended) confirmations numbers specified in coins file: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/blob/master/coins these numbers using by GUIs

```
"required_confirmations": 2,
"requires_notarization": true
```

means "wait for notarisations for this asset transactions"

security-wise 1 notarised confirmation cost almost infinity amount of non-notarized ones for low hashrate chains

@TonyL can there be an option to use conf vs notarisation based on the amount traded?


[04-Aug-20 04:39 AM] hyperDEX#6586
So say <$10 = 1 conf etc so for the most part the lower tx are lower risk and should be faster


[04-Aug-20 04:39 AM] TonyL#3577
we've considered that but it's quite tricky matter from security perspective even for such low amounts

Maybe you can develop a bar where user can slide in differents steps...left is fast swap with 1 confirmation and right is high security with more confirmations...and between this steps are more steps so user can decide if he want faster swaps or more  security but slower swaps

I'm not sure how feasible or worthwhile this is but I was thinking of ways to help solve the issue of mobile users going offline during a trade. Could there be a way to optionally link your mobile and desktop apps together, sort of like having your desktop client being a "trusted node" for your trades? I'm not too sure how this would work with signing transactions but:
You run AtomicDEX Pro, you link your AtomicDEX mobile to your pro, you make a trade via mobile, and pass off the trade data, signed transactions, etc to your AtomicDEX Pro to continue the trade/broadcasting transactions for your mobile wallet. You either leave your mobile app running to perform the trade, or if you close it, it send needed information to your Pro to finish for you. You can then close the mobile app after initiating the trade and the Pro finishes it for you.


[10-Aug-20 10:38 AM] Regnar#6164
I would think this setup would eventually lend itself to 3rd party servers who will "host" trades for you as well, possibly for a fee, or if a party creates their own GUI they could set their own servers as the default contingency nodes to complete your swaps. Assuming you can presign needed transactions and these nodes don't have to touch your private keys


[10-Aug-20 11:00 AM] Slyris#2880
@Regnar tbh with you you can already simulate an equivalent with blue stack on your computer, trade on your mobile, disconnect, connect on blue stacks with the same seed, and leave it open.

There is dozen of service to control desktop app from mobile and vice versa (I'm sure it's exist equivalent for blue stacks)

relay/route all buy/sell requests to pro from mobile. Id imagine there are some challenges with dealing with swaps that are initiated on mobile vs pro. It seems like you‚Äôd need to pick one mode or another (swap on mobile or relay buy/sell to pro) not mix trades between two devices.

@Regnar there were plans to make this possible but with a slightly different architecture. not sure about the current status and intereset. but, something like this will definitely be possible in the futture. if not in the near future, it will be after the Official release.

the initial plan was something like: A GUI (mobile or desktop) will spin up a VPS, installs/setsup mm2 in it and allows the user to have a mm2 instance that is online 24/7 . this feature may or may not look like this when it ships out.

another solution is to run your own blockchain, and send commands from your phone by some convention used in sending to/from addresses (& this can be multi-trading wallet simply based off send to/from addresses)
e.g.
send MYCOIN  to RaddressForMarketPairKMDLTC 10.5710001  could mean, in the market KMDLTC, 10 = quantity, price is 57, buy/sell = last digit 1 or 2.
in your desktop, read the relevant thing and execute order.
much more p2p & much more secure than my "public/private" terminal.
just needs better numbering system in the amount sent.

cancel last order could simply be by sending 9.99999999 to the same RaddressForMarketPairKMDLTC


[11-Aug-20 02:14 AM] Mylo#8306

So when will Mobil atomic DEX have more assets? Or when we will have an API atomic swap application that we could use in the ledger app or Trezor?


[12-Aug-20 04:14 PM] phm87#7395
Sorry to ask again but how to differentiate any P2SH address with atomixDEX addresses of a swap? Should I use the dexfee tx? Or is there anything particular to mm2 in these addresses?
To give some context, I'd like to launch a test smartchain with user active rewards activated but only on swap addresses. It is a test but later, it can be seen as a Defi product since liquidity provider will be incentivized (paid but with inflation). If I don't limit this in the code, farmers will farm on their own p2sh and not provide liquidity for mm2


[12-Aug-20 04:46 PM] phm87#7395

@Alright as I read your comment in the python code, do you know if it was implemented into coin daemon?
```# find all p2sh transactions of addresses asscociated with DEX fee address
# doing this in daemon will speed this script up significantly```

[13-Aug-20 01:01 AM] Alright#0419
that was never implemented in the daemon as far as I know


[13-Aug-20 01:47 AM] phm87#7395
Ok thank you I will have a look.
About wash trading, if the dexfee is paid at each wash trade, it is still ok for me ... maybe I can restrict AUR to successfull swaps and not pay it for failed swaps


[13-Aug-20 04:40 AM] Hassaan#5627
with atomicDEX, if say we list a brand new coin. Would the company itself need to provide liquidity providers on AtomicDEX so that the coin could be easily traded for other cryptocurrencies


[13-Aug-20 05:10 AM] Oszy#5734
as in company you mean your company?


[13-Aug-20 05:11 AM] Oszy#5734
you would need to run a mm2 node with a maker order to distribute your coins


[13-Aug-20 05:12 AM] Hassaan#5627
So just to make sure I'm not confusing anything here. If a user came onto the atomic dex and wanted to change BTC for this new coin. This mm2 node would be able to service that request at all times right. So long as it has a supply.


[13-Aug-20 05:14 AM] Hassaan#5627
and who would service the request when someone wanted to change back from this new coin to BTC


[13-Aug-20 05:32 AM] Oszy#5734
`to change BTC for this new coin` you need to set up a maker order in atomicdex for the NEW_COIN/BTC
`to change back from this new coin to BTC` you would need to set up a maker order in atomicDEX for BTC/NEW_COIN to "buy back" or let the market and other people sort it out

I wonder if there is a plan to add ARRR to AtomicDEX. Our community is very happy when exchanging between MCL and especially KMD. When people ask me in the street how they could buy and sell MCL, I just show them how to install AtomicDEX and send them a cupple of MCL and show them DEX to exchange. AtomicDEX is a wonderful product.

@B. G√ºltekin √áetiner yes, I created subatomic GUI proof of concept to which I invited you and others in MCL if they want to experience it. Nobody showed up to test it from MCL community yet. It does support MCL<->ARRR. It's not a final product so isn't perfect, but just a proof of concept to give a taste of how it looks like doing subatomic swaps. This first PoC is ready since April-May sometime and we are in August. Only 2 people has tested it so far, @SHossain and @NutellaLicka.
It is interesting to see people show interest to have a subatomic swaps but then nobody shows up to test it, even I opened it to users to test and provide feedback in #meshbits here in this discord.

It will be refunded automatically in 4 hours you can not lose anything unless data is deleted manually


[17-Aug-20 07:34 PM] smkhound#7640
This can happen if something happens like the counter party goes offline, or custom fees are used, set too low and tx doesnt confirm in time.
If the refund doesnt automatically return, DM details like swap UUID and your address to me or @gcharang so we can help you thru the process manually.
Do not delete any data until resolved, and keep your seed backed up at all times.

It's a erc20 token. The reason I ask is because you can buy this token via PayPal...


[25-Aug-20 08:18 AM] cipi#4502
https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/verasity/
shows that it is a BEP2 token, not ERC20: https://explorer.binance.org/asset/VRAB-B56
BEP2 needs to be implemented in mm2 first... i would love to see BEP2 in mm2, also because it would give us the option to use Stablecoins (eg BUSD) without having to pay the extreme high fees on ETH chain


[25-Aug-20 08:25 AM] cipi#4502
https://academy.binance.com/glossary/bep-2 ... hmm, fees on BNB chain are paid in BNB, regardless of the token you send... this drawback remains, but ok, at least it is much less than erc20


[25-Aug-20 08:40 AM] Nixgeschenkt#9372
@cipi  It is/was on Binance Chain that's correct. But they swap all vrab back to VRA on Ethereum https://etherscan.io/token/0xdf1d6405df92d981a2fb3ce68f6a03bac6c0e41f

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #168 Add a hint/prompt in the orderbook screen that lets a user know that they can be a maker if they so wish
Many users are looking at the large spreads in the orderbooks and don't seem to realize that they can create an order with the price they like, leave the app running in the background and let other users fill it. Some text that explains this on the screen might be helpful.

If ever we integrate a guided tour/tutorial to the app, this info should be included in it.

For just the DEX, yea, but not for a suite of different DeFi related projects. That would be the equivalent of calling your entire computer just an email client or a web browser, sure it has those products on it, but it's much more than just that.

@Regnar In that case its just better to be just Atomic .Aave or Compound does not call itself Aave Defi or Compound Defi. Just does not synchronize, feels cheap.... Maybe would also be good to introduce a new Atomic coin to drive various defi function.


[29-Aug-20 10:38 AM] Regnar#6164
I'd probably vote for Antara over Atomic tbh. Atomic alone would be too generic


[29-Aug-20 10:41 AM] Lord44#5840
Antara is taken other than that not a bad name. Atomic Dex was alright coz it would advertise the Atomic swap function. But for Defi it loses that function for its naming...Maybe also be good if they want officially ask the community to choose a name for the project.


[29-Aug-20 11:52 AM] Regnar#6164
What do you mean Antara is taken? Antara Composer, Antara Modules, etc are all Komodo


[29-Aug-20 11:54 AM] Regnar#6164

Again, ADFP isn't just a DEX, so it doesn't make sense to refer to it as a DEX and exclude the other DeFi abilities. ie. a computer is not called an Email machine

> Again, ADFP isn't just a DEX, so it doesn't make sense to refer to it as a DEX and exclude the other DeFi abilities. ie. a computer is not called an Email machine
@Regnar Your argument is redundant .Computer and email are not good exmaple for defi and dex.Defi is still a vague idea and sounds cheap.Its like calling a Galaxy s20 a computer and was using past tense when it did not have defi function. Whatever, I don't own Komodo brand so not my problem...

[29-Aug-20 12:12 PM] Regnar#6164
DeFi - traditional financial operations performed in a decentralized, trust less, permissionless way. 

All cryptocurrency is a form of DeFi as financial transactions are done in a way that fits the DeFi definition. 

KMD is a cryptocurrency that also has a 5.1% active user rewards system. You gain 5.1% on your stack by being an active users, at least monthly. 

KMD is also likely to be the fuel for decentralized stable coins.

Decentralized stablecoins - any user can put crypto up as collateral and issue a stablecoin that can claim that collateral, or any other collateral used for the same coin. Ie. I can lock KMD and issue a stablecoin pegged to USD, then use that KUSD to purchase the collateral of other users if their loan to collateral ratio gets in the red. Profits for me, reinforces the stable coin peg. This is in development.

In order to have DeFi stablecoins, you need DeFi price feeds, less a single feed and be manipulated to distort prices and throw off collateral ratios. For this Komodo is developing decentralized oracles that make price feeds.

Liquidation for all of this can be done by anyone with the stablecoin.


[29-Aug-20 12:12 PM] Regnar#6164
AtomicDEX - decentralized, atomic swap powered exchange. There are no proxy tokens, no centralized orderbook, no permissions needed. Orderbooks are thought libtorrent protocol. This is decentralized finance at its core, the free exchange of currencies and assets.

Assets Module. This is the DEX (see above) of the komodo Tokens CC market. Ie. DEX of NFTs and tokens.

Heir Module. Allows cryptocurrency funds to be passed on as an inheritance. Think of a decentralized Will. No more "lost coins" you can also likely use this as a insurance policy, ie. You lose your keys, fail to check in, your funds move to a new pre determined wallet. Decentralized Will, insurance policy to protect against lost keys.

Rewards module. Rewards Antara Module creates a master-node like rewards program, giving a user the ability to earn rewards by locking coins. Basically a decentralized savings account.


[29-Aug-20 12:12 PM] Regnar#6164
Atomic Swap powered exchanges, these use HTLC to securely swap crypto across blockchains without using a proxy chain or centralized gateway.

SubAtomic Swaps, these use Komodod daemon to swap crypto across blockchains, has support for Z to Z transactions.

Remember Jumblr? Decentralized coin mixing services (currently KMD doesn't support Z anymore, and the standard of anon pools is Pirate)

Years ago, BarterDEX was the initial atomic swap powered exchange, which also supported 0Conf swaps, a way to lock KMD as collateral to perform faster swaps. This is being looked at again to see if it has a place today.

MCL Marmara credit loops is a form of peer to peer credit system.

[29-Aug-20 12:13 PM] Regnar#6164
If we implement most of those types of things into this application, would it still make sense to just call it a DEX?


[29-Aug-20 12:17 PM] Lord44#5840
So, Ripple is Defi? Nice.... You are missing the past tense. Dunno why your arguing with these things it was called AtomicDex by officials with all those Defi features already there .There is only few changes on the .0.2.1 pro with live orderbook so no idea how it suddenly needed to become a Defi.


[29-Aug-20 12:27 PM] Regnar#6164
AtomicDEX didn't have any of those features. Only the DEX.


[29-Aug-20 12:28 PM] Lord44#5840
So what changes now?


[29-Aug-20 12:28 PM] Regnar#6164
It's because it is going to become the platform for Komodo's DeFi products


[29-Aug-20 12:29 PM] Lord44#5840
So what the point arguing with Komodo has 5% interest so its a defi?


[29-Aug-20 12:29 PM] Lord44#5840

Hi guys, can someone help me?
I've transfered some USDC to my Atomic DeFi wallet, but the balance is always zero.
My ETH amount is shown correcty, but USDC is always 0, so I can not transfer some of them to another address.
Has anybody an idea?
Checking the erc20-address on etherscan shows the correct amount.

@Mike66 the value you have blocked with red paint *is* your USDC balance. the wallet is just showing the euro value as zero. that is because, the wallet doesn't know the Euro price of USDC. you can transfer and use the USDC regardless of the EURO value

Hi , I had a couple of swaps fail from ltc to kmd. This was as a maker. I end up trying to sell the ltc for kmd as a taker but it kept giving me an error message. I was trying to sell the max supply. I lowered it slightly and a swap went through. But for some reason I can‚Äôt post screenshots in this group. I notified Regnar on telegram.


[03-Sep-20 12:22 PM] WnyCrypto#8781

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #169: Add info about suggested txn fee for BTC/ETH withdrawal
the output of the method `withdraw` in mm2 is showing the total fees that will be used, so `\"method\":\"withdraw\",\"coin\":\"BTC\",\"to\":\"xxxxxxxxxxxxx\",\"max\":true,\"fee\":{\"type\":\"UtxoPerKbyte\",\"amount\":0.00004}}` (with custom fee of 4 sats)
shows
```
   "fee_details" : {
      "amount" : "0.00001952"

if no fee is passed to `withdraw`, mm2 uses the fee from `estimatesmartfee` call of bitcoind

@Deleted User These are good points, have you tried asking members of the dev team yet if there is some documentation they can pass on to you, or a process for helping add these coins to the atomicDEX gui?  As I understand all coins are able to be traded, but may not be added to the GUI interface atm .

I'm not sure how to do it and loaded down atm, but I saw you mention in #üí¨‚îÉgeneral the other day you'd help in anything you can.  Maybe you can help clear a path and create some clear documentation on how to do this so you and others can follow up adding coins?

Yea I know that @Audo is making this a primary focus on his campaign, here's there things I know he's done/is doing to attack this issue
1.) Komodo internship that meets everyday there's about 10 people who are self-organizing to work on what he's described to us as 'clearing paths' to information.  
2.) Offering discourse in place of the previous portal as a place to share static content in an organized manner for those that are interested in participating which will eventually get integrated into wiki's with a lot of the focus on being on creating better path clearing.  Maybe that's a place in the coming months you'll want to poke around at? 
Like for example if I am able to make a 'grandmaproof guide' I'll probably post it there and then link it here in chat. 
3.) He's oriented the marketing team at a deep dive on internal reorg with a focus on providing clarity to both how to get to information about Komodo easily from main channels like social media + website, and a revamp of information available making it more accessible to average users and junior developers.

@Deleted User 
I def read this not as 'we can't add other coins' just like what @cipi  said.  'In ideal situations' 
I think the devs are super overloaded to be able to move on this freely on their own, why I'm thinking maybe we can do something about it here in the community?

@cipi  that would be nice...so i think the next stresstest has to be very well prepared and  their also must be a very good marketing...not marketing for all but marketing inside the kmd community...the community must be motivated...for example with big bountys...me for example need no bounty but most people need an incentive to do something


[11-Sep-20 11:22 AM] cipi#4502
i consider AtomicDEX as pretty stable, there was not a more stable atomic swap implementation in the past... besides some minor glitches, the most important and challenging was the scalability, which was visible in the last stress test
but exactly this part was under heavy development in the past months, and i am pretty confident that we will see a much more scalable AtomicDEX soon

Hi . I initiated a swap on AtomicDex . It‚Äôs been 6 hours and it still hasn‚Äôt processed. Does it usually take this long?


[11-Sep-20 11:44 AM] cipi#4502
No, that is far too long... i assume the swap hasn't even started... this can happen when price on the maker changes during swap initiation by the taker... if the price does not match any more, the order will stay in order book, being converted to a maker order and waits for a taker to come by and fill it
is it at stage 0?

hmmm, last swap i see in the DB is a KMD/VRSC swap from `19:21:01`...


[11-Sep-20 01:05 PM] cipi#4502
i see it... it's there... from 18:36:56 UTC... there were 2 much bigger DEX swaps afterwards, but in the other direction


[11-Sep-20 01:07 PM] cipi#4502
you are right.. it is missing on the website, but present in the databse


[11-Sep-20 01:08 PM] cipi#4502
@CHMEX how often do you update the data on the site?

I'm just using your API cipi lol


[11-Sep-20 01:22 PM] cipi#4502
the API shows the specific trades too: https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/trades_24h.php?market=DEX-KMD
maybe CHMEX is using his own DB for the site and the update cron job crashed... or something like this

@cipi I‚Äôve tried 3 times to start the swap and nothing happens.


[12-Sep-20 05:56 AM] Regnar#6164
how are you doing a swap? are you picking an order from the orderbook? are you setting your own price? 

What do you mean "nothing happens" does the swap begin but just doesn't finish, does your swap show up in open orders or swap history?


[12-Sep-20 06:30 AM] Oszy#5734
Try a slightly smaller amount or a different maker problem could be on the other side as well

hi, i'm currently experiencing something where i can see a transaction on a mm2-address when using a wallet or an explorer, but for the love of god it does not show up in mm2.
it was done using `-pubkey` to redirect interest to this mm2 address. 

is this something that is known to go wrong?


[12-Sep-20 09:52 AM] 0x03#8822
i should probably add it's a KMD transaction, idk


[12-Sep-20 02:50 PM] CryptoSurfer#5372
@Deleted User kmd for hush. I‚Äôve completed the swap but it takes 4 tries to set, and cancel the swap.


[12-Sep-20 02:50 PM] CryptoSurfer#5372
Very inconvenient


[12-Sep-20 02:52 PM] CryptoSurfer#5372
@Regnar I initiate the swap from the order book , but nothing happens, meaning it opens to a new page but says ‚Äústep 0/3 completed‚Äù and nothing is going. But it took me for times to cancel the order and restart it for it to work.


[12-Sep-20 11:48 PM] jorian#4555

Have problems installing the AtomicDex wallet:

1) On laptop (Linux) - cant figure out the installation process - which commands/downloads are needed to install?

2) On phone (Android) - I have pressed install through the link in the play store, but no app appears on the phone


Anyone has any advice or experience with this?


[16-Sep-20 08:44 AM] Slyris#2880
Hey @FlashyGordy, on Linux You have a `tarball`, in our case `atomicdex-pro-0.2.1-alpha-linux.tar.gz`

You can open a terminal into the download folder and type: `tar -xvf atomicdex-pro-0.2.1-alpha-linux.tar.gz`

Then you will have an AppDir directory : `AntaraAtomicDexAppDir`

with inside: `AppRun`, you can execute it with: `./AppRun`


[16-Sep-20 10:35 AM] FlashyGordy#6939
Okay that is understandable @Slyris 

One question though: how do I get the tarball into the downloads folder?


[16-Sep-20 10:39 AM] FlashyGordy#6939
Ie. - where or how can I download it..?

@Oszy is there another Linux or Android wallet that has Native mode?

no android wallet ever had native mode afaik

there are native komodo wallets, but there is no native support for atomicdex, except the command line version on linux

If it happens that I have placed an order that gets picked up but I don't want to go through the swap, I need to shut down the app to make the swap get timed out. How long will it take for a swap to get timed out and it will be OK for me to open the app again?


[18-Sep-20 04:34 AM] Hember | $ARRR#5341
or is there any other way to stop a swap when it's happening?


[18-Sep-20 04:43 AM] gcharang#6833
> How long will it take for a swap to get timed out and it will be OK for me to open the app again?
depends on the coins involved and their blocktimes


[18-Sep-20 04:43 AM] gcharang#6833
>  or is there any other way to stop a swap when it's happening?
there is no built in/ graceful way to do so


[18-Sep-20 04:49 AM] cipi#4502
swaps are not meant to be stopped once they started... taker will likely loose dexfee payment in such situations, if he already sent it... and depending on what other transactions have already been made (takerpayment, makerpayment), a refund will be necessary for those, which also costs txfees


[18-Sep-20 04:53 AM] cipi#4502
oh, and in case of failed swaps, the nodes are banning each other, which stays till manually cleared or app restarted (both)

Both dai and eth


[19-Sep-20 06:13 AM] gcharang#6833
can you try using mixed case address? you can paste the withdraw address in etherscan to get the mixedcase address. use it in atomicdex

I have not used mixed case addresses before. 
Where will I find it on etherscan after a past withdraw address?


[19-Sep-20 06:21 AM] gcharang#6833
search the normal address on etherscan. the page generated will show you the address in mixed case


[19-Sep-20 06:22 AM] gcharang#6833
the mixed case address looks the same as a normal address, but some of the alphabets are capitals instead of all of them being small


[19-Sep-20 06:22 AM] gcharang#6833
```
  - An explanation on Mixed case vs Lower case address: https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289992-Why-Some-Addresses-Are-Mixed-Case
  - For example, address 0x6eaff3479c17b8e7a0069823dc87bab09fbf4549 is valid, but 0x6eAff3479c17b8e7A0069823DC87bAB09fBf4549 is easier to copy down safely.

[20-Sep-20 04:13 AM] gcharang#6833
@FlashyGordy if you previously used pirate through agama wallet, you should have that directory in your computer.
you can open a terminal `ctrl + alt + t` and type `ls ~/.komodo/PIRATE` and hit `enter` 
if the output has `wallet.dat` , you should be  99% good. you just need to download the latest pirate wallet from https://pirate.black/wallets and sync the chain to access your coins. you can get help regarding pirate wallets from the pirate server https://discord.gg/uYdR2s


[20-Sep-20 04:15 AM] FlashyGordy#6939
@gcharang I have switched computers (lost the old one) and dont have access to the wallet.dat 

Is it possible to restore only from the Agame Seed ?

no, agama seed and the pirate coins have no relation, sorry

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] New comment on issue #129: Scrolling problem in wallet transactions
Tested on android .app Mateus send. Initial scrolling problem is solved by `db5e0db9ea3f1b` (above).
There is one scenario, when tx history still resets:

- scroll down N transaction
- send a new tx [send] -> [withdraw] -> [confirm]
- tx history also resets to latests transaction

Arguably, we can also look into it.

~~I already talked about this on Telegram side, but thought I'd share here, too. I am missing KMD on my atomicdex. I transferred 1000kmd on 23rd and after that I have swapped a bit less than 350kmd. My KMD balance says 22 kmd now.~~ I shut down the app once and then another time and the balance is now correct. No worries.


[24-Sep-20 04:01 PM] Kayaba#5184
That grin code uses very similar tech


[24-Sep-20 04:07 PM] Kayaba#5184
It's effectively the same except for the lack of dl eq proof


[24-Sep-20 04:08 PM] Kayaba#5184
So technically faster as said proof is a bit expensive; takes a second or so to generate and a few kb of space


[24-Sep-20 04:09 PM] Kayaba#5184
But I'd focus on the dl eq proof compat version to ensure compatibility with all these types of coins without multiple flow setups


[24-Sep-20 04:10 PM] Kayaba#5184
It's also possible to generate a proof of "" if you know it's the same crypt system. Just creates a meaningless packet you can if out later.

We only published it when it did work :p That said, this PoC is independent of the paper, which I didn't work on. I've since teamed up with the author's group for the proper implementation of a viable suite, modular and integratable, which is currently in the CCS.

This has probably already been thought of/suggested, but just wanted to mention - a 'top markets' / highest volume leaderboard shown in AtomicDex would help show people where the markets are moving. It currently takes a lot of effort by the user to find active markets being that they have to pick base/rel coins explicitly to look at them.

If someone developing or implementing tools related to decentralized exchange was ever charged with violating securities laws (because people were trading securities tokens using the tool) or financial surveillance laws (if those laws were ever changed to expand their coverage to non-custodial entities) then they may be able to use constitutional law as an affirmative defense. Two promising defenses that we‚Äôve written extensively on are our First Amendment freedom of speech rights and our Fourth Amendment right against warrantless search and seizure.

If a developer is creating and releasing versions of decentralized exchange software to the general public, and if that developer is not also advocating the illegal usage of that software, collecting fees from person‚Äôs use of the software, or maintaining a website through which people might access and use the software, then there is a strong case that this software publishing activity alone is constitutionally protected expression.

That doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean that the government can never regulate that activity. But it does mean that any regulation curtailing the otherwise free expression will face strict scrutiny from the courts, which means that the government will have to prove both that (a) the regulation furthers a compelling state interest, and (b) that no less-speech-restrictive means could achieve that interest. In practice this level of scrutiny forbids the state from passing laws that would ban the publication based on content or viewpoint.

Open-source decentralized exchange software is a particular type of content that advocates a strongly held political viewpoint: that we should be able to engage in payments and transactions free of middlemen and censorship. In practice, strict scrutiny forbids the state from passing laws that create a ‚Äúprior restraint‚Äù on speech, that is to say a ban on speech that is in place before the speech is actually made.


[06-Oct-20 09:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
In other words a punishment for saying something defamatory after the fact is not a prior restraint, but a law that says ‚Äúno one shall be allowed to say anything untrue about the President‚Äôs character‚Äù is a prior restraint. Any law that attempts to ban the publication of decentralized exchange software or make publication illegal without a license or some other precondition would be a prior restraint. In practice, courts always find these forms of regulation to be unconstitutional

[10-Oct-20 10:13 AM] Audo#5667
Here's my personal view.

We can see where this blockchain industry is leading, and there is nothing we can do about it. We can either quit or keep going.

Technology (including blockchain) is a double-edged sword. It can be used for good too. Thus, we keep pushing open source & decentralized technology... or any technological progress in our society... with the full knowledge that it might one day enslave us.

Here's the situation that every crypto investor will face in not too distant future:
 a) Do KYC and keep your money
 b) Cash out before it's too late ‚Äì¬†because your coins will be worthless and tagged as "toxic."

If you don't do KYC, you won't be able to deposit your coins to any exchange, and no one will accept your crypto. Everyone will be checking from Uncle Sam if your coins are marked "toxic" ‚Äì¬†and if they are ‚Äì¬†they are worthless.


[10-Oct-20 10:13 AM] Audo#5667

95% of crypto investors are there for the money, and they all will embrace regulation.

If there are unregulated DEXes, they will have very small volumes. The crypto industry will split in half: the regulated side and the unregulated side. They won't continue to co-exist like they do today.

As the Komodo team/community, we can keep developing a wallet/DEX software or quit. If we want to keep going, it has to follow the regulation. If we don't, then we are always under the threat of a violent arrest and forceful shutdown ... and most people won't be using our DEX anyway because if they do, their coins are marked "toxic" and become worthless.

That's the game we are heading to... full regulation and control.

Then why keep going?


[10-Oct-20 10:13 AM] Audo#5667

Why keep living in this society? Why don't we just run into the woods? I have seriously considered this in my life, but I decided not to because that doesn't change the society. I don't like technology ‚Äì but what can I do ‚Äì it's here, and it's not going away even if I bury my head in the sand.

The same I see for crypto. I don't like it ‚Äì but what else can we do than try to help the 'good' side to prosper.

We have to try to navigate these waters and do the best we can to build a better world and build products that help people. However, in the end, the world is going in a very bad direction.

Who is to blame? Personally, I blame the mindless people who don't give a shit about anything.

@Tylor zkFS 

I can speak on this a little bit.  
What is this mostly about is saying regulatory pressure is going to create a giant verified liquidity layer.  Those exchanges that comply will get to participate in that.  

People that don't comply Will not get the ability to participate.  And exchanges for quote unquote unlicensed money operator and facilitators will likely become major targets for prosecution.


[10-Oct-20 11:54 AM] Jcharming#2693
Other crypto won't be worthless, However by contrast until we find better solutions for privacy and anonymity in exchanging such things It's not going to be easy to find places to trade unverified funds.  
Exchanges will be pressured to choose between unlisting privacy coins or not being allowed into the verified liquidity network.


[10-Oct-20 11:54 AM] Jcharming#2693
Beyond that if exchanges don't join then again the operators facilitators will likely become major targets for prosecution.


[10-Oct-20 11:57 AM] Jcharming#2693
The next step is surely being able to move to pure protocol level things something akin to the way torrenting works.  Where users can remain completely private and anonymous in all aspects, and the tech becomes too pervasive to stop.  
AtomicDEX and underlying Komodo tech may be on this path, but it is not there right now.  The problem is is we have a right now issue, that how we handle it determines if there's going to be a later for the team members here doing the work.

```We can see where this blockchain industry is leading, and there is nothing we can do about it.``` 
The blockchain industry and freedom of humanity as a whole, depends on freedom of exchange.
Blockchain and DEX are the last resorts to protect this values.
And you are the developers who are able to give the people the tools, to protect semself from a totalitarian nightmare.
This tools are in the end just code, and this code don't need a company or real identities.
It only need people who have the will to work on it.
The responsibility for running a DEX should ideally fully transfered to the user, and devs concentrate to improve this tools/code.

```We can either quit or keep going.```
If a DEX is doing KYC, then for nearly all users, there is no reason why they should not use a much faster CEX instead.
With implementing KYC, you already decide to quit by yourself.

```Technology (including blockchain) is a double-edged sword. It can be used for good too. Thus, we keep pushing open source & decentralized technology... or any technological progress in our society... with the full knowledge that it might one day enslave us.```
Technology is neutral yes, but it need sometimes people with values, to build solutions (bitcoin, bisq, blockdx) to combat a direction into enslavement.

```Here's the situation that every crypto investor will face in not too distant future:
 a) Do KYC and keep your money
 b) Cash out before it's too late ‚Äì¬†because your coins will be worthless and tagged as "toxic."```
a) If you do KYC, you will get robbed with taxes more and more and in the end, completely enslaved.
b) Even if your coins will be tagged as toxic, they will not become worthless. 

```If you don't do KYC, you won't be able to deposit your coins to any exchange, and no one will accept your crypto. Everyone will be checking from Uncle Sam if your coins are marked "toxic" ‚Äì¬†and if they are ‚Äì¬†they are worthless.```
This coins will still have a value in the uncontrollable market.
Monero will still have value.
It is only the decision of each individual, if he goes to the controlled market or the free uncontrolled market, without listening to the authority who decide what is toxic.

You see, it's a decision everyone have to make by his own.

I see, uniswap has high volume and Monero high Mcap.

```The crypto industry will split in half: the regulated side and the unregulated side. They won't continue to co-exist like they do today.```
For this split I am hoping for a long time. Then for everyone it will be clear, to choose on which side he stays.
And people can clearly see, what projects are really decentralized (uncontrollable) and fighting for it's values, and give a shit to regulations.

```As the Komodo team/community, we can keep developing a wallet/DEX software or quit. If we want to keep going, it has to follow the regulation.```
Everyone can still share and add code to open source code and keep going.
Just don't run any services that makes you to a target.

```If we don't, then we are always under the threat of a violent arrest and forceful shutdown ...```
Putting code into the internet, can be done anonym and can't be easily shuted down if done right (zeronet).

```and most people won't be using our DEX anyway because if they do, their coins are marked "toxic" and become worthless.```
That's only your own thinking.

I like technology and crypto.
It gives us the chance of more freedom or more enslavement.
If you compliance and say you are happy about following the authority, you are not helping the good side.
"Happy slaves are the bitterest enemies of freedom"
- Marie von Ebner-Eschenbach

```We have to try to navigate these waters and do the best we can to build a better world and build products that help people.```
A proud defeat is also a victory, you just have to draw the right conclusions from it.
And that's not compliance and giving up his values.
People will lose trust into you.
You maybe need to change a bit the direction, but you should not change the goal.

```However, in the end, the world is going in a very bad direction.```
The world is going in a very good direction, thanks to crypto and the dev fighters of freedom, who are developing the tools to freeing people - be part of it.

```Who is to blame? Personally, I blame the mindless people who don't give a shit about anything.```
Only here I agree with you, but it should not be a reason to give up, also in its own interest.

the plan was to discover what this exactly means and what we can do ‚Äì but the discussion started because it's open source code and anyone can see what we are exploring/coding.

I meant that, it should have been discussed before the code was there.

the project has been forked without the controversial changes.  same result, discussion before or after.  it is a lose:lose situation.

"if the devs feel unsafe, they can pack up and move along & we find anon devs" is the same view as the "we need regulations" from the opposite side.


[11-Oct-20 09:57 PM] Mylo#8306

[11-Oct-20 10:03 PM] Mylo#8306
well i'm in the "f*ck the blowback" side of the argument, devs of this calibre are not so easy to find.  ship the product, extend the reach of the tech, make new business opportunities, move onto next product development.

the forks can co-exist in a collaborative manner.  a settings layer may be created and integrated, but it's not the primary goal to ship the product AND maintain the momentum & members of the team working on it.


[11-Oct-20 10:04 PM] Mylo#8306
this is not an absolute, it's moving with the market as an open source team & product.

90min have now passed and no funds to be seen. A closer look shows that the txid can't be found in the explorer. I rechecked the receiver address that was given by the app and it shows the same as the komodo receiver address. Shouldn't they be different?

Where do I go for support regarding a failed swap that never returned my funds.   Please help


[19-Oct-20 09:48 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Depending on how long ago it could take some time for the timelock to release the funds back - BTC is longer...let me see if I can find a chart @omydog


[19-Oct-20 09:51 AM] Tylor zkFS#8280
Bitcoin has long 10 minute block times, the lock time must be longer, too. In most cases, the lock time for Maker Payment is 15,600 seconds, which is 4 hours and 20 minutes.
If the time lock expires before the atomic swap is complete, then Maker receives the Maker Payment back.


[19-Oct-20 09:55 AM] Jcharming#2693
@omydog can you post a link to the transaction ID that was the failed swap? 
Or can you say when you made the swap that failed?

[19-Oct-20 10:05 AM] cipi#4502
don't know how the mobile app shows swap that are in "refund mode"... maybe they are showed as failed... but the seed nodes don't have any infos about this swap uuid, so nobody sent infos to them, which happens when swap reaches "Finished" state (which can be after Refund)


[19-Oct-20 10:08 AM] omydog#8014
@cipi no refund yet but I can give u an update in a few hours.  If you would like a screenshot also let me know


[19-Oct-20 10:12 AM] cipi#4502
no need for screenshot, i will just wait till the swap info reaches the seed nodes to see what went wrong


[19-Oct-20 01:31 PM] cipi#4502
@omydog looks like the maker dropped out in the middle of the swap and hasn't spent TakerPayment sent by you, so swap failed and TakerPayment was returned to you: https://mcl.explorer.dexstats.info/tx/fcba251dd8fd169cf0421a6aa138cd39dedd45ea9795fa079198a5e6c7209140
took a long time as of explorer, almost 10h: https://mcl.explorer.dexstats.info/address/bJoXfSmYhRAmZv6J9KpXUcrEaRFA2B7rDW (first tx is your TakerPayment, the second one the refund to the same address where the funds came from)

[20-Oct-20 07:01 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
i think its not reading the 'open" coin file incorrectly because it doesnt show up in openable coins -- so part of the system thinks its open but doesn't display


[20-Oct-20 07:03 PM] Tylor zkFS#8280
maybe if no connection to spv server then it doesnt pop up or show the error or retry

From my point of view, all selling orders above 48.90 MCL/KMD should be matched automatically, cause the buyer had already accepted to pay more than sellers demanded.

Use a Legacy adress format for withdrawing coins @omydog

@omydog what the address did u used to withdraw? And for which coin? DEX right?


[26-Oct-20 06:33 AM] omydog#8014
On the atomicdex mobile I tried withdrawing bch and usdc I think I figured out the bch part of, I have to convert the cash address to legacy but I‚Äôm still unsure about the usdc not having a valid address to withdraw 2 @sergey.boyko0791


[26-Oct-20 06:40 AM] sergey.boyko0791#8143
Try to use an address with the prefix "0x" for usdc
e.g. _0x657980d55733B41c0C64c06003864e1aAD917Ca7_


[26-Oct-20 07:08 AM] Oszy#5734
for USDC it's the matter of mixed case address usage. look up your address on etherscan and paste it to atomicdex from there.


[26-Oct-20 07:10 AM] Oszy#5734
so if the address you have is something like `0xf37644e390e63b59f.....` look it up on etherscan.io and it will show you the correct address format like  `0xf37644E390E63b59FD5D2eC213dea8b78A12Cf39`

So what is the Geo Blocking going to be like for USA users?  I am assuming we will be able to update to v0.3, but the swap functionality will be blocked somehow?

i just probably wont use it at all, but I am just curious what the user experience will be like.  Will we be able to update to v0.3 at all or will some messaging be in the app if a swap is attempted?


[29-Oct-20 12:30 PM] Jcharming#2693
Hey @StoeTubby 
> Note: The following jurisdictions are currently geoblocked while we find a regulatory solution: United States of America, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, Singapore, Sudan, Austria, Iran.
It's just the DEX tab that is effected.  Non-custodial wallet is still available to these regions as well as the update. 
If you want to use the DEX from one of the affected regions don't forget about VPN's üôÉ

When you hover over it there is a little tooltip dialog that says unavailable in your region.  This is just how it is currently though seeing if we can set it up so that the swap option is just grayed out and then the charts can still be used and order books viewed and things like that.

Yes to both

It's a Decentralized Exchange - no custody of client funds.  What sort of compliance are you talking about?


[09-Nov-20 09:37 PM] gcharang#6833
see: https://komodoplatform.com/standby-the-regulation-is-coming/
```
4. I thought AtomicDEX was a peer to peer solution and non-custodial, so why would we worry about regulations and why are these changes necessary?

AtomicDEX is and remains a non-custodial decentralized exchange solution; however, its protocol process could be viewed as acting as a facilitator service enabling users to find and trade with others in an unregulated fashion. 

Although there is no central server connecting the actual trading partners, services, and nodes that handle trades require compliance. The exchange system, platform, or whichever party supports these activities is legally liable.

@Deleted User you seem to have some sort of confusion. most important one is believing that there is some infinite budget to throw around on dubious spendings. that being said, if there is a cash neutral way to spend funds that raises awareness, i am sure it will be done.

calculate the revenues per visitor


[16-Nov-20 10:49 PM] jl777c#5810
if they are comparable, then it can be done


[16-Nov-20 10:50 PM] jl777c#5810
note: currently we are not getting any revenues from any visitors as we are not selling any products. even if they decide to buy a bunch of KMD, they are buying it from the open market and that doesnt return the money spent on the advertising


[16-Nov-20 10:51 PM] jl777c#5810
that means the revenues per visitor can be very accurately estimated to be ZERO.


[16-Nov-20 10:51 PM] jl777c#5810
which means the cost per visitor also must remain close to ZERO


[16-Nov-20 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
if you do not understand this, you will continue to have these strange ideas that hundreds of thousands of dollars can simply be spent on advertising and that it makes some sort of sense


[16-Nov-20 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
it doesnt


[16-Nov-20 10:52 PM] jl777c#5810
until we can get actual revenues per visitor, we are constrained to getting mentions that dont cost money. that is the prudent thing to do in order to conserve funds for years of development


[16-Nov-20 10:58 PM] jl777c#5810
until you can show positive revenues from paid placements, you are basically saying that ZERO is bigger than $20000, which is a nonsense


[16-Nov-20 11:01 PM] jl777c#5810
we plan to be around 5 years from now, 10 years from now, 20 years from now, ... 
so we need to operate in a way consistent with that and not be in a blind panic to spend all funds on short term advertising for fear of missing out on whatever you fear we will be missing out on.

also, even if we panicked and spent millions on paid placements, there is no assurance it would do anything to the KMD price, which seems to be the only thing you care about. i suspect there would be a good chance of no measurable price increase, but the million dollars would be forever gone

every post related to scammy CEXes, high withdraw fees, 51% attacks and so on, can be used to place a comment related to AtomicDEX/KMD
some people are directly asking like "isn't there a DEX where i can trade?"... most of them don't get an answer... this are wasted opportunities

Want to retrieve hush coins stored in aDex android?


[20-Nov-20 12:29 PM] phm87#7395
I heard that an old version of android aDex with hush enabled was still present. Another solution would be to use atomicdex-api and add hush coin in config file. It may not work because all hush electrum were disabled. For all solutions, your seed is the key to get back your coins. In few days, hush should have a mandatory z2z hardfork so the distination address should be a zaddress

@mickycushi ^
your best bet is to speak to the hush community and figure out which wallets are supported

[21-Nov-20 01:01 PM] tolken#2655
From what I understand, the CEX aggregate price feeds in Atomdex are from BAND now. Is that price integrated at the mm2 level or higher up in the various GUI implantations? Is it publicly accessible to query right now for those using MM2 and would like to use them?


[22-Nov-20 04:08 AM] Slyris#2880
It's only in the desktop GUI implementation @tolken atm


[22-Nov-20 12:27 PM] tolken#2655
@Slyris thanks. Hopefully this will be exposed to other users in the near future.

Bonjour, je voudrais envoyer du Zcash de mon wallet atomic dex mobile vers ma cl√© Ledger est impossible d'envoyer ou m√™me d'√©changer en swap rien ne fonctionne pour ma part. Pouvez vous m'aider car j'aimerais r√©cup√©rer mes fonds. Merci.

Hello! ZCash changed consensus branch ( https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/commit/f22860c59c874066ef91b4dd425e31f9ba9da99f ) there are multiple solution of your problem now:
a) wait for the next AtomicDEX release with coins file updated (this-next week)
b) manually add this change to your local version of `coins` file (in GUI folder `assets\tools\mm2\coins` )
c) use your seed in Verus Desktop to send out funds (https://verus.io/wallet)

Some people might see KYC functionality as a bad thing, but it is also a requirement for any trust based system with communities. Anyway.. 

I want to start a brainstorming issue. But I need to tell about problem area first and then opportunities.

As you know, Credit loops on Marmara are planned to work in 2 different protocols. The credits in Protocol 1 are fully collateralized and works very well for nearly one year. We are thankful to @jl777c, @dimxy and great team of Komodo to help us realize this to happen. 

For protocol 2, the credits will be under collateralized and even zero collateralized until maturity date. Protocol 2 credits are planned to work same as post-dated cheques which are simply money creation by people. But they need cheque books to be given by banks otherwise can only use simple promissory notes. Since cheque books are used to create money, banks do not give those to everyone and each slip in a cheque book means a blockage amount worth of nearly 400 USD.


[24-Nov-20 10:00 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Actually protocol 2 credits are money creation similar to banking credits. However bank credits bear interest and cannot be endorsed by people and transferred to others as in post-dated cheques by people where they simply create any amount of money, in any currency by issuing with a future date on the cheque. Since banks cannot redeem until maturity date, those cheques are just endorsed and transferred to other people for an exchange of goods and services. They simply work as analog blockchain but based on TRUST. The best thing about those instruments is that they ONLY work within real economy.

To make it short. We are preparing ourselves for protocol 2 now and we need escrows to help solve non-redemption problem during settlement most of which will be manual or semi-automated. We need escrows/communities having crypto exchange functionalities embedded with credit loop approvals according to protocol 2.

Those escrows are required to setup investment pools and have some collateralization to become escrows on Marmara blockchain. Issuance of a credit under Protocol 2 will be done by approval of escrow and all needed procedures such as the manual work of collateralizations over physical assets from issuer, KYC, Manuel settlements and dispute resolution are left to escrow which later get rewards from Marmara blockchain similar to Komodo notarization system with enhanced functionalities during credit approval and settlement. 

We are honored to host non-KYC version of AtomicDEX. If possible, we also need a a trust based Version of AtomicDEX with embedded functionalities for approval of credits by escrow points which will make accomplish required procedures around the communities. I check in the market now there are some projects claiming to setup a crypto exchange easily within hours. There are also some open source crypto exchange projects.


[24-Nov-20 10:00 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
I feel that that kind of AtomicDEX version might have flexibility to be adopted by any community. Now we want to setup those escrows for protocol 2 in at least 80 different locations each in a different city. I have consulted @ca333 about the issue and I am happy that he has a positive answer. Can we have such alternative? We have counted the number of crypto exchanges now in Turkey alone and found out that there are more than a dozen and I know many startup which like to establish a crypto exchange. I think AtomicDEX can be a good alternative for this purpose.

@gcharang  weird, for what its worth, uninstalled/reinstalled, no change. WOrks fine on iPhone, but not on iPad. I‚Äôm guessing this is an iPad specific issue, not an isolated case. Can someone else try this? Using IOS 13.6 on IPad


[03-Dec-20 10:48 AM] tolken#2655
Can you submit/specify a manual price (rather than selecting an existing price in orderbooks) ?


[03-Dec-20 12:06 PM] Deleted User#0000
@tolken you can on the desktop app


[03-Dec-20 01:28 PM] tolken#2655
Thanks @Deleted User  - I figured you could. I guess I‚Äôm trying to see if the team can answer/address why the mobile version can or cant.  I assume the mobile GUI will get a major revision to bring it closer to desktop in the coming months? I find it a very odd UI limitation, but I know still early days. Then again this is considered Beta, so I‚Äôd think something as fundamental as that would be on the short list.


[03-Dec-20 01:52 PM] Deleted User#0000
@tolken mobile is for easy market buy/sells, desktop more control i think


[03-Dec-20 04:34 PM] tolken#2655
Yeah, needs to be revamped though - its a great proof of concept, but showing its age (I know it isn‚Äôt that old) Being able to just set a market price would make a lot of sense. I‚Äôd also recommend some default pairs based on various criteria such as volume, depth etc. For example, KMD is a relatively high volume/depth coin.. So by default, you would see DEX/KMD, not KMD/DEX. You would see KMD/BTC, not BTC/KMD by default, etc. A top ‚Äòmarkets‚Äô that lists these out, categorized/organized like this would be much more user friendly than explicitly selecting the pairs every time and having to invert the price to a denomination you‚Äôre familiar with.

Hi there! No, you cant set order price directly at the moment, but you can specify amount to receive manually. Please try to press 'Click to create an order' link below the existing orders list.

[04-Dec-20 08:55 AM] yurii-khi#7301
`buy` if you're selecting existing order, and `setprice` if creating maker order.

If it is region blocked through googleplay or iOS it's not within our control at this time.  It is Google and Apple imposing region restrictions on us as fintech software according to new rules that have come out during the 2nd half of 2020

Update not available in google play store accessing from AT. Cant even access the old app any more, goes directly to the update button. Needs to be fixed asap!

[12-Dec-20 02:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
for pub address: go to any coin, and click receive


[12-Dec-20 02:45 AM] Cryptoon#3362
then you will see your address


[12-Dec-20 02:46 AM] Cryptoon#3362
for privkey,  go to settings,  scroll down, `view seed`

hello


[12-Dec-20 03:11 AM] Dantemonion#1010
my swap got stuck i guess


[12-Dec-20 03:12 AM] Dantemonion#1010
at maker's payment validatiom


[12-Dec-20 03:33 AM] gcharang#6833
if maker payment doesn't validate in time, the swap will fail and your coijs will be freed up


[12-Dec-20 03:35 AM] Dantemonion#1010
taker payment sent


[12-Dec-20 03:35 AM] Dantemonion#1010
now 19m at takerpaymentspent


[12-Dec-20 03:35 AM] Dantemonion#1010
i'll fail anyway?


[12-Dec-20 03:36 AM] gcharang#6833
if takerpaymentspent happened, it won't fail


[12-Dec-20 03:36 AM] gcharang#6833
maker's payment happens first, then takerpayment, then takerpayment spent then maker payment spent


[12-Dec-20 03:38 AM] Dantemonion#1010

right now, there is no other way than to  "clerar cache" and if that doesn't help, reinstall the app. we are going to provide a "clear logs" cutton inside the app in future versionbs

The stress test seems to be a succes from what i gather, thats nice! What i am curious about: did you guys pay fee during the test?


[13-Dec-20 01:25 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
In the fee adress there was little movement (which is totally fine by the way!), i am just wondering if paying a fee can be shut off manually if that is a risk as a DEX asset holder for the future


[13-Dec-20 01:28 AM] gcharang#6833
the stresstest coins are rick and morty. the fee paid in them is worthless. the fee in dex address is not directly related to the test


[13-Dec-20 01:30 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
I thought the fee for using the dex protocol was always in Kmd and added to the dex address?


[13-Dec-20 01:31 AM] GoeieDagSchotel#0222
Or is the fee converted to kmd and b/c value of stress test coins is 0, 0 fee in kmd was added to the adres?


[13-Dec-20 01:32 AM] gcharang#6833
this


[13-Dec-20 01:32 AM] gcharang#6833
which ever the taker coin is, the dex fee is paid in it

Are there vunerabilites in using older version since Access to update doesn't work (locality issue I guess)?


[13-Dec-20 12:21 PM] cipi#4502
only problem is that older versions run on a different netid, means you won't be able to do swaps with them since almost everybody switched to the new version, but you have access to the funds


[13-Dec-20 12:22 PM] watchingthis2#8747

the 'Swap in Progress' triggers even when no swap is being made


[13-Dec-20 02:13 PM] cipi#4502
that sounds like there was an maker order open that was taken by a taker
you either placed a maker order or a taker order you have initiated hasn't matched and was automatically turned into a maker order

not sure why the app is restricted in certain locations when similar apps are allowed like atomicwallet, not a dex but allows you to exchange using service like changelly


[14-Dec-20 02:20 PM] cipi#4502
has somebody tried to get the app through Aurora Store? the store could even spoof your location, but i can't find AtomicDEX and i am not in a restricted country... so maybe there is another reason, like being in the beta section on Google or something

After the stress test, my RICK and MORTY In AtomicDex won‚Äôt refresh completely. Says all of the last tx‚Äôs are unconfirmed, but they a actually have about a thousand confirmations at this point. I tried removing Rick, then re-added, but no luck. I assume you‚Äôre querying using piginated data, sothe quantity of txs should be too big of a burden?

a true DEX is freedom.   Google hates freedom.  I can't get the phone app unless I change my country and you can only change your country once a year.

I'm pretty sure you can create a new gmail account and have that be the new country while keeping your other email current country

or you could buy a burner phone and use that for the dex with prepaid minutes and use a fresh email to login to playstore

So.....since my log file was over 25gb and I've just been upgrading AtomicDEX instead of fresh installs I've decided to delete the data / wallet  & app then reinstall fresh. All back up and running but won't let me add any new coins / tokens, just get a spinning disk with 'connecting' tried individual coins, tried VPN. Could it be related to the prices not updating from $0 ?¬ø

Adding vrsc anew doesnt work


[17-Dec-20 06:33 AM] 0x03#8822
1) i just checked all services, and they are running fine (and in fact it does on my 'test mobile')
2) guesses are it's because i do support ipv6 (and return both v4 and v6 addresses in dns) and then the client can't do v6 but tries anyways and obviously fails
3) sorry, disabling ipv6 is not an option


[17-Dec-20 06:34 AM] TonyL#3577
@Cryptoon could you please share app log in DM? are other coins adding/removing fine?


[17-Dec-20 06:34 AM] 0x03#8822
btw i do not have native ipv6 and my mobile correctly activates verus nevertheless

Dear beta testers, there is a problem with coins activation atm the moment in mobile GUI (caused by unexpected coingecko API response format change). Please wait for a version with hotfix and sorry for any inconvenience it might cause üôÇ

latest build also fixes vrsc


[18-Dec-20 04:42 AM] 0x03#8822
what was the fix if i may ask


[18-Dec-20 04:43 AM] gcharang#6833
not sure if it was specific to vrsc. but, the general issue was that: coingecko changed their API response format and enabling coins errored because of that


[18-Dec-20 04:43 AM] 0x03#8822
ok, that is miles away from my guess

@Cryptoon i don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs likely, as the upgrade to 2.1 required a deliberate netid change.

Ok atomicDex app I use my phrase to log in. But how do I get any private key or recover in case?


[21-Dec-20 02:08 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Settings view seed I believe


[21-Dec-20 03:26 PM] icantgiveyou#2384
@Cryptoon well I know my seed, I had agama before , now using this. But there is also bitcoin wallet and I don‚Äôt know how thats gonna work , bcs I don‚Äôt have anything for that BTC wallet. No key, no recovery words nothing for that BTC address


[21-Dec-20 07:31 PM] gcharang#6833
the same seed words produce the private keys for all the coins. including BTC
the privatekey viewing feature is available in cli for now, not yet in guis
for now, you can use verus desktop wallet to export privkeys for any coin


[21-Dec-20 11:00 PM] dondada#8777
in the ussa and i cant update my AD through google can someone help?


[22-Dec-20 04:23 AM] gcharang#6833 (pinned)
if you are comfortable with cli, you can use the mm2 binary to get the priv keys
download and extract https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/releases/download/beta-2.1.2857/mm2-c6cf54af6-Darwin-Release.zip
open a terminal and cd into the extracted folder. For example:
```
cd ~/Downloads/mm2-c6cf54af6-Darwin-Release
```
then, run the following comamnds
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/master/coins
./mm2 "{\"netid\":9999,\"gui\":\"cli\",\"passphrase\":\"SEED_WORDS_PLEASE_REPLACE\",\"rpc_password\":\"RPC_PASS_PLEASE_REPLACE\"}"
```
in the last command, replace `SEED_WORDS_PLEASE_REPLACE` with your seed words and `RPC_PASS_PLEASE_REPLACE` with any string that can be a password and remember this string. 

Enable the coin you need (KMD):
```
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"REPLACE_WITH_RPC_PASS\",\"method\":\"electrum\",\"coin\":\"KMD\",\"servers\":[{\"url\":\"electrum1.cipig.net:10001\"},{\"url\":\"electrum2.cipig.net:10001\"}]}"
```
BTC:
```
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"REPLACE_WITH_RPC_PASS\",\"method\":\"electrum\",\"coin\":\"BTC\",\"servers\":[{\"url\":\"electrum1.cipig.net:10000\"},{\"url\":\"electrum2.cipig.net:10000\"}]}"
```

to enable any other coin, change the coin name and find their electrum server urls from here: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins/tree/master/electrums

to get privkey:
```
curl --url "http://127.0.0.1:7783" --data "{\"userpass\":\"REPLACE_WITH_RPC_PASS\",\"method\":\"show_priv_key\",\"coin\":\"BTC\"}"
```

if you participated in the stress test, the size could be due to the log files. you can try to backup your seed words and reinstall the app

@joshuamayu actually just checked chromeOS which is still linux, so you might try desktop app  atomicdex-desktop-0.3.1-beta-linux.zip from here https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/releases
but we never tested for it, so the chances are slim, but worth a try

atomic dex was forked off of github by an llc called "power block". I have a hunch that they may be running an atomic dex stateside in the near future, but it's just speculation on my part.

having issues with atomicdex on iphone. several times I lost KMD during swaps, and it was never returned...I let it goat first, but now trying to figure out why this happens and see if I can reverse this?


[05-Jan-21 10:52 AM] ecbuddy#8524
also, when I make orders, they seem to go through and the clock ticks, but as soon as I move off the screen the orders disapear and aren't active anymore. very frustrating

Just thought of a feature request - it would be good if you can convert dust into KMD... I have lots of small amounts of different coins on my atomicdex wallet.

converting for KMD would make it a good feature for atomicdex and its a built in demand for KMD

@mo7881 as long as fees don‚Äôt exceed the dust amounts, that could be cool.


[06-Jan-21 06:23 PM] blahblah#4980
I swapped KMD for VERUS today. A couple observations:
1) it felt expensive, I think this is because not enough people using it, but it could cause a barrier to getting more people to use it.
2) the audio during swap is really bad, needs to go away
3) there‚Äôs still so much happening, I feel it needs more design ‚Äúdon‚Äôt make me think‚Äù applied
4) awesome product, truly.
5) it‚Äôs not always clear which is the best ‚Äúdeal‚Äù to take when selecting a coin, have to click every time to see what premium is. Related to item 1 and 4.
6) I wanted VERUS, but it was a bit frustrating trying to see what coin was beat to deposit in the wallet to give me the best exchange or liquidity.. maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter.. but I was left unsatisfied here. If I want VERUS I thought it wouldn‚Äôt matter what coin I swapped for it but it looks like there are preferred pairs, and it‚Äôs not easy to see what those are. Not sure what the solution is, just sharing what I felt from a new user using it for real (I tested in both recent tests but this was first real use)

I think the expensive feel goes away once you consider that there are no withdrawal fees. I agree that it can seem counterintuitive compared to the typical cex gui's. But it doesn't work the same way as off-chain exchanges, so to make the interface the same would require an additional layer of complexity that could hurt the utility that becomes apparent once you get used to the format. I would be really interested to hear some comparisons to uniswap. I have only dabbled in it and have been reluctant to burn the eth to really dive in.


[06-Jan-21 07:34 PM] blahblah#4980
Good point about withdrawal. That is what I would call a proof point for the AtomixDex value proposition and it needs to be called out more prominently IMO. That‚Äôs something that pulls people in. I‚Äôll have to try UniSwap to see some other experiences.

@Komodefi I have mentioned this a few times, but mobile needs a refresh, it can be much more CEX like, the desktop is an example of that. Secondly - and i want to stress emphasize this suggestion very strongly: There should be default base/rel prioritization. There should be a ‚Äòmarkets‚Äô list like on virtually all exchanges. KMD, BTC, ETH, etc.... Having a user select BTC for base, and ETH for rel, is very confusing for most users. It should be a power-user feature to manually select base/rel. With this default market list, you wouldn‚Äôt ever encounter ‚ÄúBTC/LTC‚Äù but you would see a ‚ÄúLTC/BTC‚Äù. You wouldn‚Äôt see a ‚ÄúKMD/REVS‚Äù but you would see a ‚ÄúREVS/KMD‚Äù

Everything about the general parameters is very well explained.
The procedure of how to set up and achieve a successful atomic swap is the questionable part :-)

Setup atomicdex in CLI on 2 servers, and ad the proposed coin o the coins file on both. Activate the proposed coin on both, then initiate a swap.

hello all, I came a few days ago with an issue about atomic dex...
Its happened again.


[13-Jan-21 09:33 AM] ecbuddy#8524
Initiate swaps, and then move back to another page on the app and the orders disappear.
No big deal I guess, but now my KMD is disappearing with the order that I placed and NO order is listed on order page and KMD is removed from my wallet.


[13-Jan-21 09:34 AM] ecbuddy#8524
I messaged @gcharang but he must be away from the pc or very busy since he hasnt replied to me in 2 days. 
Anyone else know how I can retrieve coins from failed swaps on atomic dex?

Hello everyone. Today I tested AtomicDex and I like it, I even places orders for RICK and MORY tokens. Some observations - after clicking sound in Settings, I can't turned it off. Tried multiple times, it says from time to time "Make your order placed" and it's really annoying, I scrolled and didn't see it anyone reported this (I'm on android phone)


[14-Jan-21 01:40 PM] Andrii#1591
Even if the AtomicDEX app is not active - this sound still keeps saying "Make your order placed" from time to time, until you close it


[14-Jan-21 01:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah it needs to have a sound to keep it active on background


[14-Jan-21 01:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
In settings you can change the sound to a sound that is nothing


[14-Jan-21 01:40 PM] Cryptoon#3362
I think there is an empty mp3 file on github


[14-Jan-21 01:41 PM] Cryptoon#3362
For the time being its the workaround but I believe in the final version it will be removed


[14-Jan-21 01:44 PM] Andrii#1591
Yes, it's just this is not user-friendly) some people might not like it, that the only way to avoid sound is such complicated. If it's the only way, I'm sure it will be removed. For me it's easier just to close app and then open again if I need it


[14-Jan-21 01:45 PM] Andrii#1591
And do you know what about staking, is it happening automatically on AtomicDEX or this will be added as a separate feature?


[14-Jan-21 01:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Of KMD?


[14-Jan-21 01:47 PM] Cryptoon#3362
If you hold more than 10kmd for over an hour in your wallet you will see a button to claim your rewards!


[14-Jan-21 01:49 PM] Andrii#1591
Thanks


[14-Jan-21 01:50 PM] Andrii#1591
One more small thing. I activated biometrics, and when I close the app, it's also asking to confirm it. I think it's not necessary when you close the app, and probably haven't seen it. So maybe it might be also changed


[14-Jan-21 01:58 PM] Cryptoon#3362
Hmm weird, doesnt do that on ios, maybe android specific? Someone from the team should look into that one


[15-Jan-21 01:37 PM] ejuliano#8606
if you close the app itself while you have a swap order placed or ongoing it won't work.  As long as the app is running in the background it will keep swap lines open

depends on what you consider superior. I'd consider ocean superior in wallet terms. but most users don't want to download the whole blockchain and atomicdex has trading as well.

{Reactions}
üëÄ 

[22-Jan-21 04:53 PM] smkhound#7640
Dex fee is 1/777 of swap value (for maker), then you have transaction fees set by BTC network. An atomic swap involves more than one transaction, so when network fees are high this accumulates. Generaly best not to swap low values of BTC or during times of high network fee.

[27-Jan-21 02:08 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Currently it has geoblock for certain jurisdictions that will be eventually removed.  They were added as a safeguard while we seek some clarifications from lawyers regarding Atomicdex.   So far it seems it was an overreaction but better safe than sorry once we get the green light it will be removed,  a lot of far reaching , strict and vague regs coming out or hinted at .

They have already two electrum servers running.

Hello, I am unable to update my AtomicDex app, when I open it says "you are using version 0.2.19, new version available: 0.3.1" Then when i click Update at the bottom of the screen, it takes me to Google Play and endlessly loads. It doesn't ever get past this point. When I manually search for atomic dex on the google play store, nothing comes up. Can anyone help with this?

Guys what must be done in order to see more coins in the mobile version ? 
I mean there are already some coins in desktop adex that cannot be found in the mobile version.


[14-Feb-21 09:38 PM] lightspeed393#5403
not all coins from desktop version are listed on the mobile version


[14-Feb-21 09:38 PM] CryptoQueen#8313
(the liquidity is different in each is version? For example desktop has other liquidity and, ios and android mobile other as well?)


[14-Feb-21 09:39 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I don't think so, but I haven't used mobile in a bit so I could be wrong.


[14-Feb-21 09:42 PM] CryptoQueen#8313
This question came from the fact that for example you can find coin A, coin B and coin C in Desktop....

A and B are in mobile as well but C is not....

So if somebody wished to sell A to gain C, can do that in Desktop but not in the mobile app ?


[14-Feb-21 09:46 PM] lightspeed393#5403
yes it's possible. any coin can be swapped to any other coin via the protocol. mobile just might not have the coin available to use.

I can't update. It's geo-blocked again so I can't do anything in the app which is really annoying because I want to at least be able to move my funds to a new wallet. It just prompts for an update and sends you to google play where it loads forever. It worked for a couple days a couple weeks ago and now it doesn't.

I have atomicDeFi app installed on my Android phone, I installed it (or was it atomicDEX) some time ago. When I open it there is an in-app notification that an update is available. But I can no longer find the app on the Play Store in my list of installed apps.


[21-Feb-21 09:50 AM] Aquila#3547
I don't understand the circumstances under which I have an app installed but it isn't listed in the app store where I installed it from. Was it somehow delisted but they didn't remove it from my phone? and now it wants to install an update from some third party location? or what

even with geoblock you can still use the wallet functions to access your funds, just not the dex functions.

It had been 2 hours since my swap started, i was keeping the application open on the screen. Since 2 hours have passed, I had to use my phone and I quit the application. Now my swap stopped, and my balance is not the same, my coins are gone but I didn't receive any coin from the swap. What should I do?


[21-Feb-21 02:00 PM] Sir Seven#7158
@belartoza After you restart app, it will attempt to initiate unfinished swaps. If swap actually failed for any reason, you shall see a button to claim back your funds after timeout.


[21-Feb-21 02:02 PM] belartoza#5162
It had been already 2.5 hours, when will I be able to take my funds back? I will not lose them right?


[21-Feb-21 02:10 PM] Sir Seven#7158
If you find any troubles reclaiming your funds in a few more hours, contact @gcharang and DM him your logs from application. He will provide you with further instruction.
Don't worry, you will at most loose tx_fees.

The app doesn't let me dismiss the upgrade modal, mine is probably very out of date. The only option is to click to upgrade which takes me to the play store but that just hangs with the loading spinner. But I do have the seed which I can use in another wallet app as mentioned

for now, the best path for you is to use your seed words to restore the wallet on AtomicDEX desktop to access your coins. You can use the mobile version again once the geoblock has been removed

Hi guys I don‚Äôt remember setting up a password for atomic DEX mobile. However when I go to check my seed it asks for a password... ? Any advice?


[25-Feb-21 07:14 AM] infotech-al#5583
I don‚Äôt want to start adding more coins if I can‚Äôt get the seed phrase!


[25-Feb-21 07:14 AM] infotech-al#5583
Please advise


[25-Feb-21 07:59 AM] gcharang#6833
if the txn fees are not too high, maybe move the coins out first?

afaik, there was always a requirement to set password when creating/restoring a wallet.


[25-Feb-21 08:37 AM] PTYX#6840
the password is setup during the creation of the wallet to protect the seed in case you need to export it


[25-Feb-21 08:46 AM] infotech-al#5583
Hmm will have to keep trying or move the coins and redownload


[25-Feb-21 08:46 AM] infotech-al#5583
Thnx @gcharang @PTYX


[25-Feb-21 09:05 AM] PTYX#6840
If you can't find the password it's better if you move them to a temporary address, create a new seed and then move them to the new seed addresses


[25-Feb-21 09:05 AM] PTYX#6840
It's better not to use a wallet to which you don't have a seed backup

question about restoring a wallet from the desktop application. i have a mobile wallet (although geoblocked for now) so i downloaded desktop today and selected "recover wallet". it says wallet name required but i dont remember my wallet name.

is it poss to recover the wallet without the name by just using the seed and pswd?


[27-Feb-21 06:19 AM] rionnox#3470
From memory I believe you can put any name down as long as seed and password correct

if i just put the seed from my mobile wallet in after selecting  "recover wallet" the confirm button doesnt work


[27-Feb-21 06:42 AM] c2k#6034
that seed is only 12 words and not the 24 words when generating a new seed. not sure if thats the issue or not


[27-Feb-21 06:57 AM] Oszy#5734
tick "allow custom seed"


[27-Feb-21 07:04 AM] c2k#6034
tried just with my mobile wallet seed.  unfortunately the confirm button still doesnt work

also wont work if i try custom seed with my mobile pswd (which isnt 16characers long)


[27-Feb-21 07:04 AM] c2k#6034
maybe i just need to wait for mobile to un-geolock

Good morning, I am trying to am trying to get my csv to report. my original wallet on android will not update, I can still view trading history but not balance showing. I re-installed the wallet on an i Phone and there's no history at all but I have the balance showing. I don't see an export option on the android phone.


[03-Mar-21 06:13 AM] gcharang#6833
currently there is no mechanism to share trade history between devices.  your old version may have outdated electrum server list, so it is not getting the balance data. You can update the app to see balance on android. I think there is no export option in mobile till version 0.3.3

[09-Mar-21 08:30 AM] StoeTubby#7366
figured it out... oddly if you select "Max" it will take a very long time to load up order book. If you instead put in a small number of the coin you want to sell, then order book opens fast, then once you have the order you want to take, you hit max.  sort of buggy if you ask me.

What are the thoughts/plans on integrating new cryptocurrencies on AtomicDex? I personally think it would be good (both opportunity, new users, funding possibilities) to add Cardano and Telos.


[12-Mar-21 01:44 AM] looye29#2126
And Monero


[12-Mar-21 02:08 AM] Cryptoon#3362
monero atomic swaps are being worked on

Is AtomicDEX-mobile available in android's PlayStore without enabling Developer mode on the smartphone ?
Is it available without testflight ?
(I'd like to propose to  friend to install it, we are in Belgium so I don't think that there is geoblock for now)

Hi all. What could be the reason if order matching doesn't match the order I try to create? I try to get one that is already on the market. And after the countdown of 30 seconds nothing happened, no order accepted. But the one I like to match with is still shown on the market.


[12-Mar-21 08:08 AM] Komodefi#5638
slightly reducing the amount and trying again has helped me in the past.


[12-Mar-21 08:09 AM] Komodefi#5638
if it's eth based you need eth.


[12-Mar-21 08:09 AM] Jurjen#9294
So it could mean that someone already have an matched order which is a part of the amount shown?


[12-Mar-21 08:10 AM] Komodefi#5638
if it's on the books it should be available


[12-Mar-21 08:10 AM] Jurjen#9294
It is about KMD / VRSC


[12-Mar-21 08:11 AM] Jurjen#9294
I tried now again with lower. In the books 52.57 max vol of KMD, so I tried that. I jus tried 40 KMD, but same issue


[12-Mar-21 08:12 AM] Jurjen#9294
I also have enough KMD for transaction costs


[12-Mar-21 08:14 AM] Komodefi#5638
maybe it wants you to buy the smaller order first


[12-Mar-21 08:15 AM] Komodefi#5638
since it's cheaper


[12-Mar-21 08:15 AM] Jurjen#9294
I just tried 1 KMD, also same problem. I was able to buy a higher order before. But I will give it a try now


[12-Mar-21 08:17 AM] Jurjen#9294
unfortunately the same problem with the smaller order


[12-Mar-21 08:18 AM] Jurjen#9294
Going to try with desktop app now to see if it will make a difference


[12-Mar-21 08:20 AM] Jurjen#9294
Thanks for helping so far


[12-Mar-21 08:32 AM] cipi#4502
if maker has banned your node, it will not match
or when he set a min_volume that is higher then the volume you want to buy, but that is not the case on KMD/VRSC
i take a look... there are 3 banned pubkeys on my node... will go through them...
but best is to avoid failed swaps, every failed swap will lead to a ban


[12-Mar-21 08:35 AM] cipi#4502
the banned pubkeys on my node were because of other failed swaps, no KMD/VRSC, but i unbanned them anyway


[12-Mar-21 08:42 AM] Jurjen#9294
Is the ban on ip address or KMD address?


[12-Mar-21 08:43 AM] cipi#4502
KMD address


[12-Mar-21 08:44 AM] cipi#4502
you can try another one to see if the maker banned you or not


[12-Mar-21 08:45 AM] Jurjen#9294
How can I see which maker I am using? Or is the maker the one that put the order in the market? I tried 2 orders, both failed. But maybe they were from the same maker


[12-Mar-21 08:46 AM] Jurjen#9294
okay I see an address at the orders. Both are the same addresss


[12-Mar-21 08:47 AM] Jurjen#9294
I would only have no clue why it would have banned my address.


[12-Mar-21 08:51 AM] cipi#4502
the maker is the one that put the order in the market... orderbook-call on API shows the pubkeys of the maker, but GUI doesn't show it
yes, different orders can be from the same maker, if it's the same address, it's the same maker... address and pubkeys are the same, pubkey is more general because it is even the same across coins
the banning just happens when swaps are failing, it's the default behavior


[12-Mar-21 08:52 AM] cipi#4502
but your node also bans other nodes, and a restart removes the bans, so you could also restart your AtomicDEX and try again


[12-Mar-21 08:52 AM] Jurjen#9294
Okay I see. So one failed, and all orders later will fail as well.


[12-Mar-21 08:52 AM] Jurjen#9294
I already tried restarting Atomicdex, didn't helped


[12-Mar-21 08:53 AM] cipi#4502
if one fails and the other node bans you or you the other node, further swaps between the 2 nodes will not match anymore


[12-Mar-21 08:53 AM] Jurjen#9294
And no clue why the first one failed


[12-Mar-21 08:54 AM] cipi#4502
what is the swap uuid of the failed swap?


[12-Mar-21 08:54 AM] cipi#4502
if the seed nodes already have the info, you could lookup the error here: https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/error.php?uuid=
complete the URL with the swap uuid


[12-Mar-21 08:55 AM] Jurjen#9294
I see one failed swap yesterday. That was with an order that when the swap was failed wasn't available on the market anymore. I will make the url now

taker_error_msg    "taker_swap:802] Started_at time_dif over 60 478
your system clock is more than 60s away from real time, 478s
you need to sync it, else no swaps will start


[12-Mar-21 08:59 AM] cipi#4502
ah wait, could also be the clock of the maker


[12-Mar-21 09:00 AM] cipi#4502
it is likely the maker, since you are on Android


[12-Mar-21 09:00 AM] Jurjen#9294
My android phone is automatically synced with Google timeservers. Seems to be fine


[12-Mar-21 09:00 AM] cipi#4502
yes, it is the maker


[12-Mar-21 09:01 AM] Jurjen#9294
Okay. So maker clock might be not on time. Make sense. So if I understand well I try to make a match with the same maker that I failed with yesterday? And that one banned me automatically because of a time mismatch?


[12-Mar-21 09:01 AM] cipi#4502
yes


[12-Mar-21 09:02 AM] cipi#4502
if the swap would start, it will fail again anyway though


[12-Mar-21 09:04 AM] Jurjen#9294
I understand it now. I think for one of the next versions could be improved someway. For example by checking the time in the app of the client with NTP servers, and if there is something wrong in this, the app will return this and let the user have fix it. Now it would be my problem which doesn't give feedback in the app at all about that. I could understand that anyhow in a beta stadium. Should a put this as a suggestion with a new Github issue?

[12-Mar-21 09:21 AM] cipi#4502
in this case it wasn't the users clock, but the makers clock that is off

@Slyris could a check be added to AtomicDEX Desktop on start that checks if local clock is off and if so refuses to start?

```


[12-Mar-21 09:43 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but i don't see why it will solve the problem, if the local clock is unsync it's 100% the user responsibility, we should not touch system clock without user permission


[12-Mar-21 09:44 AM] Slyris#2880
What can i do is detecting this error in the swap error and popup a warning to the user, but not on start - on swap failed


[12-Mar-21 09:44 AM] cipi#4502
problem is that other users swaps are failing and they don't know why... in this case it would have helped, since maker was ADEX Desktop


[12-Mar-21 09:44 AM] cipi#4502
or that


[12-Mar-21 09:45 AM] Slyris#2880
Yeah this is the best way,  better error treatment and explain to the user


[12-Mar-21 09:45 AM] Slyris#2880
This is the way to do that


[12-Mar-21 09:46 AM] cipi#4502
hmmm, in this case the failed swap was 1 day ago and the user tried to swap with the same maker... the second time swap does not fail any more and shows no error, it simply does not match because of the banning from the failed swap from prior day


[12-Mar-21 09:48 AM] cipi#4502
but that is another problem... or actually the solution üòÑ ... if maker bad, don't use maker... maybe mm2 should simply not show the orders of such makers any more


[12-Mar-21 09:52 AM] cipi#4502
but you could actually refuse to start the app if the clock is off... it is of no use anyway, since all swaps with it will fail, it just disturbs all others
don't fix clock, just don't start ADEX Desktop


[12-Mar-21 11:48 AM] Jurjen#9294
That is indeed what I try to suggest. @Slyris it isn't that the app should change system time of the maker. But more not allow to start the app if time is incorrect.


[12-Mar-21 11:48 AM] Jurjen#9294

it took too long for TakerPayment in KMD to be confirmed 2 times... in case of KMD, 2 confirms means waiting for notarization... the swap timed out because of that
Taker should get his KMD and maker his ETH... but bitter, since ETH fees are extreme... payed for nothing


[15-Mar-21 11:56 AM] SaltyCroc#4456
Thx cipi... Any idea of ETA for KMD release? (It's been several hours)


[15-Mar-21 11:59 AM] cipi#4502
yes, i now see the error on TakerPaymentrefund, it's not it the above output
it's TakerPaymentRefundFailed with `the transaction was rejected by network rules` and i fear it is this bug: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/852 that was fixed couple hours ago
you can try to restart, see if you can work around
if not, you need to wait for next release


[15-Mar-21 12:07 PM] SaltyCroc#4456
Bad gas, not good... OK great explanation! In an earlier refund situation the release funds button, if re-pressed, says already processed or such. It would be good if that button disappeared or changed to refund value... in next release. Happy to wait üôÇ

[20-Mar-21 12:52 PM] Jurjen#9294
Thanks anyhow. So I guess this will be the best place to report issues and ask for feature requests?


[20-Mar-21 12:53 PM] Jurjen#9294
1) When I lost my password I can restore the wallet by entering the seed. The issue is that it is creating a second wallet. So I have the entry twice. I would expect that it will use the same wallet that I am restoring.


[20-Mar-21 12:56 PM] Jurjen#9294
2) Feature request: Making it easier to switch between wallets. It is time consuming to have to enter the whole password again instead of the pin or so. For my UX it would be best if I don't have to enter a pin/password for every wallet. E.g. in Mycelium I can switch easily between multiple wallets without entering a password/pin. It is just when the app starts to have access to all my wallets. Would love to see this for Atomicdex mobile as well.


[20-Mar-21 12:58 PM] Jurjen#9294
3) Feature request: Address book saved decentralized encrypted with an open standard format so all same based wallets can use it. Now when I remove and add the app my address book is empty. Maybe IPFS can provide a solution for this.

Since Binance Chain is pretty fast and cheap, it could speed up greatly the speed between btc tokens on bsc to all other coins.

was this in response to support binance smart chain? for example, will i be able to swap bETH/ETH on BSC to ETH on Ethereum?


[22-Mar-21 04:32 PM] PTYX#6840
the bc1 addresses were planned before BSC but you will be able to swap BETH/ETH to and from the BSC ecosystem

wow, that sounds amazing. thanks

Hello I tried out Atomicdex last year and want to try it again but it is not in the Play Store any more?

Are you in the us? If yes, try dogedex instead, same thing, just different skin

best to use this with test tokens only - this is some web wallet running a local mm2 instance on user computer. Just assume user data is not protected in this runtime environment.

As issue 852 with the atomicDEX-API has been resolved, will compiling this and the current atomicDEX-desktop source allow me to reclaim my frozen KMD? Any tutorials on how to do this? Or is the next release far off? Thanks team Komodo!

@PTYX is there a public roadmap/timescale for other coins & tokens being added to the mobile AtomicDEX?


[03-Apr-21 01:04 AM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
@figgy132 Pay to add


[03-Apr-21 02:14 AM] dth88#2674
@figgy132 the closest and ongoing integration on the roadmap is the SLP (BCH), the fundraiser was fully funded few weeks back.
But if you have any propositions, I suggest you to open an issue in https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues, we will take a look at how resourceful the task is and if its easy enough it can be done in a matter of days/weeks (in case its another ETH clone for example).
Pay to add is only for mobile version of the app.


[03-Apr-21 06:26 AM] PTYX#6840
Not quite. It's free to add to the desktop wallet and core.


[03-Apr-21 06:27 AM] PTYX#6840
Mobile listing does require the coin to have a minimum volume on the DEX


[07-Apr-21 02:07 AM] figgy132#7531
Just upgraded to latest version. SUPERNET & DEX coins aren't there anymore (not in the list of coins to add) and can't select any other display currency (default is USD) *clean install

@figgy132 you mentioned the roadmap for integrations recently, but maybe you can just let me know what coins are you interested in? will make sure to have a look at those projects


[08-Apr-21 12:56 PM] figgy132#7531
Hi dth, I'm only interested in liquidity on AtomicDEX - bringing more communities into the KMD ecosystem. I personally prefer the mobile app but see loads of new tokens and coins being added to the desktop version :) that was why I asked


[08-Apr-21 12:57 PM] dth88#2674
btw absence of supernet and dex assets seems like some internal config messup, should be resolved next revision¬† UPD: (turns out my statement here is terribly wrong please refer to @TonyL 's answer below for official info on supernet and dex)

Maybe I'll have another look at the dextop version but I'll miss being able to easily swap XX KMD for whatever is on offer against it - doesn't seem as intuitive as the mobile app - maybe I'm just missing something :)

These assets were removed because of legal reasons and will not be added back into AtomicDEX in the next release, however should be tradable still in DogeDEX and in Marmara desktop fork

I updated AtomicDEX mobile using play store , I am using Samsung keyboard in English, I can't paste anymore addresses, did anybody encountered this issue ? Maybe a shortcut changed


[10-Apr-21 06:23 AM] phm87#7395
I can type an address, I can select it and copy or cut it. But I can't paste what is in my clipboard (copied from another app)


[10-Apr-21 06:47 AM] phm87#7395
If I use the camera to scan a QR Code, I can add a new address but I have "No Internet connection" error (tested on VOTE2021 and KMD) when I confirm to withdraw coins


[10-Apr-21 06:53 AM] phm87#7395
"No Internet connection" problem was solved by killing AtomicDEX app and relaunch it, the withdraw works fine now

Hi all!
I am using DogeDEX and I am really enjoying it.
Unfortunately, I just had a wonky swap of Morty to Rick that hung at "takerpayment spent." 
The Morty coins I sent are now missing, so far as I can tell.
I let the order keep going, and I just noticed that the order ended.
I just feel like I should let someone know.


[10-Apr-21 08:38 AM] dth88#2674
I have an old s7 edge, will try to reproduce, thanks


[10-Apr-21 08:42 AM] dth88#2674
I know for a fact that the paste button on samsung differs from other android phones, might even be a framework bug, so will look into this.


[10-Apr-21 08:51 AM] drebelx#9362
The Morties came back! Excellent!


[10-Apr-21 08:52 AM] dth88#2674
@drebelx the button to refund coins only shows up if automatic refund tx failed


[10-Apr-21 08:53 AM] dth88#2674
but when even the button fails, then you should let us know üòÑ


[10-Apr-21 09:00 AM] dth88#2674
ok, so I could not reproduce the paste problem on my samsung, can you DM more specifics, android version, phone model, and if it's not too much trouble log file, btw maybe you are using some custom keyboard plugin just checking üôÇ ?


[10-Apr-21 01:06 PM] phm87#7395
Weird, after few hours, I restarted again the app and copy from outside the app and paste into the app works now! I will DM info of the phone but issue self resolved

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #171 Shapeshift style swaps for mobile
I've noticed many users on mobile are finding it hard to navigate the DEX UI. I think it's because the reduced size of a mobile screen makes it difficult to add the needed detail to make it intuitive. I propose to change the mobile swap UI to a shapeshift-style screen. 
1 - User picks coin 1, and an amount
2- User picks coin 2, he gets shown a conversion estimate based on what's in the orderbooks. If there's no liquidity, it shows as not available. 
3- MM does its magic and finds matches t...

why nano cant be added on AtomicDEX?


[19-Apr-21 05:34 AM] Komodefi#5638
mobile listings are paid listings. you should ask nano


[19-Apr-21 05:44 AM] cipi#4502
https://docs.nano.org/commands/rpc-protocol/ the RPC calls of NANO are totally different to the ones of BTC compatible UTXO coins: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/coins#bitcoin-compatibles,  so it would need to be added to ADEX-API https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API first... if possible

how experienced are you with cli? it would require just a little tech intuition from you


[19-Apr-21 09:26 PM] dth88#2674
however if you are unexperienced at all or lazy(in a good way :D), I would suggest just moving all the funds to another seed and DM this one (seed with locked funds) so it could be done faster. Also logs from that date you had this swap can help a lot so DM if you have them as well.

it should hopefully be quite heavy this swap was a month ago if I'm not mistaken


[19-Apr-21 11:50 PM] Mylo#8306
Swap has finished but GUI says 2/3. Is this a  known issue?


[19-Apr-21 11:59 PM] Mylo#8306
When entering a withdraw amount, entering first digit `.` as a short cut for `0.` does not work.

Pushing . (decimal point) as first digit would be better to automatically populate amount field with 0. (Zero point)

Because without looking at the display as I type, .07, my entire balance was used for the amount, eg 0.5


[20-Apr-21 12:21 AM] dth88#2674
@Mylo it is currently setup this way in dev branch and as I remember but might be mistaking was this way for a long time already, what platform are you using?

yup. you're not the first to ask for an apk, it would be nice to have

DogeDEX is available outside Google store, i installed it through Aurora store on GrapheneOS... haven't looked for APKs, but the chances are high they are available


[24-Apr-21 12:29 PM] tracelessbraces#7366
@cipi got dogedex working fine on graph too, was just hoping for atomicdex :/


[24-Apr-21 12:33 PM] cipi#4502
me too üôÇ
i wonder why Aurora store filters out AtomicDEX


[24-Apr-21 01:00 PM] tracelessbraces#7366
i think aurora might not display anything thats under a /testing dir


[24-Apr-21 01:04 PM] tracelessbraces#7366
hell i cant even find it on playstore. looks like you have to do browser sign in with google. that is asinine


[24-Apr-21 01:05 PM] cipi#4502
i hope you are right... because that means it will be in Aurora when it gets out of testing


[24-Apr-21 04:43 PM] hellomikeharrington#8363
also, after it asks me to name the wallet, it says "enter your seed phrase" - So, I entered the seed phrase of my existing wallet, and it still just creates a brand new wallet / address. Any ideas?


[24-Apr-21 04:49 PM] lightspeed393#5403
are you sure you entered the seed exactly the same? any change such as an extra space between words will change it.


[24-Apr-21 04:49 PM] hellomikeharrington#8363
Yes, I just went back and checked and that's exactly what happened. It now restored correctly on my iPhone

[24-Apr-21 04:51 PM] hellomikeharrington#8363
one other question - if sending KMD funds from Atomic wallet to an exchange, such as Binance... Binance gives option of receiving over the BEP20 (BSC) network. Am I able to send KMD to this kind of address if sending from my atomicDex wallet?


[24-Apr-21 05:00 PM] lightspeed393#5403
yes you can, if you have KMD already in BEP20 format. But I'm assuming you have normal KMD in a R address, so then you'll need to send that to a R address on the KMD network.


[24-Apr-21 05:03 PM] hellomikeharrington#8363
ahhh


[24-Apr-21 05:04 PM] hellomikeharrington#8363
can you give me a quick example or instruction on how to find an R address on the KMD network?


[24-Apr-21 05:05 PM] hellomikeharrington#8363
and yes, the KMD is in a "R address" on AtomicDex wallet


[24-Apr-21 05:08 PM] hellomikeharrington#8363
whoops, disregard. If I am understanding correctly, once KMD is in an R address, it can only be sent to other R addresses on the KMD network..


[24-Apr-21 06:29 PM] Michaelk#3334
Will there be and actual downloadable mobile and or desktop app?


[24-Apr-21 06:34 PM] lightspeed393#5403
yes R addresses for KMD network sending and receiving.

[25-Apr-21 09:08 PM] lightspeed393#5403
btc network has high fees in general

Average transaction fee per txs now 25 usd, through adex is way more than 8 times.

[25-Apr-21 10:00 PM] lightspeed393#5403
if I'm not mistaken, I think it's related to needing the swap txs to confirm quickly so the swap doesn't time out


[25-Apr-21 10:43 PM] Slyris#2880
This is something solvable with Lighting Network in the future, the reason is that if you are a taker on a BTC swap, you need to send taker fee + transaction fees which is expensive right now


[25-Apr-21 10:44 PM] Slyris#2880
You can use BTC-BEP20 meanwhile this time, should have minimum fees and you can always send it to binance and withdraw real BTC afterwards

[25-Apr-21 11:19 PM] Nabob | $ARRR#5004
@Slyris thanks , using atomicdex mobile . I don't think we have that pair on v0.41


[26-Apr-21 01:10 AM] cipi#4502
fee in mobile is likely shown as too high, afaik it wasn't switched to use new trade_preimage call from API yet
but fee on BTC net is extremely high anyway, ADEX uses output from `estimatesmartfee`from bitcoind
could be a good idea to disable BTC pairs completely till fee goes back to < 30 sats and stays there for at least a day or two, but i guess we will never see this again as long as BTC doesn't change anything, like bigger blocks

Is there anyway someone can help me? I was trying to send myself more KMD to swap for more HempCoin but apparently I tapped on the HempCoin KMD swap address and sent it there by mistake not realizing it cleared my KMD address from my clipboard. Is there anyway I can get the HempCoin I would have gotten with my 34 KMD? 
The next TestFlight update you may want to disable the ability to tap on exchange addresses or add a pop up warning letting people know it was copied to their clipboard.


[26-Apr-21 03:46 PM] lightspeed393#5403
` I tapped on the HempCoin KMD swap address` do you mean your HempCoin wallet address in AtomicDEX?


[26-Apr-21 03:49 PM] lightspeed393#5403
KMD and THC share the same address format so both addresses should be the same in your wallet.

[30-Apr-21 02:11 PM] lightspeed393#5403
it means the supernet assets are in a grey area legally and rather than facilitate users swapping them, they've chosen to disable them from being traded to protect themselves.


[30-Apr-21 02:12 PM] lightspeed393#5403

Thanks for the answer @ lightspeed393
So in case I need to write my own wallet it?
As I understand it, I have to install and configure my Back And.
Install this: AtomicDEX (MM2)
And use the: AtomicDEX API

To interact with my Back And
Using the wallet I'm going to have to create!
That's right ?

And you know how to tell me there is some usage restriction on these softwares:
AtomicDEX (MM2)
AtomicDEX API ????


[30-Apr-21 02:40 PM] lightspeed393#5403
atomicdex-api builds the mm2 binary (backend) that the gui's use. so yes if you were to write your own wallet, you'd need mm2

If you initiate a swap and it fails, do you eventually get your fees back?


[01-May-21 06:32 AM] StoeTubby#7366
Does your Doge swap have issues if you have multiple UTXOs? I had ~17 doge across 2 UTXOs and swap failed, looks like it took one of my entire UTXOs and failed on the "Taker Payment Sent". Something about couldn't extract enough value from UTXOs... I was above minimum. Just confused why DogeDex appears to have run off with one of my UTXOs worth 5 doge

have you transferred DOGE out of app during the swap?


[01-May-21 08:58 AM] StoeTubby#7366
@cipi nope, did not transfers in or out during the swap. I have since moved my doge elsewhere (an hour plus after the failed swap) as I didn't want to keep losing doge for no reason.


[01-May-21 09:00 AM] StoeTubby#7366
What is even stranger to me, is that the missing doge was exactly the amount of one of the UTXO inputs. And not the amount of the fees which is usually~3 doge.

those are likely the DOGE you are missing

AtomicDEX is restricted in some countries, you can use DogeDEX instead, it is the same backend, just differently branded

Hi everyone, I have storage problems on my phone as AtomicDex keeps on taking more space everyday. I have deleted old logs, cleared only 2 gb from 8,8 gb.  Will the problem be solved if I delete/ reinstall the app with the same wallet?

if you are in one of the geoblocked locations, the app won't be available to you. You can use the seed words to restore your wallet and access the DEX on the dogedex available here: https://dogedex.xyz/
it's the same as atomicdex, just a reskinned version

To expand... ARRR is a z-tx only chain, and uses different calls and data to perform its zk-snark transactions. Current DEX atmoic swaps don't do z transactions, but development to added "ztomics" is "under development" as stated.

[23-May-21 06:51 AM] gcharang#6833
does it let you input seed words or generate them for you? if it lets you input your own seed words, then thats the expected behavior and you need to input your seed words from atomicdex. make sure to NOT select the "allow custom seed" option


[23-May-21 07:18 AM] Biscuits#0462
Confirm button grayed out can't click after I input my seed


[23-May-21 07:20 AM] Biscuits#0462
If I check allow custom seed, it allows me to click confirm but of course that's going to create a new wallet address etc


[23-May-21 09:29 AM] gcharang#6833
please don't select the "allow custom seed" check box if you are trying to restore a seed phrase generated by atomicdex

 Make sure that:
there are no spaces at the beginning or end of the words
there is only one space between each pair of words
each of the words are present in the list: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bitcoin/bips/master/bip-0039/english.txt 2 and that the spellings are exact

Hello. One of my swaps failed yesterday and I have waited 24 hours for the refund. When I check the swap uuid on kmdexplorer‚Äôio, it says the KMD is refunded but as I was selling MCL for KMD, I didn‚Äôt get any MCL refund. I am also not sure about the number of MCL missing (it seems like only half of it‚Äôs gone). I only have uuid of the swap from the screenshot I took during swap, no history available as I reinstalled the app (I think it was a bad idea üòÑ ) Any help? 

Uuid: 3cad7bae-18fd-41d1-838e-2cbec2e6c71f


[12-Jun-21 05:11 AM] cipi#4502
https://dexapi.cipig.net/public/error.php?uuid=3cad7bae-18fd-41d1-838e-2cbec2e6c71f
it says `TakerPaymentTransactionFailed`, so no MCL were sent in the swap


[12-Jun-21 06:13 AM] Zeyneb ~ Mins Design#2568
I think I have miscalculated my amount. I will also check on kmd and marmara explorers. Thank you very much


[12-Jun-21 06:23 AM] cipi#4502
the amount you lost is the TakerFee... it is 0.15% of the MCL amount you wanted to sell


[12-Jun-21 06:28 AM] cipi#4502
what have you done while the swap was failing? did you sent MCL out during the swap?
added the "case" to API issue: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/967#issuecomment-860053447


[12-Jun-21 07:29 AM] Zeyneb ~ Mins Design#2568
I couldn‚Äôt do anything as the history tab didn‚Äôt load for 4 hours. Then I deleted/reinstalled the app. The order maker was someone I knew, he sent me the screenshot of the failed swap. (Added pictures with his permission on link) I didn‚Äôt send any MCL out but I did swaps before and after the failed one. 

I did lots of swaps yesterday and I couldn‚Äôt keep a track of my amount. It seems like 20k MCL is missing but once again I am not sure of anything. Thanks for your time.

sorry, i reread what you wrote... sounds like you could have deleted the app while a swap was still running... idk what can happen in such cases... guess this case is not accounted for, so "undefined" üôÇ
but anyway, for this particular swap, no MCL were sent out, since TakerPayment failed

swap simply failed with `"taker_swap:1026] utxo:1636] utxo_common:449] Sum of input values 4299688625513 is too small, required no less than 4700000001000"`, likely because balance was already used by the other swap

but idk what happens to the swap that was running while the app was removed... if the infos about that swap are not preserved, the new app doesn't know about it and also can't do any refunds about it... but idk what is removed and what not when you remove the app... need to ask the devs


[12-Jun-21 11:51 AM] cipi#4502
OK, the swap data is lost when you remove the app... so if there were failed swaps that were not already refunded, all the data from this swaps needs to be recreated manually, imported into the new app and then the refund can take place
it's a manual process, so you need to contact support to do this


[12-Jun-21 12:00 PM] cipi#4502
but i only see exactly one failed MCL/KMD swap in the last 3 days and that is `3cad7bae-18fd-41d1-838e-2cbec2e6c71f`, the one from above, where no MCL were sent

Atomic swap fee is it in eth or kmd ?


[14-Jun-21 09:18 PM] gsomna#8978
I see reward paid in AWC, if network fee is in eth and reward AWC then what is the use of kmd coin in atomic swaps ? I tot network fee supposed to kmd.


[15-Jun-21 04:00 AM] lightspeed393#5403
network fee is in the coin you are swapping. If it's an ERC token than it's in ETH.


[15-Jun-21 04:20 AM] Deleted User#0000
The AWC reward is for Atomic wallet, not AtomicDex

Installed dogedex and was curious about Rick and Morty? Somewhere I can get more info? 

Found the answer. They're valueless test coins.

Hi, noob here, any help with the exchange would be appreciated. I‚Äôve been attempting to exchange BTC to KMD and it keeps coming back saying ‚Äúinsufficient volume: the minimum required KMD is so and so‚Äù.
I‚Äôm not understanding something or do I need more BTC to trade? Just not sure what‚Äôs going on.


[15-Jun-21 02:58 PM] AllSeezen#9443
Is the dex ready for androids. New and not familiar with progress


[15-Jun-21 02:58 PM] cipi#4502
the txfees on BTC chain are extremely high, so most users have put minimum trade volume for their orders, so you need to sell at least the amount shown there
but i would recommend to use a normal fee coin for the swaps and avoid BTC and ETH/ERC20


[15-Jun-21 03:47 PM] gcharang#6833
try https://atomicdex.io/ and if that doesn't work because of your location, use: https://dogedex.xyz/
it is the same app with a different theme and no geo blocks


[16-Jun-21 01:04 AM] WiWaStra#9105
Thank you, What normal fee coins are you referring to or can you give me an example


[16-Jun-21 01:09 AM] gcharang#6833
he meant other coins like LTC, KMD that don't have a fee market and txns can be sent with quite low fees


[16-Jun-21 03:59 AM] cryptothegrave#9253
Thanks for the response but I need an invitation code to use on TestFlight which will then give access to the IOS version of AtomicDEX

I recently sent KMD from my Bittrex wallet to AtomicDEX. It has been a day and still has yet to show up in AtomicDEX. The transaction says complete and the address is correct.
Is it supposed to take a long time?

there was a network upgrade on June 14th and we informed all exchanges about it. Please write to bittrex customer support and let them know about your pending transaction. You might also send them this blog post: https://komodoplatform.com/en/blog/komodo-medusa-update/


[18-Jun-21 07:38 AM] WiWaStra#9105
Thank you, I wrote to bittrex and their reply is that the pending transaction can be canceled, but the transaction has a transaction ID. I‚Äôve authorized it and it can‚Äôt be canceled.
I‚Äôve shared the article on the Komodo update, but have yet to hear anything from bittrex.


[18-Jun-21 07:51 AM] gcharang#6833
got it. we have also emailed them and waiting for a reply. it is most likely that the bittrex support people you spoke with didn't have all the info. you most likely won't lose your coins. we are also trying to contact them using other means


[18-Jun-21 12:28 PM] WiWaStra#9105
Thank you.
They relpied and here it is, if it is helpful.
Currently it looks like the KMD wallet is on a blocked status in the exchange.
‚ÄúHi there,

Please check https://www.bittrex.com/status for the status of a wallet. Once the wallet is back online, if you are still having any issues please reply to this email or visit bittrex.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/2255818 and let us know.

Wallet maintenance implies one of several possible things could be happening:

There could be a possible fork on the block chain. In order to protect funds, we have disabled the wallet until a consensus has been made on which chain is the proper chain.

The wallet has been updated by the developer and the exchange is in the process of implementing the wallet update.

The wallet daemon on our server has hung or crashed.

The wallet is sending orphan transactions or having an issue that requires the developer to work with us on resolving.

There are other scenarios that cause a wallet to be disabled. In general, the wallet is disabled to prevent users attempting to deposit or withdraw to a wallet that may not be functioning properly. We are always actively working to bring wallets in maintenance back online as quickly as possible.

I deposited coins while the market was offline, will they be credited?
As long as your deposit was on the proper block chain and it's transaction id can be found on the official explorer your coins should credit when the wallet is turned back on.

Can I trade when a wallet is disabled?
In most cases you can continue trading if wallet is disabled. If there is an issue that would cause trading concerns, we would turn off the market.
Best Regards,

Follow us on Twitter @ https://twitter.com/BittrexExchange‚Äù

Never seen it get stuck this late in the swap... Take payment spent status


[27-Jun-21 09:20 AM] BoBot-LunaMaxi#8821
I guess that 2 minute disconnection is going to make the swap fail... It's been over 1 hour so I'm assuming if taker payment step hasn't gone thru yet that it will fail

[02-Jul-21 01:35 AM] cipi#4502
both WBTC are listed, so you can trade, but no orders atm... problem is that both coins are high fee coins, so you would need to post orders with a min_volume of 1000$ or so, so that swaps with a spread of 1-2% are still profitable

you may try.. search it on google : atomicdex.io


[03-Jul-21 05:16 AM] gcharang#6833
you will have to hash it out with the bittrex support. let them know that the txid they gave you previously doesn't exist on the KMD blockchain they are on right now. You can ask them to double check.


[03-Jul-21 05:18 AM] gcharang#6833
the SPV servers (lite mode) don't respond well when dealing with too many txns. so, it is advised to not use the atomicdex address for collecting mining payments. you can export the privkey from settings, import it in native mode and access your coins

Never received 2 transactions with USTD sent from OKEx and it shows completed in there end!


[08-Jul-21 07:01 PM] gcharang#6833
USDT listed on the atomicdex-mobile app is the BEP20 version. OKEx most likely sent you ERC20 version of USDT. You cannot access them on atomicdex as it doesn't support this version of the token. To access your coins, get private key of ETH from atomicdex (settings -> seeds and privatekeys -> input your password) and then use that privatekey to restore the wallet on metamask or any other standard ETH wallet. You will be able to see your USDT there


[09-Jul-21 02:32 AM] cipi#4502
USDT-ERC20 was also added to ADEX Desktop as wallet-only coin, so sending and receiving should work

This is the reply I got from Bittrex. ‚ÄúHello,

Thanks for reaching back out.

The Withdrawal Transaction ID (TxID) shows that it‚Äôs been broadcast to the Blockchain and is confirmed. Bittrex cannot recall or cancel confirmed Withdrawals. You'll ‚Äãneed to contact the receiving wallet or exchange for further assistance. Bittrex does not have access to any wallets not on the Bittrex exchange.
Best Regards,‚Äù
What can I do now? You tell me to hash it out with them. They tell me to hash it out with you guys.


[09-Jul-21 06:45 AM] gcharang#6833
can you please tell me when you received this reply? I pinged their dev team yesterday, and they informed me that they sent the necessary info to their support team.
can you please send me the transaction id through a direct message?


[09-Jul-21 08:53 AM] WiWaStra#9105
I received the email July 8th.
I originally created the support request with the wrong TxID. In correspondence I told them so, and provided the problematic TxID.

@Mr.Lubo if you are using CLI, use this call to activate BTC electrum. you need to use `source userpass` either standalone or above the curl command to activate it

Tried both doge and ripple from TradeOgre.


[31-Jul-21 08:22 AM] gcharang#6833
depending on the error, it is either trade ogre's withdrawals aren't working for these coins. or, you entered addresses in wrong formats/protocols etc.,
the XRP available in atomicdex is the BEP20 version. not sure tradeogre supports it. and Doge supported on AtomicDEX and trade ogre must be the same version

(furthermore, the addresses for some coins change as well)


[31-Jul-21 10:54 PM] Slyris#2880
It's not the same derivation @deadFreak781 , atomicdex doesn't support bip derivation yet


[31-Jul-21 11:40 PM] deadFreak781#7423
ok, thanks for answering, any ETA for that?

Not yet but we already discussed it in private - it's not high priority but may come at the same time with hardware support.

to be clear, you can use privkeys(in wif format) from other wallets to login to AtomicDEX. just thatm using seed phrases direcly from external wallets isn't supported yet

the wallet is non custodial. software updates shouldn't need you to move coins out of your seed phrase. Even if you want to use a different supported app like AtomicDEX desktop, using the same seed phrase to restore the wallet i enough. No need to move the coins out of the address

True, just make sure to have the seed phrase backup in any and all cases. Some people ignore it for later, they should never ignore taking backup of wallet seed phrase.

Mate you guys are always reactive rather than proactive. This is why KMD is not the top chain. I placed a new token on BSE because you are always fixing rather than developing. I needed to send some my tokens in the dex wallet urgently and cannot now.  Really disappointing.

If we update the app, do we need to enter our pass or something? I hope not, otherwise my savings will be gone. Why dont you inform us before updating?


[08-Aug-21 01:11 AM] silverdin#3872
Could you please answer? Im very worried


[08-Aug-21 01:24 AM] Slyris#2880
But this is absolutely your responsibility to backup your seed and knows your password - many other wallet are even less permissive and after 3 wrong pin your wallet would be reset.


[08-Aug-21 01:27 AM] silverdin#3872
I know my pin


[08-Aug-21 01:27 AM] silverdin#3872
Just dont have seed


[08-Aug-21 01:28 AM] Slyris#2880
I don't know for IOS - but what i can say so far for Android on my experience is that if you update the application you should not have any problem, but if you uninstall the app and then reinstall it the data folder is gone and you have to reimport the seed.

Now, if you access your funds after the update in the settings you have a button "view seed & private keys" please do the appropriate backup this time...


[08-Aug-21 01:30 AM] silverdin#3872
Application and its data still there, I hope I wont have problem. Thank you


[08-Aug-21 01:31 AM] Slyris#2880
Ok, worst case wait for the answer from @TonyL or @ca333 - i do not know that much about testflight data folder and update in general.

The only advice i can give you is that you need to backup your **seed**.

My desktop is a Mac air. But older version. It does not have the app.


[08-Aug-21 01:44 AM] Slyris#2880
I want to say impartially here that TestFlight still wants to say that it is a beta-test and that therefore it is necessary to respect the conditions of apple: https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/testflight/sren/terms.html

AtomicDEX is accessible in many ways: Mobile, Desktop, CLI - you should never be blocked in any way if you have your backup **seed**.

I also want to say that with the recent listing of GleecDEX (branded dex) on the apple store, it also means that AtomicDEX will be able to be on the apple store.

eg: https://apps.apple.com/nl/app/gleecdex-wallet/id1563795528


[08-Aug-21 02:09 AM] Anthony007#3956
So the seed phrase is connected to the wallet not the device?


[08-Aug-21 02:10 AM] Slyris#2880
The seed phrase is derived the same way on all devices there is no notion of wallet or device in this case, i write a thread back in the days let me find it for you


[08-Aug-21 02:11 AM] Slyris#2880

I think you just have to renew it on testflight. and it should work on your phone again now

[14-Aug-21 11:44 PM] gcharang#6833
try https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.komodoplatform.atomicdex


[14-Aug-21 11:46 PM] iridium‚úî#1613
Thks.  Been there.  There are two links at that page but they don't get me anywhere that I can see atomicDex.


[14-Aug-21 11:49 PM] gcharang#6833
ok, please try the android link on https://dogedex.xyz/
it is the same app as atomicdex, just reskinned


[14-Aug-21 11:53 PM] iridium‚úî#1613
That I can see.  But I have hard time believing it will give me the same functionality as Komodo's atomicDEX.


[15-Aug-21 12:00 AM] gcharang#6833
it does. it is just a rebranded wallet. there might be different sets of coins available, but features are the same

Hi,

While I was doing KMD and MCL swap transactions on an ios phone with AtomicDex software, the small amount of KMD left in my account was hacked today. This is a very small amount, but the problem here is not the amount, it happened without my knowledge.

Something like this happened to a friend of mine from the MCL group recently, and there was a large amount of transfer, now it happened to me too.

Since I am an experienced software developer, I have provided all the protections for my account information, I am asking for help on the subject, this is hackers taking the KMDs in our wallet with the help of a bug in AtomicDex.

There is no other activity in the sent account other than KMD from me.

Details are below, please help.

Regards Ugur


[15-Aug-21 01:17 PM] Ugur#2795
About the hacking event;
-My phone is ios and phone memory is full.
-I placed a swap KMD/MCL transfer order, it was right after I canceled the transaction before the swap started.
-The application did not close or give any notification.

I can give more details if you want.

1. First empty the storage for app. You should not delete the app once you start a swap. 
2. Can you open application now? 
3. Do you see that the swap was cancelled? 
4. Does it Show any information about the swap? 
5. Within 24 hours, there will be refund but the application should be open during That time.


[15-Aug-21 01:40 PM] Ugur#2795
1. Swap did not start, I had to delete AtomicDex due to lack of disk space. (After I opened AtomicDex on the Windows side.)
2.3. When I reinstall AtomicDex on the phone, I can't see the swaps.
4. I can't see any information about swap.
5. I will be waiting for payment within 24 hours.

Are you sure the transferring account is a virtual account created by AtomicDex, is there anything else I need to do?

Thanks.


[15-Aug-21 02:02 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
You should not delete the app once you start a swap. It probably started the swap. If app is deleted, you will most probably have no refund. @Zeyneb ~ Mins Design had the similar case.


[15-Aug-21 02:06 PM] Ugur#2795
If the transaction didn't commit, it should be a rollback. If so, it's an AtomicDex error, even in the simplest software.

Is there a way to get the Outgoing KMD for a transaction like this, I think it should be. Who owns this KMD?


[15-Aug-21 07:22 PM] smkhound#7640
do you have txids or swap uuid?
swap json is stored locally, but if you deleted app then it might be gone. With the above info, we might be able to recover it. It is needed to process refund.


[15-Aug-21 08:28 PM] gcharang#6833
there was no hacking event. it looks like you uninstalled the app after the swap started
https://kmdexplorer.io/address/bSF656rktbC2oKYHDm9s3oamiA4i5dPra7
cc: @smkhound 
the txn on this address is typical of a atomicswap txn created by atomicdex.


[16-Aug-21 02:14 AM] Ugur#2795
There is no swap uuid unfortunately, because the application keeps the transfer process locally, it ran out of memory of my phone, so I had to delete it.

Can't we get it back with the information below, so is there a rollback, I think this should be it üò¶

[23-Aug-21 06:14 AM] Slyris#2880
Fujicoin is not available on mobile due to limitations on simultaneous number of activated coin


[23-Aug-21 06:20 AM] Cramer#5542
i guess in future if this limitation is lifted, or fujicoin is later added, it should in theory automatically appear in my wallet on mobile if i have any coins in the desktop wallet?

there are buttons to participate in iOS testflight or android beta-testing

If I click on the "App Store" link, it does offer a download of TestFlight, and links to join the beta-test.

If I click on "Google Play", it sends me straight to a plain login page for the Google account I won't have. No other info.

If it's offered as other than under a testing program, I can still get the apk, basically from Play. Not suggesting you change its status there, as I understand the desire to do what you can so that people know what they're getting.


[29-Aug-21 02:00 PM] roarde#0976
Really would like to see it offered from a more privacy- and community-friendly repo, tho.

But I mean if it can have BTC and LTC it should be able to support similar coins that are forked from them right


[30-Aug-21 02:25 AM] gcharang#6833
the issue is about the maximum number of coins that can be supported on mobile. as that number is limited, we don't list every compatible coin on mobile. for mobile listing, the coin's team has to email our bizdev team at partners@komodoplatform.com


[30-Aug-21 02:38 AM] BitSec#1898
Oh that makes sense. I'll ask them to email :) thanks

The KMD miner fee has risen to 0.2KMD, is this reasonable?


[30-Aug-21 04:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
The fee is not 0.2, it is -0.2. Meaning your balance increased. This is because of the active user rewards


[30-Aug-21 04:31 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
It appears as a negative transaction fee

I need to transfer funds to the target account which is 3KMD. As a result, I deducted 0.2? Then I added 0.2 to the balance? Is this the result I want?
If the balance is insufficient, you can deduct the miner's fee like this. If there is a balance, you don't need to deduct it.


[30-Aug-21 11:43 PM] TonyL#3577
Negative tx fee means that you earned rewards for Komodo holding in this transaction as poly stated above


[31-Aug-21 12:16 AM] gcharang#6833
please see the txn clearly.
initially you had 514.06685829 KMD
you sent 3 KMD to someone and had left 511.27570019 KMD in your address.
added together, it is 514.2757 KMD

so, you have around 0.2 more than you are supposed to. this is because of active user rewards. the blockchain is rewarding you for holding KMD and transacting it.
that's why the txnfee is shown as negative in the image you shared

[04-Sep-21 03:23 AM] find_your_way#5266

[04-Sep-21 04:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Not necessarily that kmd team has to know what other projects in the ecosystem will be doing, when and what are their plans. I don‚Äôt understand why it‚Äôs seems hard to believe for you. This is third time I‚Äôm giving you same answer: Ask Mike about Verus mainnet release. Not KMD team.


[04-Sep-21 06:41 AM] find_your_way#5266
Sorry...dont know that vdex/dex is a verus project...i thought it is a kmd project and the start of vdex depends on verus mainnet launch. So in my  understanding kmd team should be up to date because they need mainnet for vdex but it seems my thoughts are wrong....sorry...my mistake


[04-Sep-21 06:50 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
maybe I can clear that if there's confusion:
DEX is an asset/smartchain/cryptocurrency which represents revenue sharing with it's holders which gets generated by the fees collection from AtomicDEX.
vDEX is supposed to be a PBaaS chain on Verus mainnet when PBaaS tech is enabled on Verus main network.
Nobody in the ecosystem may know about it's release dates or estimates other than Mike himself, in my opinion. I bet if you even ask in Verus, you'll get the similar answer, which would be "soon" or something similar. There is no set date for it, and it's rightly so. Security and safe execusion of this important DiFi technology is the focus for Verus, and that's how it should be. You should ask about anything Verus mainnet, then head over to Verus Discord.


[04-Sep-21 06:51 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
Only after Verus mainnet releases PBaaS tech, vDEX PBaaS chain can be created. So all eyes should be on Verus for that if looking forward to vDEX.


[04-Sep-21 06:53 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
> So in my  understanding kmd team should be up to date because the need mainnet for vdex but it seems my thoughts are wrong
true, you are mistaken I guess. I don't think anyone in the ecosystem knows best when will Verus Mainnet with PBaaS capability will release other than Mike himself.

@idontknow Does it ask for your password? Re-add the coin to the AtomicDex app


[16-Sep-21 09:24 AM] idontknow#4099
no-the VRSC is on the mobile app.  but 0 balance.


[16-Sep-21 09:26 AM] idontknow#4099
says 0 vrsc, no transactions.  VRSC wallet shows the transaction.  it was a great, fast transaction-then it dissapeared when i reinstalled Atomicwallet.

there is no such address on https://explorer.verus.io/search

idk what it is, you said you sent VRSC there... but the address is not even known by https://explorer.verus.io, so no VRSC was ever sent there

do you have your KMD back now?


[28-Sep-21 01:34 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
We use the concept similar to "light/full" nodes: full AtomicDEX nodes are subscribed to all order books and swaps messages by default. "light" nodes connect to full, subscribe to only selected pairs, etc. So as light nodes initiate only outgoing connections, we don't require to bypass NAT.


[28-Sep-21 06:30 AM] Mark81#4505
@artem.pikulin Thanks for info. I believe this is just for handling message between peers and nothing is saved in blocks? And how network stays in "sync" of orderbooks?


[29-Sep-21 12:41 AM] MorganJekyll#8355
So now that we have a low fee, Komodo based web DEX what is preventing KMD from making uniswap and other DEXs obsolete?


[29-Sep-21 04:03 AM] artem.pikulin#0794
Yes, the messages are off-chain. We have an order book sync protocol relying on the slightly modified libp2p gossipsub v1 spec (<https://github.com/libp2p/specs/blob/master/pubsub/gossipsub/gossipsub-v1.0.md>). Once a node creates a maker order, it broadcasts the `MakerOrderCreated` message, other nodes receive it and add the new order in their local order book copy. Orders' essential data is also stored in the Patricia trie. Makers broadcast `KeepAlive` messages every 30 seconds - these contain the roots of tries per pair (these messages are relatively small). When another node receives such `KeepAlive` it compares its roots to the received. If they don't match, then the node is in a desync state - it requests up-to-date info from other nodes.

There are more messages types for different actions with orders. You can find them in <https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/blob/mm2.1/mm2src/lp_ordermatch/new_protocol.rs>.

out of curiousity, how much is a mobile listing for a komodo smart chain ?


[25-Oct-21 03:47 AM] cryptosammy#3587
I think you have to contact the Atomic DEX team, if I recall correctly you must contact @PTYX


[25-Oct-21 06:04 AM] Jimm B.#9993
I really enjoy trading on the mobile version!
It's really unbelievable how the UX has improved since barterdex days!
good work!
everything runs smoothly.
everything is clear and the announcements are nice when a swap status changes!
everything would be perfect if the music were exchanged for something neutral ... maybe a little tone every 30 seconds.
Yes, I know that you can change the tone yourself, but why not do something less noticeable right away?
I would also like it that when I am in the market tab and look at the order book, I can select and trade an order there directly.
if you select an order there, you can see the information.
a trade button under the information would be really nice.
AtomicDEX is already an incredibly good tool!  what will it look like in 2 years?:KMD: :shexy: :AtomicDEX:

0.5.1.


[25-Oct-21 07:33 PM] Jimm B.#9993
I tested it again ... it is not silent but has a lower volume.  so my question from above still applies.


[25-Oct-21 11:02 PM] find_your_way#5266
the simplest would be if kmd delivered a quiet sound and set it as the standard. but that hasn't happened yet.i dont know why


[25-Oct-21 11:29 PM] cryptosammy#3587
ehm, you dont use the option first one (Sound) above language?

@cryptosammy Yes, I use this option.


[25-Oct-21 11:33 PM] cryptosammy#3587
honestly I dont use swap a lot on my phone ( not much too swap ), it could be that sometimes i phone is on silent, cant recall that i heard the funky music when I swapped last week.


[25-Oct-21 11:37 PM] Jimm B.#9993
I could also turn the sound on my phone down, but if you like to hear spotify while swapping, you run into problems!
Apart from that, the sound doesn't stop the app from going into a kind of sleep mode after a short time.
that's what the sound is supposed to prevent, right?


[26-Oct-21 12:20 AM] cryptosammy#3587
@Jimm B. to be honest, I don't know. The mobile version is as far as I know not open, else I would have gone through it üòÑ


[26-Oct-21 12:26 AM] Jimm B.#9993
@cryptosammy that was a rhetorical question and not addressed to you.
I know the sound is there to prevent the app / smartphone from going to sleep.
but nice that you try to help.üôÇ

I think there is something brewing but current atomic swaps arent from shielded pool. Its kind of a bandaid swap ie. Arrr is pulled out from shielded pool, swap is made and then sent back to shielded pool.

You might be able to close the app for several hours


[30-Oct-21 03:46 AM] smkhound#7640
if you close the app soon enough, and keep it closed until swap fails, you should get a refund (minus transaction fees) though your pubkey may be banned from the network for a while,

make sure there are no active/failed swaps. backup your seed phrase and reinstall the app. that should let you see it for sure


[04-Nov-21 11:25 PM] jspook16#3059
I pointed someone to AtomicDEX mobile but they are unable to download on Google play. Does that mean they are in a geo blocked area? And if so is there an alternative mobile app? (I didn't see dogedex on Google play either)


[05-Nov-21 12:40 AM] gcharang#6833
dogedex was ip trolled and atomicdex mobile has geoblock. there should be another branded dex out soon that may not have geoblocks. but, there isn't any other available right now afaik


[08-Nov-21 01:27 AM] Jimm B.#9993
does the minimum for a btc trade really have to be 0.00777?  would love to see that without limit ... as long as I pay the DEX fees, the app shouldn't care how much I trade ..


[08-Nov-21 09:36 PM] Jimm B.#9993
@TonyL maybe you can say something about it?


[08-Nov-21 09:37 PM] Jimm B.#9993
with this high minimum a lot of volume is lost I think.


[09-Nov-21 12:22 AM] TonyL#3577
Right now BTC orders min volume limiting by maker setting when placing orders. BTC fees are huge so with small volume makers don't see financial incentive to keep such orders.


[09-Nov-21 12:30 AM] Jimm B.#9993
I understand what you're saying but I still don't see the need for this minimum.  can't it be left to the people to decide?  I think this minimum is bad for AtomicDEX and i ask the komodo team to remove it as soon as possible.üôè


[09-Nov-21 12:31 AM] Jimm B.#9993
the maker can add more% to make it worthwhile for him.


[09-Nov-21 12:33 AM] Jimm B.#9993
0.00777 are +500$ atm...


[09-Nov-21 12:35 AM] Jimm B.#9993
The maker can also set the minimum size if he does not consider small trades to be worthwhile.


[09-Nov-21 12:41 AM] Jimm B.#9993
sometimes you just need a small amount of btc quickly or you want to get rid of a small amount.  please make that possible.üôè :AtomicDEX:

By the way guys , if we wish to achieve higher organic volume in the ADEX and the family branches, I strongly believe that the team should consider offering an honorary listing in the mobile version either free or with a really symbolic price to the Projects that seem to have a real traction in the DEX every few months.


[13-Nov-21 06:16 PM] VandarGR#6065
For example BITCOINZ is usually among the top performers.


[13-Nov-21 06:20 PM] VandarGR#6065
KMD/BTCZ and LTC/BTCZ pairs are 3 and 4 position in the top5 with the highest volume. Quite impressive for a coin that is available only in the Desktop version.

 There were days that the LTC/BTCZ pair alone touched even 1k $ which is really nice for driving ADEX in higher volumes. 
4 years old + Community with real people trading. Most tokens usually are 'dead' in ADEX because of the gas fees, especially the eth-based.

IMHO it is oxymoron having some tokens & pairs that usually generate next to zero volume, just for prestige in the mobile version and not having one of the top performing coins in volume.

And when you put a silent sound file into adex package? Then people musnt dowload recorder and record an own sound file...i know its not difficult to do that but people are lazy

I‚Äôm seeing tweets, texts, etc. saying mobile AtomicDex now shows value of Tokel, MCL, but mine doesn‚Äôt.  THC doesn‚Äôt have a value either, sometimes yes, most times no.  What am I doing wrong? v0.5.1

Who do I ask for help with a tokel transaction that was done on AtomicDEX that is hung up between the withdraw and receive wallets? Been a week now and I still have not received my coins. Thanks


[26-Dec-21 09:32 AM] Colbybr1010#9995
Sender claims the coins are gone from his wallet but I have not received them. I do not even have an unconfirmed transaction showing them. There is nothing on the chain showing they were ever sent but he claims they are gone from his account so he can‚Äôt resend to me. Please help


[26-Dec-21 09:34 AM] smkhound#7640
has sender provided a transaction ID?


[26-Dec-21 09:34 AM] Colbybr1010#9995
Let me ask for it.


[26-Dec-21 09:35 AM] smkhound#7640
If there is no record of a transaction from their address to yours on https://tokel.explorer.dexstats.info/, it didn't happen.


[26-Dec-21 09:35 AM] smkhound#7640
if there is, it'd be easy enough for them to give you a link to the transaction


[26-Dec-21 09:37 AM] Colbybr1010#9995
There is nothing on the chain but his account shows less coins in his account by the exact amount that he said he sent from he claims


[26-Dec-21 09:38 AM] Colbybr1010#9995
I was told by someone on here that he would need to do a -rescan of his wallet To see the coins back in his account


[26-Dec-21 09:38 AM] smkhound#7640
was he using a native wallet?


[26-Dec-21 09:38 AM] Colbybr1010#9995
He was using AtomicDEX


[26-Dec-21 09:38 AM] Colbybr1010#9995
We both use AtomicDEX


[26-Dec-21 09:39 AM] smkhound#7640
rescan does not apply to electrum transactions


[26-Dec-21 09:39 AM] Colbybr1010#9995
He sent from his desktop


[26-Dec-21 09:39 AM] smkhound#7640
if is account has less funds, he should have a transaction that matches the amount sent


[26-Dec-21 09:40 AM] Colbybr1010#9995
And that‚Äôs the issue now he says


[26-Dec-21 09:40 AM] Colbybr1010#9995
No chain of it shows up but his wallet has less coins he claims


[26-Dec-21 09:40 AM] smkhound#7640
if there is not transaction ID, funds were not sent. if there is a txid, we can see where it was sent, perhaps to a different address.


[26-Dec-21 09:41 AM] smkhound#7640
his claims have no merit. chain doesnt lie


[26-Dec-21 09:41 AM] Colbybr1010#9995
Ok I‚Äôm trying to get the trans ID but he claims he can‚Äôt find one.


[26-Dec-21 09:41 AM] smkhound#7640
no txid, no tx


[26-Dec-21 09:42 AM] smkhound#7640
smells like bullshit to be honest.


[26-Dec-21 09:49 AM] Colbybr1010#9995

could be a bug in local stored transaction data. chain is point of truth. even if it were unconfirmed, I'd be able to see that in the mempool of a native wallet. not found.

Somebody had the atomic swap failure. He had no refunding. His mobile AtomicDEX had gone since he had no space in mobile. After opening, there was no info on any history like brand new. The history was zero. Can he still get back refunds?

[28-Dec-21 10:04 PM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Thanks very much. It was solved. His money came back. I told him to keep the AtomicDEX on. Even if there was no history and all data had gone, the refund was made. You gave me a good idea. @Aklix and @ryilmaz are developing Marmara Connector to handle all Marmara Credit Loops functions. If there is a way to make atomic swaps within Marmara Connector, it would be great. The community is using Connector now as main tool to handle all operations. @cipi @tony

you can get testnet BTC / ETH / BNB / QTUM etc and try a swap with that. the orderbook might not be populated for them thos so you'd need a second device. If I'm around I can put up an order for you to match

the swap is not failed.  it's still running, but of course it won't continue.


[22-Jan-22 06:12 AM] Jimm B.#9993
maybe it has something to do with the fact that I claimed just before the swap.  the claimed KMD and the KMD transaction to the b address are unconfirmed.


[22-Jan-22 06:13 AM] Jimm B.#9993
I just claimed again and it was successful but the unconfirmed transactions are still visible.

Where did you send from? If it's a CEX, they may take longer to actually make the transaction


[30-Jan-22 11:46 AM] DashAcceptedHere#7483
I have sent from my DASH Wallet. My deposit was credited successfully.


[30-Jan-22 12:01 PM] DashAcceptedHere#7483
I have placed order. Is there a time limit for an order?
what will happen to my order if the atomicDEX app is closed in the future?


[30-Jan-22 12:56 PM] PTYX#6840
If the app is closed the order can't match or settle so it will fail after a while

Hey, there is one wallet RCBheTft7W19VQ28wXpY5EdwnaA8zfpbCV and LN8TqA6RbLSdgCM6eVpiFjNWEX4pTxwZhy that puts orders ppl cant buy. I guess there is a bug, and it is being used on purpose. Because usually only the first and 2nd order he places can not be swapped, but 3rd order, he lets it. I donno how but he does this with MCL/LTC, MCL/KMD, KMD/MCL swaps.


[04-Feb-22 01:20 PM] cipi#4502
he needs to restart his ADEX


[05-Feb-22 12:35 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626

[KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX] Issue opened: #172 Add \[ES\] language to AtomicDEX on mobile web and desktop version\.
Hello.
I'm not sure about the current amount of spanish-native/talking AtomicDEX customers but it sure is >0.
Please add Spanish to the app's language options on desktop and mobile version. I volunteer to translate every string.


[05-Feb-22 10:57 PM] Jimm B.#9993
i remember the address with CV at the end... already some months ago i could not start a swap with this address.


[05-Feb-22 10:58 PM] Jimm B.#9993
KMD/TKL it was then.


[05-Feb-22 11:00 PM] Jimm B.#9993
Is this person a bad MM on purpose?  I find it hard to believe that someone hasn't noticed this for months.


[06-Feb-22 12:02 AM] B. G√ºltekin √áetiner#0626
Yes. That is the address. My guess is that person is doing it intentionally in many markets. The market for that pair stops after certain time since he/she dominates especially the first likely buys/sells with unswappable orders.


[06-Feb-22 01:17 AM] Jimm B.#9993
would love to hear what the team thinks about it.  the statement "he needs to restart his adex" is not very satisfactory.
especially since there is a suspicion that these orders are intentionally flawed and have been for months and on many pairs.

it's not intentionally, there is a bug in ADEX-API that freezes mm2 when you have lots of orders and it is running for a longer time (eg couple days) https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/1172
this bug is not present in dev branch of ADEX-API, i am running nodes for several weeks without problem
but all ADEX Desktop versions out there are using the affected mm2
restarting the app "fixes" the problem

i have ADEX Desktop binaries built with mm2 from dev branch https://github.com/cipig/atomicDEX-Desktop/actions
but i made them only for linux
if `RCBheTft7W19VQ28wXpY5EdwnaA8zfpbCV` needs other OS, let me know and i enable those builds back and rebuild

yea, by "restoring" the seed from the desktop wallet into the mobile wallet.


[20-Feb-22 09:44 PM] smkhound#7640
It's not recommended, as your swap histories will be incomplete (stored locally on each device). You may also have problems if you attempt to swap on both at the same time.

Good day sir, AtomicDex mobile is safe to save my assets their like Tokel and kmd..or not necessary because it's in beta


[23-Feb-22 02:50 AM] gcharang#6833
it is as safe as any other mobile wallet can be. best practice is to store only trading funds on there and using a hardware wallet for long term storage

Thefe are some LP having connection issues some others might be offline and some imo are playing games


[02-Mar-22 11:57 PM] Jimm B.#9993
Is a kind of reputation system possible so that you can quickly identify good/bad LP's?
Or are there other ideas how to label bad LPs?
or will that remain part of a DEX forever?ü§î


[02-Mar-22 11:59 PM] Jimm B.#9993
as it becomes more popular, so will the number of people who play games and waste people's time i think.


[03-Mar-22 05:39 AM] smkhound#7640
there is a pubkey ban for misbehaving nodes, though it resets when you restart the app


[03-Mar-22 08:41 AM] Jimm B.#9993
Yes I know.  but is there anything else planned in this regard?


[03-Mar-22 08:47 AM] Jimm B.#9993
The ban isn't very helpful because it also "punishes" unintentionally failed swaps, as I've experienced myself.  so I was thinking of some kind of reputation system.  large LPs would be immediately recognizable and could be preferred if you want to be sure


[03-Mar-22 08:51 AM] Jimm B.#9993
it would be nice to be able to rule out the LP is not playing games and wasting my time.


[03-Mar-22 08:58 AM] Jimm B.#9993
spontaneous idea ... the maker has the possibility to "freeze" some KMD as security.  this will be visible to other users, e.g. with a star.  and gives the certainty that the maker is reputable.  should the swap fail because of the maker, a small portion of the "frozen" KMD would go to the taker as compensation.


[03-Mar-22 09:02 AM] Jimm B.#9993
Of course, that would also be possible the other way around.  that makers will only accept takers who have frozen KMD as collateral.  but I think this goes against the principle of not forcing anyone to use KMD.

[07-Mar-22 08:19 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
How about blacklisting obvious bad actors?
For those crying about decentralization / censorship or whatever, allow an option in the settings "allow all maker orders" or "disable blacklist" but have it turned on by default

Btw, I want to warn the community. When somebody has a problem, a scammer is immediately jumping into the DM, saying that he/she is from Komodo team and asking for the wallet privkeys by saying that he/she will help. Community should be careful. You just immediately report that as spammer. Beware! Don't give anybody your keys. Your keys are your coins!
