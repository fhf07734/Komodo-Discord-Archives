Atomic swaps are generating a lot of buzz in the blockchain world. It‚Äôs not uncommon to hear them called ‚Äúthe future of crypto trading.‚Äù But you might not know exactly what atomic swaps are, how they work, or why they‚Äôre important.

Well, to put it very simply, here are the three most important points to understand about atomic swaps:

**One**. They‚Äôre peer-to-peer trades of cryptocurrencies made directly from one user to another, blockchain-to-blockchain. No centralization, proxy tokens, escrow services, or other third parties necessary. 

**Two**. In total, there are 5 steps to an atomic swap and the swaps are designed so that each party has an incentive to continue with the trade as agreed, throughout every step in the process.

**Three**. Together, all of this means that atomic swaps are a safer and cheaper way to trade cryptocurrencies, when compared to centralized exchanges.
