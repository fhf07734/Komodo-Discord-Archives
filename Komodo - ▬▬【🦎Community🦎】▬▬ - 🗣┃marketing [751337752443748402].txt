Hello Community,

I thought it would be a great idea to start this channel again, given all the marketing-related concerns. This new marketing channel gives us a platform to address all concerns now and in the future. I am also looking to use this channel unfiltered marketing updates and to bounce-off ideas.

As I have stated already, as the new director of marketing, I am looking to guide our marketing back on its community roots ‚Äì so that we become a truly a community-driven project. That means we will have a lot more community discussions, community collaboration, and increased transparency. I believe we already have that in our culture, and it's just about switching the lights back on. However, it always takes time to change processes and nurture a culture ‚Äì and so I am taking a slow & steady approach with one chance, tweak, or addition at a time. 

I hope this channel isn't a one-way street, but there are also many community-collaboration and initiatives. You won't need the Komodo team's permission to start your project or initiative. I am happy to see and support all initiatives that help Komodo reach new people ‚Äì or that provide more value to our existing community.

I will be extremely occupied in the coming days and weeks, though, and won't have as much time to spend here as I would like to. I want to be as accessible as possible, and you guys can talk to me on Discord anytime ‚Äì¬†it just might be that for now, I have delays in responses, and I might have just quickly skimmed through some of the conversations.

If there's a need for a community discussion, we can have more of those. I have created a new category called 'Discussion Sprints.' That will include temporary community talks that last for several days, with a clear intention to reach a conclusion on a given topic. Someone has to introduce the topic, guide the discussion, and provide a summary/conclusion after it is up. 

If there's interest, we can create more of those discussions, but whoever brings up a topic should be willing and able to host the discussion too.

I am looking to share marketing updates and my thinking here. These will be more unfiltered writings, though, and they are subject to change. I am writing these, so everyone understands what is going on, and hopefully, they spark further ideas, discussions, and initiatives. 

My writings here are not "marketing messages" that I intend to share outside of our community. The way I see it, I am wiring for the active & passionate community members here, and I am looking to shine some light into what we are currently working on and what our challenges might be.

Let's see how it goes!

**What's been going on this week?**

I have worked long hours to form a situation overview of what's going on. I have had plenty of 1on1 calls with our team members to update everyone and to let them update me.

I have also built an alignment with our team about the general marketing direction I want to go to, and everyone is fully on-board about our new community focus.

We also hosted the AtomicDeFi community discussion. We are yet to review the discussion as a team, which won't be happening before next week.

I have also had many ideas, and there are many things I would like to do and start. However, time and resources are limited. My number one challenge is to select what to prioritize and where to start.

At the moment, the top priority in my head is to get clarity on our brand architecture. To me, it also seemed to be the conclusion of the community talk this week. The goal is to write a short overview document that outlines our product-brands and how we talk about them, and that way, we build full alignment with our team and the community.

I am still leading the Komodo internship team too. I am meeting with the interns every day from Monday to Friday. I am pleased to say that we have successfully transitioned from the "discover & brainstorm" phase to the "let's roll our sleeves and get started" phase.

I am very excited about what's to come and try to move as fast as possible, tackling one thing at a time. However, I do suspect I might be too optimistic about the time it will take. I also want to caution everyone that days/weeks go by fast. However, I am looking to write frequent updates and keep everyone on the loop.

Today we are looking at our newsletter. We are looking to change the format a little bit ‚Äì so it is more personalized. We also want to make it shorter and easily digestible. @Delton is actively thinking of the newsletter, and you can tag him with your ideas & feedback ‚Äì¬†now and in the future.

My view is that the people reading these newsletters are busy people who might spend 10 seconds on one email before jumping to the next one. Thus, we are looking to provide a better overview for them to understand what our newsletter is about to decide within a few seconds if they want to keep reading.

Keep your eyes for the monthly newsletter today! Let us know what you think. We can make any changes for next month's newsletter and keep improving it.

In Defi - are all technologies going to be "Atomic"?? some will be subatomic.... I personally suggest removing atomic and maybe going with DexDefi or just leaving it alone for a bit .. *Komodo DexDefi* "Built on Atomic Swap technology" covers the bases.  or  just Komodo DeFi...this shit has been on my mind.... I really hope it gets well thought out

Yes all are utxo based, atomic and totally p2p.

In 2018 jl777 developed derivatives, synthetics and pegs on top of the utxo model. They use antara tech layer to extend BTC protocol.

DexDefi is a good name. Sounds with testify.

The newsletter was a pleasant read.

Making the dev tech accessible for the community to use is key. It already is in action with alpha/beta atomicdex.

It was a hit with ROGUE, it can be gamified with synthetics for community use and alpha testing.

the top links are dead on the newsletter, may just be my security settings on iOS but they work farther down the page.  I like the focus on education. The puzzles CA333 did were pretty cool. maybe we could do blockchain trivia with a reward for correct answers. Maybe it's just my nerd level but the mm1 stress testing was pretty fun with the orderbook hidden  bargains, bounties, etc. there is so much tech in development that it seems like there are some opportunities for more stuff like that. challenging things that can bring in crypto enthusiasts and devs.

@Audo my take away from watching a few of the videos from founders that have made it, the bigger the problem that we have a solution for, the more shitty the MVP we can get out and people are still ok with it.

If we have 1 user, AtomicDEX is launched.  We have something that works but we are not focusing on liquidity, we need to ask what problem are we solving and for whom (ie, All KMD eco system coins to trade between each other flawlessly) in the short term. We cannot solve cross chain atomic swaps for everyone if we cannot even solve the current pain points for our community. 

Also is there plans to offer some sort of referral program for trades made via the app? This way people will shill it to earn money, this is how the big sites have done it.

on the binance mobile app (maybe futures only) there is a "share this" that is quite cool.
it shows, current price & ROI for the current position on a trade.


[06-Sep-20 10:23 PM] Mylo#8306
being able to share that (privately or publicly) would be cool.  e.g. i just swapped XYZ <-> KMD atomically at <rate>

no need to show amounts, only rate.

I'd like to also suggest a periodic update of the roadmap. Also I'm not even sure how to find the roadmap on the website without just knowing the url, ie. where's the roadmap button/link located?

[08-Sep-20 08:12 AM] Mylo#8306
roadmap is good, but the road of pioneering is extremely hard to forecast, including r&d, testing, refinement etc.


[08-Sep-20 08:47 AM] Regnar#6164
right, but things that have some progress shouldn't be sitting at 0%


[08-Sep-20 08:49 AM] Regnar#6164
there should be an effort to maintain the roadmap, which isn't an easy task I don't think, it involves probably monthly reaching out to different groups and getting progress updates.


[08-Sep-20 08:52 AM] Regnar#6164
Ideally, there is a point of contact for each element in the roadmap, they are the "lead" and basically once a month (or so) send a status update to whomever is maintaining the roadmap itself. This way the leads who likely have a better "guess" of end dates, can say "hey we are probably half way done, because X Y Z"
They could also just pick a conservative end date/goal (say 12 months away) and if progress is being made they just give the "yup, progress is moving along, no number though" and the roadmap just increases their progress by 1/12, or 8%


[08-Sep-20 09:47 AM] Mylo#8306
in years gone by, i would have agreed.
but p2p development is a different beast.
and to place an end date, puts out an expectation.
expectation leads to pressure/deadlines/remorse/hostility.

i agree some kind of indication of what is being worked on, but this can already be done by looking at the github and reporting on it, by anyone.


[08-Sep-20 10:50 AM] Audo#5667
@Regnar agreed, we have to do something about the roadmap. It's on my list. I would like to upgrade the format and simplify it. That's an item for later. For now we don't want to draw any attention to it either. 

I don't want to update it because I want to upgrade it. This roadmap task has two dependencies 1) we have to review our product brand architecture, and 2) there are ongoing discussions about our bigger vision & direction that will affect the roadmap.

:KMD:  **What are we working on this week?** üëÄ 

Time for another quick update.

During this week, I have had time to start forming a bigger picture of the situation. The result is that we have two high-priority items that we must finish before we continue to anything else.

1) Brand Architecture Review
2) Messaging Framework

We are working on these two tasks in parallel, although the brand architecture review must be completed before we can finalize the messaging framework.

Just today, we had our first marketing call about brand architecture. It was an excellent conversation, but we were short on time, and it will continue tomorrow. We are taking into account all the discussions and the community vibes we also got from the #atomicdefi-discussion. 

Once we reach some conclusions and map out our options within the marketing team, we will hear out the wider Komodo team. Finally, we will present the possibilities or a full solution to the broader community for final feedback & review.

These two tasks will form the proper platform for us to do some actual marketing. There are two deliverables we will share with everyone publicly.

--> Komodo Brand Architecture: Overview of Komodo product brands (goal is to remove brand obfuscation)
--> Komodo Messaging Framework: basic information and descriptions about our project and the product brands. (goal is to get us all to speak the same language)

After these two are completed, we can start crafting together marketing campaigns and maintain consistency in marketing.

[08-Sep-20 07:47 PM] Komodefi#5638
One of the main arguments against kmd seems to be that its (semi)centralized. Having 64 notary nodes is unique to this ecosystem. Making the case for the system could be a good fudbuster. It's a point of contention and a common criticism in other communities.


[08-Sep-20 08:07 PM] Mylo#8306
it is also secured by bitcoin.  the 64 nodes are equivalent to 64 mining pools in that those 64 nodes generate 75% of the new blocks in a round robin.  in the cosmos ecosystem, the validator node numbers are less for many projects. and validation is centralized.  the notary nodes observe hashes from the network consensus.


[08-Sep-20 08:35 PM] Komodefi#5638
I didn't know that. That seems more centralized than kmd


[08-Sep-20 08:36 PM] Komodefi#5638
that could be a marketing angle


[08-Sep-20 08:41 PM] Komodefi#5638
cosmos touts that they have the most scalable, interoperable, and most powerful platform on their website.


[08-Sep-20 08:47 PM] Mylo#8306
scalability comes about  with centralization.
they have 6s blocks as well by default.

kmd has 1 minute blocks, but smart chains can be configured to have shorter blocks.   the same 4MB blocksize, so if you were to make 10s blocktimes, the tx rate is increased.

the neat thing with cosmos is the way users can delegate their funds towards a validator. the validator then uses this delegation for voting.  the delegation by the user also allows them to earn for each block.  but ultimately block production comes from validators.  cosmos has 154 validators currently it seems, https://cosmos.fish/leaderboard/all
kava has 89 https://kava.bigdipper.live/validators
likecoin 14, https://likecoin.bigdipper.live/validators

it's cool anyone can become a validator.


[08-Sep-20 08:52 PM] Mylo#8306
the kmd NN voting is like political sortition.


[08-Sep-20 08:52 PM] Mylo#8306
anyone can start a new notary network to notarize to kmd.  e.g. smartchain -> KMD.


[08-Sep-20 08:53 PM] Mylo#8306
but the KMD -> BTC is the komodo ecosystem seasonal sortition based on performance.


[08-Sep-20 08:58 PM] Komodefi#5638

@Deleted User It's a tongue in cheek joke.   The elusive jl777 which doesn't take calls shows up in a tweet mentioning a private call opperunity but somehow it still can't be done.  When you click the reply it shows that only people who @komodoplatform mentioned can reply to the post.  It's memetic and meant to target exposure.  It's a little out there as far as 'proffessional humor' goes, but the metrics of retweet and likes speaks for itself and the SMM is searching for best engagement practices atm.

These can range across quotes, retweets, likes, time of day/week/quarter, reply/direct engagement, metathread/threading, tags, etc
My earlier reference was purely to superficial looks at quotes, retweets, and likes.

The forum has to provide value to our community. We will launch it small and not make too much noise about it.

After all it's up to you how you want to move forward, but i see that there's is a lot of focus on things that aren't important right now. Like this forum. Or name of a newsletter which i couldn't care less when I receive one.

While Komodo's brand awareness is down the toilet. Very few people actually heard about Komodo in the crypto space, and even less knows what it can actually offer. 
New devs and projects should be popping up every week considering what Komodo is offering, where are they? 
Do decent development bounties for devs, get them to make PoC apps with KMD tech, which you can build your marketing on. 
A random guy who creates a post on a forum for a 10 KMD bounty won't get Komodo anywhere for you. It doesn't add value. 

I am not a marketing expert to say where did it go wrong, but I see whatever is happening is not working. 
Feel free to disagree with me at any point, this is just my honest opinion about what i've experienced this year so far.

One more thing to add, when I discovered Komodo it was the BaterDex stress test, that was a good marketing move, sucked me into Komodo and it's tech. 
Since that day, I didn't see one move here that i would have jump on like I did on that. (except atomicDEX stress test but it's basically the same thing, and except James's brilliant new developments and ideas, he's pretty much the only reason i am still here)

Feedback noted. We aren't focused on creating a new forum or newsletter though. Our focus this week is on brand architecture and messaging framework. We spend one day last week to create the newsletter, and that is because we have made a commitment to send a mounthly update.

I am trying to involve the community and find way to let people help out. Launching the forum is one way. Regardless, we are closing down the portal as the pay day is approaching and we won't renew.


[11-Sep-20 02:46 AM] jorian#4555
we had a discourse forum before, what makes you think it will succeed now?


[11-Sep-20 02:47 AM] jorian#4555
if you do the discourse forum, you should push the complete dev team to start working there too. be an example of some sorts


[11-Sep-20 02:47 AM] jorian#4555
most importantly: a section to shill a business, like the ANN threads in bitcointalk


[11-Sep-20 02:49 AM] jorian#4555
but seeing the size of our current 'community' i dont think another place will help the branding of Komodo


[11-Sep-20 02:59 AM] Mylo#8306
Integrating discourse with ikomodo.com or some other blog/website so a discussion can be created around content.  Howtos etc.


[11-Sep-20 03:00 AM] Oszy#5734
I agree with jorian here.

Komodo has 1 commercial product, atomicDEX which can be marketed to the average people.
Then there are the business products, the development tools ,smart chains, dex-API, oracles, CC's,  dPow, which can be marketed for the rest (devs, tech experts)

I can only see the commercial part being pushed from time to time, whereas the business side could bring more value and income to the project. 

Having a nice community is a great thing but that's not the main thing will bring this project to success.


[11-Sep-20 03:00 AM] jorian#4555
@Mylo not sure i agree. then we are going to create yet another place. even more confusion for newcomers and it definitely doesn't do the branding any good

that was one of the reason I started Shurli under Meshbits instead of pursuing KMD team, coz initially it is using golang+HTML/JS/CSS stack in proof of concept stage. And this is the stack that I'm more efficient with as comparison to golang+Flutter.
My fear was that KMD team will not accept it and will deny adding this code stack coded app in official apps, so I didn't even ask or expressed it.
At this moment, the next version of PoC2 of Shurli can already be bundled in golang based Electron app and work like a Desktop application, but I'll try to move my attention to Flutter based app once the initial PoC is considered easily testable.

ethereum was aiming for a 'cheap coin' from the start. I think it's probably because young vitalik was easily misled by criticism from mainstream economists (currencyists) who criticized bitcoin's deflationary nature.

at the height of the ethereum boom in 2017, people around me were so persistent about ethereum that I asked my opinion. at that time, ethereum was soaring 50 times. few of the people I asked back to know that ethereum was produced indefinitely.

no matter how good the marketing is, if the volume is poured out, it is hard for the market to digest. vitalik seems to have admired the wisdom of Satoshi Nakamoto, who gave bitcoin scarcity as he matured.

Ethereum will switch to PoS this fall and next spring. Given PoS's system and market and participants' desires, the long-term stability is beyond my forecast as a nonlinear mathematics.

However, PoS has the effect of giving scarcity to Ethereum's main coin Ethereum. I'll figure out why, if you think about it a little bit.

What's different from Bitcoin and Ethereum stocks is the fact that Bitcoin is increasing at every moment, but so far eth has not done so while Bitcoin respects old stocks.

Now, if we added not only the usefulness of the platform but also the scarcity of coins, should we buy eth from now on? In the long run, it is still hard to reach a conclusion, but I think it will not be bad for a one to two year investment.

@‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª there won't be a migration. the forum will be an alternative, google able , appreciating resource that will be useful for years to come if mainatained properly. The least and best of its use will be to function as a comment section for our docs, tutorials and an upgraded blog in the future. We could also handle user support through there when atomicDEX gets more mainstream users. All of this is in discussions and will be enabled slowly once the forum is launched.

The portal provided a valuable lesson.

The forum will have a very simple & straightforward structure, and then it's up to the forum community how the structure evolves.

Komodo Brand Architecture Review ‚Äì Part I
An ad-hoc video update for the Komodo community from the Komodo marketing team.

Recorded on September 12, 2020
https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/95Kob3Nt0ONc697AWJpLYQLmiZwjCG2z78MKru9JoOc/https/i.ytimg.com/vi/qjLa2zQGrLA/sddefault.jpg

I think I remember it being a point to make AtomicDEX appear standalone, as there might be issues other coin projects have with getting on and using it, but dPoW is heavily a Komodo project. I think however this is backwards.

It appears other coin projects are more likely to want collaboration on things that are additional features, but not core components, like consensus. Relying on a 3rd party for core components of your blockchain might make it seem like you can't handle it on your own, that you need to rely on other teams, which can undermine confidence in the core devs. So we see projects either trying to bake their own solution or just ignoring 51% attacks. This I think is a case against a strong Komodo branded dPoW. The other option is to build an even stronger reputation as an interoperability project to counter the `monolitisk` brand structure of dPoW, but it doesn't seem like both strategies would work.

As for AtomicDEX, as it is a standalone looking application it would be easier to pull closer to the core brand but the original reasoning was we didn't want people to think it was some proxy token exchange, or rely on KMD and scare off listings. But I now don't think that is ever the case. I haven't really seen any coins NOT wanting to get listed on an exchange that was just wrapping their coins in a token anyway. The other concern was with 3rd parties deciding not to build on the core, but again, I don't think this will be an issue based on what we've seen

I don't understand why Audo, who hasn't made any progress in marketing, stays in marketing team. 
Steve, Daniel, and Tss all seem to have left Komodo. 
How do you stay on the team without success? 
I think it's been more than three years since Audo said we're heading in the right direction.


[12-Sep-20 05:57 AM] Regnar#6164
can you define marketing progress for me @Deleted User ?


[12-Sep-20 05:59 AM] Deleted User#0000
@Regnar an activity to efficiently provide goods or services to consumers in order to meet their needs, while responding to changes in circumstances.
market research, merchandising plans, propaganda, sales, etc
"Market trading," "market management."


[12-Sep-20 06:00 AM] Regnar#6164
that's marketing. you said he hasn't made any progress, by what metric hasn't he made progress


[12-Sep-20 06:00 AM] Regnar#6164
because it really comes down to that, what metrics you are viewing when you say there is or isn't progress.


[12-Sep-20 06:16 AM] Audo#5667
When I joined the team I didn't have any actual marketing experience. I joined as a community manager with the goal of trying to keep everyone up to date about the progress. I was also doing user support and various things like that.

I have been learning over the years. I have been reading books and tried to think how what I read would apply to Komodo and to our situation. I am now trying to apply to my ideas into Komodo and the marketing, and I have the full support of the Komodo team. 

I am looking to make tons of progress in a short time and keep everyone üíØ updated about it. Let's see what happens!

plus I am also working with a consultant that can validate my thoughts and educate me on some things that I might not have the full grasp of yet.

[12-Sep-20 10:35 AM] Audo#5667
oh yeah, sure we can make a marketing introduction later. In fact, I would like to run a full series of team intros as a campaign.

We won't be doing anything extra until we reach a clear decision about Komodo brand architecture. We will deliver documents publicly that will outline what our products are and how they are described.

Step #1. Create a proposal to simplify Komodo brand architecture: 
 ----> Goal: Remove brand obfuscation 

Step #2. Release a document that explains how Komodo and all the product brands are described & explained
 ----> Goal: We all describe and talk about Komodo in the same way

Step #3. Plan a marketing campaign for the upcoming stress test 
 ----> Goal: It becomes clear what's happening on Komodo and where our focus is

The old team moved to catch other opportunities. I don't want to put any words to their mouth.

As the result I was the best person to step-up. I involved a third party to work closely with me during this transition period, and he has a lot of marketing & management experience. 

"restart marketing" ‚Äì I like that term! That's what I feel we are indeed doing.

In evaluating the brand architecture,  it might be helpful to list the other main projects in the kmd ecosystem and how they fit in the puzzle as well. Where as Kmd could do certain things, it chooses not to in favor of the ecosystem coins. Verus and Pirate as two examples.

@‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª as far as i understand it, the first task is for the products/services directly under the control of komodo ... 
there will also eventually highlight on the endorsed ecosystem projects but that isn't the primary goal of the komodo brand architecture revisal currently... 
considering @Audo 's 3 steps above, they are very local to Komodo specifically... Audo can explain more exactly though if need be...
your point is important though... leveraging the amazing ecosystem built using komodo is an opportunity that should not be dismissed... I think it will be addressed

@‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª this is a good point and what came up during our community hangout too.

Name is not as important as brand consistency. I assume you get the point however. We need eyes on our brand. Having an open source micro computer that uses low power and is meant to stay on is pretty cool. I personally don't want the dex on my phone. Some probably don't mind. I'm running aDex on live linux Ubuntu and it's really awesome so I'm assuming it will work on a raspberry pi or something similar. However, it's on a big old laptop and the laptop takes up unnecessary space hence smaller. Even if it is offered as a diy, I'd still want one.


[13-Sep-20 08:51 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
The reason why I chose the Shurli-server and a GUI client model archiceture for my application. It'd be possible to setup 2 on flexible setup. Chose it an old laptop, desktop, cloud vps, IoT device to setup Shurli-server and connect client to this server from any other devices.


[13-Sep-20 08:52 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
I think the same must be possible with existing AtomicDEX setup too, with a bit of modification.


[13-Sep-20 08:56 PM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
As an interesting marketing angle. Say there was a diy kit that could be sold on amazon. AtomicDex would flash up in people's search, and cost to us, very little.

I'm not saying do the sneaky stuff that facebook and Google does, but we need more of the rick and morty type of chains. The old adage is you have to give to get. Why can't we create digital assets to just give away as a form of digital promotion swag. People love free stuff, even if it isn't worth anything. Launch an asset chain called treasure chain that periodically gives a nft or token gift to your wallet regularly to keep your attention.

[13-Sep-20 11:05 PM] tolken#2655
I think if you‚Äôre going to give away something, give away like that, give something like what Redfox is doing. NFTs that have some value. Imagine having some NFTs, some actually include keys to unlock a pool of KMD. To encourage participation, the NFTs expire if not claimed within a reasonable time period. So for example, if you give out a promotional NFT worth 100,000kmd, you could ensure it‚Äôs received by someone - they have to actively claim it, or it reverts back to the Komodo team to issue out again.

Thank you @thebaselinetest !

This gives me also a chance to introduce you to the community. @thebaselinetest has been working with us for a month now and has brought in a lot of energy and ideas!

During his first month, he focused on Twitter and caused a noticeable change and contrast to our old way of interacting (or not interacting) on Twitter. Some people thought we went crazy (maybe we did), and a few even asked if we got hacked. :)

I have told @thebaselinetest that I am üíØ in support of trying out new things and testing what works and what doesn't. What do you guys think about this new SM approach?

As stated a month ago, we also have this new policy to work more in the open. Let us know if you like this direction and if we should go more in this direction.

If you would like to help @thebaselinetest out, you can contribute to our next 1 FACT = 1 RT Friday campaign by finding DeFi facts. More info: https://discordapp.com/channels/412898016371015680/453203596494766099/761207699236192286

I beg, plead and implore you to NOT use ethereum for tokenization if stocks.  
@KomodoPlatform is a MUCH better solution.
With INFINITELY scaleable chains and custom fees.
Tokens for ALL stocks could launch in a month with high security.

This is not a mere theoretical story in science blogs. It's happening daily in many countries with the post-dated cheque culture as analog blockchain on papers. It's worth trillion USD in real economies. We will make online demo tomorrow on international level to show that it is a reality with Marmara Credit Loops. 

We are planning to start a credit loop in studio on live TV Show. We will issue and transfer to second person in studio. Then we will transfer the credit to Russia. Then it will be transferred to Belgium and finally back to studio in ƒ∞stanbul. You can see that Komodo Platform is well suited to create an advanced independent smart Chain with a set of very complex DeFi structure designed to run in real economy.

We finished a credit loop between 3 countries, Turkey, Russia, Belgium and Turkey again. The credit was issued in Turkey and came back to Turkey after transferred to Russia first and then Belgium. Thanks to Komodo technologies. We finished it within 40 blocks.

Any ideas on what you'd like to see for 1 RT = 1 Fact Friday.

I'm leaning towards engineering quotes or a list of people in a certain topic.

I'm open to community feedback though.

Keep in mind DeFi as a broad topic don't perform too well. Could narrow it down.

The twitter change was cute and all at the start, thought we were drumming up attn for the dex release, but now its getting a bit cringe.


[18-Oct-20 11:03 PM] Mylo#8306
yeah.  you have one trick.  learn another.  this was introduced as trying new things out.  so _try new things out_.

my thoughts on it are not to comment on it, but i definiltey do not check twitter anymore.

when i first saw the komodo facts/retweet campaign, i felt confused, contempt, digusted.  but then i read about the cute change in direction of marketing, and my reaction was subdued. "they are trying something in a field (SM) i have no idea about, good.  better than not trying" was my thoughts.

the reason i was confused: totally unrelated content.  (but maybe this is strategy to get different eyeballs in.)
the reason i had contempt: similar, totally irrelevant content.
the reason i feld disgusted: all year my blog has been creating content for komodo community and not a single retweet when i was bothering with SM.  i have quit pushing SM stuff because of very little collaboration from community.  the disgusted part was the ridiculous tweet storm of garbage <-- which now i understand as part of the strategy to be more approachable/new-audience etc.

as harsh as üëÜ might sound, that's how i felt at the time prior to understanding what was going on.  atm, i'm not playing along with the marketing concepts, i have no energy to put towards helping try things out.  go ahead and try them, then when there is some solid strategy, let the community know i guess ü§∑  it will be nice to know how to contribute better.

There's no way this isn't going to repel a large portion of the market. If I showed my family or friends Komodo's feed after hyping them up, they would think I'm investing in a scam or at the very least a very unprofessional project. Most recent posts are infomercials and tweets about meme contests.

Some thoughts...

01 Reading through comments. The first thing we might want to decide in any team or group is how we make decisions... is it opinion, experience or with data? Here is September's report if you're interested in data: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CxKS9fsi98B79Ax-R5CaXinCnHFpoz7TMzc1EAruEgI/edit#slide=id.g96c2ee9cda_0_41.

02 What is Twitter's role in the marketing stack? It's at the beginning of the funnel, and the remit or goal given was to increase 'engagement.' The question is, 'who are we trying to engage?' and my assumption is a broader audience of users than we currently have because we're focused on AtomicDEX. Therefore, we're not writing for ourselves or how we'd feel if we read what we wrote. Does that make sense? 

QUESTION: Who you think we want to attract and what can you point to in terms of what works for them? Share your ideas to help us reach a consensus as a group. 

03 The challenge is keeping Twitter active and fun. Good community content and interesting team updates help that! We're going through a big transition in terms of the news about KYC etc... and Twitter is not a content strategy. It's an engagement tactic and what we're trying are weekly habits and rituals. "1 RT = 1 Fact Friday" is an example. 

QUESTION: What rituals and weekly habits would you like to see, and are you willing to contribute your time and effort to make them happen? 

04 Final point: I advocate for a culture of citizenship where people are willing to own an outcome. Being part of the solution, championing an idea, and contributing to making it happen is what open innovation is about. This is a good video about the 'hard parts of open source' worth watching https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_4EX4dPppA. 

In summary, who is willing to do more than have an opinion? Who will put their hand up and work with me?

"The Hard Parts of Open Source" by Evan Czaplicki
As more people enter /r/elm and the Elm discourse, I have thought a lot about how "online communities" work. Patterns of conflict. Why those patterns exist. Structures that would diffuse that conflict in healthy ways. Initially I just wanted to get yelled at less, but I instea...

I'd like to see us move from 'this is bad/good' to 'let's try this idea and see whether it performs better than these other ideas' and use data to decide.

And when you suggest an idea, be willing to make it happen. Then I can run the test with @Audo's approval.


[19-Oct-20 02:27 AM] ohweoh.tez#9761
@thebaselinetest your tweet uptick was most likely because people were like "Oh Komodo's acting different, maybe they are up to something IE The Dex is releasing." I think the hype fizzled on that, and now people like myself are wondering what is the end goal? Personally my feed is bombarded with Defi projects in this space, types of dragons, memes, and i really have no idea what it up now, something about tech or agriculture?


[19-Oct-20 02:39 AM] ohweoh.tez#9761
We are  riding all time lows. Those marketing stats are after one month of a pretty dormant account awakening also. 

 I think if we are going to be doing stuff like that, lets have a product out and engage with the community with first. Then we can see if the change was for the best. Right now we are clearly having an identity crisis.  

80 % of crypto is the degen gambler edgy/ funny 4chan mentality. (blue kirby, rug pull, pickle finance, lein, link, rlc, kleros)
20% is dev/programmer/finance minded people. (insert your own coins, not gonna shill)

We were that 20%, didn't matter about frequency of tweets or engagement. Ppl knew we were block nerds. Now, I have no clue, our team has stated they want out help.


[19-Oct-20 02:53 AM] Audo#5667
The main feedback I am hearing is that the content should be a bit closer to Komodo/blockchain.

For full transparency, I would like to say that due to our current workload, we haven't had time to set up a proper support structure for @thebaselinetest, through which he would receive more grass-roots info about what's going on and what he could be Tweeting about. Once we have such a system in place, the content will naturally shift to include much more Komodo/blockchain related information.

For the time being, I still feel we should explore and try things as @thebaselinetest has a vision, and he wants to try different things. It takes several weeks to try out the habit-forming content approach. We need more data.

If there are members who would like to help @thebaselinetest by finding raw content he could use on Twitter, please reach out. We could turn this into a community effort ‚Äì but we need a bit of time to figure out how this all would work.


[19-Oct-20 02:53 AM] Audo#5667
_ _
One idea/approach we have been thinking of is to create different Twitter accounts for different purposes. That way everyone can follow the type of content they like.

Example: developer content, or a Twitter account for each product brand
Example: community content, more fun & engaging tweets towards users
Example: AtomicDEX Twitter for the users (we already have this)

--> and then the main Twitter retweets everything

is komodo trying to be like anyone else?  if so, do what they're doing, follow them.   
is komodo trying to just be itself?   then do whatever makes you komodo
on the technical side of things, there are plenty of documentations from where short quotes can be pulled that are relevant to the tech offerings and capabilities of komodo platform
...also, having a talk on discord with team members about komodo can yield quotes too

[19-Oct-20 08:15 AM] Jcharming#2693
I'm going to answer a few questions here to help bring some understandings in-line with what is going on, and address what sounds like might be possible concerns budding. 

@debaas The goal of 1RT = 1 Fact is to foster engagement across multiple threads on twitter, actionable by a response format.   The reason for which is to create wider dispersion of Komodo across multithreaded feeds.  
In this kind of connection it only matter that Komodo handle gets wider dispersion,  as inviduals see it/engage with it more they come here, slide into DM's on twitter, or start to join in other Komodo content that is more relevant to the project on twitter.  

Alice like 1 RT = 1 Fact, she starts noticing Komodo more, but her attention for noticing Komodo isn't relegated only 2 Fridays because she's on twitter every day. 
On saturday she see's the same Komodo that she enjoyed responding to the thread on friday about release information regarding the project they are working on.  
Alice **now curious about Komodo content** opens the link and reads about AtomicDEX and retweets garnering engagement on her own channel starting conversations and multi-threads with Barbara and Charlie as to what this 'new active member in their space' has going on. This is a power engagement technique.


[19-Oct-20 08:20 AM] Jcharming#2693
@ohweoh.tez This is the mutli-fold problem when it comes to social engagement that you're wrapping into 1 things.  
>  thought we were drumming up attn for the dex release, but now its getting a bit cringe.
Concerning engagement and dispersion over a topic/idea this is solved is solved not in a 1 step problem but a 2 step fashion. 
1) Drumming up attention, 
2) Directing that attention to a desired outlet. 

Both have to be satisfied and ideally they happen in 1 motion, however that is rarely the case as audience building through exposure tactics is usually step 1 and then the actual content is inter woven when we come into potential audiences field of view.


[19-Oct-20 08:28 AM] Jcharming#2693
@Mylo 
> the reason i was confused: totally unrelated content.  (but maybe this is strategy to get different eyeballs in.)
That's exactly what this strategy connects around. 

Something to consider as we move along and create more refined strategies is that we (project activists) only get to decide part of the equation when it comes to engagement.  The part we get to solve changes and evolves and isn't even written in stone itself.  
The part we don't get to solve is usually *the form* we engage over.   A lot of it is about staying relevant across major threads.  

And a lot of this is syndicating techniques that are already being perused and made familiar by projects that have larger engagement audiences. 
For example if there is a tik-tok craze that is sweeping through, -as cringe as it may be- if Komodo produces **some** (not all) content on a regular basis staying relevant people will then also notice and nod to the information that they don't connect to as easily because they have developed a sense of 'familiarity' with seeing and even RT/participating in Komodo content threads they do get.  

We give a little of what the world is interested in to say closer to their threads & DM's, and they give a little of what we're interested in at Komodo and connect over it.

> There's no way this isn't going to repel a large portion of the market. If I showed my family or friends Komodo's feed after hyping them up, they would think I'm investing in a scam or at the very least a very unprofessional project. Most recent posts are infomercials and tweets about meme contests.
@ohweoh.tez 

It truly depends on what you show them.  There are tweets and engagement threads on BitMEX and info around that which will repel my investor groups for example.  As a result I'm not going to show them that.  Or BitMEX in general. I will share relatable content.  For the tech heavy/dev heavy audience I'll show them that, for the 'I've never heard of crypto audience' I'll show them things they can actually participate in 'I've already shared Komodo twitter to some of that audience and recieved positive feedback working the angle of 'crypto is scary?  Just start by following Komodo they're a project that has a nice mix their twitter is doing fun stuff and it's littered through the week with CryptoCurrency concepts, many beginner level questions and answers. 

The feedback I received was it is the 'content they actually *can* grasp which kept them around long enough to finally click on the information *they can't grasp* as readily.  
If audience members like what you're doing and have something to connect to they will stick around and start to examine the parts they don't, to try to feel more included.  

Because they have developed trust from the facilitator in other areas they do get and really like the resulting feeling, they go searching for that feeling in content that's not as readily available expecting to find it üëàüèø  This is the real backend magic that is being put in place when it comes to engagement hacking.

@ohweoh.tez 

OUR tweet uptick as a community is up, the fact that it's up at all is an excellent review.  This is our first set of metrics we have to work with, it's an easy blanket statement to say 'it's just up bc we were dormant', but just because a project is less dormant doesn't guarantee it's going to get such a boost of attention.  
Consider that today we get to complain as a community about the direction of content and engagement, instead of complaining over the fact we don't have any. üôÉ

This is repetitive feedback I'm about to give, and I want to do it to give continually clarifying feedback. the 80% have become our marketers as much as the 20% in this example.  Capitalizing on both quality and quantity is important. Anyone that is driven here to your closer community will get distilled down, anyone that isn't a at of our community and see's Komodo as a topic will then find out about us and join quality endeavors as soon as they start to engage with our other content.


[19-Oct-20 08:56 AM] ohweoh.tez#9761
Any serious investor who logs on today and sees the last 7-14 days of tweets might potentially be thrown off. They would have zero previous knowledge of the product base. 

Icant say for sure, but if i see a project i am interested in and the first thing i see is: a ghost emoji badge, tweets about memes and meme contests and infomercials gifs I would seriously question the brand/ image. 

Just saying.
No bs, I have seriously considered unfollowing the twitter account. Its just spammy at this point. I would reconsider after product launch for updates potentially.

Can we do a dev code display or ecosystem feature display? " X,Y,Z function of code on Anatra, Komodo, AtoDex does this.  Maybe tie in the incentive model mentioned by mylo here by doing a call to action to the community, "hey check out our docs/ github repo, first, second, third to find the solution to "Call transatction or what have you" wins this.

Talk about economics on chain off chain, talk about ecosystem projects. Not sure off the top off my head, ill think more in depth about it

What makes @AtomicDEX different?

You can use the same funds from a single address you control to simultaneously create 10 order book bids. 

First to fill cancels the rest.

This is something no CEX has and liquidity pools cannot do.

This is a force multiplier. https://t.co...

The liquidity multiplier has been a feature since mm1. Almost 3 years ago I think. Maybe now that pretty much anyone can try it out, it can generate some buzz.

One of these usage is not like the others,

One of these usage just doesn't belong,

Can you tell which usage motivates it's operators to seek cheaper renewable or waste energy,

It's only 2 commands to create a NFT:  Tokencreate and then you send the raw transaction.  The hard part is getting the chain installed and synced. Alot of the CC RPC calls work similar, you create a transaction and then send the raw transaction. But the CC are amazing building blocks. They are kinda like legos where you can just snap them in. Different combinations can make different things. With the coming rework of komodo platform, it would make alot of sense to provide examples of different combinations of CC that could be used to build different things. I envisioned this as recipes, that might make a fun tweet. But advertising different combinations or recipes or whatever you want to call it would be smart as people can assimilate what komodo platform is capable of without a deep read.

@Deleted User 
Q4 is a bit of a sandbox for our new push with Social Media marketing.  
Right now we're pushing decisions based off of metric markers, and currently we're getting a significantly greater dispersion into the space than we have been in the past. 

One of the issues came up concerning quality of wanting to have our twitter sound more 'official' and this was solved by a reboot of the the KMD community twitter handle which is being used to push more of (but not all of the engaging)  meme and less official sounding content towards.  https://twitter.com/KMDCommunity

Key take away here is that we're making a lot of decisions based off of metrics and 'what works and what doesn't'  The newsletter is a great way to stay in touch more intermittently with the Komodo project.  Most of twitter works not by people revisiting original, but by tweets working their way into multithreads and targeted threads and personal feeds.

@Deleted User 

Can comment on this some as well, and feel free to bring this to the townhall this week.

Feedback doesn't always look like comment replies in twitter, a lot of feedback is retweets, hearts (likes), and syndication or promotion of the original material and hashtags.  

(1) Interaction comes in many forms like retweets and likes as it's about thread dispersion. 
(2) Currently no known fake followers, but will investigate all the same. 
(3) We are exploring social media influencers and opportunities with them. 
(4) I like this, currently exploring it on reddit with the r/cryptocurrency moon options for engagement perks.  Would love to see some ideas and conversation over this if you have more @Deleted User

[26-Oct-20 01:25 PM] ejuliano#8606
also there is something to be said about frequency... likely it is that followers of kmd twitter also follow many cryptos and other handles, so the frequency can keep kmd top of mind

Following community feedback, I am pleased to report we have a 100% audit score from Twitteraudit after I ran premium search and blocked almost 8K bots! This is done to help our engagement and algo with Twitter. 

Our total followers has dropped from 104K to 96.3K but I believe this means we'll have a much healthier account and it'll lead to quicker growth because of it https://www.twitteraudit.com/KomodoPlatform

Hi


[01-Nov-20 01:04 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@marketing-team
This article leaves a bad taste in my mouth considering the recent changes to AtomicDEX.
<https://komodoplatform.com/four-core-requirements-true-dex/>

```To recap, the 4 core requirements of a DEX are that it must be:

    non-custodial
    both a cross-chain and on-chain protocol
    permissionless
    asset agnostic

If an exchange doesn‚Äôt meet these 4 criteria, then it cannot be considered a true DEX.

AtomicDEX is the only DEX in the industry that satisfies all 4 of these requirements. It supports non-custodial, peer-to-peer trading via Komodo‚Äôs cutting-edge atomic swap technology. ```

I understand that the open-source code behind it could be forked and meet all these requirements, but the article is specifically written about AtomicDEX. Which now does not meet all of those listed. Specifically:
```The second dimension of permissionless software is the absence of registration processes. Users should never need to enter personal data or submit ‚Äúknow your customer‚Äù (KYC) documents, such as government identification, proof of employment, or bank records.```

I'm not sure what you want to do with that article, but I thought I'd point it out


[01-Nov-20 01:34 AM] Deleted User#0000
Yes the officially marketed AtomicDex version is no longer a true Dex because it is not permissionless. Arguing against that is ridiculous in my opinion.

I now have lost hope in AtomicDex  bringing adoption. We will have to wait for another version (maybe from Marmara if I understand well) which could mean another couple of years..

to "circumvent" or use a non kyc version (provided you are honest and that kyc is not needed in your area / you choose not to use kyc version)

@NutellaLicka i dont see the team asking for KYC info


[01-Nov-20 01:09 AM] NutellaLicka#4241
@Deleted User not at the moment, but it is well announced that it will be brought into the official version from the Komodo team


[01-Nov-20 01:25 AM] Deleted User#0000
people from certain countries cant use the dex function, it is a big leap to say the team will do KYC


[01-Nov-20 01:26 AM] Deleted User#0000

I don't follow what you're getting at. People can use whatever they like, and claim to be from where ever they want. My discussion (pointing it out really) was about the article and how it is no longer factually correct based on changes that were introduced following the writing of it.


[01-Nov-20 02:41 AM] Deleted User#0000
can you tell me where the team said they will do KYC?

@NutellaLicka


[01-Nov-20 02:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
my point is that blocking certain countries is not KYC


[01-Nov-20 02:42 AM] Deleted User#0000
so if it is not KYC what is wrong with the post


[01-Nov-20 02:47 AM] Audo#5667
the article talks about permissionless as one of the pillars. With KYC the official version is no longer permissionless.


[01-Nov-20 02:48 AM] Audo#5667
but the tech is there and someone could maintain a permissionless version


[01-Nov-20 02:49 AM] Deleted User#0000
there will be KYC on the official version?

[01-Nov-20 03:05 AM] Deleted User#0000
KYC is bad enough, isn‚Äôt it ? Why do you insist on the difference between KYC and georestrictions ?
Adding a KYC implicitly adds a filter and restrictions based on some authority discretion... hence the system is no longer permissionless


[01-Nov-20 03:06 AM] Deleted User#0000
Unless they add a KYC and accept service for everybody regardless. But then what‚Äôs the point of the KYC...


[01-Nov-20 04:06 AM] ejuliano#8606
official atomicdex is officially restricted to millions of people based on where they are geographically...  this is not a permissionless dex anymore (that's not a complaint, simple observation)

anyways the SEC is some kind of monster that has thrown a wrench into a free global market, the US is on a very short, scary list of countries that are taking the opportunity to show how they don't believe in freedom if it remotely threatens their power structure.

Hey everybody.  This isn't even our final form for mass dispersion - in the meantime is there anything wrong with your vpn?  
Turns out the only difference between AtomicDEX being **exactly the same as ever** is a single VPN click....

This article is strong still because it's the goal. https://komodoplatform.com/four-core-requirements-true-dex/

We're not pivoting away from it, we're figuring out how to do this so it's unstoppable.  Got to stay safe to keep developing them in the meantime.

Makes a zero sense to release something that any public facing dev can be crushed beneath litigation. 

Wait till the end of Q4, I don't have anything else to say on this subject.  Either you get it or you don't right now, in the meantime we've got stuff to do.  DM me if you want to help.

I just recently found out about windows sub system for Linux, although maybe it was 2018, time's been flying by lately. But man it took me years to figure out Linux, only because I would install it and immediately start spending all my time digging deeper and deeper trying to learn how to fix it once I inevitably broke it, and after a few weeks of that I would remember what I was originally trying to accomplish and give up Linux for another year or two. Now I'm using five different flavors and I can't remember how they're all different from each other üòñ


[01-Nov-20 09:45 AM] alkimi#1111
Now with blockchains I'm back to not knowing how to diagnose problems again.  
For example, right now I have komodo running and I can view the logs but everything I do with komodo-cli gives me no stdoutput at all, not even error messages, and nothing in the log ü§î

No, thanks tho. I rebuilt komodod from the same source and it started working again.  Now I'm trying to understand the API functions like 'setaccount', 'faucet' and 'lotto' and in what context they're used here.  I have mining enabled but I don't know where the rewards would go if I somehow found a block

if you  have neither a pubkey set using `setpukey` rpc nor the daemon was started with `-pubkey` param, each block reward is sent to a new address your wallet owns

> Now I'm trying to understand the API functions like 'setaccount', 'faucet' and 'lotto' and in what context they're used here
your best bet is to go through the docs at https://developers.komodoplatform.com

cool, that's more detail than I remember seeing in the docs, that's what I've been reading for the last couple days, but a lot of the docs are lacking details beyond what is covered in the --help output, maybe I can help with that while I'm working my way through it all, to bridge the gap a little between what the docs include and what I have to ask about here or look at code to figure out

I really think we need to push on reddit and I‚Äôd be more than happy to provide some bounties on it if someone can manage it. 

I‚Äôm doing the same on another project right now but thought it would be extremely beneficial to kmd. 

1) find a few people who have enough karma to post on r/cryptocurrency

2) find a group of bounty hunters willing to upvote

3) find group who are willing to comment info on Komodo on non related Reddit‚Äôs ie ‚Äúcrypto talk of the day‚Äù ‚Äúwhat coin should I look atl

Put the group together in discord or telegram

Paid bounty weekly, keep track on spreadsheet. 

1) pay bounty to person who posts about Komodo on r/cryptocurrency 
2) share link in the group 
3) get upvotes and comments

Group 2) get them to comment information about Komodo on other threads and cross post
2) get upvoters to vote up visibility

Same can be said for facebook

We have a major major lack of exposure on the main cryptocurrency information channels, and it‚Äôs not *too* hard to start something like this up. I‚Äôm sure there are many in this community who would do it out of goodwill, and even more for a bounty

I can‚Äôt think of the last time I‚Äôve seen Komodo mentioned on reddit or Facebook. And there is definitely not a lack of content to be posted about us (developer docs, blockchain fundamentals, updates on adex, devs looking for community work, what coin does xyz)


[04-Nov-20 04:49 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
We can do as much as possible to build the community within the people already here but to reach out further we really need to be looking at reddit and Facebook imo. Constant, informative posts, constant information being easily found from reddit and Facebook, constant group of community awareness spreaders


[04-Nov-20 04:50 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
For the relatively small amount of kmd needed, I‚Äôd think that‚Äôs a good way to improve ‚Äúmarketing‚Äù

[04-Nov-20 09:07 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
apart from finding people to do it (shouldn‚Äôt be hard to find and start it up), tracking wise I was thinking people just edit a public spreadsheet or send over once a week what they‚Äôve done. Upvotes = x kmd, comments = y kmd, new threads on r/cryptocurrency = z kmd

Group chat is only for sharing links to threads or comments for upvoting and no general chat to keep it neat

HERE is October's Report: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1N32eM4clErkVdYU5SrRK5Nd9cxdhV38mQj3GlVH-aes/edit?usp=sharing.

INTRO
We surpassed our engagement rate target of 2% and averaged 3.7% (which is in fact over 520% more engagement since July/Aug).

EXEC SUMMARY
> * 01 - PR Coverage. Twitter drove 93.6% of all mentions of ‚Äú@komodoplatform, ‚ÄòKomodo Platform‚Äô and ‚ÄòAtomicDEX‚Äô coverage. What this stat means is not that I‚Äôm amazing at Twitter (thanks for thinking that) but that I‚Äôm the only one shouting about Komodo. It shouldn‚Äôt be possible For Twitter to have 93.6% of the share. 
> * 02 Better Engagement. In July/Aug audit we identified we had 0.35% and that 2020 had averaged 0.74%. Our goal was to reach 2%. In October we averaged 3.7%. We‚Äôre also seeing an increase in positive sentiment.
> * 03 Less Fake Followers. For the purposes of improving engagement we ran a deep audit on fake accounts and blocked 7,870. Twitteraudit estimates we have 100% real.
> * 04 Discord Digest GIFs drive good engagement. An issue we identified in the July/Aug audit was that our channels were siloed. We used GIFs to animate discussions from Discord.
> * 05 Trick of Tweet Contest. To support the ‚ÄòRick and Morty‚Äô campaign we ran a contest with x3 $333 prizes for people who could get no likes or RTs on a tweet. The contest generated 772 Quote RTs as well as 120 mentions of #rickandmorty in connection with Komodo. Main tweet here: https://twitter.com/KomodoPlatform/status/1322456327931760640.

WHAT'S NEXT 
> * Begin with @AtomicDEX twitter so we can separate messaging.
> * Testing better intelligence and tools to enhance our reporting.
> * Establish clearer actions that drive real value.
Thanks for reading. Please a thumbs-up if you read the report.

51% attack challenge sounds like a great marketing idea ‚Äì but at the moment the focus is on the upcoming stress test.

We recently integrated few new projects into dPoW ‚Äì and even doing that took some time as currently we have no bandwidth. Thus advertising dPoW at this very moment is not worthwhile as we might not be able to get new integrations anytime soon. It depends on their codebase and how clean it is.

P.S. We are about to announce another dPoWed project today ‚Äì¬†actually

[09-Nov-20 01:08 PM] Audo#5667
yes they said they will be sharing the post. I also saw a post from them that they should be publishing.

Notice how talking about the future use of sidechains, and possible use cases such as dexp2p streaming, file sharing for komodo shut up the naysayers?

Hi, I just looked a video on kmd composer and :
The price is very hight, if I do it myself, what's the cost of deploying my smart chain  ? Only the 365 kmd peer year? (+My own infrastructure?)


[13-Nov-20 12:00 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
You can deploy a smart chain with just a couple VPS without DPoW or Atomicdex integration .   DPoW has a cost for smartchains 5k A year for smart chains built with komodo


[13-Nov-20 12:25 PM] Gautier#6965
So what if we are trying to launch an ico and it's a fail ?


[13-Nov-20 12:27 PM] Gautier#6965
If our project works, it's not a problem to pay this bills. But It's complicated for a project before the ico to pay all of this


[13-Nov-20 12:49 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Just launch without DPoW then


[13-Nov-20 12:52 PM] Gautier#6965
But we need mm2 to make ppl buy our token


[13-Nov-20 12:52 PM] Gautier#6965
And atomicdex has a cost too, right ?


[13-Nov-20 12:54 PM] Gautier#6965
If I'm just using mm2 as an API, and I'm launching the smart chain without DPoW and some VPS, what would be the cost ? "Only" 365 kmd + 365 of our token peer years ?


[13-Nov-20 12:55 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
Atomicdex desktop just requires a pull request and the SPV infrastructure .


[13-Nov-20 12:56 PM] polycryptoblog#1173
365 of kmd and your token are the hard costs ( consumed via notarizing ) a year , there is also cost for getting it on the notaries servers.  Nothing to do with Atomicdex


[13-Nov-20 01:01 PM] Gautier#6965
Where can I see all of this cost ? I don't find this information on your website


[13-Nov-20 01:01 PM] Gautier#6965
How much would it cost for getting it on the notaries servers ? And what are they ?


[13-Nov-20 01:26 PM] lightspeed393#5403
@Gautier poly already answered that. Komodo NN's cost $5000 a year for notarizing + the 365 KMD/yourCoin. That only applies for dPoW, besides that you can launch your coin free of charge. AtomicDEX-API requires just one pull request to the coins repo. Then AtomicDEX-Desktop just requires a pull request and electrum servers.

what is the possibility of getting dgb & dogecoin heads to atomic swap?  what about qtum, komodo has a good relationship with them?  If we can get CZ binance to do an atomic swap that would be legendary?  He can get himself some VRSC and ARRR & MCL... he already has tons of KMD?  And @grewalsatinder knows antonopolous andreas needs a good introduction to the world of atomic DEX...right?

@Crabby Paddy @ejuliano 
Keep the great ideas coming!  We've got a mostly realized plan at the moment and some great stuff in mind for the stress test.
Looking forward to making initial announcements about the date and follow-up stuff about the event soon (tm)

I'll also share this - we're building this event out to be modular and repeatable so that we can take advantage of doing repeat things and quarters to come.  
Right now this stress test is very real for determining out if the dex is going to break or not, So we might not hit the highest profile communities right off the bat less it breaks down in the first 15 minutes and We can't get things back up in a reasonable amount of time to continue the event.


[16-Nov-20 01:11 PM] Audo#5667
We will finalize few details in the coming days and we can have another discussion about this on the Thursday Townhall

@Jcharming unrelated to the video, I'm not sure who's responsible for https://atomicdex.io/ but rather than just the `Get it on Github` link, it might be better to include Windows, Mac, Linux download links that just download the latest version for each platform from github directly. Less confusion for users looking for Windows, etc and don't want to deal with github.

[08-Dec-20 07:56 AM] Regnar#6164
Had a thought for potential partnership idea and also access to relatively untapped market, based on Guarda wallet creating an Ethereum 2.0 Staking pool, and the rules for these current implementations (no withdrawals) <https://guarda.com/staking/ethereum-staking/>
According to the Ethereum staking rules, staked Ether and rewards are frozen in the network until the launch of phase 2 of Ethereum 2.0 (approx. in 2 years) thus currently it is impossible to withdraw ETH.

However, to provide our users with a more flexible option we will issue ERC-20 GETH tokens, Guarded Ether, which you will receive in a 1:1 ratio to ETH. You will be able to sell this token using DeFi exchanges like Uniswap while your Ether is locked.


We could list this GETH token on AtomicDEX and see if Guarda wants to promote using AtomicDEX instead of Uniswap, for access to different non-ETH coins. @Audo
these GETH are 1:1 with ETH, but just give access to the ETH 2.0 staking rewards before withdrawals are actually enabled. while anyone can add this to AtomicDEX since it is probably ERC20, it could be worth while to pre-add it to the supported coins.
Every month after depositing 1 ETH you will get 0.0117 ETH in GETH tokens what is roughly a 14% annual yield.
not taking a stance on ETH staking, nor taking a stance on Staking pools vs individual validators, etc. Just saying they are going to be releasing an ERC20 token (essentially an ETH backed stablecoin). Could be cool to put it on AtomicDEX default options
<https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/guarded-ether/>
there's about 310 GETH out there now, $179,000
Okay, just confirmed GETH can be added to AtomicDEX (even without it being on coinpaprika yet)

Seems very successful for this stress test. If there‚Äôs a future one, I may chip in bounty if there are plans. 

I was thinking a referral program, sign up under discord name, pool of funds similar to this time, but whoever you refer to join the stress test, 10% of their volume or something similar goes to you or a set amount

referral loops are something we explored for this release and ran into 2 issues

1. time to impliment was too high/available organized human power was too low

2. we actually had concern that too many people would show up and the DEX might suffer a serious issue and it would turn sentiment away. 

_Solution_ built a modular program that would capture and increase organic momentum as it matured - or if it failed would be less impactful for an audience <> promise failure relationship

I think our current twitter manager is doing an excellent job - having multiple managers can break up the voice and create audience engagement issues as styles conflict.  However we have a specifically dedicated komodo community twitter handle that I think you can get involved in to help do timely retweets and build the audience there which we're exploring the multiple people to manage a twitter handle approach.

```we need to work on getting 1 person into KMD``` The virtual event, the stress test was a success. More similar type of events to bring in more people will most likely be the best bang for your buck (and time). I've outlined before as well variants on the stress test that takes the shape of trading competitions.

I was happy to hear that transaction fees from dex  might be converted to kmd and then burned, this could put some nice extra buy pressure on kmd.

In regards to "real use case" it would be beneficial to merely tell people what the future plans are. This would take  no bandwidth and would be simply a few marketing statements. Things such as, in a few years side chains will be be available and working and these will create demand for kmd by the locking mechanism. Maybe this never happens but at least the users can visualize kmd use cases and be more incentivized to buy and hold

There is a lot of DEX comparaison out there. Getting AtomicDEX in those would be a good goal for KMD marketing


[18-Dec-20 10:02 AM] Komodefi#5638
chmex has done an epic service to the community building and maintaining dexstats.info. I think any efforts pointed at polishing and refining this de-facto info portal for the kmd universe would be time and money well spent. The prizes a for using the dex are definitely the better bang for the buck as opposed to paying cointelegraph or whomever to plug the project.

Hey everyone, I've started compiling a spreadsheet of Komodo ecosystem projects, tools, websites, scripts, services, and companies, and wanted to share it and also see if others would like to help contribute.

Full disclosure, I'm intending to use this information to build a new website that will have more than just Komodo stuff, hence the column names and format type, but want to start with our community. 

Feel free to download the spreadsheet for yourselves if you want, but I would also appreciate more additions and corrections of information. If you know of a project, product, script, game, etc that would be cool to include, feel free to add it to the bottom! Thanks!

Due to the AtomicDEX Stress Test and Conferencing Event on Dec 12 & 13 we've walked away with a bundle of new partnership opportunities to explore - NEM is one of those we're exploring.  Someone at NEM got a little over excited and wanted to talk about it earlier than when everything was figured out, we'll be making an official ANNC about any partnerships Komodo is locking into place with other projects during the first half of 2021 leading up to the next AtomicDEX Livestream & Conferencing Event happening at the end of June.  It's possible NEM is going to be one of these -

Just a thought here, but I wonder if there is a way Komodo can put together a team for this Postman API Hack competition. At the very least it will help us showcase Komodo tech, at the best, Komodo gets a huge prize and a lot of media attention.

@here  Organizing slides and making final graphical touches to roadmap being presented - there's been conversation here about wanting to be more involved and be working together on Komodo things.  Link me your favorites roadmaps from businesses and projects that you think are the most effective at organizing and presenting this information.  What does everyone think is the best visual way to show roadmaps and get hype for a project.  
After a few shares I'll stream and lead a convo about it in a hour or two, assuming I get responses. 

Shared examples can be anything 
for example could be your fav blog post from a business or project that gave roadmap concepts 
or could be an entire 40 slide biz pitch deck that a business made or anything in between. 

Show me what you got - let's have this convo

@mb in the crypto crocodiles report there is one sentence about Komodo:
"Komodo

[10-Jan-21 12:38 PM] ejuliano#8606
@mb  here you go:
"Komodo
Traded as KMD coin, the Komodo coin shows in the data due to associated linguistics to its name.
Recent ICO action has led to the burst of data within modelspace at this time. There are indications in
the data of a rapid growth phase for the Komodo in Summer (northern hemisphere), but with a
precipitous crash in Fall as the worst of the hyperinflation volatility sweeps through the various 'capital
markets'. The crash language for Komodo does not show from a lack of value placement, but rather
from the 'emotional turmoil' in markets as the global dollar currency crisis comes to yet another
inflection point. There are sets within Komodo as a coin that have links to the IoT sets, cross links over
to 'trading platforms', and the 'linux OS' that show up as having longer legs than may be expected.
A thin data layer on Komodo would suggest that the crash levels will NOT reach down lower than pricing a few weeks earlier. No numbers within our data for this period."

Yes - if they land a media OP it'll be like the Nasdaq article landed at the end of 2020.  We'll know if we get something big or not by after January or they'llrequest a single 2 week extension.   A lot of it for embargo (exclusive pitching) is timing for the reporter their story line and the markets. 

When accepting an embargo situation what we get is a higher prioritized opportunity to get a posting and quote - what the reporter gets in return is locked discretion for deciding when they are going to pitch your story, and they know they'll be pitching it when it best fits for their own promotion. 

A lot of owned media marketing is about these equitable relationships - and if you're ever curious for a lot of projects why "certain news is taking a while to get out" it's prob for that reason

What do you think @Nakomodo Knight üèÜ‚öî 
At the end of every week or 24 hours after each call out?
* 24 hours = you get your rewards faster
* weekly = I can run more bounties bc I only have to follow up 1x/week on reward drop.

@Audo just a suggestion, but if we want AtomicDEX to be listed on any of these aggregation sites we will need an AtomicDEX API to be hosted, probably from an official Komodo Platform or AtomicDEX.io source. I've tried posting Cipi APIs and it was shot down.


[13-Jan-21 10:46 AM] Regnar#6164
we'd also need to construct a few other endpoints that they generally use for the sites


[13-Jan-21 10:47 AM] Regnar#6164
<https://coinpaprika.com/add/>
```If you want to add a new exchange, you must provide us with a public API, which we can use to provide data. 

For each market on the exchange we need information about volume from the last 24h hours and the last price on the market. This data often can be found in an endpoint called "ticker". Only REST API is accepted. If you want to be included in "Transparency" section, please provide API endpoint for Market Depth (Order book information)

Please provide a link to the exchange's fees (optional)
Example: https://www.binance.com/en/fee/schedule
```


[13-Jan-21 10:52 AM] Regnar#6164
Coinmarketcap
```Ideal API endpoint: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S4urpzUnO2t7DmS_1dc4EL4tgnnbTObPYXvDeBnukCg/edit

Indicate the total number of trading pairs on your exchanges (e.g. 50 pairs in total as of [date]). Insert a sample list of URLs that link directly to the specific market(s)/pair(s). For example, https://www.binance.com/en/trade/pro/BTC_USDT INSTEAD of www.binance.com```

[13-Jan-21 09:54 PM] Jcharming#2693
New Site:  Which is a pathing and QoL update for our audiences and an integral part of the H1 marketing funnel plan.   It's also when AtomicDEX 04 launches, it's also when Explore Komodo Jan sprint ends and the rest of the Explore Komodo events dates for the rest of H1 get advertised.


[13-Jan-21 09:56 PM] Jcharming#2693
Go ahead and give me your explicit plan and ideas here and we can talk about it.  
If you say "I have ideas of xxyyzz" there's nothing I can follow up on specifically.  If you're saying to explore a certain topic `y` with goal `z` then drop that here and I can pursue it.  

If you want to have general brainstorming convo that's cool too just lmk what you're intending.

@Jcharming and regarding Crypto Targeted Promotion, what's your opinion? For example first material would be good about Atomic Dec. I've been testing it recently


[14-Jan-21 12:28 PM] Jcharming#2693
First lets make sure I understand what you're asking and offering. 

This
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IWoPJdkO4azIVBOGsdLjzHP8Jsk5cmBY/view?usp=sharing
is your services and pricing. 

In summation purchasing a service package with "Crypto Targeted Promotion" 
You share content with these various audiences and engage with them.  

My questions are - 
1.  who creates the content material to be shared and what does that material look like?  (work count, revisions, graphics, medium *ie is it a comment or a long form post*) 

2.  How is the follow up for this service package wrapped - what does your follow up analytics report look like?  
Can you share with me an example or do we need to work together to create a request of that wrap up sheet? 
(ie.  a doc with **y** shared in **x** space that got **z** kpi which is the single value kpi?) 
We can help you with this to plug into our funnel. 

If I had these answers or the agreement to work through them together - I could say yes right now to doing this.

I think the best option to engage with Cardano and Charles it to submit proposal to the Project Catalyst. Right now is Fund3 and deadline to publish draft in January 20. The proposal might be. "Cardano integration to atomicDEX". The whole process takes several weeks, but hopefully the proposal will be supported and soon we'll see Cardano on atomicDEX and maybe Charles will use it then

wonder what were to happen if you drop the name komodo completely and convert to just an exchange only service (Komodex). Then make this whole project look more like an exchange and komodo is just the utility coin of the PLATFORM

[17-Jan-21 01:04 PM] Loo‚úüz#2749
imo by working the fact that you are now just an open source EXCHANGE... people will use you more.. people always look for exchanges that have the coins they want... people dont always look for new technology and platforms they want to learn

Or you can consider it for the next Fund in 6 weeks. Just in case, I'm active participant since focus group, if you need any help or advise - let me know

unfortunately the response, or lack thereof, seems to show their level of interest. @Jcharming


[26-Jan-21 05:12 AM] Regnar#6164
I sent out an email 2 months ago and included your email as a response point but no response yet. Just followed up in discord if there was a better way to reach out but received "It's better that way, we'll get in touch with you if we're interested." Though now GETH is on Uniswap and is advertised as such on Guarda website so we'd lose that first mover situation. Still an opportunity if they decide to reach out but I don't think a non-connected 3rd party (me) cold emailing them will do it.


[26-Jan-21 05:25 AM] Regnar#6164
Additionally, this still poses a potential opportunity for AtomicDEX, we could offer a section for ETH 2.0 Staking tokens. This would be a section for ETH 2.0 staking pools who issue ETH2.0 pegged tokens to list those tokens for sale immediately on AtomicDEX.


[26-Jan-21 05:26 AM] Regnar#6164
The big competitor would of course be Uniswap which is designed specifically for ETH and ERC20 tokens. But seeing as it's a protocol, we could either keep Atomic swaps as the core for these tokens, or tap into the Uniswap protocol as well.

We're definitely getting away from making new channels all the time because there's not way to enforce conversation topics or make it better.  - A good thing you can definitely do is bring them here or share a link to it and ping us if there is something you'd like us to see or act on, or just be a part of in the conversation.

a backlink on this button is possible but maybe then prepare a landing page on komodoplatform.com website to explain how it is using komodo tech.
I'm thinking about websites such as atomixexplorer.com, dpow.io, dexstats.info, webworker01.sh and oracle.earth that merit their landing explanation page on the official website. The explanation/landing page can be hosted on the website such as dexstats but maybe it is worth to centralize all these explanations

why  i cant find atomic dex on coinmarketcap or coingecko under defi?? is komodos atomic dex no defi??? how can people know that atomic dex exist when there is absolutely no marketing....marketing on komodo twitter account is not a marketing


[27-Jan-21 02:18 AM] JCDenton#9728
these are the easiest things marketing have to do...make attention on big sites like coinmarketcap or coingecko

i thought kmd team has a direct line to binance team?


[27-Jan-21 02:20 AM] JCDenton#9728
we dont need thousands of internal meetings where only maximal 10 people participated....we need right marketing


[27-Jan-21 02:22 AM] JCDenton#9728
i dont understand why kmd is so f... blind....you have a good product but you dont show it....tech first is so stupid....we have the best tech regarding decentralised exchange but where is the demand?


[27-Jan-21 02:22 AM] JCDenton#9728

OpenDAO and Ren Protocol will launch DOGEO stablecoin
On January 27th, the DeFi protocol OpenDAO officially announced that it would cooperate with the asset cross-chain protocol Ren Protocol, allowing Dogecoin as collateral to mint a stablecoin DOGEO linked to the US dollar. DOGE will first be converted into renDOGE through Ren Protocol, and then renDOGE can be used as collateral to mint stablecoins, which can be swapped with other US dollar stablecoins to obtain liquidity and be used for lending business.

[28-Jan-21 02:53 AM] jesus12#6409
Better is when these accounts post about komodo


[28-Jan-21 03:13 AM] Jimm B.#9993
@jesus12 if all eyes are on doge why shouldn't AtomicDEX tweet about doge?  doge is tradable there ... would attract attention for AtomicDEX.  your statement is pointless.


[28-Jan-21 03:14 AM] Jimm B.#9993
the tweet shouldn't say "doge is the best coin" but "use AtomicDEX if you want doge."


[28-Jan-21 03:17 AM] jesus12#6409
Yeah i understand...i agree but why not should all eyes on komodo??? Whats wrong with this? Why they tweet about dodge? I dont think they get money for this....so why not tweet about kmd?


[28-Jan-21 03:18 AM] Jimm B.#9993
they should, but are not ... so the discussion in relation to the current topic is meaningless.


[28-Jan-21 03:19 AM] Jimm B.#9993
all i hear from you is: why no pump kmd now üò≠

Ok...so whats wrong with this?


[28-Jan-21 03:20 AM] jesus12#6409
So its good to not pump??? Goal is to not pump?


[28-Jan-21 03:21 AM] jesus12#6409
Until now it works really good


[28-Jan-21 03:21 AM] jesus12#6409

[28-Jan-21 03:21 AM] jesus12#6409

[28-Jan-21 03:22 AM] jesus12#6409

[28-Jan-21 03:24 AM] Jimm B.#9993
there is nothing wrong with pumps but they are not always the topic ... but for some people that is all they can think of.


[28-Jan-21 03:25 AM] jesus12#6409
Thats not correct...tech is now about 4 years a topic...team never concentrate on price


[28-Jan-21 03:25 AM] jesus12#6409
So why not do both at same time???


[28-Jan-21 03:25 AM] jesus12#6409
Or is it not possible to do both?


[28-Jan-21 03:26 AM] jesus12#6409
Benefit fir kmd is a growing price needs more money for devs


[28-Jan-21 03:26 AM] jesus12#6409
So more devs can work for kmd


[28-Jan-21 03:26 AM] jesus12#6409
Mire defs means faster progress of tech


[28-Jan-21 03:26 AM] jesus12#6409
So whats wrong with it?

[28-Jan-21 03:28 AM] jesus12#6409
So again...whats wrong with higher price?

[28-Jan-21 03:34 AM] jesus12#6409
Yeah right...and why???

Because tech first and price is not important


[28-Jan-21 03:34 AM] jesus12#6409
Higher price= more devs / more more marketing / more demand / more users / more partners

This doesn't exist at the moment because it's never been made before - the "step by step" is what I'm after procedurally crawling the Komodo project as operations during the first half of the year and I'm not the only one that is on this push.  @Audo pushed for t path clearing initiative during Q4 to even make this a possibility - we were able to get organized enough to push out the AtomicDEX stress test and starting to work in real time with major newsjacking cycles like what is going on today.  

I would say all people participating in Komodo Platform team are now mobilized on this topic and push to get this out - I expect it to be coming out piece by piece over the coming months with these easy pathways getting plugged into the new website which is now built in such a way that it's  just an easy pathway to involvement whether you're from crypto and blockchain space / or not.

@CHMEX 
I have some influencers asking about WSB coin.  Good coverage opportunity I just need to get some more information from you.

Following up here publicly please @ me when you reply so I see it thank you.


[30-Jan-21 03:46 PM] CHMEX#0686
its a community coin which was airdropped 100:1 to KMD Holders. There are enough funds to airdrop it to another chain if that helps. @ejuliano had the initial idea so i nominate him as the leader (if you have time)
Blocktime 60 sec. Blockreward 1 WSB. WSB is live on AtomicDEX and has successful trades

This is exactly the kind of stuff that I'm after.


[30-Jan-21 04:15 PM] Jcharming#2693
Or co-op marketing opportunities that say get your airdrop by downloading AtomicDEX and holding KMD on it


[30-Jan-21 04:15 PM] ejuliano#8606
yes we've tweeted at him already.. let's see what happens further


[30-Jan-21 04:16 PM] ejuliano#8606
should use the official komodo twitter to ping him


[30-Jan-21 04:16 PM] ejuliano#8606
and ask for the airdrop to all kmd holders


[30-Jan-21 04:16 PM] ejuliano#8606
they don't have to list it, it could be withdraw function only

Thank you I'll follow up more with you here - I'll be using the information you dropped as a byline. 
I'll be crediting you as project founder/ generator etc - do you have any additional info you want spread around.  Such as another project you're working on or anything that is just privately yours or that you are also working on to get additional dispersion coverage with this?

Everything will help on this push as this bus is likely to last for the next several days. The earlier we capitalize on anything the better - I'd appreciate it someone being able to set this up as it's beyond the scope of what I can do.


[30-Jan-21 04:27 PM] Jcharming#2693
As a general rule when it comes to marketing - everything that's done is an opportunity for something to go viral.  

There is proactive and reactive marketing as a general overview. 
Reactive marketing generally has an opportunity of 72 hours minimum 7 days maximum to get caught in the buzz.
Reactive is generally a more potent chance to go viral.

Thanks to @audo and @ca333 I've had enough free hands to be able to set up basic pipelining to take advantage of these kind of situations.  

As a direct example The things that anybody does (like what's going on now) It's gaining the ability for a wider network to be followed through on which is being maintained by this new marketing team.


[30-Jan-21 04:29 PM] Jcharming#2693

I just forked that souljacoin site and I'm in the process of editing it for WSB usage. It can be hosted on github pages, just need a domain to point to it


[30-Jan-21 04:32 PM] CHMEX#0686
yes https://souljacoin.cash/ is hosted on github you can do the same with wsb


[30-Jan-21 04:34 PM] CHMEX#0686
sure feel free to use it
I develop and maintain www.dexstats.info so running an explorer and richlists / airdrops is what I learned during the last 4 years with komodo.

Just clarify The way I understand it is that using these instructionshttps://souljacoin.cash/
Those that wish to participate could  mine assumably either of these asset chains - However there aren't any particularly clear instructions on claiming the airdrop for the average user. (Reminder the average user is grandma)

[30-Jan-21 06:21 PM] Jcharming#2693
thank you @lightspeed393 assuming users can prob "see" the airdrop associated to their public address in kmd explorer - not sure though haven't checked.  Just to get my caught up is there any further instructions besides "wait for AtomicDEX 040 where you can claim your WSB tokens in your wallet in AtomicDEX"...?


[30-Jan-21 06:25 PM] ejuliano#8606
there was a quick update just for soulja and wsb
also... if there are anymore wsb to airdrop, and there is actually interest from people outside kmd community, could get  them to download 0.4.0 atomicdex and they can register for the airdrop similar to how it was done during the stress test events.


[30-Jan-21 06:25 PM] lightspeed393#5403
ca333 actually did a new 0.3.2 release today that includes WSB and SOULJA already


[30-Jan-21 06:25 PM] ejuliano#8606
shill it in the reddit channel


[30-Jan-21 06:26 PM] lightspeed393#5403
but any KMD address with coins got airdropped WSB. So if they put their address in on the WSB explorer, it should show the coins. Then they just need to login to atomicdex or import privkey into a wallet to claim them


[30-Jan-21 06:26 PM] lightspeed393#5403
I'll work on adding some more info to the webpage


[30-Jan-21 06:51 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
You can make an event to airdrop some fans on WSB Twitter. Just download the KMD wallet and send it back to the wallet address.


[30-Jan-21 06:52 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Like the original Dogecoin, it spreads out, allowing everyone to participate in the KMD atomic swap.

It's not live yet to the AtomicDEX app - assuming you mean through github download.  So it isn't worth talking about it live yet as the newest batch of users are already trained (used to/most familiar with the process) of logging into their AtomicDEX and receiving a ping for an update directly to their app like with the last 03x release


[30-Jan-21 07:23 PM] lightspeed393#5403
ah sorry I see AtomicDEX app and just associate Desktop in my head and not mobile.


[30-Jan-21 07:28 PM] Jcharming#2693
Actually I was referencing desktop - when I open desktop I get no notification to upgrade for example nor is there a wallet live in AtomicDEX for WSB or SOULJA

But I believe since @elonmusk is genius smart, he can outperform creating more advanced tech & features in $KMD

I will let audo write his thought process. to me, it looks like we are retracing komodo's history and putting out polished versions of all the tech. we started with mm1 and barterdex. they were useful, but not user friendly. now, we have mm2 and AtomicDEX. they are both useful and user friendly. the same story goes for the technologies that came after: dpow, smart chain creation, cc modules etc., we don't want to highlight too much the technologies we are still polishing and hoping to have good first impressions from new users when they encounter them. for now, the focus is on atomicdex and we will build out the technology,products, community from there

so yes, your criticism is all valid, but I hope you can see it from this perspective @Gokhan Gark

Why don't we include a brief history/about panel on the website explaining how Komodo started , previous existing tech in place.


[31-Jan-21 04:11 AM] rionnox#3470
It instills confidence in people when they know how long the project has been going on for. Longevity and continued work through bull/bear markets


[31-Jan-21 04:12 AM] Audo#5667
all of this is in a new long-form document we named "Community Handbook"

This is everything on coinmarketcap about komodo. Shouldn't this be much more (and more clear) for new investors? This page is for many the first look at kmd... 
If l look at ark, for example, they have a large text section explaining what/who they are.

We first wanted to make sure the new website and its featured content like the Komodo Handbook had clearly defined language explaining Komodo. Now that those are live, we will most definitely be updating the descriptions on CoinMarketCap and other third-party sites starting in February.

Love the demo on the website, two recommendations though. First, allow the selection of chapters from the beginning so you don't have to click through all of it just to get to interoperability if that's all you're wondering about. 2nd, allow the minimizing of the text box at any stage and at the end of each chapter, you should have the option to minimize the text box just watch the current animation. Right now the text box blocks the animation.

[31-Jan-21 06:12 PM] Jcharming#2693
@Deleted User @Gokhan Gark @wil Saw the batch of responses - atm as an everyday user AtomicDEX is **the** product that Komodo platform has.  
This is something to consider.  The first page (home page/index page) is just a welcoming screen - the idea is that if you are interested in blockchain or Komodo you'll identify yourself into a role. 

Business/Developer/Community

Now obv if I have to explain it then for you this isn't doing it's job off the bat - and if it's not doing it's job for you then it's likely there are other audience members like you it isn't doing it for either. I've taken down some notes and added them to my stack.  

One of you talked about "where products" - all end user products (AtomicDEX) are on front page.  All other products that are development related and orientated are no on the developer page - please click through to that. If there are things you feel could be better please come to the Thursday Townhall at 4pm UTC on Thursdays.


[31-Jan-21 06:13 PM] Jcharming#2693
Two things to take away: 
(1)  The website is built in such a way that more beauty is coming - but more importantly it serves a critical function for the overall marketing funnel and the way that Komodo platform enagages with it's various audiences. Also the website is a dynamic and "living" tool - it will be incrimentally improved for the next several months at least as it finds it's fit in the ecosystem.  It has been set up in such a way that marketing can pivot to any hot topic or important issue - within 24 hours to be a part of any conversation.  This is not an easy thing to do - consider the trade offs you'd have to make in order to build this kind of website + system and keep it minimal yet understandable. 

(2) Critical feedback is welcome, a word to the wise the team members here work so much and sleep so little that comments like "this is shit" mean nothing to us as we assume you're trolling and being an asshole - but what I will do is set up a monthly call once a month 5 months lead by me to collect feedback and suggestive improvement for the website.


[31-Jan-21 06:18 PM] Jcharming#2693
This is an interesting idea - do you have any writing experience?  We could build a stand alone article on the topic and inject it into the website - if it's a forever topic even discuss building a footer system into it. 

I'm drawing this form a V2 mockup we have that was our "wish list" which improved the home page and helped encourage people to self identify as Business/Dev/Community and making an expandable "journey" that was a click through user journey and expanded off the bottom similar to the idea you're describing.  "letting people 'take the journey" 

If you - or anyone else that reads this - has an interst in writing and wants to pick up some freelance work I'd like to get this added in.  As a 3 man team many concessions had to be made and we focused on minimum - quality (viable) - repeatinable processes and our main marketing CTA's

If given access would you be able to take a copy and make these changes?


[31-Jan-21 06:24 PM] Jcharming#2693
You'll want to get plugged into a conversation with @Audo as there are many terms which are changing/have changed due for brand equity choices and direction etc.   Since this represents SEO material as well I'd really suggest getting into a convo with @Delton for copywrite help and attenument and of course @Jcharming here to support as well.  

You'll want to engage with these people for making high quality output when it comes to copywriter and language or else you there could be a major discrepancy in some places. Leaving this info here for support as it looks like a wonderful and ambitious project and I can see just from the images there are outdated copywrite and terms that you'll need updated info as we push into 2021.

Been working to do the setup and test it that way bc as soon as I drop the reward I have new opps lined up and want to use the reward drop as a notice for the next one.

There's been a lot going on in January - I definitely have not forgotten about this.  Be patient with me, it'll be rewarding.  Building out a schedule so it's sustainable as well.  Weekly rewards.  

At longest it'll be ready March 1st and we'll do a social media push behind.
At shortest I might get it done and all up and running before Feb 9 üíö.

In a tricky stage of delivering on things atm.  Ty for patience.


[01-Feb-21 01:39 PM] Jcharming#2693
If there's no expiration on this offer - can you bring this donation forward in March when we run the social media campaign workshops.  It'll actually make for a nice story and we can get some news out of it. 

If you really want this to happen now just to get it done and over with I'll take delivery and plug it into what we have coming. 
Your choice just let me know

[01-Feb-21 06:37 PM] Jcharming#2693
Love this!  

Before submitting it to getting retweeted and shared out can you remove "Antara smart chains" 

If you'd like to put in something else you can use this phrase as a descriptor.
"Komodo custom consensus blockchains"

Now that the website is live there will be an audience wide communication about this and push through the rest of the quarter about language.

If you want to be ahead of the curve
 "Antara" is one of two important changes as it as a branding equity word is getting deprioritized bring everything under Komodo main name for maximum equity.

Edit: speeling

Absolutely no requests to delete it.
It's a wonderful tweet - I'll never ask anybody to delete a tweet.  That's so rude It's like trying to take away from somebody. 

All communications Will always be about - "If you adjust this will capitalize on it and make your voice louder with the resources we have"


[01-Feb-21 06:51 PM] Jcharming#2693
And to be honest the request for those adjustments will be very few and far between.  It just so happens to be at this exact moment We're doing the communication change.  You don't know about it yet because the announcement hasn't gone out yet.  
I was reluctant to even bring it up here - but to be honest the tweet is so nice If you did feel like remaking it with that language in mind I would love to have it retweeted and shared and everything.

Hi, when can we issue coin on Komodo platform?

[01-Feb-21 09:02 PM] Lifexcel#6798
Should I create my smart chain first and create coin on top of that or those will be independent blockchain one for platform and one for coin?


[01-Feb-21 09:06 PM] Lifexcel#6798
First create a smart chain and issue coin on that chain. am I right?


[01-Feb-21 09:06 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
You get an independent blockchain from the start. there is no need to start a token on top of your own independent blockchain, since you already get your own blockchain's coins


[01-Feb-21 09:08 PM] Lifexcel#6798
I see, got it. That is a similar way of "Blockchain Composer (Coming Soon) Launch a basic chain in 60 seconds"

Is that issued coin will be ERC20 compatible coin?


[01-Feb-21 09:17 PM] gcharang#6833
ERC20 are tokens on the ETH blockchain. the smart chain you create is independent and will behave like kmd/btc type chains with extra features. they can be swapped for ERC20 tokens on AtomicDEX, but not sure what you mean by compatible


[01-Feb-21 09:18 PM] gcharang#6833
no ETA yet. we will make an announcement when it is publicly available


[01-Feb-21 09:19 PM] Lifexcel#6798
I see, okay.


[01-Feb-21 09:20 PM] gcharang#6833
for now, you can DIY by following the docs if you are interested


[01-Feb-21 09:23 PM] Lifexcel#6798
What is the best idea? Should I start now creating smart chain or wait for the composer available?


[01-Feb-21 09:23 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if you can explain what you expect from being compatible, can answer a bit more on that


[01-Feb-21 09:26 PM] Lifexcel#6798

with composer, you pay the setup fees, saves yourself a lot of technical expenses and manual management of hosting infrastructure to get started with and also manage expenses of making sure your chain isn't 51% attacked. This kickstart of the blockchain is extreamly helpful for non-tech entreprenures who wants to get started with a blockchain of their own with core features already offered by the komodo eocsystem. 

With self starting you manage all the technical aspects, go through the chain parameters and chose what you want to do, setup starting seed nodes, explorers, any light wallet specific server nodes for Electrum/SPV clients for your chain, manage the payments etc for security against 51% attacks etc later on.

The benefit is you get started with self-managed setup far cheaper, but you have to manage the technical side. If you are technical enough you might feel self-doing thing better. If you are not technical, you will find composer much helpful to get started with.

Being a project owner, should I reveal my main private key to the developer to handle my smart chain on Komodo?


[01-Feb-21 09:33 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you don't need to share your private key to developers as far I understand


[01-Feb-21 09:34 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
you should be the owner of your original pre-mined coins if you chose to premine coins. or any Founders Rewards etc.
You can also actually chose to use a multi-signature address to get your pre-mined and Founders Rewards coins.


[01-Feb-21 09:35 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
if anyone need coins, you just get their address, send some to them as you feel fit with your project requirements


[01-Feb-21 09:36 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
for development, just a fraction of 1 coin would be sufficient for testing too, or may be based on devleoper's need to test things

I want to develop more other products on top of my blockchain like DeFi related products or other products. My concern is hire many developers and deploy new products without revealing my master private key.

I am curious about the transaction fee on AtomicDEX. How AtomicDEX handle if the ETH gas fee is high, will be a high gas fee for swapping or any optimizer or rollup integrated?


[02-Feb-21 12:11 AM] Jcharming#2693
I think it's nice to get as original as possible with the graphics - However if you find something that needs to be commissioned or purchased from an artist.  as long as it isn't a terribly large amount and it's something you see being valuable here I can say that marketing will chip in a touch from its budget to help out.


[02-Feb-21 12:14 AM] Jcharming#2693
Can't remember it off hand - I think there was a conversation around viable possibilities to avoid ETH fees when high while still doing txs? If somebody knew about this it would probably be Poly.

@Lifexcel Verus will have ETH bridges, once ETH enters Verus the fees would be very minimal. How to use that on Komodo would be the trick.


[02-Feb-21 12:37 AM] Lifexcel#6798
I saw Verus but did not check in detail.


[02-Feb-21 12:38 AM] Slyris#2880
https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/728 We have this issue that is open regarding ETH fees and also https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/801 if you want to don't pay high fees with ETH tokens / coins
regarding taker_fees: https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-API/issues/715


[02-Feb-21 12:40 AM] VJ#1796
@Slyris Do you know if the chains in Verus can be bridged into Komodo smartchains?


[02-Feb-21 12:41 AM] Slyris#2880
Hey - what do you mean by bridged ?


[02-Feb-21 12:41 AM] VJ#1796
ETH --> Verus --> Komodo


[02-Feb-21 12:41 AM] VJ#1796
Verus will have bridges so Eth sent to the Verus contract will be held and vETH created on Verus.


[02-Feb-21 12:42 AM] Slyris#2880
You can also do `ETH<->KMD` directly without going through `Verus`, in this case you want to trade `vETH<->KMD` which is different


[02-Feb-21 12:42 AM] VJ#1796
Yes to remove the fees.


[02-Feb-21 12:42 AM] Slyris#2880
But in this case you can just have a `vETH` tokens and start trading it


[02-Feb-21 12:42 AM] VJ#1796
I think Verus will have BTC too.


[02-Feb-21 12:43 AM] VJ#1796
I did not think that vETH would be a UTXO chain?


[02-Feb-21 12:43 AM] Slyris#2880
Yes sure, but with BEP20 support you will also have BTC-BEP20 and ETH-BEP20 with low fees with BNB


[02-Feb-21 12:44 AM] VJ#1796
Do we have anyone using that on the DEX currently? Do the user have to deposit this onto to Binance to exchange it for real BTC?


[02-Feb-21 12:45 AM] Slyris#2880
Either swap it in the application directly


[02-Feb-21 12:45 AM] Slyris#2880
for example `WBTC<->BTC`


[02-Feb-21 12:45 AM] Slyris#2880
No - for the moment we have ERC-20 and QRC-20 support + Many UTXO coins and SmartChain from KMD


[02-Feb-21 12:46 AM] VJ#1796
Ok thanks.


[02-Feb-21 12:46 AM] Slyris#2880
>  Do the user have to deposit this onto to Binance to exchange it for real BTC?

You can do that actually, but this is not related to AtomicDEX


[02-Feb-21 12:47 AM] VJ#1796
I think it would be good for the team to speak to Mike and see what can be done. From his talks it sounds like a huge amount of liquidity will enter Verus, being a UTXO based DEX it will not help directly but coming up with a way to tap into that should help us.


[02-Feb-21 12:48 AM] Lifexcel#6798
Okay got it.


[02-Feb-21 12:50 AM] Lifexcel#6798
What about your confirmation time? How fast execute the transactions? How low is the fee?


[02-Feb-21 01:49 AM] VJ#1796
@Lifexcel Once in the system the tx would be 0.0001? Verus which is $0.00003 at the current price? But even if you only use the liquidity pools, it would be cheaper than uniswap.


[02-Feb-21 01:51 AM] VJ#1796
Eth --> Verus --> Dai (on ETH) will be cheaper than Eth --> Uniswap --> Dai


[02-Feb-21 01:56 AM] CHMEX#0686
Did somebody make calculations of how much cheaper it is at 160 gwei?


[02-Feb-21 01:56 AM] VJ#1796
It could be infinite if you do not move it back to Eth?

[02-Feb-21 02:02 AM] VJ#1796
But from what Mike has said, it would be better to send the tx via Verus than swapping directly with Uniswap.


[02-Feb-21 02:14 AM] Lifexcel#6798
Oh. okay. liquidity pools depend on contract as well. If the tx fee for the token swap like that would be great.


[02-Feb-21 02:15 AM] Lifexcel#6798
When that available?


[02-Feb-21 02:16 AM] VJ#1796
I do not understand it all but there will be mining/staking on the bridge so people will earn a yield on the volume and one thing that will be better than Eth swaps is there is no front running, all tx is done in parallel not in serial.


[02-Feb-21 02:16 AM] VJ#1796

KMD tech IMO is definitely superior to most everything else *if* you want your own blockchain. I'm under the belief that a lot of projects don't want their own blockchain, they just want a token. With a blockchain comes the need to manage nodes, run an explorer, get mining pools, etc. etc. Yes you can pay the team/other service providers to help you do this, but the keyword there is pay. So it's either time or money. Tokens on someone else's blockchain don't require that really.


[05-Feb-21 07:48 AM] lightspeed393#5403
There's lot of work being done for KMD tokens. tokens/assets v2, sec-wallet, tokel project. Once tokens can be used on KMD easily for the average user and all they need to do is spend 1 KMD or so to make it, then I feel KMD will be talked about as a platform projects can switch to from ETH. It would also add utility to the KMD chain itself rather than offloading a project to their own chain.

We have scheduled a social media related internship to start around march. However, we are happy to work with people on bounty basis - so you can get involved right away if you like! Just let us know what you would like to do and let's talk.


[06-Feb-21 01:43 PM] jvr#6773
Great! So I have some ideas of things that can be done to increase awareness and adoption outside of social media, but can be shared on social media and get even more exposure. The first and most important is to get crypto startups to build their projects within the Komodo ecosystem. If you look at all the projects in the Top 100 by Market Cap, more than half are Ethereum ERC tokens. I believe right now is an optimal time to make people aware that there is another option out there that might better fit their needs. With approval from the KMD community, I could start a direct outreach campaign via e-mail or dm to developers, founders, and decision makers of these projects. Not automated or spammy messages, more hand written and tailored to address their specific needs and pain points. 
Next, I would like to work towards getting KMD and all the projects in the KMD ecosystem listed on every Exchange, Market Price Aggregator, Forum, etc as possible. Basically just try to spread the Komodo awareness outside of social media. All or most of these sites allow links back to the Komodo website, social media profiles and discord so this could be a compounding network effect that is well worth the effort.
I truly believe in this project, I have been following and holding since early 2018 and there's no reason Komodo shouldn't be in the Top 10 and a household name other than people just don't know about it. I would just like to do my part to increase awareness in any way the KMD community deems necessary, these are just some possible approaches.

We should market that heavily in dogecoin community, if one of our community members dont do it, maybe one of theirs will want to


[08-Feb-21 07:31 PM] Sdunbar#5064
huge opportunity for marketing I think


[08-Feb-21 07:57 PM] Regnar#6164
honestly it would be pretty cool to "shop skins" and such. Nothing to stop someone from altering the code and compiling on their own for free, but if the prices are low enough, in KMD, and simple enough to grab. Could bring in some side money for Komodo.


[08-Feb-21 08:06 PM] Sdunbar#5064
Yeah thats an idea as well


[08-Feb-21 08:07 PM] Sdunbar#5064
but i think providing a doge skinned dex to that dogecoin community could do wonders for atomicdex adoption


[08-Feb-21 08:08 PM] Sdunbar#5064
just because those guys are relentless in marketing dogecoin, and if they have a nice cutting edge dex with their branding on it they could end up doing a lot of the work towards getting the dex some recognition

hey, not a bad idea! Imagine if we have that feature to all biggest coins and a marketing campaign that say s something like:

Which would mean that the wallet skin changes and it features those pairs on the DEX dashboard.

Thank you, had tons of fun making it. Gotta thank @ca333 and the rest of the dev team. Once it's ready we'll push it out so the doge community can start using it. We will have bounties and rewards for a limited time to drive installs. As it is, it's the largest contribution anyone has made to doge in years. It's also the most modern wallet available to them.

I'm currently watching a **single dude**, live, fix the Dogecoin network and catch peers up. Single-handedly. The fact that Dogecoin value was rising so massively is likely in part because the people who *have* Doge literally can't erect their nodes to *sell* it.

@PTYX something I mentioned a while back and might be a good talking point with exchanges looking at dPoW to reduce their liability. <https://discord.com/channels/412898016371015680/428673045767520260/740970548003340334> Exchanges are definitely in the market for managing risk, ie. every user could be an adversary who might 51% attack them. So dPoW is a natural fit. However, there is also User facing benefits for accepting dPoW confirmations, which includes lower confirmation times and lower deposit-trade-times which increases the exchanges advantage for arbitrage influx.

If you are holding coins and looking at two different exchanges, one with 120 min confs and the other with 1-10, you will likely pick the faster exchange to reduce price slippage from the time you try to deposit. So if Bittrex has 120 and Binance has 10, you would be more likely to try arbitrage opportunities from Bittrex to Binance, but not Binance to Bittrex

which could mean an influx of fresh coins and probably a decent percentage of those that stay on the exchange and are used for trading.

What do you all think about creating a social media channel here on discord where people can share their posts on Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, etc and as a community we can all go like, comment, share, etc to expand the reach.

I have resorted to trying some concepts myself before pestering artists further. Me just messing around with my 10 yr old.

End SARS
End SARS is a decentralised social movement, and series of mass protests against police brutality in Nigeria.

Additionally, maybe there is a cool way to explore initiatives and projects that are looking for funding within AtomicDEX address book. There could also be an "allocate KMD rewards" option, so you could split your rewards and allocate a certain percentage to various addresses as donations or funding

20/ Verge (XVG) just got 51% attacked. Always be wary of coins that are highly NiceHash-able. When there‚Äôs no upfront cost, the incremental cost can be quite cheap. And it would be easy to do a 51% attack and re-org the chain.

Thoughts about this?

Pool up community funds, maybe aim for 1000kmd or something similar. 

Find and message big crypto personalities (200k+ followers ie winklevoss, elon, etc) 

Have a set time where we as a community all comment the same / similar thing to improve chance of visibility

Tweet that as a community we have xxxxx to donate to charity of their choice in return for a discussion of crypto

how to activate earn4living? I've done all the steps in the mailchimp invite. But upon trying to subscribe as per the e-mail confirmation, I keep getting a server error which says to keep trying and if it persists, to contact "Support." Which Support, tho?

By the way, more than a month since bounty took place, that's not so good to have such delays. Just an advice, I will keep AtomicDEX at least for a while as I like the idea, but somebody else could have negative sentiments when something is promised but not delivered

Hi all
Why is the Komodo community not active on Twitter?
Why not share team content?

We, as investors and the community, must defend the team and share content

If you want to reach $ 100, you must be active.
By sleeping and moaning; We will not succeed

The Komodo project is active on Twitter.

Why not let SOULJA join the mobile atomic wallet and let him try the atomic swap function. Is it that the US cannot download mobile wallets?

He doesn't necessarily have time to turn on the computer, but he uses his mobile phone every day. Of course you need to actively guide him to start using it.

Before he makes a final decision, we still have to work hard. Otherwise, it is possible to use BCS. It is very convenient for him to use and be familiar with KMD atomic swap, and the transfer fee is low. Mobile payment will be very simple.


[20-Feb-21 07:08 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
SOULJA can be added temporarily. WSB has been carrying out a lot of airdrops to allow these new players to experience and participate in the mobile phone atomic swap. Expand the user base. There are more mobile phone users than computer users.

We need more people to use the atomic swap function of mobile phones, and we need users. Why does BNB increase? Maybe it's because many developers use BSC.


[20-Feb-21 07:15 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Don't put the listing fee in the first place, the user's money will naturally come.

After adding it to the phone, drop a wave among his fans.


[20-Feb-21 07:20 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Don't be so passive, let's take the initiative, OK? Does he have to approve this coin before he starts acting? ? ? Of course, let him start using it. Don't say let him use the computer first. It is estimated that busy people have no time to use computers.


[20-Feb-21 07:25 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
As long as he tries the mobile phone DEX, reveals SOULJA, WSB atomic swap, we will win. He has many fans. Not worth trying?


[20-Feb-21 07:28 PM] PTYX#6840
no, BNB and BSC are now popular because they took over the ETH tools. All a user has to do is add custom RPC on metamask and they are hooked up to BSC.


[20-Feb-21 07:29 PM] PTYX#6840
But yes, we do need more dex users, that will come when there is more liquidity.


[20-Feb-21 07:31 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
No matter how good the technology is, no user is nothing, but technology serves users. No money from users?


[20-Feb-21 07:33 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
There are more users, and Binance has created a TWT and there are people chasing it.


[20-Feb-21 07:33 PM] VJ#1796
Even with users, if there is no liquidity, they won't use it.


[20-Feb-21 07:33 PM] VJ#1796
Binance can pump their own coin with unlimited digits.


[20-Feb-21 07:34 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Even if there are no users, what use are you developing for?


[20-Feb-21 07:36 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Developed is for users to use, and the flow of users will come. Otherwise, what's the point of doing this? ? ? ? ? ? No mobility means useless people are using it, maybe many people don't know it.


[20-Feb-21 07:52 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
If there are 100,000 users using it every day, do you still think there is no flow?


[20-Feb-21 07:53 PM] VJ#1796
Chicken and egg problem.


[20-Feb-21 07:53 PM] VJ#1796
Does the users come first or the liquidity?


[20-Feb-21 07:54 PM] VJ#1796
We as the community need to add liquidity and actually use the DEX.


[20-Feb-21 07:55 PM] VJ#1796
I think everyone agrees the lack of liquidity and users is the biggest problem now, which is why the team are working on marketing.


[20-Feb-21 07:59 PM] PTYX#6840
Souljaboy already knows about Soulja, he's blowing hot air. Wants attention. If he was serious, he'd already have his coin.


[20-Feb-21 08:02 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
Then let's start by posting pictures of mobile phone swaps on his Twitter, and engaging in activities, downloading mobile DEX and leaving the wallet address to send coins.


[20-Feb-21 08:20 PM] Ëä±ÊûúÂ±±#5224
If you create KBTC, KBTC, KUSDT, and legal risk, just provide technical support and let other teams create it. Now the miner fees of BTC and ETH are too high and the time is too long, which is not good for atomic swaps.@NutellaLicka

Hey @RNR_0 $VIA is supported on @AtomicDEX but it seems the electrums are offline and they can't be traded atm. Any chance you can look into it? Might also be interesting to look at launching your own VIADEX skin like they did for $DOGE @dogecoindex

This is in association with the live stream events - we're building out a earn program with these events for those that come and participate to start up being a part of the various larger projects conversations around building and having edu content available out there and providing an incentivization model to accompany it.

Just spent some time talking aout @Nakomodo Knight üèÜ‚öî on today's livestream and how due to the community response that was so positive I'm building out something larger and repeatable to help make rampant and directed social media growth as opposed to noise with no signal.  

Thanks to those who were the first movers and have been waiting for the program to initiate now I'm intending to drop some extra reward as a thank you for helping.  I'm waiting to drop/release this initial reward until I have more info to accompany it as the first question from everyone will be "when is the next reward op" after the prize is dropped.  I want to have all this solved since there is energy around this. 

Thanks for the reminder on the sentiment - we're all working as fast and much as we can to do everything  in reliable, high quality, repeatable ways that build more benefits instead of just having a list of tasks to constantly complete and not get anything actual done  : )

It takes both little by little until one grabs critical mass and traction and drags the other one in. 

I put 1 BTC on AtomicDEX and get a couple people the knowledge to use it.  
They use it and trade against BTC and then soon they add a little. 

It's all grassroots.  We're running a marketmaker explainer in May that will show users the basic steps to be able to setup AtomicDEX on a VPS and set up a market maker situation to get liquidity resting on AtomicDEX. - hopefully this set of explainer steps will make it easier for those that want to use this non-custodial solution.

talk to @cipi about technical parts of providing liquidity
to @Slyris about the price fetching done by atomicdex. I'm sure you know this. but, i'm just repeating: the display price and the trading price are not related directly, except that the display price may affect the psychology of a user

uniswap like DEX for cross chain trades doesn't exist yet. maybe someone is working on it (like Verus). right now any one claiming to have it is using proxy tokens afaik

You need to know that hole platform is runed by code and if you know how to comply with code you will be ranked and viewed much more


[24-Feb-21 04:28 PM] Salama#9157
Yes . If you tag Crypto or POS coin or etc you will get attention from search not related to komodo name


[24-Feb-21 06:51 PM] jvr#6773
Maybe time for a new infographic contest? Was looking for some on Google and most of the top results are 2 years old. Impressive to see how long Komodo has been so advanced but would be great to get some new ones with the latest info.

Got this idea from Twitter earlier today but integrating an NFT marketplace into AtomicDex and/or DogeDex would really get a lot of people talking.

And a Yield Farming + Staking integration would also be amazing.

All the other project I've seen are web based. Having a native client for all of this would set KMD apart from the crowd and would actually be more decentralized. Having a web based marketplace and DeFi can be considered a single point of failure if the website goes down.

It could be called AtomicDex+ and DogeDex+ so that the originals can still be lightweight, for users that don't want the extra features.


[25-Feb-21 01:00 AM] jvr#6773
The last one seemed to get a lot of community involvement and really help the visibility of KMD especially because the graphic designers posted their entries on sites like reddit and steemit.

@PTYX 1inch is an AMM aggregator right?  I hadn't considered a hook in for AMM aggregations <> decentralized orderbooks as an option bc afaik there is no techically reasonable way to do this atm - but interesting idea?  Or is 1inch not what I'm thinking of


[27-Feb-21 12:49 PM] phm87#7395
Using 1inch can cost more since it will use several AMM, it optimize the price, it works but not for small amounts. Big traders will always use 1inch

It should boost KMD liquidity. Maybe we can make a deal with some of the uniswap-like exchanges so they offer rewards for kmd farming

I also shared few weeks ago an idea regarding wallet connect support in atomicdex: https://walletconnect.org/ to be able to connect atomicdex funds to uniswap/inch and all other exchange

https://walletconnect.org/
WalletConnect

[27-Feb-21 08:55 PM] Slyris#2880
But according to @artem.pikulin this is a bit more complicated that it seems


[27-Feb-21 08:56 PM] Slyris#2880
Basically with wallet connect you could use your atomicdex funds to do a swap on uniswap and retrieve the received coins directly in your wallet


[27-Feb-21 08:56 PM] Slyris#2880
which basically brings all the liquidity of dapps to atomicdex

[27-Feb-21 09:00 PM] Slyris#2880
So basically if you would like to have a WEB 3.0 vision for atomicdex you need to think about a bridge within the application to existing DAPP, a KMD tokenized on both ETH and BSC, wallet connect to bridge liquidity, and a Decentralized App Store within the app where you can start your fav apps and use your atomicdex funds


[27-Feb-21 09:04 PM] Slyris#2880
note that integrating all this stuff will instantly turn atomicdex into a major product of the industry bridging million of users of different apps

OK great, let me know here when March events schedule page  is live and I will spread the information on crypto calendars. I hope this will redirect crowd to the blog and then to the events.


[28-Feb-21 07:52 AM] Jcharming#2693
Sounds good, that's the goal def.
People who wind up somewhere in our schedule gain
(1) Komodo awareness
(2) download AtomicDEX

The events are just content production machines to help cast the net in our space and make sure that we have content to hit all of our social media channels with and form relations and etc etc

Yeah, I have tried using Pancake and Dodo on BSC on weekend - looks like it is exactly same as ETH so we just need to deploy the etomic-swap smart contract there and we are all set to support BSC and BEP-20.

Much cheaper than erc

Wallet connect protocol doesn't bring automatic support of all ETH smart contracts to the application using it. Its purpose is to connect the dAPPs (applications interacting with smart contracts) with a wallet storing the private key. This way users don't have to input their privkeys to every application used. So if we would like to support Uniswap we will have to implement smart contract calls for Uniswap specifically.


[28-Feb-21 09:19 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
@artem.pikulin since Binance Smartchain is a fork of Cosmos, with improvements, (as little as I know ü§î ) does that mean we can also support Cosmos with our Atomic Swaps tech?


[28-Feb-21 09:20 PM] PTYX#6840
@grewalsatinder the binance chain is different than the BEP smart chain


[28-Feb-21 09:20 PM] PTYX#6840
or BSC i mean, is a copy/paste of ETH that is running alongside the BNB chain


[28-Feb-21 09:22 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
hmm.... didn't had clarity on it ü§î 
cool üëç


[28-Feb-21 09:27 PM] PTYX#6840
yeah, to use BSC all you need to do is add an rpc port change to metamask: https://docs.binance.org/smart-chain/wallet/metamask.html


[28-Feb-21 09:28 PM] PTYX#6840
it's around 100 times cheaper than using ETH at this moment due to gas fees


[28-Feb-21 09:29 PM] grewalsatinder#9653
yes, this little m aware üôÇ


[28-Feb-21 11:18 PM] Slyris#2880
Yeah but to support BEP smart chain you need binance chain support since fuel need to be paid in BNB


[28-Feb-21 11:19 PM] Slyris#2880
This means that you have to support cosmos fork from Binance too


[28-Feb-21 11:19 PM] PTYX#6840
True


[28-Feb-21 11:23 PM] Slyris#2880
nvm according to artem it should be possible even without the cosmos fork support

Wasnt the choice to pay in BNB just a cheaper payment option but native fees work too?


[01-Mar-21 08:56 AM] PTYX#6840
Do you know how the fees will work?


[01-Mar-21 08:57 AM] PTYX#6840
Maybe WBNB?


[01-Mar-21 09:06 AM] cipi#4502
this in true for the trading fees on binance.com, but BEP20 transactions on their chain will need BNB as gas, like in ETH/ERC20


[01-Mar-21 09:06 AM] daemonfox#6136

Hi everyone, I hope you are doing well. I checked your Anarchapulco video and it looks fine, but I hope you are not sponsoring the event, as they have more reputation like a a bunch of freaks, so it would be waste of money


[10-Mar-21 12:36 AM] Andrii#1591
I remember I was at crypto events in Portugal in 2018, and Anarchapulco got event next day (of course to attract more crypto visitors) most of crypto community ignored it, and 1 guy told me he regretted as he came to listen to ideas and heard just bunch of nonsense about "freeing yourself with drugs" or "tantric sex", that's ok to be interested in such topics, but I don't like when they try to parasite on "crypto-hype". So I really hope Komodo wasn't paying for this

@Jcharming I sent to you in DM one idea, it's more about business development than marketing that's why I shared it in DM. But if it works - this will provide additional room for marketing incentives, and we can think together here what we can do else


[17-Mar-21 02:07 AM] Andrii#1591
The idea is about AtomicDEX and Cardano, I don't know who is in charge of business development in Komodo team so shared with you. But just in case I can speak with somebody else

I imagine the team is busy, however we move pretty fast right now and it would be useful to get the ball rolling as early as possible.

Same as Africa which hadn't been targeted before.

I personally think the demo should be embedded onto the main page


[30-Mar-21 10:55 AM] Regnar#6164
@Audo do we have any analytics on how users interact with the website? I've seen some user clicks/heatmap that look pretty cool. I think the interactive demos shouldn't be hidden behind such a small button at the bottom of the page. Is there a way to embed the demo somewhere on the main page? would be a standout showcasing feature I haven't seen on any other sites yet.


[30-Mar-21 11:14 AM] Regnar#6164
you'd have to turn off `x-frame-options` to allow it to be embedded though


[30-Mar-21 11:16 AM] Regnar#6164
unless otherwise the code would have to be added to komodo instead of an iframe, which might be *better* idk just a thought. its a great and unique demo but seems hidden


[30-Mar-21 11:16 AM] Audo#5667
We have start preparing a Q1 marketing report this week ‚Äì we are gathering all the statistics. We will have good SEO focused  data at least as we just got a new tool for ourselves. We should also have the basic data from Google Analytics about website statistics


[30-Mar-21 11:19 AM] Audo#5667
One key aspect we really focused on was video content. It really shows from YouTube analytics.

We also want to look into other video platforms apart from Youtube

Also, we already began planning the June conference event last week. It seems like its long time until that comes around, but actually there's not too much time if we really want to make it a big thing for Komodo.


[30-Mar-21 11:23 AM] Audo#5667

Nice, looking forward to the report. Also any thoughts on possibly moving the demo to the actual Komodo site?


[30-Mar-21 12:06 PM] Audo#5667
yeah, that's an option. We are thinking of how to improve the website overall. We could have this as one items for the next sprint.

Back in January our thought was to add a 'tech overview' section to the homepage. A section that could be expanded on click and it would be interactive. The demo would fit there


[30-Mar-21 02:45 PM] Regnar#6164
yea that would make a lot of sense. I just don't think we have seen anything that is an interactive overview like that and it would be an excellent piece to highlight.


[30-Mar-21 02:47 PM] Regnar#6164
Also worth considering is how it would be more "shareable" so if someone wants to share the interaction, they should be able to share a link that generally brings them there without additional instructions, like when a URL endpoint has the `#` category to drop them specifically on a page (like in our docs pages)

What social media do crypto users in Korea like to use.. twitter?  youtube?

mostly crypto people in Korea use youtube and Naver blog(Korean social platform).

Q - I already dl the atomicdex app on my desktop since I'm interested in the Earn4Learning project because of all the crypto learning opportunities to be familiarised with a diverse group of blockchains, tokens, processes, DeFi tech, etc...in the Crypto World. Also curious to know how to earn KMD for participating in the events. How does it work? Is there a guideline for it which I assume is associated with my atomicdex? Please advise. Thanks!


[08-Apr-21 12:34 PM] Delton#2644
The Earn4Learning guidelines will correspond with the events we have going on each month. We will post the exact details for each opportunity on the blog. You will need your AtomicDEX KMD address to register. You can register monthly. So if you participated in March, you can register again and earn KMD in April, May, etc.

yeah coingecko has been a pain. basically ignoring, then telling us we "might" have been declined but they wont' specify why so that we can fix the api. However, coinpaprika added us and i'm waiting on them to update the pairs. coincodex will be adding us in the coming 1-2weeks.


[14-Apr-21 11:57 AM] PTYX#6840
CMC also same as coingecko. I still bug them almost everyday. the team made the api based on CMC's model so it should be compatible. I'm still at a loss of why it takes them so long.

I have an idea for Marketing the AtomicDex.  I am interested in precious metals.  We can already add gold and silver tokens to AtomicDex.  To turn AtomicDex into a very useful tool for the precious metal community we only need some decent liquidity for the gold and silver tokens.  This is the Dex many in the precious metal community are dying for, but they do not know of it's existence.   There a lot of these communities on twitter and YouTube with big followings.  With Pirate Chain hopefully being added to AtomicDex in the future, I believe this could have millions of people interested within the precious metal community and a good niche market to target.

[16-Apr-21 10:19 AM] animus#8016
Wow, this is very interesting indeed! We've been watching the precious metals and been waiting for the eventual digital tokenisation of them in the blockchain - not just gold and silver, but palladium, rhodium...!! If AtomicDex taps into that at an early stage....


[16-Apr-21 10:21 AM] Corellian Engineering#8439
We can add the Paxos gold token on Atomic DEX and there are silver ERC 20 token's, these can be added to Atomic DEX already.  These tokens track the price of gold and silver and you have the benefit of precious metals on the blockchain.  I cannot stress the value of this to millions of people.


[16-Apr-21 10:22 AM] Corellian Engineering#8439
We just need some liquidity, and some meme's to attract user's, should be a quick win if we want it.


[16-Apr-21 10:25 AM] Corellian Engineering#8439
Palladium and rhodium would be great, I might see if there is other metal token's.


[16-Apr-21 10:34 AM] animus#8016

[17-Apr-21 06:11 AM] luckyolddaddy#5245
I think I lost my coins because I can‚Äôt recover the wallet. If any feedback I could give is this: after the screen Create or Restore, it shouldn‚Äôt take you to the same welcome page which still allow create with allow custom seed (when the user thought he was at Restore page already). If he checked that box and thought he was at the restored wallet and didn‚Äôt realize he it had a brand new seed, he would never check back... So when I deleted the app, I thought the old seed was kept on the new wallet and many transactions were made on the new wallet without knowing it was the newly created wallet. So just modify the entrance pages more distinctively. That would be my feedback


[17-Apr-21 06:22 AM] luckyolddaddy#5245
Or looks like I completely misunderstood the restore mode. How can you restore an app with allow custom seed option. That serves as create new wallet once conformed right?

Hey guys, this is a small thing but someone made a good point on this tweet, the grammar for the push notification is off. It says "You have received KMD transaction"

It should read "You have received a KMD transation" or "New Transaction: x amount of $KMD received" or something like that

I think it really helps CHIPS as people see things are happening even tho it is slow üòä  I am happy to help if you need me but I dont know what you guys do around here so I would have to bug the whole team once a week to get some info out of them, plus it d take me a while to wrap my head around your work. My advice is - dont make it a blog post but just a small announcement in a dedicated channel. I think blogpost will create a bit of pressure, while couple of lines on how everyone is doing is pretty harmless.

@ThomasFarley I heard you love #crypto and are interested in decentralized exchanges. You should really take a look at @AtomicDEX! It uses atomic swaps to directly swap coins from one blockchain to another.

Spread this far and wide to all OG $CHIPS miners and other CHIPS holders

It's time to dust off those coins and spread the love ‚ù§Ô∏è

Time for some price discovery and distribution

Retweet this !!!

[26-Apr-21 03:52 PM] Regnar#6164
okay cool, I submitted an update to Coinpaprika to add the following pairs to AtomicDEX page. Hopefully it updates quickly, a few of those coins don't have any exchange besides AtomicDEX so their pages show `inactive` which can hurt their projects. Additionally excluding those pairs, especially CHIPS, shaves almost $200k off of AtomicDEX's daily volume.

sweet, I just messaged them about it yesterday as well for SPACE and asked them why only a few pairs were shown


[26-Apr-21 03:56 PM] Regnar#6164
@jl777c in regard to your call to action for CHIPS whales to get CHIPS to top 100, at a minimum this is the first step, and getting their current price recorded correctly, right now has them breaking the top 250 on Coinpaprika.


[26-Apr-21 03:56 PM] Regnar#6164
yea I'm not sure what their criteria is. But I figured I'd specify SPACE coin too, since there might be others that could confuse it.


[26-Apr-21 03:57 PM] Regnar#6164
I just ran the API and selected all those that had volume *that could calculate a price tracked on CP* right now and started with them


[26-Apr-21 03:59 PM] ejuliano#8606
well done!  @Regnar @lightspeed393


[26-Apr-21 04:00 PM] Regnar#6164
I don't own any CHIPS, but having a 2000% increase in price on Coinpaprika can only draw more attention to Komodo ecosystem ü§£

@Regnar they need the orderbook for liquidity metric

I was hoping they'd have the API already since they have other coins listed, I sent more than what I wrote here, but I'll see if I can give them these APIs too


[26-Apr-21 11:44 PM] LocoMB#8593
how about using Bitcointalk for these things?
just a few lines of writeup with instructions can go a long way, because discord and even more so telegram are really volatile


[26-Apr-21 11:50 PM] Cryptoon#3362
might give more attention to the general KMD thread as well


[27-Apr-21 12:34 AM] LocoMB#8593
yep it is about the memory of a conversation so to speak- these superficial chats forget quickly: they aonly have a short attention span because, after minutes to hours at the most all that was communicated is scrolled off...
not so in a msg board, as we know from the past, they allow for much more qualified conversations.
Now we all know about that Troll infested bilge called bitcointalk, but hey, why not? eyperience has shown that msg forums external to bitcointalk have adoption deficits- only a few communities got meaningful ones going, NXT and I think NEm aslo and maybe a few others


[27-Apr-21 12:39 AM] LocoMB#8593
but bitcointalk does not take much work to set up and maintain, and also has guaranteed fun with Trolls  üêó üêó üê∑ üê©  üçø üé™  ü•ì ü•ì üçî üìà


[27-Apr-21 12:44 AM] LocoMB#8593
maybe, when KMD ecosystem picks up some steam, a forum similar to Bitcointalk/ NXT forum could be established..
With KMD, ARRRR, CHIPS, ADEX, VRSC, COLLIDER, TOKEL, MCL - this could be a critical mass to maintain a base level of activity.
Also, I noticed that other forum platforms are not very  accessible, just simply from a layout perspective.
There were Komodo and WAVES forums, but they quickly died - I think that was at least in part due to wrong choice of forum platform

@marketing-team Great marketing update, fully aligned that we need to crystallize the Komodo story. What I would like to see that we better explain the tokenomics, how KMD will profit from all the great stuff that Komodo brings


[27-Apr-21 12:17 PM] ejuliano#8606
did you read the recent posts from jl777?
the 5% rewards , just that alone, allows any user to "profit" from all the great stuff that komodo brings (MCL TOKEL CHIPS,........) by buying it with those rewards


[27-Apr-21 12:18 PM] ejuliano#8606
as exemplified by ARRR and "soon" Verus


[27-Apr-21 01:25 PM] rovaaa#2596
Its not about what I read, its about how clearly this is articulated to anyone trying to understand Komodo. Imo we should include this in our messaging

10%, same as jl suggested.


[28-Apr-21 07:14 AM] daemonfox#6136

Its a cute assessment, but there are tons of situations in the universe that lend themselves to a 90/10 rule.


[28-Apr-21 07:15 AM] daemonfox#6136
10% of project work requires 90% of the time and cost


[28-Apr-21 07:16 AM] daemonfox#6136
When I melt Aluminum trash for art metal, the first 90% scopped off is trash waste, but scoops after that are likely 90% Al and 10% trash so scoop efficiently!

My fave is when new miners do the detail math of how much they give up in fees... and realize they are closer to 90% of their projections

Hey guys.  I'm a small-time YouTuber.  Just did a Pirate Chain video that was received very well by their community and now I wanted to make a Komodo video to talk about the fundamentals.  I'm not a slideshow/powerpoint type of video presenter or some kind of TA chart price pumper.  I just look at web sites and talk about fundamentals of how projects work.   Do you guys have some kind of basic fundamentals talking points marketing pdf I could go by top make sure I cover all the signifcant generals?

You have some data on dexstats.info for tps and that would be possible.
Yes there are 64NN but they only notarize the chains anybody can mine the chain with hashpower so it has unlimited validators imo

Trx fee: 0.00001 KMD is accepted

Finality time i guess that is one notarization so about 10 minutes = 10 blocks max


[03-May-21 08:08 AM] Regnar#6164
a lot of those are proof of stake, which makes the "validator" count pretty important. KMD is proof of work though, so it doesn't really make sense.


[03-May-21 08:08 AM] Regnar#6164
0.00001 KMD is around $0.000028 right now

It'd be nice to see $KMD included on more of these kind of infographics - especially with a lot of discussion about L1 ETH competitors

In 2017 - 2019 $KMD was mentioned quite a bit when considering L1 ETH competitors - now I almost never hear it mentioned except in smaller circles

I'm not sure who communicates with coinmarketcap typically, but it seems their website's categorization of Komodo is not updated / correct.

It should also list Komodo as a Smart Contract Platform, Interoperability, etc

yea not sure. i've also noticed just because a coin gets added to an exchanges page doesn't mean it's added to the coin page. Which seems odd, I would assume exchanges/coins would be database tables and have a foreign key linking to one another. Update one and it updates all

To people who have been around Komodo for a while, what would you say was the single most FOMO-hype-inspiring event, activity, piece of content, or publication the team and community ever made public?

Please @ me üëå


[05-May-21 07:02 PM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Low hype community here. But there have been memorable  moments unrelated to price.


[05-May-21 10:50 PM] stnabben#4667
@Roti  I remember back in the last bull run they had a countdown timer on the website for a release of news I can't recall what was. It was a live event that started when the time went out. Unfortunately their stream had lots of technical errors and they where not prepared so it was badly received and a large price dive took place. Might have been a case of buy the rumor, sell the news as well

imo for me the privacy zk atomic  swaps is a huge news (and would be considered hype simply because it's not actualized yet (for public use), this is a massive move forward;
apparently regular p2p atomic swaps was not good enough for the crypto world up until this point; if they're not wild about zatomic swaps then they're all eth-heads who spend too much time looking at green and red numbers

Same as ejulliano, atomic swapping arrr into and out of adex is going to be hard to beat privacy wise. an atomic webdex dapp with a simple gui and kitschy dragon theme would be the game changer of all time for this project imo.


[06-May-21 07:27 AM] Buddz1993  HYPEBEARS FAN üêª‚ùÑ#5380

[06-May-21 07:46 AM] Komodefi#5638
Pirates are in some deep waters now. I hope that a sense of cohesion between arrr-kmd-vrsc can be sustained. They all started together, with each others help. Maybe branching off is part of maturing as projects but they're all still fundamentally connected. It feels like communication breakdowns are happening more often as a result of in group priorities.

Hey guys - put out this tweet highlighting the disparity between smart contract platform projects: 

https://twitter.com/rackdisiprin/status/1390671570549493760?s=20

gives a nice visual of how undervalued $KMD is

> Please think about this, it is a critical point. A cellphone network that has all of 3 users in its network, is basically an intercom system and doesnt have much value. But if there are millions of users, then all of them are able to phone any of the other users. This is the network effect, it goes up as the square of the users. That means 10 times more users has 100x the value. A hundred times the users has 10000x the value. Of course, it isnt a mathematically precise formula especially as it is nearly impossible to know how many actual users a crypto has. The important thing to realize that the primary value driver for a crypto coin is the total number of users it has.

I have been thinking the same thing. Kmd needs a better sales pitch. Here is a rewrite example.
```Kmd (Komodo coin) is the original decentralized finance coin of the Komodo platform. It provides 5% yearly yields as a reward for monthly balance transfers on the network. Kmd also enjoys privileged status when it is used with the AtomicDex software (The original and only non-custodial decentralized exchange multi-wallet) of the Komodo Platform. Trading fees are reduced when using Komodo to provide liquidity. As a result Komodo is the most used trading pair. In addition, other coin transfer fees (fees orginally are paid in each native coin) are converted to Kmd adding buy support for the Kmd price. The program Komodod when launched using different parameters and custom consensus modules (built in smart contracts) can create a nearly infinite number of smart-chains that are all compatible with Komodo infrastructure. This allows easy scalability, turn key wallets, explorers, SPV servers, and AtomicDex integration. The nearly infinite number of smart-chain business use cases creates a positive feed-back loop that Kmd is perfectly positioned to benefit from. As each new chain is created and traded via the AtomicDex, the Kmd base pair directly benefits from this as it provides a main source of liquidity. ```

```Komodo is an end-to-end blockchain infrastructure solutions provider. Consistently recognized as one of the world‚Äôs most innovative blockchain projects, Komodo is developing technologies at the cutting-edge of the blockchain industry.

In reality, most blockchain platforms today are but a single blockchain that offers support for smart contracts and decentralized applications. This model forces all projects to share the same infrastructure, leading to congestion, increased transactions fees, and stifled growth.

Whereas other blockchain platforms employ a single, shared-blockchain model, Komodo‚Äôs federated multi-chain architecture provides each and every external project with independent infrastructure and a dedicated blockchain.

This multi-chain design is what makes Komodo unique among blockchain platforms. Each project is given the opportunity to create their own blockchain ecosystem via Komodo‚Äôs infinitely scalable infrastructure.

Komodo‚Äôs tech enables seamless cross-chain interoperability among all federated blockchains. Every blockchain built with Komodo is also connected to 95% of chains outside the federation via atomic swap technology. Future plans are in place for blockchain bridging support, which will create cross-chain fungibility throughout the entire blockchains industry.

Moreover, with Komodo‚Äôs architecture, multiple blockchains can sync up and function as a single chain. If one chain is not meeting performance needs, additional chains can be added to form a blockchain cluster. A blockchain cluster boosts performance linearly without inflating coin supply or devaluing the currency.

The Komodo ecosystem is not only scalable and interoperable, it‚Äôs also secured with the power of the Bitcoin network. This is accomplished with a series of cross-chain notarizations that store a blockhash onto the Bitcoin ledger every ten minutes, providing protection from 51% attacks.

From crypto compare

Komodo is a privacy-centric cryptocurrency that combines the anonymity of ZCash with the security of Bitcoin. Using a new consensus mechanism developed by the Komodo team, delayed Proof of Work, Komodo blocks can be notarized using the Bitcoin blockchain. KMD is issued through an Equihash-based PoW¬†protocol, and the new block information is sent to pre-voted notary nodes. These nodes insert the Komodo block information on the BTC blockchain by creating a custom transaction. This system ensures that in order to "hack" komodo, one would have to rewrite both chains.

Komodo uses Zero Knowledge Proofs to provide 100% anonymous transactions, that are now secured with Bitcoin's hash rate.```

```from coinlib
¬†
Komodo is a platform forked from zCash. It incorporates the same zero-knowledge proof protocol, so transactions are anonymous and private. Its unique consensus protocol is called delayed proof-of-stake. 64 masternodes, elected by voting, are responsible for notarizing (recording) Komodo's blocks into the Bitcoin's blockchain. With this, they offer the same security level of Bitcoin. Kmodo also offers a framework for creating independent blockchains with blocks notarized to it (and, therefore¬†o Bitcoin). Mining uses the equihash algorithm, so it's ASIC resistant.

Through their dICO platform, anyone can launch an ICO with total anonymity, with a blockchain within the Komodo ecosystem or not. Komodo also features the BarterDEX decentralized exchange, which uniquely supports trading between different pairs using atomic swaps for increased speed

What is¬†KMD

Omodo is a cryptocurrency aiming to set new standards with security and anonymity. Protected by Zcash Zero Knowledge proofs, users can make completely untraceable transactions. Additionally , Komodo uses a new mining algorithm, known as delayed proof-of-work which uses bitcoin network hashing power to the threat of 51% attacks. Komodo holders also receive an annual percentage rate revenue of 5%. Every KMD holder will receive this automatically and this will remain until the maximum supply of 200M KMD is reached.

[25-May-21 06:31 AM] PTYX#6840
Is your company a blockchain company? I don't think you can compare the goals of one company to the other. Going to a conference shouldn't be done for thr sake of showing up. There has to he a specific goal you're trying to accomplish like getting a deal or meeting a specific goal. Not saying all conferences are bad but they are not worth the spendature in most cases.


[25-May-21 06:31 AM] blackpanther222#0398
To speak about defi and green alternatives is at the moment the best marketing...and many people will look for this on conferences...


[25-May-21 06:31 AM] PTYX#6840
It costs upwards to 150-250K to attend these conferences and get a dedicated stand.


[25-May-21 06:32 AM] PTYX#6840
Much more can be achieved at aiming those funds to development and traditional marketing

[25-May-21 06:33 AM] blackpanther222#0398
So you thing to speak about defi and kmd products is useless on biggest conferences in US?


[25-May-21 06:34 AM] blackpanther222#0398
And its better to post on twitter?


[25-May-21 06:44 AM] PTYX#6840
When i buy anything, i expect the cost/return to be the equal. My point is that spending even 50K-100K on a conference isn't going to generate the same results as if we spend it on actual development or traditional marketing such as targeted outreach. If the team saw it as a worth while spendature we'd be attending. I don't make decisions on if we're going or not, just giving you my opinion on the matter.


[25-May-21 06:46 AM] PTYX#6840
We'd spend that money to go shake hands with people, dodging Covid, and possibly getting on stage to talk about something that'd be forgotten after the conference ended.

Any thoughts on piggybacking onto recent BSC chain hype for atomicdex


[02-Jun-21 10:42 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Approach top 10 projects, have their coins listed in the list (and not just ‚Äúcustom bep‚Äù)


[02-Jun-21 10:42 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Have these icons already added in + poocoin chart url linked instead of having to manually do it


[02-Jun-21 10:42 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Then tweeting them and saying


[02-Jun-21 10:42 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Due to overwhelming demand we have decided to list your coin


[02-Jun-21 10:43 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239

what are the biggest hype coins that are likely to like/rt such a statement?


[02-Jun-21 11:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
safemoon, shiba clones, cummies, strainz, look at top 3 nft games, campfire


[02-Jun-21 11:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
all those


[02-Jun-21 11:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
even just popping into their communities stealthily


[02-Jun-21 11:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
then a few days later post a comment on telegram


[02-Jun-21 11:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
ask who to speak with


[02-Jun-21 11:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
then end up talking to team / ceo


[02-Jun-21 11:36 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
then say youre listing


[02-Jun-21 11:37 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
and to announce it


[02-Jun-21 11:37 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239

+ my idea where we do twitter votes to add them "natively"


[02-Jun-21 11:37 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
get a vote between safemoon, nft art, shiba and something else


[02-Jun-21 11:37 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
tweet to them all and say youll list one in a weeks time

I understand using a current trend /moment to gain market share and attention. 

But do we really want to be the "platform thatll list anything, even straight scams"

This seems like a competitor for KMDs cross chain vision. It'd be interesting to contrast these kind of solutions (built on top of other tech, more centralized, etc), versus Komodos "built from the ground up" approach

@Doink thing is, they‚Äôre technically already listed. Even binance is listing coins like shiba due to sheer volume


[03-Jun-21 03:10 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239

Is Komodo still running their end of June "Summer Conference" for engaging new users for Atomicdex?


[04-Jun-21 10:54 AM] Audo#5667
we gave an update on that on a Thursday Townhall

We will have a half-year Komodo Update at the end of June.

We will also have an on-site event later this year that we will share more information about later


[04-Jun-21 10:57 AM] digital bullion#8223
An update?

I will listen to the update.

If it has changed then it needs to be reflected on the website.


[04-Jun-21 11:22 AM] digital bullion#8223
Which Thursday Townhall?

I really think more emphasis needs to be made upon being more calculated in which statements are made publicly in regards to events and timelines.

If a statement is made it must be fullfilled, otherwise it should not have been made in the begginning.

It is really important, theres too much flip flopping in that area, I find it hard to keep up @Audo#5667


[04-Jun-21 11:45 AM] Churro#4832
who knows


[04-Jun-21 05:57 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Definitely need a dot point summary and a longer to read for all townhall / weekly updates


[05-Jun-21 10:16 PM] Audo#5667
bullet point summary to go with townhalls is a good idea.

We will decide the end-year update date on Monday - it will likely be the last day of this month: July 30th


[05-Jun-21 10:16 PM] Audo#5667
the on-site event is in August - date is confimed once the venue is confirmed


[05-Jun-21 11:38 PM] blackpanther222#0398
I ask that too some time ago


[05-Jun-21 11:40 PM] blackpanther222#0398
So why there is no june event like planned? What are the reasons? Will the on site event bigger than planed june event?


[06-Jun-21 03:52 AM] Audo#5667
yes that's right - and the half-year update is planned to be a bigger Komodo Update then the one we did last week. Details are to be brainstormed.


[06-Jun-21 10:09 AM] digital bullion#8223
@Audo do you have a response to my question?

Which Townhall meeting should I be listening to for the update in regards to the rescheduling of the event?


[06-Jun-21 10:12 AM] digital bullion#8223
Even the month it was stated would be helpful.


[06-Jun-21 02:34 PM] digital bullion#8223
I dont think it is overly difficult to respond to that.


[07-Jun-21 05:04 AM] Audo#5667
It's in August - and it was mentioned in a townhall few weeks back (not sure which one exactly) and in the May update. Basically the same info was shared here now - nothing else was said on the townhall.

Split testing is how you get what your looking for by testing, testing, testing. It is how you hone your promoting to get the desired outcome also called click testing. Assumptions mean only that, assumed, you think but don't actually know, we only know by testing. Sorry but regardless of what we might think, good advertising works because good advertisers test, test, test. I can test anything with images by just doing a poll, take your pick that is testing, don't assume, ask. Which is what you are doing so have achieved an out come, bingo.


[13-Jun-21 06:00 AM] Nev#5914
Yes with such a thing images can be tested for the best results but all are on the same page with text, text also needs to be tested, believe it or not but just taking a (but) out of a test can improve click through rate and that is the desired out come. Official text is a great way forward.

[15-Jun-21 04:48 PM] Nev#5914
Theoretical borders inculcated into the mind can be stronger than concrete and steel, I accept that, although I doubt there are many concrete and steel state borders anywhere they seem to be imaginary diktats only. The bigger problem could be, what is reality?

we had a video like that a long time ago - we should remake it!

Perhaps make a new video but show some of the older video to visualize the progress since.

When Pirate Chain is added to Atomic Dex, we should have a cross promotion campaign of the likes Komodo has not seen before.

Journey to Komodo AtomicDEX
AtomicDEX what is it? 
It is a wallet where you can store many different coins safely. You control the private keys for your own coins. If someone was to hack the technology supporting AtomicDEX they would not get your coins unless they gained access to your wallet's seed phrase. (it must be kept safe). The Komodo network is secured from 51% att...

Now if I got the question right, atomic swaps are big game changers and potentially very disruptive. zAtomic Swaps are even more threatening. You must remember this is the 21st century Renascence and people get executed for telling the truth, remember the world is flat a bit like public knowledge.

What's good Komodo community. My name is Don Roderick, Hip Hop Artist and Founder of the Gideon Association. Our mission is to inspire free speech, interest in literacy and language arts through the sport of battle rap. 

In short, we have an dapp on the way, Gideon, a streaming and gaming platform for the battle rap industry. We've solved an industry wide problem of there being no fair voting mechanism to decide the outcome of rap battles by using block chain based voting. We will be bringing this project to a market of over 800 leagues. And of course, we are using Komodo as our block chain of choice. 

We believe strongly in Komodo's capabilities and look forward to partnering in any capacity. 

We've also launched our G1 NFT today so things are moving. Here's a link for more info.

Best.

[02-Jul-21 01:16 AM] Vipes83#3757
I fully  appreciate the caution. Most of us have had  bad experiences with scams.

[02-Jul-21 01:21 AM] Vipes83#3757
Unlike most other NFT  platforms that have multiple  fees, which are often high and sometimes convoluted.

To mint and  deploy NFTs  on libra.codes is FREE.

Users only pay a 2% on final sale of NFT.
KMD is one of the listed cryptos which can be used for payment

Simple as that.


[02-Jul-21 01:27 AM] Vipes83#3757
If the team  end up liking what they see, there are other avenues  of  synergy worth exploring.  (bridging blockchains  so communities on both sides can access other usecases like DeFi for example)
Will explore that in the months to come myself  if no one from  KMD  reaches out. We are very easy to find on Telegram and LinkedIN.
Have a great weekend

Tokens
The Tokens Module enables support for the on-chain creation of colored coins, also called tokens. The created tokens are typically used with another module that supports operations on tokens. For example, the Assets Module provides buy/sell operations for tokens.

Many interesting things happening at @KomodoPlatform. Especially as the team is actively working on more use cases for $KMD. 
These + listing on big Korean exchange with a KMD/KRW pair make me very bullish on the future price action üöÄüíéüôå

#airdrop you say? After the IDO $KMD holders will also get a share of the $TKL allocation to ensure fair distribution. It will be balance based for all $KMD held in a private wallet. (such as @AtomicDEX or @dogecoindex for example!) $KMD $DOGE $TKL üöÄüíéüôåüíé

I swear there used to be a bounty channel in here (maybe thinking of chips/versus/one of the ecosystem‚Ä¶ but is there any way for people to earn KMD who don‚Äôt have the knowledge/skills to work on coding and the tech side of it? Are there any type of ‚Äúreferral‚Äù or reach X number of viewers and you can receive some KMD?

@‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª  i delete the post because no one answer and i recognize thats not so easy to create a chain...its easier on binance chain...but thank you for the hint with tokel


[16-Jul-21 12:40 PM] find_your_way#5266
So if i understand correct its something like the nxt asset explorer in nxt days? You create an asset for 1000 nxt and everybody can buy it...no need for    dev experience and no need for node

THORChain is the worst, you should go use all the other ways to swap between L1 chains instead. 

But there are none. 

THORChain is all you have. And It's the best.

Im from the Kalao Team and would be glad to talk about this project. If we are looking for a VR marketplace and metaverse experience, KALAO project can be a nice project to bridge with KMD. It could be a nice partnership maybe. What do you think about it? If this post isn‚Äôt adapted I can delete it.

We were aware about todays issue with the stream thanks for letting us know all the same.  We're probably going to move to a more strictly pre-record format overall and then have a separate tool anytime we want to do complete live streams as our solution.

@Artakush if my mic is not working when I get home this evening. Can I borrow your voice? Also are we missing any information on this video? I want to clean up the transition between pages. The graphic I used was downloaded off of the website, then thrown into photoshop to delete the Background so it looks a bit pixelated if you put your face up right up to the screen.

Just a couple things I noticed on mobile. that absolutely beautiful background graphic is pixelated. Developer and documentation spacing  slightly off. Overall the website looks fantastic.

You can load it up as an A tag somewhere and then drag that A tag to your bookmarks and if you click on it on any webpage it will convert the page to something like this ^ which has been really helpful for me to debug/see site layouts

Start promoting some other coins in the KMD ecosystem such as SpaceCoin, CHIPS, THC, etc to reach a broader audience. You get the poker bros for CHIPS, Space nerds for SpaceCoin, and stoners for THC, which all lead back to adex and eventually KMD! Start from the bottom up! ü§òüèª

Also what can non-tech users do to gain KMD through bounties/etc? For example. If a YouTube video hits 10k videos you can get xxx KMD

@everyone Komodo Runners are available. If a prototype order is made, the pre-orders campaign becomes obsolete. Please let me know if you are pre-ordering or purchasing the prototype. The $30 discount only works on pre-orders or if the shoes have already been unlocked because of the prototype purchase. Feel free to contact me for any questions, comments or concerns. Thank you!!

[22-Aug-21 12:45 PM] Franswa Andre#2142
The way I have it set-up, only 15 NFT's of this specific shoe will be given out for free due to purchasing the shoes. Once you purchase, contact me and I will extend the NFT link where you will get the Transaction and Token ID that will also be on the Limited Edition PDF file as verification of blockchain, Token ID, and proof of purchase which is your copy of the payment and has an ID itself.

I don't know which one is the best and allows you to use KMD...Any ideas?


[23-Aug-21 11:48 AM] Franswa Andre#2142
Well, It's visa-versa, when you purchase a pair, you contact or pm me here with a copy of your receipt, I then send you the link to the NFT, you get it for free because you already bought the shoes, and you get the Limited Edition Patent with the transaction ID, unique identifier, and token ID from the NFT. This gives you authenticity because only 15 pair will ever be sold until KMD reaches a specific disclosed amount, and this also gives you full re-sell rights to the NFT which in turn are the shoes themselves.

I have to admit I feel the same level of frustration- but it is mostly not the lack of 'marketing' that is to blame.
It seems to expose a deeper flaw in current programming paradigms: 
Low level c language usage versus shallow unicorn hipster sugar poppers javascript shit
[sure, nodejs is really really a serious programming env .. ü§° ... not .. üêó ]
Some functional optimism here and an analogy: Linux never conquered the desktop world, but boy does it rule the internet!
Android, IOS (in a sense), TVs and whatnotas well as  every fricking internet router and switch, _PLUS_ almost every computational science application is running a *-Xoid
But it is sort of non-obvious, and it took a while üï∞Ô∏è
Yep, I get quite angry when I hear the pompous YT augurs babbling in awe struck tones about 'the next altoin that has huge potential gains' and then they babble about the top 20s like ADA, DOT, SOL, AAVE, MATIC, and dont forget eth ..
So I occasionally listen in to the bitboys for 2 or 3 minutes as exercise in frustration management.
Mostly on my exercise bike, then I quickly start to wonder why I waste my attention on these bland mantras and switch channels-
usually sounds like Uncle Wally 401k advice from 20 years ago- and where exactly did that lead to? üòà

Programming is different in that aspect that if you throw N amount programmers at the problem, it doesnt get solved N times faster as in for example painting a house, you add N amount of painters and house gets painted N times faster.

i'm genuinely curious, not attacking you or even saying you are incorrect, so i hope you don't take this the wrong way:
why do you think Sol, avalanche, and others are having such price increases?  do you have a theory?  is it because their marketing?  can you share what is their marketing? (other than spending 100s of millions of dollars to get related brands naming rights on sports arenas (ftx))...
what do they do that is different, and why do you think people care so much about Sol or Avax or the other ones you think about when you compare KMD?

People here know what marketing is. üòÇ komodo doesnt have hundreds of millions of Venture Capitalist money to throw at every single output. Komodo has a budget and that budget is streched out for many many years, so komodo has to choose wisely where and on what they spend money and its wiser to spend it development not on ads that may or may not do what they are meant to do.

I think most of this boils down to capital. With more capital you can be in peoples face 24/7 and it does help boost the price.

Solana, Avalanche or Near have some hackathons/competitions with rewards to get developers on board. Their ecosystems grow quite fast


[29-Aug-21 01:57 AM] rustytwilight#5920
Also they don't necessarily compete with Ethereum, but instead they focus on bridging with Ethereum & provide tools for developers to seamlessly migrate dapps from Ethereum, that's what Komodo is lacking I believe


[29-Aug-21 06:39 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
They integrated solidity. Kmd had no plans on integrating solidity. I believe the kmd devs said solidity is too primitive, wasm is the future.

But the beauty of kmd CC is that anyone can make a kmd smartchain and create a solidity.CC if they so desire.


[29-Aug-21 06:57 AM] rustytwilight#5920
The 3 blockchains platform above also have their own programming language like Rust, that could be compiled to wasm. I don't know how good is Komodo CC, but judging by the surrounding ecosystem or market cap, those 3 are way bigger than Komodo despite entering the space later

non solidity smart contracts will have a breakout moment. I think jack from twitter is looking to do smart contracts on the btc chain. This will hopefully make people aware that smart contracts can exist outside of solidity


[29-Aug-21 07:05 AM] LocoMB#8593
to be fair, the tapestries of ecosystems of platforms like cardano are impressive:

[29-Aug-21 07:07 AM] LocoMB#8593
I think that is because they catered to VC customers with perspective to _fast_ product readiness,
which is to say that a high-level language like solidity and all those other js- knockoffs are cheap and fast sugar for quickly getting in some investors


[29-Aug-21 07:09 AM] LocoMB#8593
So it is quite easy to quickly clobber together some smart contracts, including several inept attempts that failed spectacularly.
But that doesn't preclude attention by people that want results fast - because .. hey, the inept amateurs are always those other ones, right?


[29-Aug-21 07:11 AM] rustytwilight#5920
The point I was trying to make is Ethereum tooling support is a must, like assets bridges or EVM compatible machine, the 3 mentioned platforms above don't natively use solidity or js, they use Rust or Go


[29-Aug-21 07:12 AM] LocoMB#8593
ha... I wasn't even aware what language they use internally ... I think there was a discussion about ETH tooling support some weeks ago, but I can't remember


[29-Aug-21 07:15 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
I have to disagree with you on this. EVM is a way to compensate for the lack of capabilities of the chain itself. Create a chain that can do stuff on L1 and you won't need an EVM on top.

[29-Aug-21 07:23 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
It makes things easier indeed. Also making mistakes is easier, but luckily hardly any solidity contract has had value extracted from it, because of vulnerabilities unknowingly (I hope) introduced by the programmers.

Solidity is still viable because general usage is still comparatively low. You can see Eth's gas model creaking at the seams on busy days with ridiculous fees. BSC developed a workaround but honestly it's still a bit clunky. And who knows what damage the next exploit will do. I see solidity as a sandbox where people are exploring ideas. Once those concepts are proven out they can be hardened and streamlined with a utxo logic model that doesn't need all the fuss, bandwidth, and fees that the evm requires.


[29-Aug-21 07:30 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Indeed. That was the intention of the Ethereum VM model initially. Unfortunately people decided differently.


[29-Aug-21 07:35 AM] rustytwilight#5920
Thanks for your points of view, it was a great discussion


[29-Aug-21 07:47 AM] Komodefi#5638
I am fairly certain that in the future there will be a multitude of interpreters or cross compilers that will be able to translate solidity mechanisms into all of the various utxo based smart contract protocols that will emerge.


[29-Aug-21 07:49 AM] Komodefi#5638
But the hype is the easy part. I'm anxious to see what ADA comes out with and how well it works.


[29-Aug-21 07:49 AM] LocoMB#8593
seems to be the gist of it: EVMs like solidity are an extra convenience layer on top of the blockchain engine that make it easier to get something fast, but it also makes it easier to make it go wrong horribly... 
Jep, because utxo is where the numbers are crunched


[29-Aug-21 07:50 AM] LocoMB#8593

[29-Aug-21 08:05 AM] Komodefi#5638
At some point actual utility has to usurp hype. It's exciting to see jack from twitter jump into the utxo based smart contract game though. I dont even remember how long ago jl came up with CC's but if they are ignoring this contribution, I think they may end up wasting a lot of time unnecessarily.

A good name for what google is might be is a propaganda engine or an echo chamber but it's not honest search, in fact none of them search the internet, they search a data base which they made/compiled themselves, not internet search at all.

If you think that so called search engines don't know when they are being gamed your wrong about that as well, sorry but they are all in it for the money, the reward is mightier than the truth. They protect their interests and big banks are their priority. They, banks that is, control everything and if you don't play with them they crush you because they own it all, because they own the money creation process.

Are there plans to get MCL CHIPS and VRSC listed on new exchanges?


[06-Sep-21 06:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think someone asked what the specifics were for kucoin listing


[06-Sep-21 06:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
For vrsc


[06-Sep-21 06:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Think it was a listing fee


[06-Sep-21 06:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
I think @PTYX was going to give the details to mike


[06-Sep-21 06:24 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
I think it was somebody in the community, not the general community consensus


[06-Sep-21 06:24 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Maybe 1-2 weeks ago


[06-Sep-21 06:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Aha possible


[06-Sep-21 06:25 AM] PTYX#6840
He never replied to me


[06-Sep-21 06:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Anyway if mike knows the cost then its up to them I guess


[06-Sep-21 06:25 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Sweet, remembered correctly then :p


[06-Sep-21 06:26 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
But with the current liquidity and lined up changes for mainnet, spending community raised funds on an exchange is... well... not likely.


[06-Sep-21 06:27 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Don't take that personally. I imagine him being pinged by every John Doe and his mother.


[06-Sep-21 06:27 AM] PTYX#6840
Yeah and it's something like 250K


[06-Sep-21 06:27 AM] PTYX#6840
It varies from project to project but that's the ballpark


[06-Sep-21 06:28 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
Ouch.... That'll be a tough cookie to swallow for any community project....


[06-Sep-21 06:28 AM] PTYX#6840
Yeah it's not a small amount


[06-Sep-21 06:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
5BTC for one of the bigger exchanges though


[06-Sep-21 06:29 AM] Cryptoon#3362
relatively probably a 'fair' price, given the prices some small shitbox exchanges are asking


[06-Sep-21 06:31 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
I'm personally very reluctant... Past experiences with exchange listings made me weary...


[06-Sep-21 06:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Tbh if one really wants a bag, atomicdex has some nice liquidity for VRSC I believe


[06-Sep-21 06:32 AM] Cryptoon#3362
swapping them takes 2 mins max if you dont wait for dpow conf


[06-Sep-21 06:35 AM] ùôäùôûùô£ùô†#3612
You are correct, but iirc the price markup compared to the prices on CEXes is pretty steep (But even then it is good value for money)


[06-Sep-21 06:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
Yeah sure


[06-Sep-21 06:37 AM] Cryptoon#3362
even buying with 10% difference today will mean nothing if Mike's vision comes to fruition


[06-Sep-21 06:38 AM] Cryptoon#3362
will mean nothing to price in a year*

btw, someone from VRSC could fill out the form https://coinpaprika.com/add/ and add VRSC pairs to https://coinpaprika.com/exchanges/atomicdex/ ... it may become more visible then how the prices and spreads look like
the APi endpoint are
trades: https://stats-api.atomicdex.io/api/v1/trades/VRSC_KMD
orderbook: https://stats-api.atomicdex.io/api/v1/orderbook/VRSC_KMD
or any other base coin... but i saw that they add couple of base coins per default (guess they have a collection or something)

Now that adex is being tracked on coinpaprika we need to pump up these numbers like degenerate venture capitol super predators. Tokel was a nice bump but we need some more real incentives or competitions, sweepstakes, etc.

about that 'marketing' or rather: lack of perception which is suffered by Komodo:
Here is a guy that allegedly is well versed in the crypto industry, making a study mapping all cross-blockchain bridges.
He ends up with a tome of 40 something different bridges... and does not even mention Komodo, the first cross-blockchain bridge, _ever_
Why is that so?

1/ Fun fact: there are around 100 public blockchains and *over 40* bridge projects today (!)

I've written a piece explaining why bridges are important, how they are designed, who is building them, and what the future landscape might look like.

Tuesday: For Tyr, god of war, Tyr's day

Tirsdag is the day of the Norse god Tyr, the son of Odin. Tyr was a warrior, the god of the sword, and for a long time, it was believed that Tuesday was the best day to start a war.

Tyr was a more than just a brave warrior‚Äîhe was also a reliable source of wisdom and a champion of justice.

yay! @Audo thanks, appreciated! I had just turned on the audio stream when I heard your comments!
This is an interesting question, bcs all the complaining about what some ppl claim is 'lack of marketing' is not really appropriate at all.
Blaming price action that is not as dramatic as doge etc on 'lack of marketing' is cheap and not fair,
because tech like Komodo can't be compared to a new brand of chocolate or the latest and greatest in designer sneakers-
this has always annoyed me. the assumption that just throwing money at the problem and if it doesnt stick throw more money at it.
That may work with selling soda pops but not with tech.
So the question is with perception- the broader 'market' does not see what it perceives as 'boring'
Compare that to a frog- I once heard the story (not sure if true) that you can place a frog next to a pile of dead flies and maggots(yummie) and it will starve to death because it only perceives life flies.
So 'the market' wants to see the PomPom dance with the logos and VC conventions and all that- and that is just not the Komodo way.
Maybe better to not try and play a game that is not in line with  Komodos strengths are ...
I think SmartFi and Tokel can make real changes... oh and we see the same with the TOKEL IDO - how many times have the clickmonkeys gobbled up those Binance ICOs within _seconds_ of launch, and what trash did they buy there?
Just shows the immaturity of the whole market still - what I mean is, just keep up the good work, it'll pay off eventually... üçª

KMD 

[10-Sep-21 11:46 PM] LocoMB#8593
how about making a distinction between UTXO coins and non-UTXO coins? @Kelcie 
Sry, I am not  sure if I am 100% correct there, but UTXO is the BTC-paradigm, and ETH and NXT and many 2nd gen coins are a different paradigm - dont know if all the same.
Point is, the 'SmartContracts' blinkenlichten they are all getting high on were introduced with ETH and solidity, which is a js knockoff.
DOnt know if all smartcontract programming langs are js knockoffs too, but that SC vehicle is the big 'marketing' attraction.
It makes audience hypnotize themselves by firing up their imaginations. A bit like bitconneeeect, only that worked with simple greed.
So the allure of SCs is a big part of what makes the audience _not_ see anything else.
And trying to out-shine that which shines so brightly because it is the fire of imagination of the audience itself would be a wrong approach.
I think there are also script-like properties in UTXO coins, but making these into smartcontracts is more difficult and more basic.
Does KMD have smart contracts? Is this what CC is?
Large parts of the audience just won't care about such details (or won't understand either)
One important  questions is if UTXO coins are obsolete- ofc ETH maxis make a fuss about this.
But then, KMD could try to be a low level connectivity layer... ha, Now I rememeber what I was thinking about:
Maybe try to come up with something similar to the OSI layer model, but for blockchain platforms?!?!?

cross-chain. I assume there (like LocoMB mentioned) you are not referring to crossing from one currency into the other within the same L1 chain (like token swaps on ETH, BNB and what have you).
Since you are referring to *cross-chain bridges in the __ecosystem__* you may want to have a look around in Verus Discord, where bridging is active on testnet with an ETH-bridge in the works.

@ùôäùôûùô£ùô†  and @LocoMB  thank you for your feedback.  This will definitely help my research. Right now I have 3 areas, UXTO, ERC20 and BEP20. Sure it is a lot of assets to organize visually, but I would like to show how they each asset is connected instead of them just being in lumped together in a giant graphic.

Maybe pirate somewhere in there as well. Even though it's a smart chain, i think it plays a significant role in bridging/mixing

the devs are keen to add new protocols (blockchain) to atomicdex, i commented on this issue suggesting a bittorrent client. https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/issues/1337

bittorrent is the most used p2p application, and having a front end built into atomic dex would serve two user bases, increasing the userbase of the application.

what do you think?

Dear Marketing, I am not a marketeer or have ever done something with business. I was wondering, why there is not so many emphasis on the platform itself? I have found many treasures. I also notice there aren't a lot of tutorial videos. I have read an article about onboarding. A lot of tech requires a lot of knowledge that takes weeks to find. Could it be possible that someone makes a really good video for people who want to code with Komodo technology?

Historically, Komodo's marketing has tried to do a lot at once. We're focusing on sequencing and qualifying new community members so that they better understand the technology, and the vision, before we introduce them to more abstract tech and potential. I'm working closely with @Audo and @Artakush in this regard.

seems like @cryptosammy means marketing to a developer segment, for people who build blockchains to know better and more easily the "treasures" of komodo and have more efficiency with figuring things out;
i see the flipside though as komodo being high level tech that is still very new and unexplored because of various reasons;
cryptosammy are you able to make any videos about these things you're learning/discovering?  it might be a type of content that only those like yourself are capable of engaging, or it might require other kmd devs to do that instead of the other work they're already doing.  But i also see the value in having those videos from people with deep knowledge of komodo platform

What usually happens is that curious devs show up, start building stuff, and end up adding to the tech stack is some way or another.  Many things that have been built ended up getting set aside, for better or worse. The pushes to build up documentation happen and then the whole thing jumps ahead and focus shifts to building the next thing. Is what it is. Some projects endlessly market and pontificate on what they are going to do. These guys just ship code. The work you have done and are doing is very cool. I suggest pinning a donation address to the #lore-of-tokels channel so the community can more easily support your work.

@cryptosammy  once that is public it will be easier for other devs to help you if they choose to. But you are doing so well for someone with no coding experience. I am impressed. if I wasn't so busy I would totally help out. My unity is pretty rusty. But we see what you are doing and we are impressed. Your game was mentioned in the Tokel Talk yesterday

Even when that is public, a real plan needs to be composed. But honestly, what kind of planning can you make when you dont understand half of the tech you work with (nSPV, Tokenv2, smokesignal, nodejs, Unity). I also heard the shoutout on TokelTalk, I am happy that people get excited about this project. Hopefully some backing will follow soon for the project.

If you don't have a plan, how do you get a backing? If you don't understand the tech, how do you make a plan? I'd suggest that people won't donate their funds or effort (or pay you directly for doing something), if they don't know what it is you're going to do. Especially if you're new to the ecosystem and haven't proven your skill set and aptitude previously. The best thing you can do is invest in yourself (education/knowledge/learning) as you have been, tinker around and learn, then come up with a clear enough plan for somebody to understand before marketing and asking for funds. If your intent is to create a proof of concept blockchain game and you don't know what tech you are going to use, market your efforts/ the project that way. People in this community want to help build cool things, but if you expect people to pay you for your time to tinker and try and build whatever it is you want without a specific plan, then they have a right to be skeptical. 

The Komodore64 project destroyed the Komodo ecosystems ability to trust newcomers that make bold claims, ask for funding, generate hype, and use the Komodo name and ecosystem members as a means to legitify their project and make people think they are associated with (or endorsed by) the Komodo team directly. Unfortunately, you have been the first person to come along in the ecosystem that wants to do what Komodore64 claimed they were doing (make blockchain based games). So as to no fault of your own, people are going to immediately be skeptical, and they have the right to that. What you need to do is be as clear and concise in your intentions, and that trust will be built over time. How much time, I do not know.

WARNING WALL OF TEXT
```If you don't have a plan, how do you get a backing? If you don't understand the tech, how do you make a plan?```
By trying to understand the tech more first before making a really good plan. The backing is about having a budget to reach a goal. I am kind of scared to tell a veteran like you as I am not even close to a beginner in a projects like this, that there is a difference between goals and a planning. If you have a budget of 10 euro's, the plan is entirely different than a plan with a 100 euro.
```
If your intent is to create a proof of concept blockchain game and you don't know what tech you are going to use ... 
```
wow wow wow wow, the whole "proof of concept" has been the very first demo of Lore. I am sorry it looks terrible and it requires a little home setup, but its there, its ugly but for heavens sake it is working.  The fund raise is to make it an actual game that can stay alive for at least 3 years. Things like game design, art design, graphics, programming, audio, testing, quality assurance, marketing will take time, hardware, software and supporting services. With the fund raise goal, it simply means that my time and work aren't even in that calculation. I am going to need to setup a "business entity" to make the NFT store to prevent getting ruined because of tax, i need to collaborate with other people using Unity, maintain the servers and produce content. I am indeed not sure which tech will be better to use, because I feel like a traveling adventurer at this point pioneering in areas I have never seen before. If it works, it works, if it doesn't I drop it. nSPV looks great, but one of my objectives is to have a secure game (adviced by mister Lee / jl777) before it can be endorsed as a good project. I already got some community backing, thats how I got my new laptop, being able to use VPS and have some Unity asset packs. TL;DR - the fundraise is not for a demo, but a whole game which includes research. According to various online sources, a game like this to develop will cost around 25-50K to develop to alpha stage. I am aiming much lower, but not too low. 
```
then come up with a clear enough plan for somebody to understand before marketing and asking for funds
```
I think this plan is not that bad and very clear. It is underneath the pinned post for the fund raise campaign. It is right under the pinned post on the #Lore-of-Tokels channel on Tokel Discord.

```
*crossed fingers*
It looks like Lore of the Tokels is becoming much more a destiny than a "oh, let's see if I can do this".
You probably don't know me, but that might be a good thing because I am kind of "present". Yes, I talk a lot.
I am not a real programmer or game developer. I don't even get the very important things about blockchain.
What I do is try to find a solution and learn on the way. Its how I got this game working. 

LET'S START WHAT THIS PROJECT WONT BE ABOUT
1. Setting up a new coin
2. Setting up a new blockchain technology
3. Creating a brand new state of the art technology
4. Moon and Lambos
5. Fame and 100K followers
6. Creating a big FOMO with big promises
7. that end up in a FUD with big losses

... Good ... Now that is out of the way...

IT'S ABOUT 
1. Creating a multiplayer game for entertainment 
2. Where the entertainment is meant to be Play to Earn
3. Creating funny tools to make this game easy to maintain
4. And for everybody to participate in
5. Trading NFT using Tokel.io
6. Creating very cool NFT that players can really keep
7. Making use of all the awesome tech thats around

AND COULD BE EVEN ...
1. Creating a multiverse for Tokel NFT's
2. Discovering new ways to trade with tokens
3. A full time project that could stand as a flagship
4. Collaborating with ecosystem projects
5. Opening up opportunities for new Antara modules
6. Onboarding for Tokel users, developers and supporters
7. Many, many, many expansions of the Lore

[22-Oct-21 01:03 AM] cryptosammy#3587
```
Right now, this game is build with Unity and a lot of its visual/audio content is from
the asset store. So, its not really open to share. However, I use low poly models for the
look and feel. With two others, we can build this game from scratch. 

WHY?
1. So we can open up the source without any creepy copyright infringement.
2. So we can share the content for others to improve.

Security is a tough subject. With the current multiplayer source there are already three vulnerabilities.
We should totally get some help and use some tools for security review. Because nobody wants their earned
assets hijacked from a game they heavily invested in. Also, the servers aren't secured as they should be.

WHY?
1. Nobody should play a game with the fear of being robbed easily in the back of their mind
2. Because security means stability and its a great way to showcase technology such as Komodo and Tokel

The plan is for the upcoming 6 months to keep the game open so people can use blockchain without really
having to know the underlying tech. We are going to need equipment, servers, software (like that photo editing 
suite that is expensive, professional version of Unity so we can collaborate, video recording software so we 
can make good content for Social Media). But for that we need chivalry. Backing. Support. Patrons.

All the content we make, will be promotional for Komodo and Tokel. The tools we build and the game will be,
once the Asset Store content is replaced, completely open source. And for people who back this project to
make a difference, we will grant your player an estate worthy of a Knight in the Lore of the Tokels, baked into a 
NFT, making you a true Laird in the Empire of Tokelina.

*People in this community want to help build cool things, but if you expect people to pay you for your time to tinker and try and build whatever it is you want without a specific plan, then they have a right to be skeptical.*
I agree. I have setup a Trello, and still researching some technology like nSPV and BitGo to see if that would be a better option than a full node. Just looking at this, took a whole week which I could have spent on "making an amazing plan", but instead I got nSPV working for Lore partially and even though I am still drowning in the difficulty, I am happy I made this choice. 

I don't know the ins and outs about the Komodore64 and Redfox stories (and there was another i forgot), and learned that wayyyyy later. It is sad that it happened, but I got here from Atomic DEX and doing a Skrill/Paxful integration and because of the discussion here, I got into the game idea that now is Lore of the Tokels. I am not a business, I am not pretending to deliver something I cannot, my source is open, so you can see my great amateurism. I share what I have learned with others and if you calculate that fundraise for three years of development and look at the fact if I would work 20 hours a week for three years, that would simply not be realistic. So I am doing the development work as a volunteer, but hope that the NFT's I create will make that worth the while. I am not those people. I understand the traumas from the past. I don't see however how I could even match these two cases as I am well not doing the millions thing, not trying to build coins or games that don't exist. Lore of the Tokels is far from finished, but it is off to a great start. For the record, it is not that I got this idea by myself. I was inspired by others from HERE. My intention was to create an atomic dex for fraternity house parties, not a game. Who ever is sceptical, thats their right. But how can one be sceptical of the project intent, if the source is out there (with exception of the Unity asset packs) ? How can one be sceptical of the project intent, when progress is like done almost on a daily basis through Twitter? How can one be sceptical if the person who is doing this is asking genuine questions in Komodo discord, Tokel discord, Unity Discord, Infosec Discord that are obvious that I don't know most things. I have shared some people the online version of the game, just to get some more feedback. I don't see where there is a need for scepticism when it comes to backing the project. Either you believe I can complete this game or not. If someone doesn't thats completely fine by me, because I barely believe in myself - but I do believe I can complete this. I don't think that is being sceptic, the words are cautious and paranoia. I will make this game with the bare minimum. I might not be a brilliant mind, a good marketer, have a youtube channel, blockchain expertise, a real programmer, an experienced game designer, a project manager or planner - but what I do know is that I made a cool demo that works with Tokel platform, and doing cool stuff with Komodo tech and learning a lot from people here.

@Artakush Here we go. Posting my "Marketing" plan for the AtomicDEX competition:

Individual prizes (ie. competition) for campaigns incentivize people to not share knowledge of the campaign with others via social media. There is little reason to tell more people about a campaign, thereby making the competitive pool larger and my chances of winning smaller, so a campaign needs to take care to align incentives (ie. goals of campaign creator and participants)

---
Laying out the incentives/goals:

Komodo - Let me know if I missed some, Komodo wants to get more people to download AtomicDEX mobile and AtomicDEX Desktop. They want more people using it. They want more NEW people using it, even for a short time period (length of the campaign) because they hope to retain some of these new users as long term users. They want more volume in the DEX which looks better on aggregate sites like Coinpaprika. They want 3rd party projects listed on AtomicDEX to see AtomicDEX as a viable, fair, trusted, privacy friendly exchange and wallet they can recommend to their users.

Users - Users want to earn non-cash and cash prizes for their efforts. Users may enjoy the competitive nature in general. They may want to participate in the fun/social aspect of a campaign. They may be solely motivated by greed. They may want to see Komodo succeed and the success of AtomicDEX could indicate this. They may want to see their favorite 3rd party project succeed publicly to Komodo and the community. 

---
Some ideas to align incentives:

1. Create a minimum threshold prize for all participants based on social media outreach KPIs or AtomicDEX Download counts. If minimum threshold is met (must be a higher threshold) then all participants will win some non-cash prize. example: If AtomicDEX v0.5.X reaches 1,000 downloads, all participants will win a random gift. This creates an incentive for people to share the competition with others, ie. more users. It hits both user and komodo goals.


[22-Oct-21 04:10 PM] Regnar#6164
2. Create higher tiers of prizes for everyone that participates based social media outreach KPIs. example: If campaign hashtag reaches N retweets, or AtomicDEX twitter gets N followers, Komodo tweet gets N likes/retweets, etc. Then the next higher tier of prizes is opened up. Tiers can be wider or taller, or both. ie. higher tiers could be higher prizes for 1st, 2nd, 3rd (taller) or more prizes will be offered to 4th, 5th, 6th ...Nth places (wider). This broadens the reward base creating more incentive to share the competition. 

3. Make prizes for communities as well as individuals. If we are tracking Number of KMD swaps within the exchange as the winning metric, then we can bucket swaps by the 3rd party coin being swapped with. So instead of saying "Swap KMD to X coin as many times as possible" we flip the script and say "Swap your X coin to KMD as many times as possible. The Coin community with the most swaps to KMD will win Y prize" this creates an incentive for individuals in other communities to rally their collectives and Win the competition. It still has slight drag as an incentive since you may not want to share with too many communities, but if you like 2-3 coins on AtomicDEX, you could hedge your bet that one of their communities will rally and win. This creates an incentive for individuals to share with their communities, but also for communities to spread the word and rally.

4. Create a category of prizes for mobile app users. A huge and fair complaint I got in Telegram from users the last competition was that they couldn't even click as fast as some people running scripts on desktop apps. They had zero opportunity to win, so a different category for mobile users would be good. This creates an incentive for mobile users to actually participate because they could be the fastest in the mobile category.


[22-Oct-21 04:10 PM] Regnar#6164
5. Establish rules! Maker swaps should not count towards swap counts. Someone could set market maker prices low in order to get takers to buy into their wall. For every swap a taker participant makes, that one maker participant also makes one. I think DogeDEX ran into this problem. It angered a lot of people. This also means we would need active market makers for trading pairs, either within the community or from 3rd parties. Someone could put up market maker orders with the sole purpose of helping their community increase taker swaps.

6. Airdrop periodic coins to addresses that are actively swapping coins but aren't within reach of winning that round (both mobile and desktop, separately) For example at random points of time Komodo could airdrop coins to an address that has been swapping coins, so long as it is continuously swapping. This creates more incentive for people to participate longer, if you are actively swapping you could be the recipient, even if you aren't crushing it.

7. Break up competitions into smaller chunks. Some people may not be able to participate for the full time, but could try during a window of time and have a chance of winning by not competing with people swapping all day. This creates incentive for people to participate throughout the day, even for shorter bursts.

8. Consider non-linear prizes for rankings. Reality is there will be bots, that's okay. But there is likely a number of swaps that can be determined as "A lot for a person, probably not a bot" and those should have a decently high prize compared to the higher ranks that are "probably bots". There's not too many reasons for a bot to slow down, there's always a reason to speed up, so we should be ready to award those who are fast but not as fast as bots. Basically, there's a point in which a person probably isn't manually clicking (mouse or thumbs) that fast to make swaps, at just below that point there should be a bump in prizes again.


[22-Oct-21 04:10 PM] Regnar#6164
9. Moonshot tiers. There should be a moonshot tier of prizes or KPI, that if we reach it, there's an absolute frenzy of awards for users. For example, if Elon Musk tweets in response, retweets, or likes a campaign post all participants win a random Elon-san Musk Foil NFT (on Tokel) 

10. Live streams, preferably with representatives from different coins coming to talk about their projects. This adds to the community and social aspect of the competition and gives projects a platform to advertise their coins, Komodo gains by association. Live streams should also have chat features and be on Youtube or other low barrier to entry platform.

11. Leaderboards, people like seeing who is on top or where they sit. There should also be a breakdown by mobile and desktop, and update on prize tier status.

This is what I've got so far off the top of my head. Hope you like it!

Appreciate the response. I want to be clear that my discussion about this is to help better inform the community and ecosystem about what my personal thoughts are and to help inform people of my (and the Tokel teams) stance on these types of endeavors. I absolutely love the fact that somebody is creating apps/games on top of Komodo/Tokel technology. That is incredible and should be commended and incubated accordingly. As you mentioned, people can believe in you or not, and if they don't, that is fine. What I don't want is people to be misinformed and believe that by virtue of association to the Komodo/Tokel platform (in whatever capacity that is; similar names, discussions with team/community members, using the tech), that a project is immediately trustworthy or legit. They need to make an informed decision, rather than a decision based on face value hype and making connections that don't actually exist (assumed endorsements etc). If the KMD ecosystem isn't careful about this, and because there aren't a tonne of projects being made using KMD tech, we may find ourselves with the unfortunate reputation of hosting scams. Other, larger ecosystems (ETH for example), have scams, but they have a huge amount of legit projects to help balance that all out. 

Anyhow, I am speaking generally on a lot of these topics, not specifically directing them at any project in-particular. I would also approach any people/project with the same cautiousness and hesitation as I have with you & Lore specifically. I want the KMD ecosystem to thrive, not become a haven for scammy projects that take money off the community due to our kindness and excitement. Again, not saying that this is what is occurring with you, just explaining my thoughts in general.

Interesting. Thanks for posting that. I'm not yet sure exactly what form this trading competition will take. Maybe it will be a who can click the most competition. My thoughts on a trade competition are different however. (Prize distribution aside) I don't see much game in simply who can click trades the most. I view this as just transferring coins. I personally think there is more game in actually trading coins. Ie: setup minimum of 3 coins plus orderbook, players trade from one orderbook to the next inorder to obtain the final coin. Then who ever has the most of coin 3 at the end of the competition wins via a payout order on the dex. Simply mashing buttons in my opinion is not much of a competition, but that's me


[23-Oct-21 07:09 AM] Regnar#6164
Yea, I was just assuming it would be a volume competition. I do however think many of the other ideas (particularly 1, 2, and 3) are about properly incentivizing people and communities to share the competition to bring in more users. If there are collective goals that also benefit the individual, it reduces the hesitancy to share it and reduce your ability to win

Not sure what the marketing competition is, but I have a great idea on a YouTube/quick 30sec 1 min video of showing how ‚Äòdecentralized‚Äô and anonymous you can get while using atomicDEX. Basically a video going to a coin atm. Putting in $100 in LtC.

What is trust? You can trust someone based on their actions, their personality and the people they hang out with. And even then, you can be wrong - I have been there and will most likely be fooled again in life. Perhaps not with crypto, doesn't make it any worse or better. 

For the code, the community should depend on the veteran people here to look at it, and give their opinion for the non-coders (not that I am really a coder). Lore is an actual playable game. It requires a bit of work to setup, but so does a komodo blockchain. I invite anyone to look at my code! The only difference is that I can't share the asset packs I am using, but all monobehaviours are up and open!  I made a long story what the project is about and am showing an organic development of the game. I am not doing something different than putting up a kickstarter, only just not where 30% goes to a platform. I don't see the harm in doing so. I can see that there might be perception that Lore of the Tokels is somehow connected with Komodo and Tokel. I will try to make something that will make clear that Lore of the Tokels is independent and not associated by these parties, if that is what you are asking. 

I think this game benefits the Komodo and Tokel community after some time. Why? Because it is made with Komodo and Tokel. A game is tangible, and honestly I like myself to play and tinker with it. I think a game like Lore of the Tokels can be much more than just NFTs and play to earn. It can adopt people to get in touch with crypto. You can't deny that a game makes that path a lot easier. 

In my opinion, people who know crypto, know a lot more than me. If they want to back the project, I don't see the harm for setting a realistic goal. If they do so, because they think Komodo or Tokel endorses it, have you thought about that the game is made with technology from both? So whether I make statements "Lore of the Tokels is not associated or part of Komodo Platform and Tokel Platform.", there will be still an association. So far, I had no questions regarding Lore of the Tokels - curiosity should eventually lead to truth.

@cryptosammy - Maybe you should touch base and do a Komodo Tale with @daybreak. Lore Of The Tokels - Part 1 : Your generic background, how you came on to the community, how you decided on Lore Of The Tokels, your vision for the game, and what you have learned so far. Part 2 can come later as the game grows

The exchange where most of Komodo‚Äôs trading takes place is Binance.

Wouldn‚Äôt it be safer for Komodo to live longer if it was listed on a major exchange other than Binance?

What if Komodo gets delisted from Binance?

I hope that Komodo will be listed on big exchanges like coinbase or ftx.

So when I think of the worst case, I just get anxious.

OKR: there is I believe a roadmap on the Komodo website. Komodo platform has partners and an ecosystem, not so much clients as far I have understood - except... a whole lot of users! (Which should be considered stakeholders).


[30-Oct-21 03:21 AM] cryptosammy#3587
Komodo provides a platform to create cryptocurrency and has UTXO "smart contracts" (be very careful with that term!), which are called CC (there are what mixtures what that means, but the safe bet is to say Antara). Komodo also has a state of the art wallet, Atomic DEX, considered a flagship, allowing... atomic swaps!


[30-Oct-21 03:25 AM] cryptosammy#3587
Important to know that the Komodo team works and assists on many projects (ecosystem), acting as a factory for innovation, which are often inspired by @jl777c - mister Lee, the founder of Komodo, mister Stadelmann the CTO, incubate and accelerate projects such as Tokel by providing developers. Recently Komodo became part of a crypto alliance.

My two satoshi when it comes to marketing is making certain topics more easy to adopt for new developers. If I look at Lore, a lot of things I did not have to code, but to "understand" or to "discover". I love Atomic DEX, but the power of the platform is beyond everything. A subject like oracles, sure there is documentation, but the docs are very straightforward - great if you have been here for a while, but very tough to digest when everything is new and you want to achieve something. Empathise with me - i haven't even seen the rest of the CC's! 

When I was trying to get Lore's multiplayer working, I didn't knew anything about websockets. I still don't really grasp them indepth - but I know what they are, know how to use them and why I need them! This video helped me with the whole setup. (of course the new version of Lore is way better, but still - it is about a starting point)

surveys are often done - I never participate in them though - by the social team after town hall. There are also a lot of very technical looking stats pages (dexstats/richlist/etc).

[31-Oct-21 06:51 AM] cryptosammy#3587
the question is about profiles regarding the people who are in the community - to get a good idea of how that community is composed, that spectrum should be wide. You are not alone in your views, but are outspoken (thus a very good candidate to analyze). It is not about newbies, but getting insight for a marketeer like @SUCH_a_Flore. Preaching for the choir is one, but market growth about reaching further than that. Which means addressing certain views and questions (even if they don't make you popular or praised)


[31-Oct-21 07:21 AM] cryptosammy#3587
For example, 
- A is one of those people who have a background in crypto, made some successes and probably some failures too - sticks with idealism in regard to cryptocurrency. Not hype, but facts - mostly looking at use case and innovation. <just scraping away the beautiful comments, sarcasm and really fast comebacks in offtopic>
- B is one of those people who have genuine good ideas, follows the trends in cryptospace and wants to push KMD into a "grow grow grow" direction. I am not sure, but he/she comes across like someone who invested long term in KMD and looks thus at long term goals
- C is kind of the "news flash" person, who actively talks about every possible opportunity/threat. Not sure what he/she does, but looks like someone who actively watches charts and feeds. Not sure what he/she contributes to KMD, yet I do experience valuable information that could be used to make KMD better in comparison
- D is the idea person, who seems to be well informed in what Komodo could potentially mean. Like the Dragon Fairy idea, setting up the mere basics and could totally represent a person who is starting a 3rd party project from scratch
- E is attracted to the potential of Komodo, but with a very clear commercial mind when it comes to monetizing such ideas. Perhaps not very technical, but technical enough to start his/her own nodes and trial by error.
- F seems to know a lot, but very "raw" when it comes to social interaction. Politics won't cut it, but he/she looks like a diehard fan of the ideals of KMD (at least the ideas that could lead to anarchy or something similar)
- G is a standup tech who actively contributes to KMD, worked his way up by going for the tech. Mostly driven by this, I think he represents the kind of community member that comes closest to KMD ideals.
- H I know from Tokel.io - who probably has a long history here. Political correct, careful but also the type of people who make a plan, use the tech and roll out. Not so much interested in the hype, but does comes across to target awareness and change.
- K comes across as someone who experienced broken dreams, yet still wants to get back that feeling of hope. Most agony comes from missing out where other crypto organizations would hunt like a bloodhound on pep. 
- L is a profile that would fit between grewalsatinder and nutellicka. 
- M makes content and comes from another world before landing here following opportunity, yet not that focused on the coin value but on the possibilities.
- N is non technical regarding his own words, but seems to be a praiser of KMD, speaks about markets. Not lot to find about, but it also respresents a profile.
- Q places content, contributes socially to general talks. Part of a 3rd party (Tokel), but not so much present in regard to opinion. 
I think if you let out the bots and the "help where is my pobkey oshit atomdex no fiat why when moon" people, you got a fairly good image of the community.

I‚Äôm willing to donate 200kmd to the airdrop but hope others can help chip in too if it happens. Their community is massive and very active with lots of newcomers and people who have been around since 2014 etc


[02-Nov-21 06:40 PM] Regnar#6164
AMAs are often a really good idea.


[02-Nov-21 07:38 PM] jspook16#3059

[02-Nov-21 08:15 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239

[02-Nov-21 08:16 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
Constantly 200-300 comments/likes on the posts. Honestly don‚Äôt think he will charge anything to do a guest show / ama with kmd


[02-Nov-21 08:16 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
But it would do wonders on the community to airdrop (happy to donate) to get them in, as well as a live demo of atomicdex etc


[02-Nov-21 08:20 PM] jspook16#3059

An airdrop for audience is a great idea Crabby.  This could be the model moving forward.  It's honest and influencers also like it as it builds interest in their group.

@Crabby Paddy it was mentioned that your Facebook group has designed games.

https://komodoplatform.com/en/blog/decentralized-margin-trading/

Why not hook them with some inspiration. 

From 2019, when the komodo momentum was building. This was right before the air got let out by a series of events. Agama hack, COVID-19, redfox debacle, black joker departure.  It would be amazing to reinject some energy into this. This was one of the best projects in my opinion.

I mention this because, it might be best to approach this group not just as hey invest in my coin but hey invest in my ecosystem, here is some inspiration and reasons for speculation.

I get what you are saying here. But these things, do they directly promote kmd? Or is it promoting adex, smft, and the utxo partnership? Kmd the coin, why would I invest in this? You just told me to invest in smft, and kmd isn't listed anywhere. And if promoting adex, is the group american? Can't use adex if American, here use the turkey version. 
Note: not busting your balls but trying to look at our marketing message from an outside perspective.

It would definately kickstart a whole lot more people looking into kmd, making their own choices and hopefully for others to start posting about kmd as well


[03-Nov-21 02:43 PM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Let me rephrase. I think your suggestion is a good suggestion. I also think that there should be a unified selling points for kmd, komodod ecosystem, and adex.
1. Best selling points for kmd are the 5% rewards, and the liquidity provider of the komodod ecosystem. Plus nSPV
2. Best selling points for the komodod ecosystem are dPOW, easy integration into the DEX, anybody can create their own chain with a variety of settings to choose from, ie,: pirate, and the power of Custom Consensus Modules (cc) {existing: Tokel, space coin, MCL,  and future potential {that decentralized margin trading game}
3. Best selling points for Atomicdex are non custodial wallet, multiple versions include {existing:Marmaradex, dogedex, gleecdex, future: piratedex, webdex}, SMTF success and use case, future kmd usecases for adex


[03-Nov-21 02:47 PM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
That group looks like it wants reasons to speculation a crypto asset, so sales pitch should be geared towards this mindset


[03-Nov-21 02:48 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Pirate doesn't have CC. So I'd add the fact anybody can create their own blockchain in point #2.

Yeah but to be honest...its a big oportunity...i dont know why kmd team (marketing) dont use it...it's not like we have many other promising marketing projects ... if we don't use this "free" opportunity, I see no reason not to be critical of marketing any more.


[04-Nov-21 01:23 AM] find_your_way#5266
the offensive came from you (community) and kmd doesn't use it ... it's really sad


[04-Nov-21 01:30 AM] find_your_way#5266
I really don't understand kmd sometimes. marketing is planning a huge event. they don't make it in time and postpone it and announce an even bigger event. then the event will be completely canceled at short notice due to corona, which is understandable. however, one should have known that earlier. Anyway ... a lot of time and money is invested and in the end there is no result. and then you come up with your cool and free idea, you even establish contact with a big influencer with a lot of reach and marketing seems to have no interest ... I really have no more words for that ...


[04-Nov-21 04:05 AM] cryptosammy#3587
there was some feedback from @PTYX so it caught the attention - maybe the CTO is simply not available (I don't see ca333 often online here). To bad the follow up takes long, especially for something like an AMA)


[04-Nov-21 05:43 AM] PTYX#6840
What I meant was to present the idea to artakush/audo, have them vet it, let them coordinate with the rest of the marketing team and they will run it up the ladder to either get CA o whoever on the AMA. We don't just do these types of things by-the-seat-of-our-pants.

Because let's be honest. The bulk of all people use crypto simply for speculation. We approach a large group of people who think like this, we need to present kmd in this view. There need to be reasons for them to buy and hold and support. It's been a long running theme around here that kmd has been so hard to explain exactly what it is that people don't get the value proposition of it. Pirate, Tokel people immediately get the value proposition, it's very easy to understand. I love Verus, but let's be honest, their multi chain architecture is also competing with kmd multichain architecture. (And things like Verus ID, bridge, etc, are very easy to see the value proposition). Users such as hollowman don't see the value proposition in kmd but they do in Verus. That is why I'm proposing a sales pitch, and really it should always be a sales pitch when doing marketing. And definitely a sales pitch to a group of people who invest in cryptocurrency and on occasion pump them.


[04-Nov-21 06:15 AM] ‡º∫Œ±‚ò¨‰∏Ç”¶¬¢ ‡ºí ‡ºª#5987
Note: if smartfi is talked about it should be mentioned in a way that it highlights the successful dex sales and usage. Past that, smartfi isn't on a kmd assetchain so this link to kmd is confusing. Smartfi choose their own chain (BSC clone). Which is ironic since komodo devs assured the community that it was worthless to try to bridge in solidarity code to CC


[04-Nov-21 07:09 AM] cryptosammy#3587
I understand what you say. My opinion is that Komodo shouldnt adjust to the view of the majority of people but on its intrinsic power.

Luckily this is exactly where kmd is currently, not competing. Don't have to do anything then, no need to AMA. I'm sure anyone looking for solutions kmd ecosystem has to offer will find us organically without any effort on our part. After all this is the approach that we have had for several years now.


[04-Nov-21 07:35 AM] cryptosammy#3587
I think there is a difference between exposure and direct competition.


[04-Nov-21 07:36 AM] cryptosammy#3587
Exposure is good, because Komodo is good for people who want to build things.

With Ethereum you can not create your own coin without strings attached. Komodo allows you to do so without any string attached. You can set up a blockchain of your own without dPow for some bucks. Sure, the composer is out of the air, but it takes a small tutorial.


[04-Nov-21 07:42 AM] cryptosammy#3587
I assume that the value of KMD depends on its demand, and trade volume right?


[04-Nov-21 07:43 AM] cryptosammy#3587
Everything you need to make a KMD powered webshop is here. Komodo offers every tool you can possibly imagine.

Ultimately I agree with you and am playing devil's advocate. But the reoccurring theme here is why hasn't the ecosystem acted like a snowball rolling down hill? Why are we still in bootstrap phase? The momentum needed to get to the 1000+ assetchain is lacking. Why is that?

However, I do see the Komodo success formula.


[04-Nov-21 07:54 AM] cryptosammy#3587
Which is

"We ship code."


[04-Nov-21 07:54 AM] cryptosammy#3587
And Komodo does so.


[04-Nov-21 07:54 AM] cipi#4502
the problem with the assetchains is that "projects" decide to launch a token on some ERC20 chains instead of running their own chain... it's much easier for them... of course it comes with a price, nothing is for free... just that the price is not payed by the issuer of the tokens, but later by the users in form of txfees on that foreign chain that also needs to be payed in a foreign coin not related to the actual project

We can throw ideas out, if they seem good, get it escalated and looked at asap. If the idea is not a good one, then give reasoning why it is not good so we can understand things from the marketting teams pov as well as change our ideas to reflect better of what Komodo is looking to achieve

Is there any reason why Komodo can't be listed on Coinbase?

Does it fall short of Coinbase standards?

Komodo is not understood. So its feared. No one wants to be the entity that gave it a chance to be exposed to the world and possibly become a competitor. #FearTheDragon

This idea is more personal rather than KMD Marketing Idea. We must share all the ideas around to see what we would like to see and work with, it does not end up at the Komodo marketing team. I personally want to contribute from myself that makes me smile and also educate people, community, Ones who have no idea what crypto is at all


[16-Nov-21 10:17 AM] cryptosammy#3587
If two people from the Komodo team ask for a chip in, doesn't sound to me like an initiative on a personal title. I hope you can take criticism. It is YOUR nickname that is in the "we are hiring" tweet and people have to "work shoulder to shoulder with". I have been not here for long, just some months - but you must have noticed the sceptic views on the marketing performance. Prior going into #üí¨‚îÉgeneral why didn't you use the channel #writers-room you promoted yourself? Everyone is entitled to their own views, but do you not agree that as a community manager you should balance your actions a bit more carefully?

We need volume, so we would have the best marketing. A vicious circle.

There's a bit of history and a copyright issue, which I think is why Komodo stopped using it, maybe someone can explain, I forget what happened.  Yes this would be awesome in your game, a much loved icon of Komodo.  Long Live Komodo Knight! key promotional figure during Komodo's ATH era.

its a legit question. kmd team said that they find a good replacement for upbit but until now (6 months later) nothing happened...so the question is why kmd say they have a new korean exchange? In between it was said that the listing process would take longer ... but 6 months ?? Nobody believes that anymore.

Most Koreans who invest in coins have a very, very, very low proportion of dex transactions.

More than 90% of transactions are made through Upbit, Bithumb, and Coinone exchanges.

Of course, Upbit has the highest trading volume in Korea.

The daily trading volume is in trillions.

Next up are Bithumb and Coinone.

Because of the low marketability or public awareness of dex, I am sure that listing Komodo Coin on Bithumb or Coinone can have an immediate effect.

Once kmd  become famous, more people will learn about the coin and study it.


[27-Nov-21 08:40 PM] Crabby Paddy#6239
It had multiple years for people to learn and study while it was on upbit

trying to get on CEXs will prly be an attritious losing proposition - why go into rearguard action, better go forward and expand into new territory ..  I think Komodo is toxic for most CEXes so  better to shift and and develop towards DEX

I've used Kakao in the past and was always impressed with the emoji characters. In Seoul they have erected entire stores for Kakao emoji merchandise. Can't say yet how it could work for a K-dex.

I just took a look at https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ehpXdtxs3-sNtuChg6Mv-bMYa-ZMffkz?usp=sharing. I am going to try and make some of these avatars. However, for k-dex, maybe the non pixelation art would be best. I don't know, just my first impression. Still this method is pretty cool. I'm going to see what other characters can be created. Dog, frog, bear, cat, bird, duck, etc

To be clear: Verus has been dealing with an entity that had a franchise agreement with BitHumb Korea. After the franchise agreement was terminated by BitHumb Korea, that entity continued under the name BitGlobal and has nothing but trouble since.
BitHumb Korea has its own red flags in Social Media channels.

yeah this is what happened to our negotiations. Basically we are in talks with bithumb, coinone, and gate. Both Bithumb and Coinone stopped listings on their Korean pair exchanges. We did get offers for Bithumb Global but no KRW pair. Gate told us a few weeks ago that they will have a solution early next year for KRW pairs, so we're sort of waiting for an opportunity.

we actually have a lot of different stable coins listed... look for `forex_id` in config, like https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/blob/dev/assets/config/0.5.3-coins.json#L839 ... all those are stable coins
will add more soon, like https://learn.jarvis.network/protocol-overview/contracts (EUR, CHF, GBP are already added)

Do we need a version of DEX for each of these communities? Might not be a bad idea. Different languages, different themes. 
Can you expand on the china comment? Ie: crypto bad, p2p good


[29-Nov-21 06:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
In my opinion, just single app, but with only language support will be sufficient


[29-Nov-21 06:34 AM] grewalsatinder#9653
so the main target should be localisation of AtomicDEX in as many languages as possible

maybe even combined with a voting system. This means that the community can, for example, also express wishes and vote for them and even donate kmd or other crypto to finance and accelerate the whole thing. I think that way we could become much more effective and the communication between team and community will become stronger again.

```
For example, app_de.ts sets the target language to German, and app_de_ch.ts sets the target language to German and the target country to Switzerland. This also helps loading translations for the current locale automatically. For more information, see Developers.

I have an idea what could be the best marketing gimmick. The price of KMD should be around 7-8 usdt.

The best marketing is, JL777 should reveal his/her identity to the public.

Nothing more, nothing less. We moon. üåô

There are plenty of articles about jl777 that discuss who he is and what he has done for the world.  Suggesting to Dox someone isn‚Äôt cool.  Do some research. Putting this suggestion in multiple channels, just shows you haven‚Äôt even tried.

Hey is there any way to publish Komodo platform and AtomicDEX web page analytics? I'd love to see the report on viewers, their most frequent pages, where they come from, where they go, time spent on pages, etc. Could be really cool to publish monthly or something.

I've been looking at different analytics providers like google or plausible (I'm liking plausible) and saw they allow you to make your page statistics public for anyone visiting the page. I think komodo and atomicdex use google analytics, but it would be nice for the community to see the data

Howey Test
The Howey Test determines which transactions qualify as an "investment contract" and would therefore be subject to U.S. securities laws.

Both of these things fall under the heading of "don't abuse the feature to the point that enough people mute it and more people miss actual information that __everyone__ should have"

@grewalsatinder same question for `https://komodian.org/` 

I have a bot that posts AtomicDEX and Komodian website links and shows the number of downloads (pulled from github) for the current version of AtomicDEX, and I thought it might help the project to help get an idea if it's actually driving any users towards the sites.

oh don't give me too much credit lol I have **zero** evidence my bot helped in anyway. That's why I was hoping to get a UTM code from komodian and atomicdex websites. Then I can add that code to the URL I post in Telegram daily and we can get a better idea of what traffic actually comes from Telegram


[15-Dec-21 05:46 PM] daybreak#8641

[15-Dec-21 05:48 PM] Regnar#6164
Not sure actually. I don't think Komodian is running any analytics on the site. I think komodo platform is running google analytics


[15-Dec-21 05:51 PM] Regnar#6164
I was trying to think of some way I could do that, but not sure tbh. I was thinking maybe there was a way to add my own server as a proxy, bounce the link through me and then to the actual site so I could log traffic. But that seems a bit much for what might just be very little traffic anyway. The *right* answer is to use the analytics service that is already in place and create a specific UTM endpoint with Telegram as the referrer.


[15-Dec-21 05:52 PM] Regnar#6164
That way when Komodo checks site analytics, they can see where traffic comes from (twitter, google, duckduckgo, telegram etc)

You probably found this page because one of our subscribers used Mailchimp to send you an email campaign and you traced a link in the email back here to investigate. Mailchimp is a marketing platform that serves millions of companies of all shapes and sizes, from all over the world. We send more than 1 billion emails every day, and we help our customers comply with spam laws and best practices so they can get their campaigns into their subscribers' inboxes.

@Regnar Komodian doesn‚Äôt has google analytics. It can be added. But I don‚Äôt feel comfortable adding data analysis tool to community website. Usually such things as I understand required privacy policy and legal stuff sorted and I would like to avoid such kind of things. Even for my own company Meshbits and Pirate Wallet m strictly following no logging and no analysis tools usage everywhere.

I totally agree, I wasn't advocating for that. idk what type of framework you're using for the site, but handling logs with additional params after a url would be the same thing. Unless it's serverless (which I suspect it is) then we'd have to do something else

If we are going to focus on marketing, we are going to need measurements. We could make smart pixels ourselves. Or use GA. I would go for GA.

@Regnar love those stats and 100 hearts for your efforts


[16-Dec-21 10:51 AM] cryptosammy#3587
@Minigunner I think that everyone tags are overrated, but I agree that the big sites should totally be more giving attention to campaigns. But if marketing team doesnt see these things, oh well, nothing we can do about it there. Not sure about the Komodian page, but maybe check with @grewalsatinder and see if we can make a landingpage and super promote on this campaign.


[16-Dec-21 10:57 AM] Artakush#4285
We are already working on that


[16-Dec-21 11:20 AM] Minigunner#0467
I think that announcement was pretty important don't you think? Both sides Komodo and DigiByte should go 100% full speed ahead with this campaign.

sure, but I'm still not in favour of google analytics tools used for community resources.
just like I do not support tipbots in Komodian discord, but those are added anyways.
if anyone wants to do analytics, they can manage those things themselves as group.
Consider my words as advise. I do not wish to be in-charge of Komodian, but there to guide and advise things.
jekyll website is already on github, and analytics ID can be added to it. make a PR for whatever changes wanted there.
Hugo based temp static website is also on my github shared it in Komodian, which I would encourage others to fork and push missing information to it, and any updates to it.
Do whatever you all collectively want.

So I was reading the 2021 Year Review and saw this under the Ecosystem Milestones and Industry Firsts: "August 2021 - Dubbed 'ARRRtomic swaps', Komodo successfully demonstrated the first shielded atomic swap between Komodo (KMD) and Pirate Chain (ARRR)."  Is it really shielded swap? Afaik current pirate swaps pull pirate out of the shielded pool, make a swap and send it back to shielded pool.

this makes the coin look ''cheap'' even tho is basically the same üòÑ

VEN did it back in 2018 and now is call VET.

Hi guys!
ADEX is still in beta testing. I know we will see explosive growth in the near future. I have been trading on ADEX for 3+ years. I know what NN and dPOW are.
 And that's what I want to tell you, my dears.
 Every time when my KMD swaps are waiting to be notarized (my personal best is ~3 hours), I imagine that in my place is a New User.
  A New User will first worry that the swap stuck for >hour (and he does not know about notarization), and then he will be disappointed with the speed of swaps with the central coin of the ecosystem üò¶
  Only after that, the New User will find out in #support (if he doesn't leave immediately) that it was a notarization - and it can be disabled for small swaps.
In fact, this is already happening. ...and the fact that ADEX is still in beta doesn't make up for the negative impression that newcomers have.
  I am well aware that disabling notarization for swaps by default will provoke 51 attacks in the future.
 Therefore, I do not see a future without speeding up notarization. Actually, when the transition of NN to LTC took place, I naively expected that swaps would be faster, until I figured it out  - no üò¶
 It is depressing that swaps on fast blockchains without the participation of KMD happen instantly - this is just REAL continuous marketing against KMD üò¶
 I am not a developer. Maybe the problem will be solved differently.
  But one thing I am 100% sure of:  if ADEX comes out of beta with still long KMD swaps...   neither reduced commissions nor active marketing will help. The hourly wait for a deal will speak for itself  üò¶
                     With great respect for the Team and your efforts.

P.S. For the sake of clarity, I give the definition for "New User"
  - this is the middle participant in the wave that will overwhelm us after the words of Influencer about our project. It will be a VERY short wave - and the FIRST impression will tell him everything about us.
- Yes! he is the one who never reads EULA and chainsaw instructions üòâ
- he forgets to write down SEED.
- he in general - came here on a hype and makes hasty conclusions üòâ
- there is a LOT of him and he will spread the good news about us.

The finality time of the core consensus is just not fast enough for DeFi use case, compared to Avalanche, Fantom, Harmony or even Ethereum


[09-Feb-22 01:32 AM] smkhound#7640
There is option to set it to not use notarisations, though this might be more obvious for the uninitiated.

The slowest swaps are with coins with the slowest blocktimes, not much to be done there except use BTC-BEP20 rather than BTC.


[09-Feb-22 01:35 AM] smkhound#7640
I have an idea about adding "distractions" in the app like chat or simple gaming to take the edge off the wait (and maybe incorporate swap events with in game powerups / monsters etc), though that's well outside the core function of the app so there are higher prio tasks competing with that idea


[09-Feb-22 01:40 AM] Panho#7078
@smkhound  My whole thread is about this - For the Uninitiated aka New Users it should be VERY EASY to trade.
  Otherwise, they will leave us without understanding (see my definition üòâ  ) In fact, this is already happening - this is happening all the time while the ADEX beta version is in the public testing  üò¶


[09-Feb-22 01:52 AM] smkhound#7640
added a discussion issue here for distractions - https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/atomicDEX-Desktop/issues/1606
please feel free to open one for areas where the uninitiated might need some extra info to help in their understanding of things.


[09-Feb-22 02:03 AM] Panho#7078
I write here - in #marketing. Because I think that the release of ADEX in its current form (and active pre-marketing of it) will lead to user disappointment.


[09-Feb-22 02:15 AM] Panho#7078
@smkhound I came across your link. I consider this unacceptable. And I'll explain why: Resources.
I have about 70 active orders. And the app doesn't behave very fast on my fast computer. All that you described will additionally slow down the interface. I'm not a developer, but I'm afraid that additional traffic in the application will slow down swaps too. The average user's computer/smartphone is not fast - we will lose users.


[09-Feb-22 02:21 AM] smkhound#7640
They're optional and there shouldn't be much overhead in rendering text from RSS or chat. I dont propose this for phones, just desktop. it shouldnt slow down swaps, most of that wait is a wait for confirmations


[09-Feb-22 02:25 AM] smkhound#7640
for the mini games, I had in mind the most simple things like "snake" which had no problem running on a nokia 3310.


[09-Feb-22 03:04 AM] Panho#7078
@smkhound  And you still don't want to discuss speeding up notarization? üò¶
 But after all, distracting the user during the swap is not even a half-solution. These are DIFFERENT solutions.
  A person who is interested in completing the swap as soon as possible (this is often myself, but I'm not 100% alone in this) - he will sit on pins and needles and think about the speedy completion of the swap - but not about chats.
  And yes - I'm talking about Central Coin of our ecosystem, not about slow blockchains. 
KMD is fast enough, notarization interferes every 10 minutes.
  _ Having plucked up courage üòâ ... I would venture to suggest reducing the block time to 30 s, notarization every two blocks.
 _ Having changed my mind a little ... I suggest just doing a notarization every two blocks.
     Ouch oh, that's an extra cost!!!
And now you imagine that thanks to this, the blockchain became popular ... and the income from commissions became 1000x  üòâ


[09-Feb-22 03:51 AM] smkhound#7640
I think there is potential merit in higher notarisation frequency, though that would be hardforking so something to keep in mind at the next notary election update.


[09-Feb-22 04:02 AM] Panho#7078
@smkhound  I'm afraid that it was necessary to speed up notarization yesterday üò¶
  Okay. Imagine that you are a Padawan. You stayed to trade on ADEX after the wave of interest subsided.
I'll tell you from experience - slow swaps are depressing. I can't force the counterparty to turn them off. Infuriates. Terribly annoying.


[09-Feb-22 06:47 AM] cipi#4502
how about setting KMD to 4-5 confirmations per default? users who need increased security can enable notarizations... i use 4 confirmations for KMD on all my nodes, no matter the amount
can leave the assetchains (eg TKL) to wait for notas, those are more vulnerable to 51% attacks as KMD itself
increasing notarization speed could be possible, but needs to be well tested... and it will not be every 2 minutes, pretty sure that will not work
but maybe every 5 blocks, instead of every 10


[09-Feb-22 01:51 PM] Panho#7078
@cipi  "... and it will not be every 2 minutes, pretty sure that will not work"
What won't work? You are building a REAL decentralized exchange. But the main coin is almost as slow as bitcoin. I'm not just writing this in the #marketing section. New users will avoid deals with KMD üò¶  - negative marketing before the first release.
What I'm proposing here - is to bring the user experience as close as possible to trading on the CEX: all of our new people will come from there.


[09-Feb-22 02:10 PM] lpdz011#9233
The thing is that behind cex and dex trading is a totally different technology...people have to understand this first...but i agree with you that we need a way to make swaps faster


[09-Feb-22 02:14 PM] lpdz011#9233
When i explain kmd and adex to friends I am often compare our situation with conventional food and organic food. Its not easy to sell people organic food when they only see the price...for them its not logical to buy 2$ milk when right next to it 1$ milk is buyable  ..same with cex and dex trading....people need to be made aware of the differences and why it is better to switch to adex. to make it easier and more understandable, could we really start a comparison with conventional and oorganic food? but the comparison has to be cool... with sweet animations.


An idea could be something like....
On one side you have a lucky cow on green  meadow and on the other side you have an ill cow which is trapped in the stable with no space.


Then we can ask a simple question like..."which milk / meat would you give your doge/shiba?"

since it is a rhetorical question, you could then ask the next question.

Somethink like...

So why you are still  trade on conventional centralized exchanges?

Dont be a fool, try Adex and  do something good for your shibas...


Its just a first idea...i am sure we could find a better slogan


[09-Feb-22 02:19 PM] cipi#4502
LTC has a blocktime of 150s, that's 2.5 minutes, so you can't notarize every 2 minutes anything to LTC chain


[09-Feb-22 02:20 PM] cipi#4502
and it also takes time to come to a consensus between the notary nodes


[09-Feb-22 02:49 PM] Panho#7078
@cipi  OMG  ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  for some reason I thought it was 1 minute. Are there reliable blockchains with lower block times for NN?
@lpdz011  Bro, you are somehow frivolously attributed to serious people with serious money - to those who are eager to see on our platform. This is the TIME factor. Time is money. Loss of time is loss of money. I do not know what else to say ü§î   Have you ever made arbitrage trades?


[09-Feb-22 02:59 PM] cipi#4502
not many with enough hashrate to not be vulnerable to 51% attacks themselves
you can see some relevant values here https://www.crypto51.app
there is basically only BTC, ETH and LTC
i guess we are pretty good with LTC in terms of cost and speed, ETH txfees are much too high
pretty confident that doubling the notarization speed would work and it would make a difference... using 4 confirmations is even faster and possible atm üôÇ


[09-Feb-22 03:01 PM] Panho#7078
Actually, I was discouraged for a while. And I even wrote to binance support when I discovered that they require 120 confirmations for a deposit. Now I understand that they are smart guys and took into account the number of notarizations (then still on BT–°)

[09-Feb-22 03:06 PM] cipi#4502
problem on Binance is that they are using it wrong... they don't look at the notarizations, they simply use the usual "confirmations", that's why it is 120
if they would use it properly, they would only wait for 1 notarization, which is much faster then 120 usual confirmations... some exchanges use it properly though... actually, all they need to do is to set their configuration to wait for 2 confirmations... because 2 normal confirmations on KMD means it was notarized (special stuff)...  idk if they simply don't know üôÇ ... or it is a bureaucratic thingy or whatever


[09-Feb-22 03:08 PM] lpdz011#9233
But binance switch to 30 confs or not?

[09-Feb-22 03:10 PM] cipi#4502
yes, it is 30... so half an hour... a notarization should take 10-20 minutes, sometimes 30, but more like 20... so 30 confirmations ~ the same

{Reactions}
üëç 

[09-Feb-22 03:14 PM] cipi#4502
we should also compare the duration of a atomic swap more to this numbers, because they are covering the same problem, the risk of a 51% attack... if you attack and double spend sending the coins to Binance to sell, they are screwed


[09-Feb-22 03:14 PM] Panho#7078
@cipi  I agree. But it will be a difficult compromise to make up for.
  I want to tell you something terrible. New Users are not willing to wait even 15 minutes 5 minutes too, even 10 seconds these devils don't want to wait. They want to be like in CEX, but they have the keys üòâ  - they already understand this.
  So... maybe in some way LN? however, this is nonsense. impossible

[09-Feb-22 03:16 PM] cipi#4502
yes, i know and i agree, users are not willing to wait 15 minutes and they give up security for comfort
that's why i think the compromise is to set the neede number of confirmations to 4 or 5 for KMD per default and let users choose to opt for a notarization if they want... most of them are trading rather small amounts anyway


[09-Feb-22 03:17 PM] lpdz011#9233
So switch of dpow as default?


[09-Feb-22 03:19 PM] cipi#4502
nono, keep dpow as is, just don't make it required by default for KMD...
but also keep them 100% for all assetchains, those are much more vulnerable to 51% if pure PoW


[09-Feb-22 03:20 PM] lpdz011#9233
Oh okey...i always switch off dpow and  click 1 confirmationüòï

[09-Feb-22 03:26 PM] Panho#7078
@cipi  I wrote about it at the very beginning. You will get a huge pool of orders with noarization disabled by default. With a mass adoption, the bad guys will have a tasty choice and time to prepare an attack.
Or did I not understand something and notarization is not critical for KMD?


[09-Feb-22 03:29 PM] cipi#4502
in my opinion, it's a very theoretical risk üôÇ
someone would have to directly attack you, like doing a trade with you while he attacks KMD chain and reverts txes
can also happen by bad chance, if there is such an attack going on and you do a swap during that time
but chances are very low, 75% of blocks are mined by notary nodes, you need a lot of hash to overcome that
and then there are still the notarizations, so it would only affect people who are not using them during that time... it is financially not viable to even try


[09-Feb-22 03:31 PM] cipi#4502
ok, he could try with the orders that are in the orderbook atm


[09-Feb-22 03:32 PM] lpdz011#9233
Thank you for explanation my friend :-) learned something new üëç good night...bed is calling


[09-Feb-22 04:00 PM] Panho#7078
@cipi  And so... ! 
Here's a marketing idea for you:
  For the first release, turn off the default notarization for KMD and make one confirmation for the swap. Do it for one year.
This will save new users from a negative experience with a long wait (+ you are well aware of the shitty aggravating surprises that bursts of difficulty lead to - my personal "experience of pain" 3 hours)
 And the Team will have time to ((switch to the block time of 15s and NN on Solana)) (crossed out)  ...  to switch to notarization every 2 LTC blocks and perform magic by speeding up swaps on KMD up to 1 minute without losing the security of transactions.
   I'm serious.   At Crypto, we are in the plasma of competition.
 mm2 technology is free software. And there are many fast UXTO blockchains ready for implementation. I even know one of these...

Yes you are right @lpdz011 - such amounts are a bit high. In the previous week we were looking into an option to build an affiliate program where we would pay for outcome (e.g. download AtomicDEX) versus views. Once we get something like that up it's better justified to spend money.
