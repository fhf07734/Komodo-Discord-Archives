> As promised, a little surprise concerning the progress of the week: Redesign of the wallet page to switch to an asynchronous model. Asynchronous rewards claiming and unlimited transaction history with scrolling that fetch as you go.

> how-to process for moving over community to new server

I don't know *why* we want to move the community to a new server, but I don't think its a good idea. we will lose so much info and important chats that happened here. we shouldn't do it unless it is absolutely necessary imo
@Jcharming


[07-Sep-20 10:58 PM] Jcharming#2693
@gcharang There should be a clarification here to help give context to what you're reading, because I am in complete agreement.   
The notes I leave in this channel for each meeting are personal shorthand notes to help provide a line for what was discussed. 

In this note that you are referencing
> how-to process for moving over community to new server

The 'new' server only means the 'new version', 'new format', or 'new structure' of what the Komodo server will take on.  
These notes are not meant to reference any actual migration as the goal is to keep in-tact all channels and information and not interrupt workflow during with the ideas presented here.  

I agree that moving the community to an actual *new server* is not a good idea.  These notes are only meant to be footnotes referencing the restructure process that is going to be built and presented to @Audo  and the Komodo team.  All communication during meetings is targeted at referencing this.   

To elaborate 5) without context of being present at meeting conversation should read more like this. 

5) Begin generating clear plan of the process for implementation of new channel structure and onboarding process, leading to eventual revamp of Komodo server.  
Be sure that information for this move and revamp clearly shows how it will be implemented with minimal workflow/usage interruption, and without causing the removal of any members of the community during completion.


[07-Sep-20 11:00 PM] Jcharming#2693
@gcharang I hope that helps to clear up what must have originally been a confusing scan of the meeting notes.  @Audo o has more information on what is to come I know, and I actually appreciate the feedback above.  I'm sure if anyone else scans these notes they had a similar concern and set of questions in mind.


[07-Sep-20 11:02 PM] gcharang#6833
> The 'new' server only means the 'new version', 'new format', or 'new structure' of what the Komodo server will take on
yup, got it. thought that was the case but had to make sure 😆 

> 5) Begin generating clear plan of the process for implementation of new channel structure and onboarding process, leading to eventual revamp of Komodo server.
thats a great idea
