Bart van Maarseveen interviewed on the topic of "blockchain in 2020"
This video is part of the Komodo Pioneers interview series. This interview was recorded at Blockparty in Amsterdam. Blockparty was a special event merging the Syscoin & Komodo communities for an  evening packed with interesting blockchain talks.

We are opening Komodo Office in Turkey soon . I will be acting as Regional Director for  Komodo Technologies in Turkey and neigbouring countries. I believe the place will be a great center of excellence for providing end-to-end blockchain solutions in real life. Our headquarters will be just 600 meters from Marmara University main campus. We will have also two other offices in two great Technoparks. One is the greatest Technopark in region. It is Istanbul Technopark. And other is Marmara University Technopark. We are planning to promote/provide the best of end-to-end Komodo blockchain solutions in real life with the help of Komodo Community. Other universities are also welcome in future. You have now one of your homes in Turkey. I personally thank @jl777c for his endless support for us, Turkish Community here. I also thank @Paro as the most active member in Turkey. I believe with Marmara Project we will not only have real economical solutions in Turkey  but also in region.

Thanks @grewalsatinder Btw, We want to establish an ecommerce site by using only cryptocurrencies. Especially Komodo family coins and tokens. There is community here willing to accept payments during buy/sell. Marmara,  MCL will be used especially for payments in installments or as credits. So there will be no need to use credit cards. This will be a unique place to pay with only cryptocurrencies.

Anyone interested and experienced in vending machines? We will try them in campus area. Komodo family coins including MCL will be included with MCL used as a replacement to credit card. We can call the machine Komodo Vending Machines. I can discuss the requirements if anyone is interested. We have also a channel in Marmara for vending machines. Another project may be ATM machine to Exchange Komodo family coins with Fiat currencies. I think a channel here would be useful to merge all knowledge and efforts. I am seeking some students in campus who are willing to join in such a project by using Raspberry and Arduino.

``Hi Dr. √áetiner,

Thanks for reaching out and for providing insight on your plans. We'd be delighted to help you bring our crypto ATMs to Turkey, alongside seeing your new use cases for them.

Our software is uniquely open-source and unlicensed, which means you, Marmara, or the Komodo team would be free to customise and build out your own features on any machines you run, as some of our other operators have accomplished. We can also recommend a development house that works closely with our platform.

Glad to provide any insight you need on our software and machines. What would be the next step for you in exploring bringing our ATMs to Turkey? 

Cheers,

Neal Conner

Hi everyone! 

I'm starting a new coin named Spacecoin using komodo assetchain technology and wanted to share it with the Komodo community first.

The idea behind Spacecoin's creation is to unite the citizens of earth behind one currency fit for our future lives in space.

Please check out our Announcement here: https://medium.com/@spaceworks/introducing-spacecoin-space-3b092137220a

and start mining! and then staking.

and the assetchain params are nicely defined, with Veruscoin type eras etc.

@SHossain I'd like to add dPoW very soon. Just need to speak with the right people about doing so. 

@grewalsatinder much help wasn't needed as you all from Komodo Team have done such a great job at documenting everything. Glad you find it well prepared üôÇ 

I realize that it's just another assetchain but the focus from the start is going to be growing a community of people really passionate about space. I've found that in our crazy world, space has always been the one thing that has been able to unite us all where everyone can get along and cooperate. 

I hope that with spacecoin we can help make existing crypto users come together and share a common mission of preparing for space. I also hope to target various groups/people that are inside the space community that at the moment aren't interested in crypto and try to get them focused on spacecoin as well.

@Crabby Paddy thanks for your interest. Spacecoin is equihash, so download any equihash miner that's compatible for zcash or komodo and point it to the pool. There are ASIC's mining on the pool currently so CPU/GPU mining won't be as rewarding.

@actionslacks we hope so. Blockstream actually has a satelite program for bitcoin, with nodes that can broadcast blocks to peers without using the internet. So technically BTC made it to space first. imo BTC isn't designed to function as a currency here on earth, so it surely wouldn't work as a currency in space. But we know satelite blockchain technology is possible for SPACE with the right hardware üôÇ

In Turkey we are not forced to add the restrictions that will need to be added by the Komodo team and would be happy to host a version of atomicDEX desktop in our repo. 

As you know, MCL on Marmara Chain is designed to run in real economy. We have so many projects that we will share with you. I believe this Version will easily make AtomicDex desktop a perfect DeFi system with dApps to run in real economy. We have two official offices now in ƒ∞stanbul, one in Technopark ƒ∞stanbul, the greatest Technopark in Turkey, and the second nearby businesses and several universities. We are ready to help with my team.

When does a project belong to the Komodo ecosystem, I assume when it is created by the KMD community.. because I see a lot of differences between projects and they look more stand alone. Verus looks an entire different project and I was wondering when you belong to the ecosystem and what the requirements are to be called an ecosystem project


[01-Nov-20 05:22 PM] bishop#9773
Probably subject to personal opinion, but I would say anything built from the Komodo code (be it a friendly fork like VRSC or an asset chain) is part of the ecosystem. Whether one wants to include non-KMD codebases that use dpow or projects that share common devs is an optional criteria.

Hello! we almost launched our ent web.! I will share a https link soon (CRYPTOKEN Board)


[25-Nov-20 09:29 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
We are planning on spending capital and developing PROD (side-chain, lite wallet, token, faucet, and trading module) for our proposed token


[25-Nov-20 09:30 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
If there is any apatite for KMD help maybe in the amount of 25% of our own contributions -


[25-Nov-20 09:30 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Our development team crypton.studio would be more than happy to take KMD as well -

The EU - is forbidding all travel - probably to stymie travel of all residents - we'll have to push our KMD production into Q1, until our legal entity is firmed up in Estonia.. In the meantime will release our base app and then build tokens when we are able to. Sorry comm. better to be diligent than sorry


[11-Dec-20 05:16 AM] xxxencryptacion#3788
Luckily enough 'Estonian Consulate' is beyond understanding and will keep our application 'current' - so we'll proceed as planned in the new year ...

Why doesn't Komodo ecosystem have a meme token or is there one? I don't mean WSB and Soulja.

I'm not sure about the usefulness yet, but Komodo Tech can do it better than Shiba Inu or other Meme Coins.


[12-Nov-21 02:29 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
NINJA, RICK, MORTY, and KOMMOD aren't memes?


[12-Nov-21 02:36 PM] Seko#7408
Rick and Morty are Testcoins. I only know the other two when television was black and white.

So there was already the attempt? But not a serious one? There needs to be a benefit for that. But I don't see it in any of the existing meme tokens.

there you go, simple as that üôÇ


[12-Nov-21 02:40 PM] ComputerGenie#7004
How do you have a "serious attempt" at a "meme coin"? the phrases counter each other


[12-Nov-21 02:44 PM] Seko#7408
yes, the more amazing it is that people are greedy for these meme tokens.

It would have to become an ecosystem, a gaming platform, NFT, otherwise I don't understand the need.


[12-Nov-21 02:46 PM] Seko#7408
Or whatever you compare memes to. But you could also just pick up a joke and then market it.

I don't understand this hype, but there is one.

[12-Nov-21 02:53 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Id disagree. It is very very simple to get a lot of support for ETH shit tokens. They have many wallets, browser wallets, immediate sushi/pancake swap pairs, AMM LP mechanisms, etc. Etc. 

These are some reasons why people use other platforms over Komodo


[12-Nov-21 02:54 PM] NutellaLicka#4241
Im personally trying to address some of these issues through Tokel development efforts.

it's fairly easy to deploy a ETH / BNB token an once you pay the miners fee it's done. There are about 400000 tokens created on eth how many really made it 50? Komodo on that perspective had more success at least 2 of the 100 projects started made it.
KMD asset chains need infrastructure and have running costs. 
Getting a new chain on adex is in my opinion still a little to complicated. Imagine you see a button on the explorer / newcoin website add to atomicdex and it automatically adds it to the adex (just like uniswap)
I imagine this is possible with the webversion but that is not for another couple months / maybe year.

building a meme coin is not the problem. Getting people to notice it is pretty much.


[13-Nov-21 01:42 AM] CHMEX#0686
there is a fastdoge chain (https://fastdoge.explorer.dexstats.info/) 3sec blocktime
now that it's there how to let people know about it?


[13-Nov-21 02:03 AM] Seko#7408
Make website, comparison to Doge in terms of advantages over Doge and others, and then proper marketing.

But there should be an idea behind it to realize something that offers added value. A decentralized meme platform to host memes decentralized via IPFS, for example.

Whereas we could certainly integrate that into Tokel.

When the WPS and Soulja chain were launched, it could have been successful if WPS or Soulja had joined in. But if we had started Fastdoge or something similar at that time, it could have been successful.


[13-Nov-21 02:11 AM] Seko#7408
Btw, surely you know Liberland. I was in contact with them a few weeks ago. They mentioned that they want to make their own cryptocurrency.
Wouldn't that be something for Komodo Platform?

Somebody could certainly create a decentralized meme platform using the Tokel blockchain

Likewise, is there a certain blockspeed that is the most ideal for use with atomicdex. Ie: maybe there are a couple of speed coins for doing many fast trades with each other

What are the requirements for a stable coin?

A private stable coin could be useful as a feeder for ARRR. 

Merchants who accept ARRR often have concerns about volatility. My recommendation would be to put the stake in Stable and keep the rest in ARRR. For such a case, a private stable coin could make sense.

But now I don't know if this is technically possible at all!


[01-Dec-21 06:56 AM] Mylo#8306
swap arrr to stable, stables need to be transparent for auditability afaik


[01-Dec-21 09:26 AM] Seko#7408
How does Haven do it? Isn't there a stable in their ecosystem?


[03-Dec-21 08:46 AM] CyberTrucker#5260
Haven is pretty simplistic. You have your Haven coin (XHV), and then a stable (xUSD). Using a price oracle, you can mint the USD value of your volatile Haven (XHV) coin in xUSD, burning your XHV. Your xUSD can be redeemable for XHV at any time by minting new XHV and burning the xUSD. It has an adaptive supply, so for that model ARRR would have to be able to be minted and burned adding and removing supply.
